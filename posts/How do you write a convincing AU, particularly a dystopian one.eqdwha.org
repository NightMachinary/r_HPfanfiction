I'm working on an AU dystopian oneshot and it's hard. Like, /hard/. So, I'd appreciate any tips I could get.

For those who are unaware, AU is Alternate Universe and dystopian means 'relating to or denoting an imagined state or society where there is great suffering or injustice.'


** You need to be very careful with dystopias. It is very easy too take it way too far and suddenly you end up with a big evil dark power wankfest in which everyone is evil. Try to make sure that you have a balance of power, obviously tipped towards the darker end but you can't have too few good guys else it becomes unrealistic. I would recommend reading up a bit on how the NAZIs controlled Germany because that gives you a good view on how a dystopian state might be ruled and will allow you to make it more realistic.

*** Well, not necessarily the balance of power. Try “[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1143960][Holly at Hogwarts -- Return to Neverland by Forest_of_Holly]]” (Part 3 of “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]”), which has lovely “1984 with Dementors” part, which I like (well, “liked” is not the proper word for dystopia) very much, and we certainly cannot talk much about balance of power. What you need is some kind of hope, that the good guys could at least theoretically ultimately win. Otherwise it is just a pure depression and boring.

**** I mean, the Minister literally had Barty Jr kissed minutes after finding out he was still alive without any form of investigation or anything. Even the countries that actually still have the Death Penalty wouldn't just summarily execute escaped criminals without at least looking into what happened. I believe even the US accepts that second trials are usually required in that instance. Or Fudge putting Hagrid in Azkaban (a human rights violation of a place itself, unarguably) without apparent trial or anything.

There's only so much you can be charitable about in a story where magic Nazis kick a useless and reoccurringly criminal government out of power and set up work camps for their political enemies.

I do agree with you on Sirius, though. People just fucked up on that one. There's no way a society that implicitly favours one racial demographic would lock up the eldest son of one of their most-liked family, no matter how rebellious he was.

***** Also, let's never forget that in canon, the government and press ran a smear campaign against a teenager because of their refusal to investigate the possibility of a terrorist cell still being active and because several of those terrorists had infiltrated the Ministry.

There's definitely a strong dystopian element in the canon series, even before Voldemort takes over in DH.

In FB, she reinforced her dystopian depiction of magical world by making MACUSA more malicious and more tyrannical. In CoG, it's hard NOT to root for Grindelwald after seeing what those Ministry goons are doing.

******* I understand that the issue of slavery is rather painful in some countries, who had nasty run with it in not so distant past (almost every nation in the world practised slavery at some moment, fortunately for us, it was so far away in past, there is no real link to it now). Therefore, I understand, that even by asking this hypothetical, it may be too much for somebody. Please, don't be angry.

We really don't know much about the nature of house-elves. They are obviously not fully human. What if, just hypothetically, they really have different expectations of happiness. I know it was said about the African-American slaves they are not fully human, which was awful (and obviously not true), but what if ... what if it was true about house-elves. What if they were in their understanding of happiness closer to for example, dogs? What do you call removing a dog from the household of its owner? Liberation? I think it is actually closer to rejection and torture. What if house-elves were truly more like that?

******** Of the three named house-elves we see, two suffer because they are slaves. One of them is forced to torture himself. They suffer because tehy are forced to work for and obey someone they hate. Forced to do things they abhor.

And the most prominent elf in the series wants to be free and is happy being free - proving that elves don't need to be slaves. The books state that they are magically bound - it's not some inherent need to be a slave.

Elves aren't dogs. Elves are enslaved people.

All that is clearly stated and shown in the book.

** It is hard to write a dystopia because there has to be a balance between the evils/flaws of the society and how well it is presented. Typically in novels, a dystopian society is presented as a eutopia and slowly the cracks begin to show. The dystopia also has to be believable for maximum impact.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/]]

The AU in this one shot really weaves in the dystopian theme. I think what made it work was that there was a tense suspenseful feeling even though this was following along a chapter we've all read. And then when Ron speaks and and the Sorting is set up you can slowly put together what changed and how wrong it is compared to the original chapter. Things are taken to the extreme, but within believable limits. The ending is very unsettling and makes you wonder what they will do.

**** Hmm, okay.

Well, for the first, I think it depends on if your dystopia evolved or was imposed. Like, if Fudge gradually became more autocratic over time and ended up a dictatorial face for a Pureblood Authority, that creates a different setting than if Grindelwald returned and took over Britain after a war even if he imposed the same rules and authority practices. The Man in the High Castle is an excellent point of inspiration for the latter, while the former is more V for Vendetta. An evolved dystopia is usually far more subtle, far more tricksy, since it's usually through cunning and trickery that they got into power. Imposed dystopia relies on brainwashing the next generations and imposing/intimidating violence. Each pattern would be best served by different types of explanation.

Generally though, a good way to explain a dystopia is simply to demonstrate the effects. Living under a dystopia, especially one where you're aware it's a dystopia, is tense. Really, really tense. Like "I just lay down in bed and closed my eyes and something suddenly breathed" kind of tense. You're always waiting for the other shoe to drop, waiting for them to find that one thing you did wrong and get you for it. That tenseness is really at its best when shown rather than told. In The Man in the High Castle, characters often walk past armed soldiers while nervously keeping their eyes on the ground and hurrying past as quickly as they can. In V for Vendetta, there are signs on the streets marking a curfew enforced by guards. It's actually better that you don't go into too much detail, because the mystery is part of what makes a dystopia scary. "They go into the gulags, and they never come out." kind of vibes, you know? Have a lot of Propaganda and Branding stuff, too. A dystopian authority works best when a part of it is visible and talking. 'cause if that part is visible and talking, you don't see the hands moving behind the scenes.

Regarding characters, I'd give them a small rebellion. For instance, Imperial Japan is very traditional and would be against a lot of themes expressed in modern art. The Man in the High Castle has one of the main characters married to a modern artist and praises his art, which he quickly hides when representatives of authority comes past. Lets them show parts of how they'd be without the dystopia, but also lets the jaded, cynical, tense fear dominate when they keep that small rebellion hidden. Like Hermione, for instance. In a dystopian Magical Britain, she'd still be obsessed with books, but she wouldn't be quite so visible about it. She'd bury it and only let it out when she felt safe.

I could probably talk for ages more on this - I'm a psychologist, a D&D worldbuilder, and a culture nerd, so this fascinates the hell out of me on so many levels - but I need to sleep soon and I figure this is enough for you to read for this one. Feel free to ask more on anything I've said or missed and I'll do my best to help out. :)
