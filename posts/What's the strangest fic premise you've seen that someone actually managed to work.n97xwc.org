And I don't mean a crackfic.I mean an honest to goodness, for-serious-reading,competently written fic that makes use of a premise that should normally be a joke/unworkable.Doesn't matter if it's finished or not.

** I read one once where a new bill was voted that would pass a Veela sanctuary into the property of the Malfoys I believe so the Veela infiltrated the Ministry turned all the employees into lust slaves and essentially ruled magical Britain as a pornocracy for several months before Harry managed to chase them out. It sounds like a smutty BDSM fic but it wasn't and actually the author drew a lot from folklore to construct a beautiful outline of the Veela society. The only thing they got wrong was the fact that Veela originate from Balkanic folklore so they wouldn't exist in Britain.

** Genderbent Harry has a Midlife Crisis after ridding the world of Death Eaters and moves to New York where she ends up working as a cleaning lady in the Avengers tower. Featuring an incredibly well thought out merge of both worlds, a focus on friendships and healing while also having a great main plot, cosmic entities, and Holly Potter being a total badass.

*** They made it work at the start, but then things just fell apart, or probably were never held together with anything substantial to begin with. The premise is good, but Holly becomes Mary Sue real fast. She's everywhere and everything, she fixes all the Avengers' problems, everyone likes if not outright loves her, she's a solution to all their issues, "a glue that holds the team together", and by the middle of the fic she becomes the /Life/, by that point I sort of gave up on the whole thing so I don't know if it got better.

That's not to say I didn't like it. It's a well written fic, it's just power creep is real, and the story became sort of a joke when in chapter 16 she single-handedly wiped out Thanos' lieutenant and his team that were sent for the Time Stone, while Avengers just keeled over and didn't even put a scratch on those guys.

tl;dr --- it was good and fun when she was a cleaning lady, it became less good when she stopped being a cleaning lady, and it was downhill with some plateaus from there.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up. This Fic is now complete!

** Linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) The premise is that Harry is a dragon and somehow manages to be a really well told feel good story. It also features a completely normal and well adjusted Harry. Although muggles can't tell that he is a dragon, he's basically impossible to abuse. Dudley can hit him but not hurt him, and Harry never recognizes it as bullying. He can eat anything so he never thinks that the Dursley's are starving him, and he believes the the cupboard under the stair is a perfectly appropriate place for a young dragon.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
