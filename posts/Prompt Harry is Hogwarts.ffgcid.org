Harry goes back in time accidentally and ends up merging with Hogwarts' magic, and making the castle sentient. Harry is the one who moves the stairs and makes the room of requirements work


** I would read the heck out of that! Harry sniggering as he changes the stairs just to screw with people. Turning doors into walls at people who are bullying others. Him laughing as others try to figure out the “rules” to the changes of the castle. But also, Harry changing in a good way for the home sick, or the bullied. Harry guiding them away from their bullies if he can. Harry steering them in the direction of some good conversationalists in the portraits to get their mind off missing home.

*** Probably by having his soul/mind merged with the castle, although at that point any fic with a sapient Hogwarts would probably be pretty close to something similar.

**** Tbh, this theory reminds me of a fanfiction I read a while ago where harry travelled through the Ceil and ended up on and alien planet and merged with an alien pretending to be a deity and became the ruler of a space empire. It was called Harry Potter and a Chance at New Life.
