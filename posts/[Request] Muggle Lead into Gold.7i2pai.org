Does anyone know of a fic in which the wizarding world learns about muggles turning lead into gold through [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation#Modern_physics][nuclear transmutation]]?


** The problem with this process is that it costs more to produce the gold than the gold that is produced is worth.

*** It does cost more than the gold, but it's still doing one of the things the philosopher's stone does.

And when bragging to wizards I imagine that the 'not worth it' bit can be conveniently left out.

**** My headcanon is that there is magic gold and mundane gold. Magic Gold is like [[http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Latinum][Latinum]] in Star Trek. It's valuable because it cannot (normally) be reproduced. Regular gold can be transfigured at will.

***** I always thought that when wizards used gold as currency they would put some sort of special enchantment on it, using some sort of ministry-held item.

******* Usual headcanon is that there are certain impurities to make the metal stronger as well as lock its value.

******** I've appropriated mine from some fic I read, don't recall what. It's that coinage in the Wizarding world isn't actually made of gold/silver/bronze, but rather they're stone discs enchanted to appear as metal. The enchanting itself is done by the goblins, so they're able to control the amount of currency introduced to the market, your average wizard cannot just transfigure the actual currency, and the goblins have some counterfeiting protection.

***** The philosopher's stone is merely a stone capable of turning lead into gold - requiring additional energy does not invalidate it as a philosopher's stone.

******* No. In real life they never could. In most stories they cannot either. A story with the abilities of alchemists and the stone as you describe it is not describing the 'classical' stone, but something else.

** The closest I can think of is Hermione's invention of molecular manipulation as an entire branch of magic in The Arithmancer and Lady Archimedes.

linkffn(10070079; 11463030)

Among other things, Hermione writes an academic proof that magical transmutation of radioactive elements is impossible, rearranges air molecules into nitrous oxide to escape captivity, and turns raw carbon into flawless diamonds to fund her war effort.

It's not really wizards learning about muggle alchemy (though Hermione does publish several academic papers), but it applies muggle discoveries to the wizarding world to create one of the most powerful versions of Hermione I've read.
