Considering JKR has mentioned that this idea nearly made it into the books, I'm surprised that I can hardly find any fics for it.

** I believe in little0birds vast AU/Cannon continuation Dudley's adopted daughter (and maybe his son too?) are magical, however from what I remember the fic that that's explored in has only just reached the point where she has her first observed bout of accidental magic
