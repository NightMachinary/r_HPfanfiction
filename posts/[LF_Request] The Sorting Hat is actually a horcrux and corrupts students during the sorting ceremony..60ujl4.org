** Helena Ravenclaw isn't actually the daughter of Rowena. Rowena never /had/ a daughter. The Grey Lady is actually just the wraith of Rowena, silently admiring her handiwork with her horcrux, the Sorting Hat.

No, but seriously, I don't think anything like this exists.

*** Thats a great idea actually, hehe. Rowena made a horcrux to imbue the hat with sentience and needed intelligence to sort to students who come to Hogwarts.

**** He was the one who killed her, believing her to be the made-up Helena, but when his saber pierced her heart, Rowena showed her true face and cursed him to forever witness the futility of his endeavor. He cannot speak of the evil in the hat, nor can he tell people who the Grey Lady really is. All he can do is watch as her plan unfolds.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** Thr Sorting Hat is such a powerful magical artifact that trying to make it a horcrux would probably either fail or destroy it. And the taint of the dark magic (or all the extra magic required to hide it) would probably be easily recognized by those familiar with the hat.

Horcuxes are best kept in less prominent objects to reduce the risk of detection.

*** What if its a horcrux of a Founder? I mean, they /made/ this thing, they didn't have to corrupt it after the fact. We also know that different horcrux have different traits and effects. The most prominent being the corrupting influence of the locket, which would be the trait OP asked for.

Also... The diadem of Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff's cup and Slytherin's locket were horcrux. We know that at least the first one was a powerful artifact. The Ring was also a horcrux, but you could argue that the material of the ring and not the Resurrection Stone on top of it was the horcrux. In any case, I don't think "powerful artifacts can't be horcrux" holds up.

If the hat was subtle in its influence, why would anyone notice? We know these objects are capable of subtlety in their corruption from CoS. Also, it has always been there, its magic has never changed its feel. There's a good chance people just accepted that it was made in darker times and by darker magic, hence nobody really giving a damn about it and just declaring it traditional.

**** I've seen a fic or two where the sorting hat is actually Godric's horcrux, but I can't remember which ones.
