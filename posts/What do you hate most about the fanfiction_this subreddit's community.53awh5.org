*** It can be a little frustrating sometimes. People use fanfiction for all sorts of reasons and their requirements don't have to be the same as someone else's. Sometimes I want canon compliant, in character stories. Other times I want a romance novel stand in where the names of the characters are practically the only things pulled from canon. Is that so terrible? Slash is especially downvoted here, which is a shame

** Hate is a bit of a strong word, but I dislike the fact that from 750.000+ stories available, this sub recommends about four dozens on a regular basis.

I acknowledge that from the 750.000 there are at least 700.000 out there that are completely unreadable, one-chapter uploads or otherwise disappointments. And hell, take another 40.000 stories away for being blatant copies of other plotlines, uncreative and/or canon rehashes. We'd still be on 10.000 stories. Take another 50% off for abandoned stories. 5000. From 5000 stories I get ~100 recommended on a regular basis, to the point where when I type out a request, I already know at least the first ten that will get recommended.

What I dislike most about the fanfiction community is very well represented in the Fanfiction.net ranking of Most Favorited Fics.

*** I couldn't agree more. And most (not all) of those are nothing special as far as writing quality goes. But then when you look at who is recommending them , they seem to be mostly the same people, so it makes sense. Realistically I don't see any way of pushing people out of their comfort bubbles, but it's a shame for the writers who never get a look-in. It's a bit of a special and rather exclusive club: membership by invitation only it seems.

That being said; I can't stand most slash fanfiction. I find a lot of it to be poorly done or just horrible. It's not about gay or straight, it's about personal preference. Now, as [[/u/Starfox5]] mentioned the biggest way us readers and writers of fanfic declare our preferences is with story tags. Pairing,characters,time period,dark/light,slash/non-slash. They're all just tags we use to find things we personally enjoy reading. People have the right to use tags to say what they want to see or not see, regardless of whether or not you like it yourself.

I also think jbern and HPMOR get a little too much hatred. jbern writes well, and the only weak point is the bashing imo(bashing outside crack and comedy is not my thing). Writing the inside of someone's head is not easy.

HPMOR characters can be smug, but you can easily spot the flawed reasoning behind most of their actions, and you are actively encouraged to nitpick. They may be smug, but they are also wrong a lot.

I prefer this smugness to other more common types found in fanfiction such as smugness over shipping wars, independent Harry, superwoman Hermione, etc where the author presents it as the best and only possibility. I'm not saying it is the best fic ever, but it had a good plot, humour, and did something different. Not top ten, but top 10% definitely.
