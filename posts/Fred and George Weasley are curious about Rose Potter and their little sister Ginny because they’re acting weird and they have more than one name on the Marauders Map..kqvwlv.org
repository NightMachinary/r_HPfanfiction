Ginny Weasley/Amane Misa and Rose Potter/Rem.

Fred and George stared at the names of their little sister and their little brothers best friends name. Why did they have Two names. No one else had Two names. It had been there for a while but this is the first time they've really sat down and thought about it. They wondered why Rose's other name had no last name. They were pretty sure Misa and Rem were Japanese names.

Now that they thought about it they were acting rather odd too. They both had massive changes in their personality. Ginny would occasionally slip into Third person (sometimes she would refer to herself as Misa) and seemed interested in a muggle fashion style which the twins had figured out was Gothic Lolita. There are also times where she seems a bit depressed.

Rose on the other hand seemed extremely protective of Ginny and on one occasion Fred and George heard her say something along the lines how she would do anything to protect her. She was more detached, quiet and seemed almost like she could barely comprehend basic Human activities. Like eating and sleeping. Sometimes she seemed a bit inhuman although neither would never admit it.

They also had red eyes and that scared the twins knowing you-know-who also had red eyes but Rose and Ginny didn't seem evil so they let it go. For some reason everything seemed to be Red to them

If Fred and George didn't know any better they would say the 2 girls were uncomfortable in their own bodies.

This is not counting the fact Ginny and Rose sometimes slipped into a language they were pretty sure was Japanese. Although Rose sometimes slipped into a language that the translation charm couldn't translate.

They also had matching notebooks. All Ginny said was Rose had an extra and decided to give it to her. They never saw the notebooks after the initial time they saw it.

So yes, Fred and George were curious about Rose Potter and Ginny Weasley or rather Rem and Amane Misa.

So I wrote this because there are only a handful of HP/DN crossovers and none are reincarnation.
