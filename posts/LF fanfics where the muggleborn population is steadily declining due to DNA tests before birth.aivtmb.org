With the advances in science and technology, more and more parents are testing fetuses to see if there's any genetic abnormalities. Magic is seen as an abnormality that can't be quantified as good or bad, so a good amount of doctors and parents err on the side of caution and abort. This in turn decreases the muggleborn population, and the wizarding world can't figure out why.


** Well, you also have to account for the part of magical of Britain that won't care about a decrease in muggleborns like the Malfoys. They'll pretend to care but behind closed doors, they don't. I don't really think a fanfic on this premise has been made before.

***** Canon is silent on that fact. The only evidence on that front is the fact that there are magical plants, other magical species, magical animals etc. This indicates that magic is not some weird offshoot of humanity but rather an integral part of the universe. It may be that asking where magic comes from makes about as much sense as asking where non-magic comes from. It boils down to the question humanity has been asking forever, and will likely never answer: why is there something rather than nothing?

Which means that if a muggleborn was born to a muggle family, the mother was likely raped by a wizard/had sex with a wizard.

***** I don't see how "Magic is a dominant and resilient gene" goes against anything I said. JKR is not saying that magical parents can't have squib children, she's saying that they are unusual. Clearly, given that magical people can have squibs, squibs can also have non-magical children. The gene is dominant, but not /that/ dominant. The full quote which you cited partially was:

#+begin_quote
  I have been asked all sorts of questions about Squibs since I first introduced the concept in ‚ÄòChamber of Secrets'. A Squib is almost the opposite of a Muggle-born wizard: he or she is a non-magical person born to at least one magical parent. Squibs are rare; magic is a dominant and resilient gene.

  Squibs would not be able to attend Hogwarts as students. They are often doomed to a rather sad kind of half-life (yes, you should be feeling sorry for Filch), as their parentage often means that they will be exposed to, if not immersed in, the wizarding community, but can never truly join it. Sometimes they find a way to fit in; Filch has carved himself a niche at Hogwarts and Arabella Figg operates as Dumbledore's liaison between the magical and Muggle worlds. Neither of these characters can perform magic (Filch's Kwikspell course never worked), but they still function within the wizarding world because they have access to certain magical objects and creatures that can help them (Arabella Figg does a roaring trade in cross-bred cats and Kneazles, and if you don‚Äòt know what a Kneazle is yet, shame on you). Incidentally, Arabella Figg never saw the Dementors that attacked Harry and Dudley, but she had enough magical knowledge to identify correctly the sensations they created in the alleyway.
#+end_quote

All of which accords entirely with JKR's interview above and my comment. To be honest I'm not sure if you're trolling or not with the rape thing. Obviously you're facetiously applying the Mendelian definition of "dominant" to the ordinary language used in the phrase "dominant and resilient" (conveniently ignoring the word "resilient", which clearly indicates that JKR is not speaking in scientific terminology); what I'm unclear on is if you're aware that it's facetious.

***** I assume you mean a muggle family with no squib ancestry.

Of course, magic doesn't behave like a single gene, especially a dominant one. If it did, all witches and wizard would have at least one magical parent, and there would be no muggle-borns. If it were a recessive gene, all magicals would have two copies, and there would be no squibs born to two magical parents, purebloods or otherwise. There would have to be a much more complex gene activation system for it to /mostly/ breed true, but also be able to skip generations.

***** All this tells me is that Rowling doesn't understand what a dominant gene is. If it's dominant, there are no true muggleborns. All ‚Äúmuggleborns‚Äù are actually halfbloods. I don't think that's what she really meant.

Also if it's dominant, squibs would be common. Two heterozygous magical parents would have 1/4 of their children be squibs.

There is no simple 1-gene pattern of inheritance that would explain both muggleborns and squibs. I think it's wrong to attempt to fit magical inheritance into Mendelian genetics, just like it would be wrong to try to fit magic into Newtonian physics.
