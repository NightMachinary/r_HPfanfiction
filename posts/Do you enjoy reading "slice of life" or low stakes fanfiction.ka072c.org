Sometimes I see comments suggesting slower paced fics about topics like the daily lives of students. I was thinking of writing an AU about shopkeepers in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. But it really doesn't have much of a story to it. It's just characters going about their lives.

Are fics like that enjoyable if they don't really go anywhere in terms of plot? They seem like they'd be comfy/relaxing to read about, but how do you keep them from being too low on excitement?

For now maybe the writing could be like TV episodes, where each chapter has its own minor problem that gets resolved, but the story isn't necessarily building to anything.

Do you read these kinds of fics? Any suggestions?

Edit: Thank you for all the recs, you're all stellar people.


** My fic is a giant slice of life, in case you're curious what that would look like. It still has an overall narrative arc and numerous smaller arcs, but overall it's fairly chill.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** You could structure it like a TV show. Each chapter has its own little conflict to resolve, a rude customer or a late supplier, and there's an overarching plot to be doled out one tidbit per episode and wrapped up in the season finale.

** I couldn't dig up the exact quote, but I remember reading a great bit of advice from Patrick Rothfuss a while back that boiled down to "make your stakes high for the characters, even if they're objectively low." He was talking about how one of the central challenges that his protagonist faces in The Name of the Wind is that he needs to scrounge up enough money to pay his tuition and rent every semester. This is a character that's performing magic, having adventures, etc, but still has serious anxiety and struggles over his day to day living. I remember the parts of the story where he's scraping up cash or cutting corners to try and meet a deadline moreso than the traditional high fantasy challenges, because Kvothe doesn't really freak out about murders or monsters but he loses his mind at the idea of not being able to play his lute or stay in school.

So your shopkeepers or shoppers don't need to be involved in the larger Harry Potter plot at all, but do give them challenges and make the stakes for those challenges real to them, even if they seem small in the grand scheme of things. Risk of a shop closing down, competing with a rival store, navigating the politics of a small-town business community, etc

** I do enjoy slice of life fics, yes. Kid raising fics are one of my favorite tropes, and those tend to be very much slice of life. But this doesn't mean there's /no/ stakes -- conflicts help a story along, even if the stakes overall are low. For example, the main kid character getting harassed, and the reluctance in opening up to the family about it, the kid planning a prank of sort that gets out of hand, or similar. A fic without any conflicts whatsoever gets boring after a while.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** hm, it really depends. I dont often read slice of life bc im a lover of the dark and gorey and traumatizing. But when I do it has to be written well and have an overarching plot.

If you wrote about the lives of shopkeepers, try to focus heavily of character building and the like. There would be most likely be plenty of OCs and you would probably add some shops, so going into characters and their motivations would be great for some plot or introspection, or maybe a few chapters here and there being character studies.

Hers some plot ideas!!!

Is there a feud between Madame Malkin, the owner of Twilfitt and Tattings, and Gladrags Wizardwear? Does WWW get along with Zonkos and gambol & Japes? Is there some sort of main lounge for the shop owners were they gossip and meet up? Are there other districts besides Hogsmeade, Diagon and Knockturn? How many lawsuits does Borgin and Burkes get? What does Ollivander do outside of the school rush? Do the shop keeps exchange favors (Fix my Owl's wing and you'll get a discount for the rest of the year)? Are there any sordid relationships or affairs? What about hidden mental/physical illness? Does Fortescue bring ice cream for the yearly cookout? What about late deliveries? How do they deal with a flakey worker? How does the new manager of Slug & Jiggers deal with firing someone for the first time? Do Madame Malkin's and Twilfitt and Tattings team up against a modern style punk/goth shop that pops up in Diagon and do they make up with that shop keep? How does Gringotts interact with the shop keeps? How do they deal with a creature escaping The Magical Menagerie? How many other shops are in Knockturn and what do they sell? Does Slug & Jiggers get grumpy when he has to refer someone to Dogweed & Deathcap? What happens when Fortescue has to renew his agreement with Honeydukes, esp when there's a new candy? Did all the shop keeps team up to help Flourish and Blotts during the fiasco with the Monster Book Of Monsters and was The Healer on call all day?

The best part of Slice of Life for me, is people finding out things and reacting. I dont like miscommunication, but secrets or small inconveniences are always fun!

** Sort of. It depends, usually I have two requirements for a fanfic; Mystery and History, with a dash of Romance. That is, there should be some over arching mystery in the story, and there should be some, usually historical, artefact that helps resolve the mystery. I typically find slice of life or fluffy stories refreshing as a calm before the storm in long fics. For slice of life fics to stand on their own for me, there has to be something unique about the experience, so for your example, what would make that daily life of a magical shopkeeper unique and different to other people in the magical world?
