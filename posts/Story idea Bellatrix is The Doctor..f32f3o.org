I heard a while back about suggestions of HBC as Doctor Who. So, I came up with the idea for a fic , where Bellatrix is The Doctor, because The master used the same time-lord watch thing as in Family of Blood, but in this case to imprison her. What do you guys think of this?


** I've long thought that Xeno Lovegood could fit as being the Sixth Doctor via Chameleon Arch, possibly with a bit of a glitch causing fragments of memory to slip through.
