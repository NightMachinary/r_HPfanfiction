Give me grisly and satisfying tales to wake up to after this Election Night, Reddit.


** *A True Daughter of the Black*, linkffn(8288341): Things got even uglier after Voldemort, and an OOC Bill Weasley became the new top villain.

*Broken Chains*, linkffn(7718942): Sith Harry cleaned things up in magical world, often in gruesome fashions. I like how Hermione's descent was written

*Dark Marauder*, linkffn(4586362): Best one-shot about this topic.

*Doubting Thomas*, linkffn(5492188): Although nobody had been killed yet, the ending left you with enough possibilities.

*Guerilla Potter*, linkffn(3930537): As the title said.

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771): The flashbacks were kind brutal.

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): This is the poster fic about wiping out the old genocidal and tyrannical establishment. Anyone pushing the marriage law, an ultimate form of tyranny, must die IMO.

*Reunion*, linkffn(4655545): is a very dark story written in a humorous way.

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620): The Trio killed them all.

*Spectrum*, linkffn(9561455): Only fic in which Hermione traveled back to Tom's era and KILLED him, but then she went on a multi-decade killing spree. Very graphical.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): Only the killing of the Lestranges was rough, but its epilogue hinted at worse things to come. If the author ever decides to write a sequel, it will be significantly darker.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I'm /really/ happy that this sub is generally free of political discussions (the recent survey threads being a rare episode of tension and unwarranted self-importance). That being said, here's a repost from a similar thread. A Tale of One Kitty devolves into silly, pointless smut after the scene below, but it's one of only a handful of stories I know that fulfills your request.

linkffn(7512124), Lessons With Hagrid

#+begin_quote
  After a few more seconds, in which the golden house elf got his Dark Lieutenant in a headlock, [Voldemort] had pulled himself together and made it to his feet, wand in wraithlike hand, and he might /still/ have escaped had not Harry Potter chosen that moment to hit him with a brick.
#+end_quote

linkffn(4525496), A Tale of One Kitty

#+begin_quote
  Bracing himself, Harry swung said shovel as hard as he could at the back of the villain's skull. With the blow, Harry had effectively knocked Voldemort's eyes out of their sockets, shattered his skull and turned his brain into runny porridge that dribbled out of his nose, ears and the gaping wholes where his eyes had, until very recently, rested.
