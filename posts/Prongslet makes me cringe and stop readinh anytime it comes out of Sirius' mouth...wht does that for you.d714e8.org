*** So much agreement for your last point. I vastly prefer names/pronouns. The hair color thing is okay used sparingly or situationally, but it frequently goes way over the top.

"Let's play chess," suggested the red-haired boy.

"But you always win," replied his black-haired friend.

"We've already done everything else," argued the flame-haired boy.

"I guess that's true," admitted the ebony-haired boy, reaching for the chess set.

"I'll let you go first," said the redhead generously.

"Thanks," said the messy-haired boy. "I wish my chess pieces would listen to me."

"They just haven't learned to trust you yet," said the taller boy sagely.

"They won't ever learn to trust me if I keep losing to you," retorted the shorter boy.

"That is true," said the freckled boy with a grin.

"Can you beat all of your brothers at chess?" asked the boy with the scar on his forehead.

"Once in a while Bill can beat me," said the boy with lots of brothers.

"He's the oldest one, right?" asked the boy who didn't have any brothers.

"Yeah. He's in Egypt, breaking curses for Gringotts," replied the blue-eyed boy.

"That's the coolest job I've ever heard of," marveled the bespeckled boy.

"Mum says maybe we can all go visit him together in a few years if we can save up the money," said the raggedly-dressed boy.

"That will be fun," said the emerald-eyed boy rather wistfully. "I've never been anywhere."

"Nor have I," agreed the cerulean-eyed boy.

"Perhaps you'll travel the world winning chess tournaments," suggested the green-eyed boy.

"I never thought of that!" exclaimed the lanky boy.

"You could start by entering the school tournament," suggested the skinny boy. "Why haven't you?"

"Oh, the bushy-haired, buck-toothed, bossy, smart, brown-eyed girl told me to so I said no just to annoy her. But now that I can say it's your idea, I think I will."

The two pale-skinned boys laughed together.

I prefer when authors vary the way they reference characters, I think it helps to keep the reading experience from feeling stale. Calling Harry "green eyed boy" or "raven haired wizard" every now and then is more palatable to me than just "Harry this, Harry that, Harryharryharry".

**** I don't consider it stale to read someone's name over and over again, similar to reading the dialogue tag "said". After a while I stop noticing and my attention goes to the plot itself.

On the other hand, I do notice when authors try to mix it up with "emerald orbs" or "caramel spheres", and "ejaculated Ron loudly" for dialogue tags, and that is worse than being plain or stale, because I find extremely distracting.

****** I pay attention to prose as well. However, to me, this extends to the author's capacity to set a scene, create an immersive atmosphere, make magic feel magical, and make me feel emotions the characters are feeling. I'd compare it to the feelings and immersion I got when JKR first introduced Diagon Alley, where Harry follows Hagrid into a magical street where there's so much going on behind every shop window. That's what I consider great prose.

In the creative writing community, use of "orbs" and hair colors, and complicated ways to avoid the word "said", are considered marks of amateurism. In dialogue, the character's mood and tone should be conveyed by the /words themselves/, rather than the dialogue tags from the narrative, because Show versus Tell is one of the biggest guidelines of effective writing. Good dialogue writing should not need complicated dialogue tags to get the message across. The way JKR wrote the books, Snape and Hagrid could be in a room together, and without a single dialogue tag ("said the greasy-haired potionmaster"), you could identify each person speaking, just by their speech patterns.

Example:

#+begin_quote
  "Why can't I do what I want? I'm sixteen, I'm grown enough to know what's good for me and what's not. You need to stop telling me what to do and how to act - Mum, I'm not a baby anymore!"
#+end_quote

It's one of the first things pro editors look for when you submit manuscripts. In the past (and even now, to an extent), fanfiction was a stigma in the traditional publishing world, and these kinds of tells were a common way to figure out if the author cut their teeth in fanfiction, versus being trained through upper-level/tertiary education creative writing courses.

Another tell is constantly referring to eyes, character looking at each other, glancing and making eye contact between every single line of dialogue. Eg, "Emerald green met vivid scarlet", every time Harry interacts with Voldemort.

***** I've always preferred Harry and Dumbledore to simply call him "Tom," to show that they are both unafraid and unimpressed by Voldemort's grandstanding. Voldemort is the larger than life character, and Tom Riddle is the actor behind the mask- and the entire wizarding war is just a show for Tom to lord his superiority over everyone else. Calling him by his birth name strips away the curtain and reveals the small man behind the Wizard of Oz.

Calling him Moldyshorts on the other hand just feels juvenile and dumb, and still plays into the larger than life mythos- it doesn't have the same quietly defiant power calling him Tom does. To call him Voldyshorts mocks the power of the man, but to call him Tom strips it away all together.

But Hermione? Or McGonagall? Eh, nope. I can buy certain variations of Harry doing it but definitely not when he's, say, addressing the Wizengamot. Anything like this, and I hit the back button.

** The one thing that really turns me off is Harry getting compared to his parents. One, he got orphaned by them at a young age, causing him to not be influenced by them much. Secondly, he isn't just related to his mother and father, he has grandparents, great-grandparents, ex. That just makes me feel as though his great grandfather Charlus is unimportant, same with his great grandmother Dorea. Or his grandparents Fleamont and Euphemia. Finally, he is his own person, albeit the product of two others.

*** My eyes change colour depending on the light, but that's because I have hazel eyes. Hazel eyes reflect the colour around them to a bigger degree than other colour eyes, so they can appear more green or more brown.

When I was a kid I could never make my mind up whether my eyes were green or brown or grey, because every time I checked (which actually wasn't that often because I usually didn't think about my eye colour) it looked different. It wasn't until I was older that I learned about hazel eyes and how they appear to change colour.

Anyway, moving along to Harry Potter, I just don't enjoy how, in this fandom, every second marriage at least results in some unwieldy monster of a name. Seriously, keep either family name, I don't care, but don't make such a huge deal about it. It also doesn't make a lot of sense in-universe. Rowling made it a point to give Harry one of the least impressive names imaginable, it just doesn't fit well as Potter-Peverell-Black whatever. If he's some heir or whatever to whatever imaginary house, say so. You don't have to change your name just because you got a title.
