Hey all. I know this has been posted a bit lately, but I've looked at almost every recommendation for Dramione and SS/HG and have yet to find a well-written, believable one.

Any recs?

The two fics that stick out for me as the best I've read are Isolation and Pet Project- both of them were long, with lots of buildup.

I absolutely hate fics where the two act out of character, become so lovey-dovey, etc..

I'd like one that's actually believable!

Thanks for your recs, guys!

(Recently tried reading Cruel and Beautiful world by the way, and I couldn't stand it. Sorry! So don't recommend that one!)


** Some SS/HG fics that I enjoyed that I thought had pretty good relationship development are:

Admittedly, it has been a while since I read either of these stories so they may not be quite what you've requested. The former is a Time Turner fic (/I know, I know!/), but I remember it as addictive. I'm pretty sure that the latter story ends up mushy, but there's quite a bit of miscommunication along the way. Enjoy!

***** I nope'd the fuck out of a Sirius/Hermione one where Sirius "humorously" rapes a twelve year old Hermione.

In general, Sirius/Hermione and Sirius/Harry creep me out because Sirius is a father figure to Harry, and Hermione may as well be Harry's sister in my book. Remus/Hermione and Remus/Harry less creepy, but still somewhat so. I'm also uncomfortable with HHr due to the incest-factor, but sometimes those are just well written.

******* Things I've encountered in fan fiction that are supposed to be funny:

- gang rape (they thought it was someone else!)
- torture (hahaha, poor Neville lolol!)
- pedophilia (she told me she was 14!)
- incest (those Weasley twins and their shenanigans!)
- slavery (Draco had it coming rofl!)
- genocide (it was accidental!)

Unfortunately, this is an incomplete list. The amount of cringeworthy moments increases in direct proportions with appearances of Sirius and the twins, and inverse to the skill of the author.

tl;dr: some people don't know how to be funny so they go for shock value because they can't tell the difference.

******** Your tl;dr pretty much summed it up and to an extent, adding that extra shock value in a fanfiction can boost the gritty realism, but when you're reading a jovial fanfiction and then suddenly Boom, Draco is raping someone in a casual way it makes you wonder what the fuck is going on!

I might do a separate thread to talk about these ideas properly because after dropping a fanfiction for the fifth time due to adding casual rape scenes it starts to really irk at you.

Edit: i would definitely prefer to not go into one of the biggest and most annoying atrocities in fanfiction that is the portrayal of +Fred and George+ Gred and Forge Weasley (which almost every bad fanfic will call them) if you look through my post in HPFanfiction then you'd understand the hatred I now have for their fanon portrayal. Ranging from their *absolutely fucking annoying bullshit PING PONG STYLE SPEECH* to their general one dimensional characters.

********* Well, I'm one of the rare few that didn't find the twins too appealing in canon. Though in fanon they are particularly annoying. Actually here's my list of characters that I are written badly in fanon:

1. Luna Lovegood. I've read like... 4 fics where they didn't butcher her character.
2. Severus Snape. He's either completely one dimensional, or suddenly made of pure supportiveness and awesome.
3. Sirius Black. He's been 12 years in Azkaban, and was rather unstable before it (he's a Black, damn it). Writers just make him shrug that off in a couple of weeks, or suddenly make him the ultimate father figure.
4. Fred and George. I may not particularly care for them, but that does not excuse how they're butchered in fanon.
5. Dumbledore. Is not stupid. He may be manipulative, but he's not cruel.
6. Hagrid. He speaks in a particular way - if you can't emulate it, don't try.
7. Voldemort. He's /smart/. Everyone seems to forget that.

Those characters in particular are so rarely written well. The top three of the list are IMO the most rewarding characters to read when they are written well, because they are the most complicated ones (which is perhaps a nice way of saying "damaged")... but it's surprising how people mess up even the simplest characters when it comes to humor.

********** On the subject of Luna [[/u/truncation_error]] pretty much summed up how a lot of authors see her complex character.

#+begin_quote
  One of my biggest pet peeves in fanfiction is so-called "Luna flakes": take a hetero pairing, say Harry/Hermione, sprinkle over wish-fulfillment kink sex with Luna, and there you go: extra spice. It's boring. It's been done to death. And it's both wholly unbelievable polyamory and degrading to women, who deserve better than to have one of the more interesting characters of their gender portrayed as little more than a vapid fucktoy with a sub fetish. More broadly, so few writers can pull off writing Luna competently that I wish they wouldn't bother.

*********** I stay away from H/Hr also due to crap like that (the incest factor can be worked around if written well). Threesomes can be particularly steamy, but most writers have so obviously never participated in one that it just comes off as embarrassingly bad wish fulfillment... and H/Hr tends to be mostly about embarrassingly bad wish fulfillment as is.

And dammit, Luna is anything but vapid. That's one of the many ways people mess her up. She's suddenly a seer, can read auras, loses that dreamlike quality to her speech, isn't tough as nails, has no positive outlook (ugh, read one where she was a cutter... how OOC can you get?!), and suddenly has a cruel streak a mile wide.

Though to be honest, if one girl from canon is likely to be ok with sexual experimentation it's probably Luna.

Their relationship is super-strong, but it's not in the least bit romantic - hence, it feels like a breaking of a unique trust. It's not literal incest, but this is why it feels like that to me. Unless a story veers way off canon, it just seems so wrong for them.
