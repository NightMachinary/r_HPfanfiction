Hi! So, as I tend to do from time to time, I browsed the recent posts to see what new reccomendations come up. As it happens, I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11196345/1/A-New-Man]] and although I generally tend to stay away from crossovers, something compelled me to read it. Surprisingly, I liked it quite a lot but unfortunately it seems abandoned. Thus, I'd like to ask you guys for a few other crossovers with the Avengers/MCU. I tend to like longer stories, so preferably something like 100k+? Also, in 'A new man', I liked the concept of Harry being pulled into a parallel universe in which the wizarding world doesn't seem to exist. So extra kudos if the story is sort of like that.

Thanks in advance!

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

** I went through fanfiction.net's entire collection of Harry/Avengers crossovers several times, but I've yet to come across a fic that is long, finished and good all at the same time.

Though Heroes Assemble was fun for a while. It got a bit silly later on.

Finding Home was good for a while, only unfortunately it turned out to be one of those stories in which Harry just kind of tags along and doesn't really impact the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home]]

And the Observer Effect is kind of fun if you like fem!Harry. I liked the playful interaction between female Harry and Stark. It's only pretty ooc and abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10524028/1/The-Observer-Effect]]

I loved A New Man and I hope it hasn't actually been abandoned. It's one of very, very few good crossover stories. Wand and Shield starts out okay, but drags along endlessly, unfortunately.

** There are a ridiculous number of MoD Harry x MCU fics.

Here's a few:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13647819][Harry Potter and Death's Quest]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13159671][My Dad, the Boy (Man) who Lived]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136][Of Wizards and Heroes]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3198950][Deus Ex Machina]]

And there are a /lot/ more. I recomend checking Archive of our Own (AO3) more; they actually have a mechanism for searching tags so you can find things better.

It isn't /all/ slash, in fact I've read two where even though Harry's relationship was very 'close' with Tony/Steve they made a point of "no we're just really good friends who leave clothes at eachother's houses". It's kind of weird. But I'll see if I can find them.

  A story of how Harry growing up as Tony's brother might have changed things in both worlds. Told non-chronologicaly. But don't worry: the order makes sense. At least in my head. Now with the option of reading chronologicaly.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

*** I'd say right now the MCU is more interesting to play around in vs the DCCU simply because the variety in terms of character personality is a lot wider at the moment. Plus we've had nearly six years for Avengers crossovers to build up while Justice League just came out.
