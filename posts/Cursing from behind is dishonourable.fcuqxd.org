:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I remember only one part of this fic - though I'm fairly certain it's an alternate universe fic, I'm not 100% sure - and that is when Harry and crew are hanging out at the Burrow when it's attacked, and Harry flanks the Death Eaters and curses them from behind, which everyone else gets pissed at him for because it's dishonourable. I remember it not being overly good, but I can't remember the title and that inability to remember is itching in my brain.


** I don't know the fic, but people in it sound stupid. You don't give people a stand up fight during war or ever really.

*** Oh agreed. It's peak 'The Order of the Phoenix don't kill people, don't sink yourself to the level of the Death Eaters!' so Harry can shout at them a lot about that. Like I said, it's not a good fic, I just can't remember the name and my brain seizes on that and keeps reminding me I can't remember whenever that happens.

*** Yep. That's the one. Apologies for not responding to your question, but I had to go get groceries. Thanks for finding it, you've saved me quite the headache. :)
