I'm sick of reading bashing stories of both Hermione and Ron and would love you guys to recommend me some stories were Ron and Hermione love and respect Harry as a friend and just take care of each other. Might be hurt/comfort or an adventure story but the main point is that I want them close to each other.


** Some of my favorite golden trio fanfics I remember:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11968875][to welcome you home]], linkao3(11968875)\\
A lovely oneshot about Teddys first day in Hogwarts

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167)\\
After the war the ministry stays corrupt so Harry, Hermione and Ron start to fight it. One of my favorite "dark Harry" fanfics even if the ending feels a little bit rushed.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/][Forging the Sword]], linkffn(3557725)\\
Ginny dies in the chamber, this changes Harry, Ron and Hermione. Sadly its incomplete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose]], linkffn(4101650)\\
Ron, Ginny and Harry travel back in time. It's some years ago that I read it, but I'm pretty sure Hermione joins them later.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11302568/1/][Renegade]] - The Trio (and Neville, but he isn't that important) are pretty close. Although it is a non-linear fic and Edgy!Gary Sue!Harry is a bit annoying.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12792189/1/][A Beautiful Lie]] - Ron and Hermione are significantly less featured, but their portrayal is very good. It really shines in the second arc, as the first arc is mainly about Dumbledore mentoring Harry and a burgeoning Harry/Fleur (with a bit of Harry/Daphne).

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8666085/1/][Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection]] - Specifically, book 4 and 5. I don't remember it very well, but I'm pretty sure Ron is one of Harry's close friends. One of the few Slytherin!Harry AU's which has Ron /and/ Hermione as Harry's friends.

The first and second fics in the series are extremely generic canon rehashes. You can skip them and still understand the rest, but there are a few (/very/ few) moments which foreshadow a major plot point of the fifth part.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/][The Merging]] - The first 16-17 chapters have an excellent trio (plus a few extras) dynamic. It is mixed in well with a more complex plot and Harry's rapid growth. I didn't like the fic much after chapter 20-21, but the high school vibe in their fifth year is one of the best I've ever read.

Note: All these fics are low on Angst, Family and Hurt/Comfort, with focus mainly on Adventure and sometimes, Friendship. I don't read too many fics of the former genres, and forget the ones I do read quite quickly.

  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
