  A month after the Battle of Hogwarts, war-scarred, pre-Auror recruit Harry has a new target: Antonin Dolohov, the man who killed Remus Lupin. When a tip from Malfoy leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione into an ambush, however, Harry's Master of Death power awakens and sends him---and Malfoy---to the time of Dolohov's first murder in 1978. As Harry and Draco struggle to find their way home while (re)doing their seventh year at Hogwarts, Voldemort is at the height of his power in the First Wizarding War. And, despite not being born yet, he's still targeting Harry. Harry and Draco fight for their lives and their future, burdened with the knowledge of what will happen to everyone around them. The Marauders, on the other hand, are more concerned with pranks, love, and N.E.W.T.s than the war outside the castle.

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.

  Lily has revolved around him for years, ever since he held out his hand and made impossible things happen; cracked open her tiny little world and showed her magic.And for the longest time she loves him. And then he rips her apart.‚ÄúMudblood," he says, and it's like poison right in the heart of her. She starts coughing.~Basically I got fed up of people online blaming Lily for not loving Snape so I decided fuck it she's getting a fic where she's strong and brave and needs no man, especially not one that treats her like shit thank-you-not-very-much.Yes I'm salty.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Tom Riddle is a frightening coil of darkness, cruelty, and greatness, and changing him is Harry's only hope for saving people he loves.

Tom is fixated on him to the point of destroying the world just to keep him.But Harry loves him. And the future changes.

  Harry might have ended up in the past against her wishes, but now that she was already there you could bet your life on the fact she'd make the most of it.Fighting Death Eaters, evading Aurors and Ministry attention was an old game and she'd only gotten better at it with age.Accidentally becoming the Lady Black and adopting a teenager hadn't really been part of the plan, but... Harry's plans never worked out like she wanted anyway.

  For as long as Harry Potter could remember, he had only ever really needed---and wanted and longed for---one thing. Family.Family cared for one another, even at the expense of others that was not part of that family. In that, Harry could say that family is selfish and he was okay with it.And Death had always been a part of his life and he might as well hold on to what was left for him.---------------------------------------AKA that unnecessarily long and complicated fic that will lead to an overprotective Harley Keener.Or- that Harry Potter is Harley Keener AU literally nobody (including me) was looking for.

  You don't get away with writing an epilogue nineteen years later, giving all these people kids and jobs and telling us they ended up just as their parents were before. These kids fought a war, they didn't leave it unscathed. People died, people were murdered, and they had to go on with this loss in their bones the rest of their lives, with a flinch at every sudden sound and sudden movement, with a cold rattling in their lungs; they had to learn to live again. I want to read about the aftermath. I want to read about everything not being well, but maybe, just maybe, well enough.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

  Harry accidentally time travels to 1979, where he gets captured by the Order of the Phoenix. There's a catch --- from the moment they set eyes on Harry's forced Dark Mark, they despise him.* ‚ÄúFinally awake... Death Eater?‚Äù the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words ‚ÄúI can explain‚Äù were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, ‚ÄúSirius.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúWhat I find absolutely fascinating,‚Äù Riddle said, stalking closer, ‚Äúis you.‚Äù He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. ‚ÄúDo you know why?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúNo. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.‚Äù

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. ‚ÄúThat. Right there.‚Äù One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. ‚ÄúNathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...‚Äù

  He leaned closer, ‚ÄúYou look at me like you want to stab me.‚Äù After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.
