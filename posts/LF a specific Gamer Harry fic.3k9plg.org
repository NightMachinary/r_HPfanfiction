I'm looking for a Gamer Harry fic where he assigns stats and grinds to build levels, etc.

I can't recall the name, but I recall that it was pretty extensive, and featured a Gamer Harry that was slowly being corrupted by the game (without seeming to realize it) because he picked a "Perverted" flaw to have more points to buy perks/buy off some other flaw (can't remember which) and then had him rapidly become very much sociopathic when he bought away his Hero Complex flaw/perk (or something to that effect).

I don't remember the time frame (pre-Hogwarts or during) but the story mostly took place around Privet Drive (when I read it at least) and involved Harry gaming a young girl into being his girlfriend and then using game mechanics and his perverted urges to basically make her into his devoted slave. Another character was an old neighbor (I think he was a war veteran or something) who Harry worked on to gain approval from and who encouraged him to play soccer.

Anyway, I just recently went on a binge of reading Gamer fics (both HP and other fandoms) and remembered about this fic but not its name. Wanted to see if it had gone anywhere since I had last read it.


** I'm not 100% sure but it's probably this one.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

Not all (or even most) HP, like I said.

Can't say all of them were great, but nor were they all awful. Most were appallingly incomplete and/or abandoned. However, most were ok and engaging enough to keep me until the end. Some were only loosely relatable to "gaming", but close enough to catch my attention.

  When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. When life gives you the powers of a game character, you become the best character you can possibly be. Harry Potter wasn't just a Wizard. No, he was much more than that. With his powers, he'll become the strongest and kick the Dark Tosser's ass while doing so. Watch out world, Harry Potter is a new man and he's not to be messed with.

  It began after I got rejected by Signal again, though at the time I had no idea what was happening. Titles and levels suddenly appeared above people's heads and then weird things began to happen, as if I was in a game. And then, I realize I was in a game. But...if my life is a game, I'm going to win it. My name's Jaune Arc and I'm the Gamer. RWBY/The Gamer.
