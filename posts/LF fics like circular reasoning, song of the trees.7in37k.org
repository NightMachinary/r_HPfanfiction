and by the divining light

As the title says, I'm looking for fics similar to these and with quality :)

Slightly unrelated, if there's an action heavy fic with a believable plot and grammar you can read without vomiting, please recommend!

thanks


** What's the connecting thread between all these? Is it the higher powers meddling with things part?

Your second request: Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]]?

*** Just some supernatural shit ennit

seriously though, there doesn't have to be one. If it's similar to one of them, I want it!

I liked the dark parts about them and the otherworldly descriptions, so i guess you're saying would be right.

I have read ectomancer but as i haven't read it in a while I'm gonna read it again! ðŸ˜‰

**** I've got a few that might work.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/][Evil be Thou My Good]] cross with Hellraiser, Vernon opens the Lament Configuration.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/The-Eyes][The Eyes]] Lovecrafty fic where Harry sees stuff that other people don't.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed][Deathly Hallowed]] Lily makes some kind of deal with Death to save Harry and things get kinda weird sometimes. Don't really remember what was going on. But I'm pretty sure it was a fun read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King][Harry Dursely and the Chronicles of the King]] This one is hit or miss. It's confusing as all hell since the protag is getting routinely mindfucked by pretty much everyone and there's easily a half dozen different convoluted schemes going on. Really liked their version of Durmstrang though. Made more sense than most of the others I've come across.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] Popular cross between Potter and the MCU. The part you'd be interested in is pretty late in the fic when he's exploring a wizardless dimensions Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4438449/1/Path-of-Decision][Path of Decision]] Harry is an object of interest to a bunch of gods and he's trying to get the hell away from them because they're scary as shit.
