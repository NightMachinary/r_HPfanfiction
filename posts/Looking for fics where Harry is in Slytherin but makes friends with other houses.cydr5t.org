** The Sarcasm and Slytherin Series on AO3 does this, it's not a huge amount of people in other houses but it's some. Other tags are Dark!harry, WBWL, and some politics. Be warned this is a Series so it is multiple fics written under one banner year by year

It's also a wrong boy who lived (WBWL) story and has 11 year olds speaking like adults, among other tropes, but everything is convincingly and satisfyingly explained (or at least brought up as odd, and worthy of looking in to). It's well-written, long, and slowly being updated. I stopped reading it last year to allow for some time for the story to finish, but recently started over again.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
