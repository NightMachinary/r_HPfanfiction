I think that this fandom could really use an in-depth, well-written story that blends action, world building, romance, and slightly different influences than what we usually see in HP fanfiction. Do you think the multi-POV format (each chapter written from a different character's POV) would work for this fandom?


** Depends on how you'd pace it. I've seen a few do that kind of POV-switch, but most of them have turned out incredibly slow paced where the plot moves slower than continental plates.

On a personal note, I'd also say that you'd need to work out how to make the POV character's voices distinct and recognisable. One thing I've seen multi-POV fics do is label the chapters with the relevant POV and it's always come off a bit... lazy. But that's purely a personal preference/observation.

*** Thanks for the insight. I was thinking of starting the very first chapter with a bang. A sudden event that thrusts the various characters out of their normal comfort zones (quite literally) and forces them along uncommon paths. The intent would be to break up the monotony early and, given the unusual circumstances they'd find themselves in, avoid the laziness and pacing issues about which you speak.

Also, incidentally, I am toying with the idea if this being a post-Voldemort fic. Because honestly, Voldemort has been done to death and I'd like to see something different than blood supremacy as a threat.

**** It's not so much monotony as it is speed and flow. What takes one POV three chapters to do will take two POVs six, especially so if they're undergoing separate adventures.

In a standard novel, you have on average eighty-thousand words starring the adventures of one protagonist with one POV. If you're having multiple POVs, you either write less on each POV (risking faster or jumpier pacing), or you have a far longer story with each individual POV's drama spaced out (risking your plot moving so slowly that there's moss growing on your characters in real time).

Imagine having to read three chapters of a different book starring a different character following a different plotline between each chapter of the canon Harry Potter books and you'll get the idea of the issue. With multiple POVs, you're basically writing multiple novels in one. It's a very difficult balance to strike, having multiple separate 'main plots' going on at once and making sure they get their fair 'screen time'. So you've got to be careful that you keep each individual plot thread (ie. POV's plot thread) moving and don't let them lag and don't give any particular one too much priority either.

***** I've seen it work in written fiction where the timeline moves forward on the vast majority of chapters (or scenes), perhaps with one or two that occupy the the same space. Of course, it does require the different characters having goals that relate to one another in some way so that the reader can fill in the gaps. Also, careful editing to make sure that the chapters aren't bloated.

If it's done by scene, then I think the changes need to be infrequent enough that the reader isn't jolted around by perspective. Perhaps with a main character or max two who have the lion's share of the plot and another couple of appear infrequently.

It very rarely works in fanfic because you have to be particularly skilled to pull it off, in my opinion. It goes for fics in general, I suppose.

****** Exactly. It can work, and has done in the past, but it's really, really hard to pull off well.

But yes, it's definitely a good approach to take the multiple POVs as separate pieces of the puzzle rather than two different windows to the same plot or two different pictures entirely. But even that's really difficult to manage - and doubly so in fanfiction, where people will often ask questions you answered in the ANs or berate you for bashing/washing a character they have a different perception of.

I think one of the best examples I saw of this in fanfiction was that one with the Obliviated Police Officer who kept rediscovering the magical world because she left notes and recordings and magicals are ignorant idiots who've never heard of a tape recorder. She had her time when her plot-arcs came up, but it was nicely balanced with the main parts of Harry and everyone else. (Can't remember the name of the fic, though).

** It can work - I've written several such stories, though I usually switch POVs per scene, not per chapter.

** Sure, it might work, but you will run into several problems.

- The HP world is relatively small. There aren't that many characters, and like 90% of the cast eats in one of two locations every day (Hogwarts, the Ministry). Generally, more POVs imply a bigger world, otherwise it feels constricting. So you would have to do a lot of worldbuilding. Compare the HP world to the size of the cast and world of GoT.

- The world of Harry Potter isn't necessary made to be "gritty," although you certainly can make it that way. It's just a bit unnatural, just like making GoT very whimsy would be unnatural. Imagine the sorting hat in GoT, and that it isn't destroyed.

- Gritty is also not my personal stuff, and it tends to just make a story depressing. It's very much "handle with care."

- Multi-POV tends to slow things down. Allow stuff to happen off-screen (take for example GoT)

- And secondary storylines are hard to pull off, sew GoT again - a lot of people dislike the Daenaerys chapters.

** The person below captured my thoughts. Very big brain. I do want to emphasize on the "slow-paced" part- I see an unfortunate amount of people who do this, +andifyouwantanexaampleyoushouldtotallycheckouthundredacrewood+ and it just gets annoying after the thirteith chapter describing the thing that J U S T happened.
