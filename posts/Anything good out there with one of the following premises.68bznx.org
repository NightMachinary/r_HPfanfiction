a) The gang decides to keep Norberta and help Hagrid raise it

b) Things go differently in the Chamber and Harry ends up with his own basilisk

EDIT: Obligatory no slash, no pairings works too.


** Well, technically, this counts:

  When Harry loses the Sword of Gryffindor in the Chamber of Secrets, only a firm desire to at least make it through to his first kiss, a generous helping of accidental magic, and a healthy dose of phoenix tears let him survive. Unfortunately, it also leaves him with a blind basilisk, an incensed Ginny, and answers that make him wish Lockhart was still around to Obliviate him.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Hagrid wins a dragon egg...only what is inside is no dragon. Harry is the first to make eye contact with the creature inside...and ends up with a most unusual familiar. Watch out Hogwarts...things are about to get prehistoric!
