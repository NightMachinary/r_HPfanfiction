I absolutely loved reading that fic, but sadly my reading speed has made stories as long as that only last a few hours.

So yeah, I'm looking for a fic where Harry gets a dragon slayer magic, (or any magic from fairy tail- they are all OP) but doesn't immediately become godlike. I want him to have to train to get stronger.

Over 100k words please!

not quite perfect but a great story where Harry isn't OP at the beginning (if I remember it right)
