I looking for sth like that: - Snape is royal. e.g. he is the heir of a fortune, the son of a prince, etc. -Never love Lili and they was only friends from school. -He is Voldemort's right hand man. Practically like a second black gentleman -He never studied at Hogwarts, only at another prestigious school. He gets there by international exchange or sth. like that.
