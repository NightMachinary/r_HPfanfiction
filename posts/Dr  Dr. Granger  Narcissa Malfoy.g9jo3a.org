I remember reading a fanfiction with pairing as above, but I can't recall it's title... I remember that Harry was paired with Hermione and he lived in their home.

Narcissa was considered a part of Granger's family when they rescued Harry from Durzkaban.

  A more mature, knowledgeable and motivated Harry Potter goes to school. His fated encounter with Hermione Granger comes sooner as they share a compartment aboard the Hogwarts' Express during their first journey to school. With greater self-confidence, the muggle-born and halfblood will start the long needed reformation of the magical world, hand in hand. HP/HG/DG/LL/OC

*** Yeah, that's the one I was looking for, thanks.

Hmm... Weird, I didn't remember the master-slave dynamics in it.
