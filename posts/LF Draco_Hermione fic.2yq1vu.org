Hey all, I read a fic a long time ago that centred around Draco and Hermione, and I've struggled to find it for years, so I was wondering if its familiar to any of you?

All I remember is that it was a very love/hate relationship, probably because of some sort of marriage law. I think Hermione also struggles with her relationship with Narcissa for a while, but they work it out in the end. This is the biggest bit I remember: towards the end, Hermione builds an orphanage for magical kids so that no one has to grow up like Harry did.


** I wish I could help! I think I (sorta) recently read something that sounds spot on for your description...

*** If you remember what it is, feel free to let me know :) Even if it's not the one I'm looking for, it might be worth a read anyway :)
