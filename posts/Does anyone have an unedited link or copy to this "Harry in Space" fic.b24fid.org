It's been taken down from Ff.net (probably by that worthless Cretins United group), which is where I last read it in full, and I can't find it on the other usual sites.

It's been "found" in the above thread, it's "The Star Empire", but the only version I could find was one without any of the more racy scenes and was really heavily edited, which made it lose it's charm.

It kind of loses credibility when a murdering space pirate says "heck" I instead of "hell". I mean, really....? The guy is a rapist and a murderer, but he's concerned about his language? Give me a break.

So I'd appreciate if someone has a full version of this!

I have two versions of this, if I sent the wrong one let me know I'll try the other

**** Try this [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=16moWuYSeKXfYTkjaHVTBjnhoEcdJIJ_e][one]] or this [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tCA_VLOFLau0BcoSoH4RCB6BYu69gR2P][one]]. The "Harry" is wacky and the plot is a bit strange, but the world building is amazing. It's still a fun time and worth the read.
