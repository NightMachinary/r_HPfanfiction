  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** Even if Harry died in the forest, Voldemort and the Death Eaters were all but defeated. Harry would of willingly given his life for the protection of everyone else. The reinforcements still would of arrived from Hogsmeade, Neville knew to kill the snake. Would be awesome to see Ron and Hermione start fighting like 2 people possessed though.

**** Very true. Oversight on my part. Voldemort was mortal surrounded by hundreds of witches and wizards intent on ending his life. Don't think he was getting out of there alive. Especially with the added rage of avenging Harry's death.

***** With the added bonus of being unable to kill anyone, thanks to Harry's sacrifice! Well, kill them directly. It's entirely possible he would have grievously wounded, or been able to murder then through less direct means. He /was/ out dueling Professors McG, Flit, and Slug when Harry jumped in.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.

  How far would Ron and Hermione go to save their best friend? Where would their choices lead them - to doom or salvation? This is a look at what those two of the Golden Gryffindor Trio can and will do in a world darker than canon: their choices, their journey and the result.
