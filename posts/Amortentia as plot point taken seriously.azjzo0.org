Any fics where Love Potions and their horrific repercussions are treated as a serious plot issue?

I've only ever seen stories: glossing over the consequences (like canon with Ron, actually); playing it for a joke/parody; using it as a means to get Harry Righteously Outraged at someone (usually Ginny/Molly); etc. Never treated as a serious breach of consent.

It doesn't have to Be the plot, but at least play an important part in it.


** If I may plug my own fic, when time-traveling Hermione explains what Merope Gaunt did to the muggle Tom Riddle, she calls it what it is, rape. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418]])

Amortentia appears again later in that story, but it would be a spoiler to say how.

*** One thing I love about this fic is how Tom's 'unreliable narrator' perspective affects the depiction of Merope or other characters. It's hard to tell how much Tom's experiences might have scarred him, because whenever he talks about his deceased "wife" he stoically tells people what he thinks they want to hear. It's alarming how good he is at lying to himself, but often endearing as well.

**** Thanks! He's such a fun character to write, and it's especially fun to push the story through his filter before the reader has access to it.

I've been working on this story a lot recently, although I haven't updated for a little while. The plot is so huge, I have to make sure all the parts fit together before I post. I think Tom's ambition is rubbing off on me.

*** I must say, the plot looks original. I've never read anything like it, and after a few years reading fanfiction that's not an easy thing to say. I'll give it a read too, thanks for the rec!

**** Thanks! It seems like writers are always sending Hermione to the 70s, but there are other eras. The 1920s are when the problem really started. And that poor muggle doesn't get shipped with anyone besides Merope, so it was about time.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

** It's a decently major plot point in The Refiner's Fire, though it's less of a love potion and more of a curse (think it's called the Black Widow Curse). Actually causes quite a lot of tension for a number of chapters/time.
