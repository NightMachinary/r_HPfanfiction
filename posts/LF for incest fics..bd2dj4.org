I mean like pairings as Harry/Lily(his mum not his daughter) and stuff like that , and i'd prefer if y'all know of any plot centric ones . Also nothing that takes from the Epilogue and Cursed Child. Thank y'all!

**** Probably a better way to do it would be to search for [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Incest&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][works tagged with "Incest"]], so you can then also filter out stuff labeled M/M.

** I have to give credit to you for coming right out and asking. I know a great series, but it's heavy on plot and M/M, not het. If anyone is interested, I'll link it.

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1031138][Unbearable series]]. Parts 1, 3, and 5 are the main stories. You don't have to read them in order, but it helps. The incest part with Draco is obvious, but the part with Harry gets pretty tricky. This is what I told another poster:

This is a wildcard. The first story isn't H/S but builds up to them through a series of events. How do you feel about a more dramatic take that is focussed less on slash and more on a generational saga? The series eventually deals with Snape and Harry coming together as equals and healing generations of wrong doing? It's part of a multiple-story arc involving other slash pairings and Harry/Snape are never the main pairing, but they reach a point when "it" happens after a huge journey to make things right (incomplete story). Snape has secretly survived and Lucius and Draco are prominent early on. It's told through multiple view points. Draco and Snape have their versions. Harry's is still ongoing. It has all the controversial things that people posture against, but you can decide for yourself if it's right for you. There are squick/sensitive issues like mpreg, incest, noncon, but it tells a great emotional story.
