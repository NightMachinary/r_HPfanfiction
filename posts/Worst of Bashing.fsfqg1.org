There is bashing, and /then/ there is /bashing/. Like this gem in linkao3(Say a Prayer). The scene from second year where Fawks catches fire and gets reborn.

#+begin_quote
  The bird was obviously on its last legs there likely wasn't anything he could do. When'd he'd gotten most of the way towards it, the bird burst into flames.

  "Oh crap. Stop that! Water...water!" Harry began patting himself down and trying to find his wand, but it was too late--the bird crumbled to ash which sifted down into a pile in the droppings pan beneath the perch. Harry stumbled forward, horrified and then jumped as *Dumbledore suddenly appeared at his side and hip-checked him away* from the pan and the ashes contained within. Harry stumbled and caught himself on the cabinet nearby.

  *Dumbledore wasn't even looking at him*, he was dusting ashes off a tiny, featherless baby bird.
#+end_quote

Like, seriously?! You're trying to make Dumbledore look bad even in that scene?!

** That doesn't seem very bash-y to me at all, at least without any context?

Dumbledore is focussed on his pet, which he might assume is in danger either because Harry is freaking out or because he was about to/thinking of spraying it with a lot of probably fairly harsh water, which is probably not good. Or maybe he just happened to be more focused on his pet right then. And Harrry, who is freaking out because he doesn't know what's happening, is misinterpreting this momentairy dismissal/silence or taking it as some sort of slight or Dumbledore being puposfully mean/rude. Edit: Plus we have no idea what their relationship is like in this story, (it may well be worse than in canon) which changes what is believable/what works and how well as well.

I mean it's not exactly an expertly phrased scene, and it doesn't exactly paint as positive a picture of Dumbledore as the original, but it's far from being overly negative or hateful towards him. On it's own I probably wouldn't even qualify that as bashing at all.

*** The first installment of the series the OP linked/quoted is extremely over the top crack. I remember one scene that had Hermione ooohing and aaaahing over Harry's library trunk, Percy overhearing it, and then barging into the room to call her a scarlet woman and the whore of babylon. (Because obviously she, a twelve year old girl, was admiring a twelve year old boy's prepubescent penis, right?)

It eventually turns into a great story and does away with with most of the ridiculousness. But that first fic? Oh yeah: there's some pretty brutal bashing going on of multiple characters lol.

** I once read a Snily fic with James bashing. Ok, well then, nothing unusual (sadly) -- it's pretty much impossible to avoid fics with James bashing so I decided to look past it. Then it turns out that it was all because of someone casting an Imperius on him. Well, I suppose it vindicates his behaviour, allthough IMO the fic overall so far was rather dubious even if I suppose bashing wasn't one of its problems...? Then, from out of absolute nowhere, James decided it was a good idea to force himself upon Lily. Well... uh...

I left that fic feeling very annoyed and decided to read other pairings for a time. I've always liked the ship, but the fact that 90% of them bash James is disappointing IMO. Especially since this is one of those rare ships where it's remarkably easy to simply not have him in the picture at all if you want to focus on the main relationship because James and Lily weren't even friends for several years -- the ship is problematic, but competition from James doesn't even rank in top 5 of the issues with it. But this fic took it to a whole new, and unnecessary, level.

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

*** Of course there'd be James bashing in a Snily fic, he's a complete bastard in canon.

He tries to blackmail her:

#+begin_quote
  “I will if you go out with me, Evans,” said James quickly. “Go on ... Go out with me, and I'll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.”
#+end_quote

And threaten to hurt her when she defends Snape:

#+begin_quote
  “LEAVE HIM ALONE!” Lily shouted. She had her own wand out now.

  James and Sirius eyed it warily.

  “Ah, Evans, don't make me hex you,” said James earnestly.

**** To be fair, in this one the author warns the readers of the true motivations of the bashed characters and is actually one of the few I've read that make the acts of the bashed characters have some sense instead of making them seem cartoonishly evil trying to abuse the poor MC. Not to say it doesn't have characters truly bashed (spoiler alert) by the end Hermione was the wicked witch of the west, Remus basically loses it in the middle of the story and is only shown again a little before the end as a frankly stupid antagonist that is killed right after he is reveled. All the others Werewolves beside Remus are immoral psychos and this is shown as a consequence of the curse without any reason being given for Remus being except from it. The Falamel's are shown as a pair of idiots trying (and falling) at killing muggles for centuries before Harry comes up and promptly and easily do what they've been trying without success for most of their lives, thus making both of them appear extremely incompetent (End of spoilers). But to be fair there are lots of stories that bash with less logic, and more hate than this.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
