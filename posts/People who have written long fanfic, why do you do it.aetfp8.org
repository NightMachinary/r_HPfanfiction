** Why not?

When you have a story idea, either you write it or you don't, no matter the length. Sure, a longfic might seem daunting, but if you want to write it then you're going to. Planning helps, or so I hear. For many people having a guided path of where the story is going gives them the support to keep writing: they can see the next point to reach and it gives them an idea of how to get there.

I'm not one of them. I might have a few key points I want to hit, but the more detailed my planning the less likely I am to fully flesh out the story. I prefer to just get started and keep going until I stop. Sometimes I stop because I realise I've written myself into an inescapable plot hole---something the planners are more likely to avoid---but sometimes I stop because I reach the end of the story.

Length doesn't factor into it for me and I don't think it should for other writers; don't plan to write a longfic, just plan to write /a fic/. A good story will be just as long or short as it needs to be; trying to pad the word count just for the sake of it will only ruin things.

** Because I always think I'll write something short and then somewhere along the way the story writes itself. I keep going until there's a natural stopping point.

** It's a good question!

I just recently finished writing my first real long fanfic. It took me 5 months. It was an amazing 5 months. Before this, I wrote mostly one shots. I didn't really walk into this intending to write something this long or this complicated at all.. but I had so much fun doing it.

On a somewhat related note, I have a friend who is an HP fan, but doesn't really understand or appreciate fanfic, who has told me on several occasions to basically "stop wasting my time" and "write a real book instead." In a supportive enough way. The thing is... I think, probably, any fanfic author would love to write a real book, if they could, but for me personally... I don't have any ideas for one. I find that it's basically impossible to write a story, a good story, if you aren't inspired and have no ideas. It's also not that easy to come up with a good original idea. I do, however, have ideas for fanfics. Lots of them. I think I spend so much mind-time in the HP world, that sometimes I feel like I know it better than the real world and my own life, and I have so much fun just imagining new stories within it. So I guess the way I look at it is... I might as well write things that I'm passionate about... and if I ever get to a point in my life where I have an idea for a real book or something like that, that's cool, and I can work on it then, but at least in the meantime I've been writing stories, and working on my grammar and my storytelling and all those things that make a good story a story. If I do end up writing something of my own, at least the time I've spent has not been wasted. And then again, if I don't write something of my own that's OK too... because I just wrote a 316 page fanfiction story, and that's basically a book! and that was a dream I've had since I was 8, when they asked me in my third grade class what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I said "a writer!" So I guess at least now I know I can write something that's basically a book... and it's not only that I can do it, it's also that I did do it. And that's an amazing feeling. Anyway, that's the reason for me. Can't speak for anyone else.

** I haven't done it so far but I am planning on doing it. I already have a good outline of 30 chapters and it will be about 40 chapters long. I want to do it because I love reading fanfiction and contributing is a way to make people, myself included, happy. And you have certainly searched for a specific fanfiction without finnding it, well if that happens to me I think about it and might write about ir

*** I love your last point. I was just saying to my friend (I call her my muse) that I love that I can just write everything into that story that I'd want to read myself!

** It depends on how much you LOVE it. Like, right now the fic I'm writing is an absolute freaking blast. I've been writing at least 3,000 words a day on it. My chapters are all 5k-8k words long. I get ideas for this story any time I'm not physically holding a device I can record those ideas down on, so I have to rush out of the shower to type out all the dialogue I thought up in there.

​

A lot of the plot points that just... work out perfectly weren't things I'd planned long in advance. That's another part that matters, I think. There's a word for it, for when you write something, then later on it becomes very important, and it looks like you were a genius the whole time. I do that a lot (not the genius part).

It also helps to be obsessive, I guess? This story is currently 77,000 words and I'm maybe a third of the way through it. If I get an idea for a scene later on in the story, I write it, and document whereabouts it should go, and then when I get to that point, I plop it in, with some adjustments if it has stuff that I need to say or stuff I decided not to go with since I wrote it.

​

Bottom line, for the two long stories I've ever written (one of which was on hiatus for 8 years while I had babies, lol), I felt like I HAD to write it. This more recent one is an OFC story which I never thought I'd ever write, and I basically have had to accept that it's not what most people will read--but that hasn't affected my passion for it in the slightest. Some people are just... writers. We can't not do it.

​

edit: I should add that usually my word file has the story as written, then an outline of either things I plan to do, or plot points I need to remember are a thing, then after that are the 'chunks' where I put scenes out of order.
