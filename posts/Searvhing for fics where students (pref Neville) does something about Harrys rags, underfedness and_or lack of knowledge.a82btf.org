I recently started rereading fics about lord potter, and the various alliances his house have with other heirs, and how none of them tried to help him when he appeared first year in rags, with no knowledge, and malnourished/abused. So im looking for fics where someone (Neville, Susan or such) actually does something. No slash for Harry, any length is welcome :) Thanks

*** I doubt Neville knows any fashion besides robes, so i think Harry is safe there. I was thinking more of the line of contacting the dmle of the abuse, or Nevilles gran to figure out why Harry is abused/underfed and has no knowledge of beeing a Potter.

** Finding fics with a competent Neville + Harry is like a unicorn. I vaguely recall that some of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie][James Spookie's]] fics have a helpful Neville, but I can't remember any specific one. Sorry if that's not very helpful.

I think linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux]]) has a bit of a bromance going on where Neville helps Harry out, but not with Harry being in rags or whatever.

I'm really drawing mostly blanks here, sorry. Maybe better than nothing though.

#+begin_quote
  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

*** It was more in the line of if there was an alliance between Potter and Longbottom, then Neville might as heir contacted his gran to figure out what was going on.

**** That isn't a thing in canon as far as I can tell. Of course in the AU worlds of fanfiction it could be. But in the original world there doesn't appear to be anything he would need to know regarding that, other than knowing who his ancestors are for the sake of it.

This certainly doesn't indicate there is any important info Harry would be expected to know as a Potter.
