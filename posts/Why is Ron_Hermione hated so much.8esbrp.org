** It's not my favourite pairing, as I much, much prefer Harry/Ginny. However, I don't hate it, and I even like it somewhat, but definitely less than before. You, on the other hand... well, all I can say is [[https://www.removeddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/8dm7gv/do_you_think_ron_is_a_good_friend/][thank God for Removeddit]]. You [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/is-ron-an-asshole.35717/][also posted that very same thread, just with a different title, on DLP]]. So don't complain about Ron/Hermione being hated when you post anti-Ron /anti-R/Hr troll threads all over the place.

Most/all of these are your accounts: [[/u/Wyattbrother]], [[/u/Theslewfoot]], [[/u/mildymort]], [[/u/fanafana]], [[/u/Pogbaisshit]], [[/u/wengerisacunt]], [[/u/worydfandomer]], [[/u/Klopptheclown]], [[/u/Seenu1]], [[/u/gzgGahavaavaava]], [[/u/varunf]], and [[/u/praveen4]]. I'm also strongly suspecting that you are also the person behind most of the plagiarist accounts on FF.net.

** I'll be honest I didn't like Ron and Hermione (She's my favorite character) but everyone keeps mentioning opposites attract which I can say is true, my husband and I are opposites. I'm a book worm who loved school, loves knowledge, loves travel amd my husband disliked school, and is a home body. So I personally get that opposites attract and someome above mentioned compromise, yes that is a crucial, sometimes we have lazy days inside playing video games and other times he takes me to an art museum, so I can see them loving each other in healthy marriage. We don't get to see Ron and Hermiones adult relationship, we see them as adolescents and young adults who are built up with hormones, so I think that is why everyone disapproves of Ronmione because we only see a small section of their relationship. I'm not saying theyd have a great marriage but I'm confident if they really wanted to make it work, really actually loved each other, they could. My point, since we dont see their growth between book 7 and the epilogue we feel a clash (rightly so). end rant~

** Wait, so if Hermione should only be interested in intellects then where does Harry/Hermione come in? Have we forgotten how lazy Harry actually is and how little he strives to improve his academics? I mean he had to cheat his way through potions in HBP.

Are people actually shipping canon Harry and Hermione or just a fanon version of them? I don't feel like they have much in common either.

I really don't think that following a better recipe is cheating. In this situation I feel like Hermione is 100% in the wrong. If Bobby Flay handed you a cookbook with notations on the recipes I feel like you'd follow his notations rather than stick to the text completely.

**** I like to challenge Romione shippers to come up with how these two would spend a free weekend in London: Hermione wants to visit museums or a library, Ron is bored. Ron wants to go to a quidditch store, Hermione is bored. Hermione wants to eat in a fancy restaurant, Ron is upset that there's no normal food. In the evening Hermione wants to curl up and read a book, Ron wants to play chess (which Hermione showed zero interest in). Hermione wants to visit her parents the next day, Ron is bored by the muggles and wants to go to the Burrow all the time.

Relationships might be about compromises, but not about constant misery and self-flagellation. Their ideal relationship involves spending as little as time as possible with each other (Hermione does her thing, Ron does his thing, and they are totally appreciative and respectful abot the fact that they are very different people and have different life goals)

***** Example of how a Romione date would look like.

*Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, Chapter 4:

#+begin_quote
  They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor --- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.
#+end_quote

Canon says they can have fun together, even when Harry isn't around.

***** Hermione is an intellect, Ron isn't. They're fundamentally so different to the point that they simply wouldn't be compatible as romantic partners in real life. Aside from sexual attraction and friendly commodity, I don't see how they could possibly maintain a long term relationship that doesn't involve constant bickering.

*** Do you have a habit of going through life assuming that people with opinions that differ from yours must be socially inept?

I like Ron, I like Hermione, but I think they're a terrible match as romantic partners. They'd never be able to sustain a healthy and mature partnership.

*** You're only addressing why people might dislike Ron... maybe there is some truth to your argument, but even then I'd think that Hermione deserves better than someone who's immature and thoughtless.

I think plenty enough has been said about how making each other cry and constantly getting in fights is not a sign of great romantic love. It's just perpetuated by people who have watched too many Hollywod RomComs, it's not reality. As if "unresolved sexual tension" is some kind of catch-all solution? There's nothing wrong with Hermione and Ron fucking each other's brains out for a few months, I just don't see much reason for them to stay together beyond that.

Have no issues with Ron as a character. Think all-in-all he's a pretty solid dude.

Also think Ron and Hermione would have divorced in a year.

** Because constant bickering and fighting does not make a successful relationship. And Ron and Hermione were not having friendly verbal spars, they were using words to hurt each other (see books 3 and 4)

Also Ron was a prat for the first four books, Hermione knows how to hold a grudge (Crouch, Marietta) and by the time Ron got better, there's too much water under the bridge.

** The biggest and most important RHr shipper said:

#+begin_quote
  I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron. I know, I'm sorry, I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility.

  Am I breaking people's hearts by saying this? I hope not."

  ...

  Oh, *maybe she and Ron will be alright with a bit of counseling*, you know. I wonder what happens at wizard marriage counseling? They'll *probably* be fine. He needs to work on his self-esteem issues and she needs to work on being a little less critical.
