So I'm currently rereading the series I just finished book 2. Out all of the books it's my favorite. After I finished reading it, I wondered if there were any fanfics of Ginny's POV? I'm new to HP fanfiction so I don't know where's the best place to find good fics and whatnot.

  No-one ever understood the true horrors that Tom Marvolo Riddle had to suffer through, with his consciousness trapped in a diary owned by a young girl. Mild Ginny bashing (YMMV), humorous. Complete.
