[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4613516/1/A-Gift-Freely-Given][This]] is honestly one of the most wonderful one-shots I've ever read in /Harry Potter/ fanfiction. It's by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/24216/][Lady Altair]] who has short but moving and truly brilliant one-shots. Check out her other stuff. It's wonderful. Her style of writing is unique.

It sort of humanizes Lily and adresses an issue that is often times overlooked and forgotten from my experience.

I personally adored it and highly recommmed it. It's very short but beautifully written in my opinion so I thought I'd post this.

Thanks! =)

Also, did I mention to check out her other stuff? [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4182741/1/In-Ashes][In Ashes]] is a brilliant one. I simply love it.


** I don't know if you've seen, but her linkffn(cauterize by Lady Altair) is probably the most highly recommended one shot here, and for good reason. Thanks for the share of some of her other stuff though!

*** Cauterize is one of those stories I can't get through without crying a little.

*** Thanks! Check out her other stuff. They're rare gems, IMO. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4182741/1/In-Ashes][In Ashes]] is just as painful and I adore it more than A Gift Freely Given. I might include it in there.
