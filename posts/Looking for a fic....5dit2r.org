I believe it's post war and Harry decides to travel afterwards and eventually he ends up living with a Japanese family. I'll be honest I don't remember too much, but the scene that sticks out is a massive gathering of people in Japan getting attacked by dementors and Harry saves the day.

Had to look through 2 years of posts to find it, but there it is.
