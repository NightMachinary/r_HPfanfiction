** How so no slash ? Forgive me if I am mistaken but young Albus have an infatuation with blond German boys more precisely one Gellert Grindelwald.

***** Because Most Slash Authors would take this as "Dumbledore loved Grindelwald who was the Dark Lord. Let's pair Harry with Voldemort" immediately making the fic creepy, rather than adding some blonde german OC boy which would be fine. The subreddit doesn't mind slash, but hates Death Eater pairings, from what I can tell.

****** Personally, I don't like slash stories, and I do agree with what you've also said. I just know that when I see slash requests, the post is usually downvoted into oblivion - unless there was a meta post earlier in the day, and everyone joins the bandwagon.
