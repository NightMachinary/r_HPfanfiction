***** Not every computer is time-dependant. And even for those that are, not everyone of those is /date/-dependant.

Bank computer that processes payments, sure. GPS Satellite, maybe. Hospital backup power system, no. Destroyer targeting system, absolutely not.

Pretty much every government in the world would have had some backup plans in case shit hit the fan too. The US pentagon has plans for pretty much every eventuality, and since magicals are a thing that exist /and/ the head of state is informed, there's probably a plan to deal with that eventuality /somewhere/.

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.

*** It was a possible extinction event caused by programmers using two-digit numbers for years, which would have overflowed in the year 2000 (the computer would have thought it was 1990). This would have stopped all banking and probably lots of other stuff for long enough to let most modern civilizations collapse. In the end nothing really noteworthy happened because people were smart enough to upgrade their software in time.

Bit of hyperbole in my description, although I believe I recently read that electricity loss for a week or so would lead to civilizational collapse, and perhaps no banking for a prolonged time could have similar effects.

****** Yep. And 64 bit should last us far, far longer than those computers will survive.

Edit: The real risk with the end of 32 bit time, as they say in the video I linked, is that some systems simply "Always work", and therefore are never updated. I work for a state government, and while our computers themselves are new, the system we use for processing all payments for our state was made in the 70's-80's.

****** Sure, but the internal data is still represented by a 32bit integer. There's some workarounds for this and how underlying libraries have to handle edge cases for compatibility, but it's not just "throw a bigger cpu at the problem". Even a 32 bit CPU could handle larger numbers, it's more of a software problem.
