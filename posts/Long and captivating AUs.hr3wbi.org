Suggest me fics with the likes of linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) linkffn(Black Luminary) linkffn(Denarian Renegade) linkffn(What you leave behind)

Suggest me the fics which are different and captivating. You can suggest the mainstream ones because i likely have seen them but never read them cos i'm indecisive like that.


** I'm seconding Reign of the Serpent, which someone already linked. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is absolutely fantastic, linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw) throws in allllll the tropes and somehow walks away with a good story. If you're into any sort of British history/lore in addition to worldbuilding, you'll love linkao3(Of a Linear Circle - Part I) and its sequels. In terms of an AU that is just pure creative and captivating, try linkffn(Forbidden by Savageland).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Ten years after Harry Potter defeated Voldemort, the Wizarding World seems safe: until two Hogwarts students disappear without a trace in the Forbidden Forest. Strangely linked to this incident is Severus Snape, who died in the Shrieking Shack. Or did he? When Hermione Granger is pulled into the investigation, she discovers the unimaginably dangerous truth.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) and its trilogy are about as AU as you can get, and still be on earth and fighting Voldie.

A Goundhogs Day Looping Harry that's nearing the end of his chances VS an Evil Overlord List abiding Dark Lord. Around, around, around he goes. Prepare to be confused.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** I'm reading a marauders plan which takes loads of tropes and does them well the only thing I can say I dint like about it is the fact that Harry changes so much in 5 months and the fact that he gets called cub and prongslet which annoys me a little but other then that it's alright and it kind of makes sense for the characters. It has some light but well done bashing and it's dealt with and explained well.
