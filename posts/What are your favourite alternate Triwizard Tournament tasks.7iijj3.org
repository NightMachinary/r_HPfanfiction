I've always loved the concept of the Triwizard Tournament, and I want to know some of the best tasks that authors have created even if I'm not that interested in the overall story. So what are your favourites?


** Say what you will about linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern), the tasks were fun and different.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** linkffn(12568760)

Still being written and we've only seen the first task so far but it was significantly more in depth, and what I would expect from a 'canceled because too dangerous' Death tournament.

#+begin_quote
  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Life never stops trying to tear her apart, but as everyone soon learns, Iris Potter bites back. Five unique tasks. Animagus and eventual reasonably powerful fem!Harry. Fourth year.

***** I mean that I think that you (assuming you're the author) /won't/ pull a White Squirrel and write a canon-rehash.

I expect different tasks from your story, and I /don't/ expect an "Iris grabs Portkey, and student dies" graveyard scene for example.

Sure, you'll still have tasks and a Yule Ball, but everything is different - which is good.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** linkffn(Hallowed) has all new tasks and has four tasks instead of three. 1 and 2 were nice variations on the original, especially since they inverted the pattern (1 was a race with magical creatures/plants as obstacles, 2 was a challenge against a single dangerous magical beast) and they used new and interesting creatures, which I appreciated. I LOVED the third task though, which is entirely different from any other I've seen and not only creative, but a very cool use of world building (and a great example of how they might design an entertaining, competitive challenge that's not based on violence). The fourth task is pretty similar to the original, but I'm not sure you can modify that one too much (provided Hallowed is trying to maintain the cup-as-a-portkey theme, which I'm not sure is the case yet).

** in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) The First Task involved retrieving a metal flag from a Demiguise, while Tebos, Diricawls, and Chameleon Ghouls are running about, while the Second Task was based on the Myth of Perseus.

linkffn(Weres Harry) The Third Task was created by the Marauders and Weasley Twins, and was one huge reference to The Princess Bride.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
