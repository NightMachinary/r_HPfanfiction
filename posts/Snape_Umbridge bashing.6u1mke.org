The more horrific, the bettet


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Although Umbridge was still that evil bitch here, her opponents were far more vicious, especially Hermione and Daphne's grandma. She was completely outplayed by those two women. Umbridge wasn't able to commit nearly as many evils as in the Books either, and died a very painful death in the end.
