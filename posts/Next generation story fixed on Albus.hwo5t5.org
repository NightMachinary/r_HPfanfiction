:END:
It's basically a next gen fic in which there's again a war and features an Albus who is not exactly dark, but he is on the dark side. Starts off in Albus' 6th year it think. He has a romance with an OC character (whose name starts with I) who is actually muggle born and he comes to know this much later which leads to him questioning the side he chose.

Also features Scorpius and Rose (who are a couple) as main characters. Scorpius is more like Harry than Albus and Harry kinda coaches him in the latter part.

I remember most of the story but I cant remember its name or the author. Plot points which stood out and I still remember (and which might help people to remember this story more): - Albus binds a dragon to him and calls it Zephyr - albus is great at potions and comes up with one which identifies all muggle borns in hogwarts (comes up with a mudblood scar) - Hermione and Ron's house is called something along the lines of Nest (it was a call back to order of the Phoenix) - A lot if backstories for everyone supporting the dark side and shows Albus' rapport with them

Does anyone remember it? It was a proper full length fic and really well written.

Edit: I just remembered another plot point - Arthur Weasley dies. Just adding as much info to help out.
