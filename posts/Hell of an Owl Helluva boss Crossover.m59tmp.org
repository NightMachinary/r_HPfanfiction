She was not panicking. Everything was going as expected, really!

Well, so maybe using Her father's book was not that good of an idea. And while her disguise was perfect, undoing her transformation was kind of hard when stuck in a cage (and a bad idea in general, when surrounded by humans). After her curiosity led her through the portal to the human world, some wand waving weirdo caught her in a cage and put her on sale. Now she is stuck in a pet store, and her sharp beak is the only thing that protected her from being bought by the first schmuck to come in.

A few days later she is getting worried. Her father should have found her already, right? It's not like he would not notice her missing, so what is keeping him? All he has to do is open a portal and come for her... With the Grimoire... That she stole and left in a tree before getting caught...

oooooops...

Her attention is caught by the newest shop visitor. She allows Harry to buy her because he seems nicer than the average client. He looks cute, his attitude makes her think of someone lonely like her, and his scar gives a feeling that reminds her of home. Maybe he is an agent of her father? Now she has to wait until he lets her out of the cage, grab the Grimoire again and go back home.

----

Harry was slightly overwhelmed. Discovering that he was lied to his whole life was a hard pill to swallow. The whole magic thing wasn't easier to take. Now, back in his room with his stuff (his magic stuff!) he could take a minute to breathe an process everything. First things first, he had a friend to take care of. Hedwig was a beautiful snowy owl, the only one in the shop, and his first birthday gift ever. She looked so lonely in the pet store, and locked eyes with him the moment he crossed the entrance. The shopkeeper was surprised that the owl seemed to like him, specially his scar. Harry was surprised too, being liked was not something he had lots of experience in. He opened her cage and... what was she doing?

When Hedwig flies out the window immediately after he opens the cage, his heart stops. When She stands in the tree outside his room and looks at him expectantly he decides to go after her. When he reaches the tree and Hedwig comes to his shoulder, nuzzles him , and flies away to the next tree, he decides to follow. She is his first and only friend after all. He will follow her to hell itself if necessary.


** I absolutely love this.
