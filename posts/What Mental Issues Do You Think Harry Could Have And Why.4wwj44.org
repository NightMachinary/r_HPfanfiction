E.g. Dissociative Identity Disorder - Due to having two people in his head for his first 18 years.


** Probably fear of abandonment, probably PTSD. Maybe other things as a result of his neglectful upbringing and then war torn adolescence.

*** I think PTSD might be a bit strong, but then again. There's no saying how it would affect a child that young over such a long time period. It could really go either way.

**** Well from the age of 14/15 he was involved in a 2-3 year war of which he was personally involved in several major battles. DoM battle (in OTP), Hogwarts 1 (in HBP), Hogwarts 2 (in DH), All of these battles involved the death of friends, including close friends and almost family level friends. I think it would be no great stretch of the imagination to believe Harry Suffered PTSD. Not even including the things personally done to him, torture, weird dreams due to his connection to Voldemort, leading to the death of a teacher at age 11.

Who's to say that the terrible things he witnessed and did during the length of the series had little effect on him at the time cause he had a bit of Voldemort in his head, and once removed the actions and things that had occurred in Harry's life all sort of hit him at once.

****** Yeah fair enough. He probably didn't have PTSD, but I imagine that there is some level mental insecurity given he latched onto the first two people to treat him kindly. Ron and Hagrid.

** Several phobias - mostly claustrophobia coming from his stay in the cupboard. Depending on what connections the brain made, it may be even agoraphobie. If Harry links safety to enclosed spaces, then wide, open spaces may frighten him.

He /has/ massive trust issues.

Paranoia - if a Dark Lord is after your ass, that would make sense.

Empathy issues as in his formative phase all he really got was antipathy. Probably not quite psychopath levels of it, but I do think that reading people's emotions (especially positive emotions) could realistically have some bad wiring in his brain.

Severe Depression - Depression is a sneaky bastard and someone like Harry is very susceptible for it. At first he gets mentally abused - every achievement of his is followed by punishment, he is kept down at every opportunity and he is repeatedly told that he is worthless. Then follows fame (something that is easily leading to depression alone). With fame comes a mental barrier between him and other people that is tremendously hurtful. Without Hermione and Ron, Harry would be a prime candidate for suicide without therapy, and even with them it would be easy for him to develop crippling depression.

He has problems with nightmares that become borderline insomnia.

Then a wide variety of abandonment issues and guilt-complexes, mixed in with some PTSD later that may even be accompanied by actual Battle Fatigue after the Battle of Hogwarts.

Bottomline: A realistic Harry would have years of therapy to go through in order to tear down most mental walls. Subtle things like abandonment issues and depression may never heal completely.

A fic that takes an exaggerated case of abuse and thinks the character of Harry through with it is Catechism linkffn(2006636). This fic is brutal, not because of the fictional abuse, but because there are children like that out there. Personally, as a volunteer social worker, this fic hit a bit too close to home.

**** And the most terrifying thing about it is that it pretty accurately describes the worst cases of abuse out there. There are kids out there who literally got the personality beaten out of them.

** Definitely Depression. Maybe some PTSD and anxiety.

I think what a lot of people fail to realize is that depression in children and adolescents does not look anything like it does in adults. It's aggression, irritability, trouble sleeping...essentially, the fifth book. I work in special education and I see it all the time. I just reread the fifth book for the first time in a long time and it broke my heart. Too close to home.

EDIT: Just thought of this: the short-term form of PTSD is acute stress disorder, and I would say that Harry probably had that after Sirius's death and Dumbledore's death.

*** OotP is my fave HP book because it finally shows Harry breaking down like any human being in his position would. I hate that so many people disliked Harry for reacting with anger and stress to very traumatic events.

PS. High five for special ed workers!!

**** Yay!! High five to you too!!

Even as a kid, I loved the fifth book. People would complain about how whiny he was, and I would just look at them and say, "Seriously? Look how unhappy he is! Somebody should have helped him!" I still think that, but it's with a lot more anger on Dumbledore's part.

** Defjnitely PTSD and Survivors guilt, particularly noticeable post GOF and OoTP. One could also argue a mild form of depression also noticeable i the last 3-4 books.

** Looking at the facts that we know from the books. Harry was locked in the cupboard for days if anything unnatural happened. He slept in a cupboard for ten years between the Halloween after he turned One, until just shortly after he turned eleven.

That would suggest, at least a possibility, for some kind of personality disorder, whether it would mean a more vivid and long-lasting imaginary friend that his mind would have made up. Or something else I don't know, but I think something would be possible.

** Aside from Catechism, which breaks my heart, are there any other good fics that show Harry with problems like these? Preferably ones that don't just show him going through it, but also getting help for it? Maybe ones that start to show him being affected as early as the end of SS. I mean, he did just kill a man who had been posessed by Voldemort. His life was at risk... Seems he'd be a bit traumatized then, and if not then, after CoS, for sure! Hell, my kid cousin was shaking after seeing that movie; actually experiencing it...PTSD for SURE if not more.\\
Thanks.

** DID is not about having people in your head - it's a complex, nuanced mental illness stemming from trauma where parts of yourself hold onto the memories that are too painful. It's a survival technique. Recovery is to integrate all the parts into the system and to face the memories. Here's some more info about it - I suggest looking into it a little better than just throwing it out there with no real understanding. Is there such thing as MIW? Mental Illness Warrior? I'm that, lol.

There is a pretty great fic where Harry /does/ have DID though if you are interested: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2529586/1/Broken-Mind-Fractured-Soul]]

I think he could have had PTSD and depression quite easily. We see a lot of it come out in OotP.
