** And it was an absolutely awesome finish. Cannot wait for the next instalment. Now its time for yet another reread.

*** I'm very glad that the story has moved into the 'reveal' phase - it's always been great, but it felt like the charade was going on just a bit too long/moving away from being the focus.

Makes it all the more exciting!

*** I'm so excited for it! I wonder if the next book will wrap things up or if she'll continue with more. I wouldn't mind more but with how authors often end up abandoning their stories I get a bit of anxiety when I think about it.

**** IIRC violet planned for the series to be 5 stories so the next one should be tying everything up in a bow.

**** Exactly. Every chapter ends like one of those where authors realize the enormity of their works and abandon them. It's gone on for this long, and I hope it goes on for longer.

** I was a bit surprised that Riddle hasn't tried to challenge the validity of Rigel's win. Seems to me that knowingly competing as a pureblood while actually being a halfblood should be enough to get disqualified, and the win revoked. The champion selection should have been Rigel, Owens, and Krum, not Fleur. Who knows whether Krum might have won if he'd had the chance to compete in the lake and the climb and the maze? By competing in the wrong category, Rigel was able to unfairly eliminate Krum based purely on duelling, before Krum had a chance to show off those other skills.

Unless Riddle just somehow hasn't thought of it, my guess is that he's waiting until he actually catches Rigel - possibly because there's little hard evidence of Rigel's blood status until he does. Sure, Rigel /said/ he was half-blood, but he was talking to a madman in a situation where it was perfectly sensible to stall for time and keep talking as long as possible. It's adequate proof for convincing the public, but maybe not good enough for the panel of judges to disqualify him /in absentia/.

It's a great chapter, though! I loved the encounter with Leo at the end. Of all the people who could work her out, he's at least the safest, pretty much guaranteed not to sell her out.

THANK YOU

I've bookmarked chapter thirteen, but I didn't continue checking for updates after a while so it would have been some time before I realised it was complete
