Do people want a reply to their review or just prefer to just comment? I used to be diligent about replying to every review but over time I kind of just gave up due to lack of response. I read every review I get but it is disheartening to type out a reply to a long review then not get a reply back.

Gist so far: this sub is full of introverts who don't want to interact with someone and just want to read/write. Alrighty then. /sigh


** What I think is more annoying is that certain users (not you, just to be clear) post request threads on this subreddit and then don't even bother to acknowledge that people responded to them. There's one user with five different threads and over 20 replies total without a single thank you, and that's just in the past month.

As for reviews, I haven't got enough to be overwhelmed by them so I've responded to every review I've been given I usually get a response when I leave a longer critical review or have questions, but I'm also okay with getting no response at all if I've reviewed several chapters at a time.

*** THIS THIS ENTIRELY. I mean I have asked for recs and some of [okay to be honest, most] there were either bad or off point but at least I reply! D:

It's not so much as being overwhelmed it's the fact when you get a review, a nice long review and you reply but get no response back. Then feel like an asshole when you don't reply to 'plz update' comments because you don't think it's worth the effort. It's a little catch-22.

**** I feel like the first part of that, not getting a reply back, is probably due to the fact that iirc you can't see the original review without looking through the whole reviews page. So you're reading a message, often days later, where you have no idea what you said originally, and it's kinda annoying. I really don't like the whole review/pm system, but then again there are a lot of more important things I find wrong with FFNet than just that.

As to the second, I think if you review like that, you're not really expecting a reply and in fact don't understand the point of reviews anyway. It's way more of a dick thing to post replies like that than it is to not reply to those reviews.

I'm not really the type to have long conversations with the authors I've reviewed. Usually goes *review* -> "Thanks" -> "You're welcome". Even when I ask questions it's more likely to be *ask question* -> *get answer* -> "Thanks" and nothing else.

***** Well a good amount, me included, reply to reviews right away. Ffnet sends you a copy of the review in your email (if enabled) and the link you reply with. That, imo, is one of the few things they get right. Longer conversation strings move to pm which is threaded. AO3 has threaded comment strings as well. The shittiest comment system is affnet tbh.

I just have high expectations for reviewers I guess. My first fandom lead to people who I can have long conversations with over fict. HP is making me think it's a lost art now. :(

****** It's an issue of scale I think. With 700k HPfics on FFnet there's an audience at least in the tens of millions. If even one percent of people review and one percent of those aren't what you'd consider proper reviewers, you're still getting thousands of bad reviews. That's not the case in almost any other fandom. Naruto (368k), Twilight (217k), and Glee (106k) come close but as you see they're all close to half or less and that's only on FFnet and not including XOs. While there are other sites for fanfiction in those fandoms (and others, such as My Little Pony which has a different kind of community), they still pale in comparison to the huge number of Harry Potter fanfiction sites.

** The thing about people is that their all different. Reviewers are the same. Sometimes you'll get a person who'll want to talk to you forever about your fics. However most of the time a reviewer is just a person in a good mood and decides to share their joy, or the exact opposite and spreading their hate. I like to reply to the people who spend time on their review, I leave the "Cant wait till the next upload!!! :):)" because while its nice its not all that constructive or useful to me to chase up.

** I respond to most reviews, and the amount of effort I put into my response is directly proportional to the amount of effort the other person put into their review. If you say something bland, I just say "Thanks!" If you're a bit more specific, I might say something like "Thanks! I really worked hard to make her realistic." If you have a question or something, I answer it. And occasionally I'll get into an actual conversation with someone, which is fun.

When I receive replies to my reviews on other people's stories, I don't respond to them unless I have something meaningful to say.

***** It's a bit two fold. I mean yes I get questions like the one you mentioned but mine is more of a 'so why is Draco enamoured with the Dark Lord?' and it's more than a simple one word answer which [usually] leaves to a conversation. But when there is no reply, it feels..stilted. If that makes any sense.

Granted if it's a simple question like you said then no, I don't expect a reply, really. Like I said I am more used to like indepth reviews that go on for a bit and lead to a conversation. I like discussion. Hell, it's the only reason I bother with reddit for the moment.

Ignore them! I've had great conversations with authors before and as a writer, there is nothing I love more than replying to reviews -- even critical and negative ones.

Unless the review is literally just "thanks update soon!" I'll try to say something in reply, even if it is just a single sentence acknowledging their specific comment, plus a "thanks for reading and reviewing". I've had many GREAT conversations with readers after answering questions in their reviews and they certainly seemed to enjoy the back and forth. I get at least a 20% response rate to my review replies to readers. Virtually everyone replies after I answer a question, even if only with a "thanks!".

I've become a better writer because of a few readers explaining to me why a particular thing didn't work for them, or how they initially reacted to something I'd written that wasn't working the way I thought it would.

Unless you have some sort of complicated SEO thing going on with your profile, there is no reason to post to an online archive, like AO3 or fanfiction.net, if you don't want to read reviews and interact with readers.

*** I just seem to attract the negative nellies on this subreddit. :(

I too love reviews that tell me that they didn't understand something or they want to know why I wrote what I did and I reply right away to those. I mean I like to write what I like and I know not everyone likes what I like but if I am clear enough on why I like that thing, then I convert someone into liking it too. I can't do that if I am in the middle of a circlejerk of people who already like it or everyone ignores it because they don't understand.

It's an odd wanting to be honest. I want indepth reviews/critique but I wouldn't post it on a real writing site because they nitpick about the dumbest things but the usual fandom places they are just happy someone posted something thus they leave shallow comments.

Then there is the point of my post where someone leaves a really juicy comment with questions and I reply....then nothiong. /sits in corner.

^{THIS} ENTIRELY. It just baffles me when people go that they hate comments but really if you wanted just the pageviews post it somewhere like Deviantart and turn off the comments or on somewhere like Tumblr or something that doesn't even have real comments. Fandom will find it and if you scared it won't, post it on reddit and watch the traffic roll in. /rant

*** Why post on fanfiction archives then?? Just get a blog and turn off commenting.

But really writers like you are the other end of the problem. If you write just to write, cool but when say a noob reader stumbles upon your work, likes it and wants to comment and gets such a cold reaction, making them think that comments are neither wanted nor appreciated elsewhere. They don't comment where comments are wanted making the writers who do want commentary to become a bit more jaded and stop responding to comments. Thus the vicious cycle continues.

... Okay that was a bit much but I hope you get the gist. Instead of being a huge cynic about the system, just go somewhere the system isn't required.

I'm not giving a cold reaction. I am giving no reaction. Giving a cold reaction would require responding to them.

I have written a handful of comments about stories I have read, and I have never gotten a reply. That has caused me exactly zero seconds of uncertainty, self-doubt, or nervousness. I have not waited for the next inbox refresh with bated breath. I'm a healthy and well-adjusted person despite not having received review replies.

***** The way you presented your thoughts with such disdain for something that I think is a great part of fandom rubs me the wrong way. I mean, what's the point of being in a fandom by producing material when you aren't joining the conversation? It's like going to a party just to sneer at everyone having a good time. (Snape comes to mind as I write this)

Anyway that said, you can receive traffic from places other than ffnet. The right tags on Tumblr, WordPress, etc can pull ffnet traffic if not more. I used to get a buttton of traffic on WordPress when I used to post there with little to no commentary and that's with comments turned on.

And finally, I write for different reasons. Fanfiction or really writing in general, is how I make conversation and friends online. I am shy irl but online, when I can confidently contribute, I like talking to people. Otherwise I just lurk. Sorry you don't seem to share the same values but different strokes/folks.

I don't write A/N unless it's something the readers MUST know like I am going on a long hiatus/deleting the story/moving/etc. As much as I like writer's commentary since I am the kind that love watching the behind the scenes/director's commentary part of movies/TV, there are yet and still many who don't like reading that so I just post it separately elsewhere and link it in the A/N.

As to your "real" question, it's tough to carry a conversation on the internet. It takes a bunch of effort to make sure you say what you're actually meaning to say in a clear manner. So hard to do when you can't see or hear them. You have to think about how they're reading it. Will they take something you say sarcastically as meant to be mean? And so on. I would guess the reason people drop conversations with reviewers is because it is just too much work for too little output. They have other things to do and spend their time on also.
