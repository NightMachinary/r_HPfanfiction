I'm writing a marauders fanfic and I'd like to know what people are interested in seeing from it


** Personally, I hate when James and Lily are written like rivals who later fall in love. It's usually Lily being rude to James more than anything. People try to write her as sassy and strong but she just comes off as pretentious and plain annoying. I hope this trend dies.

*** The way I was going to play this romance was at first it's playful and they both enjoy it but James takes it too far when he bullies Snape and that's when lily kinda draws the line and when James starts maturing and leaving Snape alone it becomes playful again. Is this kinda what you mean ?

**** The time when Lily defends Severus is not what I meant by her being rude to James. That time is the only time when she's potrayed as strong without being annoying (not counting her sacrifice). What you desribed is how their relationship should actually be, playful. But people cross the line (for me at least) when Lily randomly throws a jinx at James just because he said something people /think/ Lily would not like. There are many examples of this but I'd rather not get into it.

** I would like to see Peter perfectly integrated in the Marauder's group. Because no one had actually suspected him before his treason. He is a Marauder as well as the other four or he plays the part extremely well. He is supposed to also be as brillant as them, especially together. Not just the cowardly follower we get to see sometimes in marauders fic.

*** Yes, I was just thinking of this earlier today! He's always, absolutely always portrayed as being a follower, pathetic, weak, etc. you know the drill. However, considering how the Marauder's group appeared to love teasing Snape, if they didn't like Peter or thought of him as lesser I'm sure they damn well would've let him know. I don't necessarily want to see him painted in good light, but I just want to see a character that isn't dragged through the mud because of his actions as an adult.

** My main gripe with marauder era fic is that they can feel very slice of life, which can be fun until you're 20 chapters in and realise anything has yet to happen. Give us a goal to look forward to that isn't Harry's birth. And play with the charachter, don't just make them their fanon selves. There is nothing inthe books forcing James to become an Auror.

** I wait with baited breath, for something similar to, To the Stars.

There is so much potential there.

** If you're writing any kind of fic, please don't have Sirius or James - two wizards who were widely considered one of the most talented of their generation - struggle with common spells, or use stunning spells or body bind curses or other useless first year spells in fights.

Actually, if you're writing fight scenes with Death Eaters, just avoid shit spells like stupefy or expelliarmus, period.

Please. James and Sirius are prodigiously talented, they'd use everything in their arsenal, not first year shit like Harry does. Also, don't limit spells to just Defence spells - Transfiguration and Charms, when they're applied inside fights make for very, very good fight scenes (think Dumbledore vs Voldemort in OotP).

** I enjoy fics where Remus is portrayed in a sightly better light than James and Sirius. James usually appears the leader of the group, and it's commonly known that Sirius loved pranks, but where does Remus stand in that? I enjoy reading fics where Remus isnt exactly comfortable with the extent of the pranks and teasing, and more followed along because he genuinely enjoys his friends company, of course. Also, try to show multiple sides of James. He's often portrayed as an asshole, and if you're going to go for this, at least show reason and develop him so that the readers can understand his actions.

**** She could be someone that puts too much emphasis on first impressions, and then barely ever tries to look past it.

It somewhat has a basis in canon. Like how she was friends with Snape till their fifth year even though there is clear evidence that Snape was going bad long before that.

** More AU's focused on the characters would be interesting imo.

First idea: Sirius really did betray the Potters. Though it'd be interesting if it was by force, because he was tortured.

Second idea: Snape sorted into another house outside of Slytherin.

Third Idea: Remus not sorted in Gryffindor.

Fourth Idea: Sirius was the one bitten by a Werewolf, not Remus.

Fifth Idea: Regulus ends up living and goes the spy route,

Sixth idea: Lily ends up living, but something inside of her was broken.

More stories in general that have Peter focused in the story more. He was a friend of the Marauder's, he was a part of it, the betrayal hurt so much because he was their friend, and yet so many have him having detentions, or in the library ignoring the others or whatever.

** Well i love the few fics that portrays Snape as a friend of the Marauders (After some plot development) and his personality even after him becoming really close to James, Sirius and Remus, he's just a tsudere, that is always bickering with them, with bad mood and trowing insults, but deep inside they're his best friends.\\
It would also be an impulse to him join the death eaters, he decides to become the spy to protect the marauders and lily.
