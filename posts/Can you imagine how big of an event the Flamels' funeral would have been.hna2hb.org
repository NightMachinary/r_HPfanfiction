Like, at least every Beauxbâtons students, alumni or anyone who had any connection to the school would have been there. Then, there would be everyone who was a descendant of the couple (if they ever had children). Probably every alchemist would also have attended to pay respects to the best of them all. Albus Dumbledore, among the couple's still living apprentices, would also have been there. That would have been the largest wizarding event in a really long time.


** Alternatively, they were the type of people to want a small discreet funeral attended by the few people who truly knew them. It's not like the funeral is guaranteed to be massive.

** I would have loved to see the conversations where people told others that Nicolas Flamel died of old age. I like to imagine it to become some sort of adage in the future like....”even Nicolas Flamel died from old age.”

** I always just imagined the funeral being a smallish event where most of the mourners are close friends or high level officials that couldn't be kept away and the flamels just chilling in the background in disguise enjoying the show until dumbledore spots them towards the end of his eulogy and after finishing quickly drags them away because the whole point in “destroying the stone” was so that they weren't in danger anymore and they show up to their own funeral
