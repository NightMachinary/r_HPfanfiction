I just started reading a promising fic. It is a long fic. It has several reviews and follows.

I couldn't get past the first chapter. The author used 'your' instead of 'you're'.

What would you do in such situations?


** No one knows you just stopped reading so it's not rude.

Thanks.

** I don't think it's rude. Poor grasp of spelling and grammar can often be hints of worse things to come. You aren't obligated to read anything for any reason. That said, are we talking one mistake or repeated mistakes throughout the first chapter? If it was only once, maybe it was just a simple error. Sometimes even the best writers make typos.

*** Honestly the 'your' and 'you're' error is generally not a typo.

I noticed only one mistake and instinctively just closed the fic.

** Each person gets to decide which fics they want to read. If they don't like it, they don't need to read it. It isn't rude to stop reading a fic for any reason. It's just a personal choice.

That doesn't mean you can go commenting rude things and such, but you don't need a reason to stop reading something. You might miss out on some good novels though.

** I stopped a fic on its first chapter today, because the author placed an author's note smack bang in the middle of a chapter to let the reader know that there will be quotes from both HPDH and the movie.

I was like nah...

It's not rude at all, unless you left a flame review.

** If the fic has a good plot, I just autocorrect in my head. It's usually not hard to figure out which one they meant.

But to each their own.

*** My problem with autocorrect is that I noticed my quality of language and grammar declined greatly once i started reading wattpad stories.

The grammar there is appalling sometimes. I kept reading and i started to notice the my sentence structure was becoming more skewed. My grammar was more confused. And my spellings went for a toss.

My pet peeve, since then, is that if a story has grammatical errors, I dont auto correct.

** Most fanfics would be a far more pleasant read if there was a script to autocorrect the most annoying mistakes.

If a fanfic has enough noticeable errors that it's taking you out of the reading, honestly just drop it - it's not like the author notices that you stopped reading, unless you comment.

I personally cringe at "should of" or any variation of that mistake - It's my number one reason to drop a fic if I see it too many times.

**** "Should /have/" is the correct version - as in "I should have been more careful", "he should have arrived by now, what's wrong?", et cetera. If you /must/ use a contraction, it's "should've" - but in this specific case it's more common and easier-to-read to just use the full words, so keep the contraction for accents in dialogue.

"Should of" is what happens when the author /doesn't/ know how to use contractions.

I can read through some pretty atroshiss speeling and grahammer as long as I'm feeling the story. Decent pacing, entertaining plot, and a bit of length and it doesn't effect me at all.

** One very important thing that people fail to grasp in the world of FanFiction is that you don't owe anything to the author and the author doesn't owe anything to you. You can read whatever you want, and they can write whatever they want. So, no, I don't think it's rude.

Choppy prose seems to be the most common reason for me to facepalm though.

** It's a good idea to remember that a lot of people have English as a second language and that spelling mistakes can come from the fact that these words sound the same even if they aren't spelled the same. Personally, I don't think it's rude to just stop reading, but it is a good idea to be considerate about the fact someone put their time and effort into making something and posting it. But as long as you don't leave a nasty comment I don't think it matters too much though.

*** I agree, I stopped reading some fan fictions because the author kept messing up a name like Hermonie, another thing that annoys me are people that write occulmency instead of occulmency, it disrupts the flow for me similar to spelling errors.

That said commenting is... Eh. While it is a valid reason but it might seem petty "nice story, but the your you're mistakes a horrible".

** I think it's rude and inconsiderate to fail to proofread one's fics before (or shortly after) posting them.

I am not saying that anything that gets posted should be completely error-free, but when a modicum of effort could have eliminated a persistent annoyance like what the OP describes, what else am I to think?

** That... would honestly annoy me to hell and back as well, but if you're not involved with the story and don't comment on it, I'd say leave it? Nothing rude about that whatsoever.

Poor grammar and abundant typos usually either show you that the author is young or learned English as a second or third language. Alternatively, the author may be dyslexic though this is oftentimes mentioned in the authors bio or in fic description or first chapter.

I know that there are people on ffn who read fics, fix up the chapters and send them back to the author with errors marked out and corrections but I also know that there are few of them and they're not always appreciated.
