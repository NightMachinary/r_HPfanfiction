:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
2 years ago I asked this group to help me find a story. And you came through in a huge way. I was going back to read it again only to find out my Harry Potter bookmarks have been removed(possibly by my Twilight loving wife ðŸ˜‚).

All I had is HPATROTP in my notes on my phone. The story has Harry returning to the Dursley's and hitting himself with an AvadaK. He manages to survive with another scar and then finds out Dumbledore did the same thing.

Please help me. Please.


** I tried investigating the link from your post history, and [[https://www.wattpad.com/216527-harry-potter-and-the-rise-of-the-phoenix-part-1][I found a story that looks like it could be the right one]] ([[https://www.wattpad.com/216529-harry-potter-rise-of-the-phoenix-part-2][part 2]]).

*** Yeah I found rise of the Phoenix too and I have it's original link. I assumed rites of passage was the fic wanted but I'll link it anyway as well.

** What is wrong with your wife? I mean, it's not like there are a finite number of bookmarks you're allowed.

Sounds like some passive-aggressive shit to me.

** Judging by your post history I'm guessing it's this....

****** Welp. Unless you used another website I'm pretty sure it's gone. Unless you can find the author's email or another way to contact them.

I found the exact link for it but Wayback doesn't have it archived. All the links to it are null and void, and it wasn't one of the fics archived at ao3. But you can try contacting the archivers because there's a chance they just never got around to it.

I believe this was the link.
