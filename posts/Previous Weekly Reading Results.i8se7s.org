Can previous weekly what are you reading posts be changed out of contest mode so we can see the results? If some of them have high scores they may get given a chance by some people who didn't like the description.


** What does contest mode mean? I've not heard about this.

** I assume the point of the contest mode is to give everyone's tastes an equal voice.

Disabling it will basically just continue to emphasize the tendencies of this sub, which leans heavily towards a couple styles of fanfic and away from many others.

*** I disagree. Contest mode, after a week, will have ensured that all fics are given equal consideration, without any bias when it comes to time of post.

After a week, when people have already voted, it would be incredibly helpful to see the most popular suggestions. At the very least, it would sort the comments in some semblance of order.
