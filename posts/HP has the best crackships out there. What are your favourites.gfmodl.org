Whether it's Dobby/Harry's Sock, Hogwarts Castle/Shrieking Shack, or Petunia/Florian Fortescue, Harry Potter fics manage to have the most delightful collection of crackships out there and I want to know what other people love from the fics they've found.


** Omg I found a Trevor/Umbridge that was well written and hysterical. Trevor thought Umbridge was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, used magic to turn into a human, but then decided to turn her into a toad. They lived happily ever after.

(Not sure how to link fics but it was called And Who But My Lady Greensleeves by Andante825 on ao3)

Edit: fixed typo in the fic name

Keep in mind it's Harry raised by deadpool, so that's some of the milder crack.

** I saw one of Harry/Whomping Willow. The grammar was atrocious and made me choke on nothing.

"Depressed after sirius escape, harry stroles the school grounds at night, when he is cought by the whomping willow, which decides to have its wicked way with him."

"Harry was once again falling into deprecion."

Also, strangely, the first time I read it it was in third person, but now it's first person.

I've seen one fanfic tagged Lockhart/Stupidity but I'm not sure whether I should take that literally.

I'm also reasonably sure I've seen fics where Fleur wasn't exactly /attacked/ by those Grindylow in the lake, if you know what I mean.
