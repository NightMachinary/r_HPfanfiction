After reading and enjoying quite a few fics like Northumbrian's series, Grow Young with Me, and the ones in California with the school. I've been interested in some more liked that. But considering the huge number of Harry/Ginny fics out there I figured I'd ask the community for some help.

It doesn't have to be fully epilogue complaint, so if Ron and Hermione don't work out, or whatever, it doesn't bother me. But I would like it to stay Harry/Ginny, or at least like GYwM show a loving relationship between the two of them.

  It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries.

** This one is mine. Sadly (for me) it's not a particularly popular story but it does seem to meet your criteria. It's an Auror Harry story set in 2009 and it's generally canon compliant. I do use several OC side characters. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic]]
