It would make for an interesting love story, I think.

I would think it would be kind of weird if he actively sought out these women but if they seemed to gravitate to him, finding him somehow.... Like it's thousand years in the future, Humanity is spread across the cosmos and Harry is on a planet, refueling or raiding it because he decided to become a space pirate. And the woman he kidnaps turns out to be the reincarnation(Soul, not appearance or temperament) of his first wife. And once she's ransomed back, she seeks him out or something. I dunno, the kidnapping introduces some squick, I was channeling the princess bride there for a second I think.

ANYWAY, any reincarnation stories like this out there?


** It's hilarious that people can make extremely specific requests like these and about half the time someone has something that fits the bill. Jesus, there's a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction.

*** Go over to FF.net sometime and check out all the HP Crossover stories, especially the ones with only one or two stories. Some of the most random crossovers like 7th Heaven, The Princess Diaries, and Freakazoid, to name a few.

**** That freakazoid one is brilliant. I just wish the Power-He-Knew-Not was the power to *FREAKOUT*!

**** Haha, just finished writing an HP crossover where the count is currently at 4. (First HP fic, too.)

The first HP fanfic I ever read was a Harry Potter/Boy Meets World crossover based around the episode where the kids get stuck in the school with a killer. At the time I thought it was the funniest thing in existence. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2662032/1/Detention][Detention]]

**** I'm mostly sure I've read everything worth reading in Hp fanfiction. I just look up "Published in the last month" at the beginning of every month and pick out the ones with some promise.

That being said, I may have missed some things. I'd love for that "The Princess Diaries" one to be good.

***** I'm not saying any of it is /good/. Let's be honest. Most ff is crap. Its just that there are enough random crossovers available that I think a dartboard and a blindfold was involved with some of them...

****** Hah! My personal favorite story is a Bleach/Highschool DxD crossover. I guess it's something you'd expect, but the difficulty of getting the two backgrounds meshed together without defaulting to getting sucked into a dimensional port seems to be a high barrier for entry.

Well done DxD crossovers are my shit though, so I might be a little biased. I hate the shit out of the anime, but the world it's in is so fucking cool. It's the same thing with Naruto now that I'm thinking about it.

******* Yeeeeesssss!

Issei is such a stupid fuckhead that it just ruins the show for me.

The idea behind it is so great, though. I'd love to see a legitimately serious take on it.

** So will he be grooming her or does she actually get the option not to associate with him? Because that's what these fics generally end up like - incredibly creepy and disturbing.
