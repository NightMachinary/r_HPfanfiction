I tried accessing the site earlier and all it says is the account has been suspended. Anyone knows what's up? Is it the whole site of just my own account?

If it's really down, where do you guys recommend I get my DMHG fix? Thank you!


** @hawthorn_vine posted this on their twitter: "Hey all, we're currently having technical issues and aren't sure when we'll be back up, but we're working on it! Thanks for your patience." So it should be back soon! #yay

*** Awesome! I like reading from the site because it isn't much of a hassle to find specific fics. Thanks!

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

**** In the way of these things, the new works are largely coalescing around the major platforms with bigger audiences so less and less traffic seek out the smaller sites. The fandom becomes more consolidated.

** It does not work for me either! Does anyone know how to get access to the fanfics now? Some authors (for example everythursday with "The Fallout" (which I would highly recommend if we could read it)) only posted their stories on dramione.org. If anyone knows a way please share it :) It would be a shame if all those stories disappeared forever!

*** Don't worry. Her stories will never disappear. Several people, me included, have downloaded and saved all her works. If Dramione.org ever goes down for good, a quick google search should provide you with a download link.

****** Hi! you said you have copies of all her works? Can you please give me a copy of it? Do you have the copy of Creatures of the Wind it's so hard to find a copy of this? I just found out dramione.org was down and now I'm freaking out!! I don't know where to start looking for fics especially the not so popular ones.

And for Creatures, ask this person. They have the file, but will only give it if you ask via PM. If you don't have a Tumblr I can ask for you, but yeah: [[http://lostdhrfics.tumblr.com]]

**** I know this was a while ago, but I was wondering if you might share the rest of her work as well? Never reading something that great without saving a backup in the future! Would be a total life saver! :')
