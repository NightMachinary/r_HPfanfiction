** Edit: Also, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6pgrhw/what_are_some_things_in_fanfiction_that_have_been/dkpeu41/][look another pet peeves thread]]!

--------------

Actually, I completely disagree. While CinemaSins is fun if you watch a few videos, I found it got boring rather fast. And I don't think FanFiction is lacking in petty reviews that nitpick minor details that the reviewer dislikes.

If you want to make something great, make [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL8h3ri2WN_-IbviBlWtUcQ][FanfictionWins]], that instead tells you what a story did well.

It shows what authors did great and actually provokes thought, brings attention to well-done details that you might have not notices and beautifully analyzes structures and plot.

But hey, if you want you could also make petty CinemaSins-style reviews. This is especially good for FanFiction as it isn't made by corporations and professionals who earn millions of dollars, but some individuals who had fun in their free time and decided to share it with you. This sure makes you the better person!

--------------

And no, I'm not saying 'negative reviews are bad' or should be disallowed. But making something dedicated to make fun of amateur authors is in my opinion wrong and petty.

*** Well, I think that it could be a good thread, but only if we require the sins to be written out in King James Bible style prose. For example,

- If an author writeth a Headmaster who doth manipulate, yet is incompetent, he hath committed an abomination: he shall surely be put to scorn; his tears shall be upon him.
- Thou shalt not make unto thee any magical core, or any likeness of any thing that acteth like a magical battery, nor arbitrary power differentials between characters.

** I might be being rather harsh, but absolutely not. We do not need even a /chance/ of having another Critics United. They purged FFN of tens of thousands of stories once already. We don't need this happening again. I don't care whether it's a good or bad story, even the most /minuscule/ chance of a "cleanup" happening is unacceptable.

Of course, if you do not lose sight of your intended vision - of humorous criticism, than I can support such a thing to a degree.

**** Good.

Sorry if my last post sounded rude, but Critics United makes me enraged just by /thinking/ of them. I'm just worried that you (and anyone also doing this) might some day lose sight of your original goal, and go off the deep end. The average Critics United review was exceedingly pompous, forceful, and arrogant sounding. It's like all of the world's stereotypical cliche Percy Weasleys decided to band together and be one.

Thanks for reminding me of this minuscule detail. /s

There is a fine line between explaining something so that readers remember it from canon, or explaining something that is either fanon or AU, but beyond that line there is stuff like this that makes me wonder if the author knows where the hell he's posting.

- Explaining your fanon preference in the story.

- Shopping trips with no other value than to equip your protagonist with shopping bags full of deus ex machina and leather trousers.

What about in the author notes? When writers write in an AU, I prefer that they document it explicitly.

*** I disagree, while is true that a fanfiction is based on canon, if well written it should be able to be it's own story. If something that happens in Canon also happens in the fanfic it should be rewritten in the Fic to give continuity in the story.

Edit: a reader can skipp the 'canon part' if they don't want to reread, but if they don't remember something they shouldn't be confused because the author didn't write something that was part of the story.

***** What if you've got light divergence from the beginning or even pre-canon. But the main divergence isn't till later in the books?

I know that there's plenty that do that and just summarise a bit in the first chapter and reveal more as the story progress, but part of me feels like that's cheating. But on the other hand, those stories at least doesn't get boring or get bogged down with 500K extra words that are as good as useless.

******* I was meaning more like something that will change some canon events but most things will stay the same, at least in broad strokes.

So still a philosphers stone, still a bassilisk that terrorised Hogwarts, Sirius still escaping, still dementors at Hogwarts, still a fuck up at the end of third year, still a Death Eater attack at the World Cup and still a plot to kidnap and kill Harry using the Triwizard tournament.

But beyond that the journey between those points may be notably different at points. It just seems pointless to go over it all when the 'main story' would start after that point from whence the story will be notably different from canon.

******* I don't think that only mentioning the changes when the main divergence occurs is always the best solution. Sometimes if you're writing a butterfly-effect sort of story, minor details in the beginning are going to turn out to be highly important later. E.g. suppose that the companionship of Harry's pet snake in first year triggers a series of changes to his personality, causing him to handle the heir of Slytherin business in a very OC way. In this case, the fun in the story is for readers to watch how the nearly unnoticable changes in first year slowly stack up and be surprised when they fall into place.

Readers who miss the details might leave because they think you're just "rehashing canon", but the ones who stay will be happy. It's similar to why a lot of detective stories force you to read through chapters upon chapters of small talks and ordinary stuff before the murder even happens.

Meanwhile, if you instead skip first year and simply say that Harry got a pet snake in first year, you might get complaints for "badly attempting to justify Harry acting like an OC".

** I hate when muggleborns are sorted into Slytherin and no one bats an eye. Slytherin didn't want to teach muggleborns at all, he would have trained the hat not to sort them into his house. And even if by a fluke one still ended up there, it would create quite a stir or the poor kid would have to hide it or have 7 years of constantly watching his/her back.

I know people want good Slytherins, but even if its set decades after HP and everyone has mellowed a lot, that hat still has 1000 year old prejudice programmed in it.

*** Yes and no. Slytherin did abandon the Hogwarts project part way through, so we don't know if he had any hand in programming the Hat.

On the other hand, as a fan of Slytherin!Hermione fic, I second the rest of this: if you're going to put Hermione in there, don't cop out with the "revelation" that Slytherins are actually more accepting than Hufflepuffs (and Gryffindors are the ones slinging around "Mudblood"), with Draco suddenly deciding to be her friend and protector, or with Hermione suddenly discovering that she is a pureblood.

Actually deal with the fact that she is sleeping in the same room as children of unrepentant Death Eaters who are all too eager to follow in their parents' footsteps. Actually deal with the fact that Slytherin tends to attract selfish, not-nice kids. Let Hermione's own talent, hard work, and her own brand of viciousness shine!

**** Its been outright stated by Rowling that the hat "literally contains the intelligence of the four founders" (source JK Rowling writing on Pottermore: [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-sorting-hat]]) and the canon fourth year song said "The founders put some brains in me, So I could choose instead!" so I think its a pretty safe assumption Slytherin was involved.

Having said that, it's fanfiction so if something in canon needs to be hand waved, as long as the rest of the story makes sense I think its pretty easy to forgive especially if they're willing to address the other consequences as you've said.

***** Good catch! I didn't know about that.

On the other hand, Rowling had also planned to put Mafalda --- a daughter of a Squib and a Muggle --- into Slytherin, only writing her out because she couldn't make the character work logistically.

Also, Slytherin is only one of four votes, and he'd been outvoted on Muggleborns before. Here's how Hermione's sorting might go:

*Helga Aspect:* Too domineering for Hufflepuff. I vote for Ravenclaw.

*Rowena Aspect:* Too goal-oriented for me. Gryffindor or Slytherin.

*Helga Aspect:* Gryffindor or Slytherin sounds fine. That vicious streak would serve her well in Slytherin, actually...

*Salazar Aspect:* A Mudblood in my House? How dare you even suggest that?!

*Helga Aspect:* You know what? I've had just about enough of your racism. I vote Slytherin. Your house could use some fresh blood. Who's with me?!

*Salazar Aspect:* This is ridiculous. Godric, take your Mudblood and go. We know she wants to be in your House.

*Godric Aspect:* Actually, Sal, I think you need a lesson. Slytherin.

*Salazar Aspect:* Veto! You need 3 of 4 to override, and there's no way Rowenna...

*Rowena Aspect:* You know, I never did get you back for not telling me that Baron Whatshisface was prone to murderous raging /before/ I sent him to track down my daughter.

*Salazar Aspect:* F#$%.

*Hermione:* Don't I get a say in this?

*All aspects:* NO!
