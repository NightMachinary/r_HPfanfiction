Bellatrix was arrested after the DL fell, meaning hers and the marks of many others would be far less visible by then.

1) The ministry and Wizarding Britain is completely retarded, didn't stripsearch the Death Eaters they incarcerated after the war and didn't ask any pertinent questions under Veritaserum to anyone (this is actually quite plausible, considering that Sirius has been locked up)

**** From book 4

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort bent down, and pulled out Wormtail's left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail's robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo -- a skull, with a snake protruding from its mouth -- the same image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail's uncontrollable weeping.

  ‘It is back,' he said softly, ‘they will all have noticed it ... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...' He pressed his long, white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail's arm.

  The scar on Harry's forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl: Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail's Mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black.

  Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.

  “There,” said Snape harshly. “There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff s too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord's vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.

I always imagined that it burns black when summoned, and fades away afterwards. It being bright red on Wormtail after Voldemort regained his body would be down to it reawakening as he grew stronger throughout GoF.

*** From the context in canon, I think they had basically faded away after Voldemort's body died in '81. During GoF, they were coming back, peaking just after Voldemort regained his body. Then he Summoned the Death Eaters, and it burned black.

Presumably, when not being actively summoned, they fade entirely, otherwise they'd be something of a dead giveaway given that every wizard knows what the dark mark looks like. Even if their existence on Death Eaters isn't known, having the Dark Mark tattooed would raise a red flag.

** Yeah, I always assumed the Dark Mark business only got revealed near the end or after the end of the first war. It doesn't seem like something Voldemort would want people to know about.

In my story, I'm thinking of having Voldemort create the mark on another part of the body once he gets resurrected, since many would know about it by that point. That way, new Death Eaters wouldn't get found out so easily.

*** So like a Death Eater tramp stamp? :D

Just kidding, there are a few places where the tattoo could go that wouldn't be weird, like the chest (the allegory to the dark mark replacing the heart could be made). But I still think having the dark mark on the hand is a good choice, you could simply have it not appear unless certain requirements are met, like the Death Eater forcing it to appear or a summons from Voldemort. Maybe only those who carry the mark can see it, like only those who have witnessed death can see Thestrals. Kind of how the writings on the One Ring in LOTR faded away and only appeared when cast into a fire.

Something to think about, but I'm confident you will do it justice.

** In addition, I imagine the Dark Mark has powers we have not been told of. We know that it can be used for communication between Voldemort and his Death Eaters (to inform them of the apparition destination) and between Death Eaters themselves (Snape and Alecto, DH). We know that Voldemort has special means of finding his Death Eaters, presumably through the Mark. And in HBP, it is hinted that the mark allows them to ignore certain spell barriers and curses too:

#+begin_quote
  “I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn't there,” said Lupin. “I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville...”

  “He must have known a spell we didn't,” whispered McGonagall. “After all --- he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who'd escaped up to the tower...”

  “He was,” said Harry savagely, “but to help them, not to stop them... *and I'll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier* --- so what happened when he came back down?”

** The only way the Dark Mark can work is if it isn't visible at all times. Whether wizardom knows about the Dark Mark on Death Eaters, they definitely know the symbol. Seeing that on someone's forearm is going to raise red flags.

Snape even tells us as much when he shows the Mark to Fudge. He says it's faded since the Summoning, but it's still visible. Presumably, given more time, it'd fade completely until the next Summoning.

Oh right and in the early 80's Sirius was already arrested and the Potters were already dead. That stuff happened in '80 or '81 I'm pretty sure lol. So they weren't looking for the spy because they assumed it was Sirius. Although that doesn't explain why they didn't use the Mark after the war ended. I assume Riddle marked some non death eaters so that his followers could say they were imperiused if they were caught.

** The Dark Mark was meant to be a sign that the person who has it is a member of Voldemort's inner circle and is trusted far above the rank and file Death Eaters. So only really important members like Lucius Malfoy, Bellatrix LeStrange, Augustus Rookwood e.t.c. should have them.

So many fics get this wrong, the writer giving the Dark Mark to every Death Eater, even the freshly recruited grunts.
