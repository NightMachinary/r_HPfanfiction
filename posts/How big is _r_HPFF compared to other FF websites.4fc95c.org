Titles says pretty much all, was just wondering if HPFF is one of the bigger HPFFs sites.


** It's one of the few ones that are still active, but still much smaller than a lot of sites were back in the HP heyday. Here's hoping the Fantastic Beasts movie will bring in a load of fresh blood (and maybe some old blood too).

*** Yes hopefully. I'm looking forward to the film, you?

*** I love the idea of possibly bringing back some of the already established writers and reinspiring some of the incomplete stories to be completed. I just hope the movie can bring back some people's muse

*** That's not too bad right. Do you want to see the sub get a lot bigger? Or do you like the way it is now.

A lot? No, not really. Big subs tend to be impersonal and full of trolls and people trying to farm karma.

** It's pretty much the only thing left, apart from DLP. HPFF.com is completely falling apart, Portkey effectively no longer exists since 2010 (even though stories are still being updated), Fictionalley is full of spam, Sugar Quill is no longer being updated since 2009. SIYE.co.uk (Harry/Ginny) is still going strong though, has been around since 2003 and it's still very popular.

But in terms of a general hub for HPFF? It's this one.

*** If Ginny gets lots of screen time in Cursed Child, SIYE will be getting another boost.

If however her character gets assassinated again, it will be game over.

**** I'm holding up hope, as I commented on another thread, the fact that JKR has published that sketch of the wands to be used in Cursed Child suggests that Ginny (and Draco) will have a major role in it.

** It's not very big, there's only a few dozen regular posters and 6-10 authors who regularly post. There about ten thousand lurkers though.
