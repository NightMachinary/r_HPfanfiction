I really really enjoy Northumbria's works and I'd like to find an author who's done a similar thing with sort of creation of their own world pre-HP or post-HP that's pretty much canon. I particularly enjoy Strangers at Drakeshaugh so any single fics like that I'd appreciate a rec for that too!


** I write canon-compliant stories that have nods/references to each other - they can be read independently, but as they're all my headcanon, they are consistent with each other. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/]]

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=144658][Slide]] has created their own world Post/Pre/During Hogwarts. Not as many short fics as Northumbrian, but a couple of long series. The style of writing is very different to Strangers of Drauksbaugh (darker tone). I would recommend [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]] before [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]] because the characters in Anguis follow on to Ignite.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3955920/HalfASlug][HalfASlug]] feels similar in tone to Northumbrian and has a large collection of short stories. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/24216/Lady-Altair][Lady Altair]] also has a collection of well written short stories, namely Cauterize.
