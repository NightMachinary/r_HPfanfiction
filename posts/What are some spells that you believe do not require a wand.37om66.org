There are spells that in various stories are performed with or without a wand. The most obvious of these is Apparition. So my question for you, is do you need a wand to Appariate? Explain your logic. And so this doesn't become a Yes no thing, what other spells do you think would not need a wand. For example, does Legilimancy require a wand? Or just eyesight?


** I think there are many ways wizards can cast magic with tools other than wands. Ollivander says in DH that wands work best, but wizards can essentially use any object to cast magic.

But I don't think you can use spells designed for wands with these other tools. They would be separate schools of magic with their own spells.

Potions, for example, uses the tools of ingredients, cauldron, heat, etc. to cast magic. You're not casting "wand spells", you're making potions.

So too with other sets of tools. A lesser example would be Divination, trying to cast magic with tea leaves, crystal ball, etc. This is clearly much less effective, but it can work if you have the innate talent.

I imagine that the Dark Arts often uses unusual and gruesome tools, which we kinda saw in Voldemort's resurrection ceremony, which was some combination of a potion and a spell (for which we might use the fanon word ritual).

I'd go so far as to suggest that all magic is essentially a ritual, which has the end result of casting a spell. The tools of the rituals change, as does the form of the resulting spell, and in modern wand magic these "rituals" are incredibly streamlined and quick, but the historical root would be there: all spells involve an external expression of intent through symbolic actions.

As for magic without any tools at all... I think this will be extremely limited. Occlumency is one such magic, and is entirely internal, which may suggest a general rule: to cast magic externally, you need external tools; internal magic does not need any such tools.

Another example of magic not needing any tools is "deep magic", such as Lily's sacrifice.

The exception would be accidental magic, which appears to have some connection to childhood, as we don't see adults doing it. Very talented wizards may be able to learn how to deliberately trigger accidental magic (Tom Riddle, Lily Evans) but it's not clear if this ability continues into adulthood or dies along with their accidental magic.

** I believe that in theory /any/ spell can be done without a wand. Kids express their accidental magic in many ways, including what seems to be Harry apparating on top of his school as a kid. This indicates that at the very least anything we've seen done accidentally /can/ be done intentionally without a wand, just it may be difficult.

We see it very very rarely in the books, excluding accidental/underage, and unless it's taught in seventh year (which we don't see), I'm thinking it's very rare to be able to successfully and consistently do it.

So yeah, I think technically they're *all* possible since we know of kids doing all sorts, and I think a wand just helps focus your power. But once your magic 'settles' and you aren't having magical outbursts anymore, it's very hard to control and do intentionally, and just take a fair bit of power. Something easy with a wand like the levitation charm suddenly requires concentration or more energy to do it without a wand.

(Apparating in canon takes deliberate focus and concentration, otherwise you kind of... Break... So I really think that would be one of the harder ones to do without a wand. But does anything in canon state that the wand has to be /in your hand/ to be used? I think Harry lighting his wand in OoTP implies not)

There, now I've got it off my chest.

*** This is not the case. In Deathly Hallows, Ron explicitly says they can't apparate out of Malfoy Manor because they don't have their wands.

How to reconcile this with the fact that we never see anyone using their wand? We know that wizards don't have to be holding their wands to use them, so it seems likely that a wizard merely needs a wand on his person to apparate -- he doesn't actively use the wand, but it has to be there.

****** The wiki states that it is unclear if a wand is needed to preform apparation. It does continue to state that a person has not been seen holding a wand while apparating.

*** Hmm. I actually didn't know that, thanks. Although that feels a little too easy. At least add some tracking methods then, or impose an apparition difficulty overhead, otherwise wizards cannot be caught unless you warded a place. I confess to dropping a few fics when I saw them mention wandless apparition, unless other wandless magic was developed properly.

**** Well anti-apparation wards are a common way to prevent easy escaping, Death Eaters and Aurors both use them. Besides, Apparation is supposed to be a tricky thing which requires intense concentration lest you splinch yourself, which is why you need a licence.

** Guys, I have done some more research in response to some comments below, and I have discovered that in terms of Apparition it is unclear as to if one needs a wand to preform it. My sources are the wiki, pottermore, and the books.

  [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wandless_spell][*>*]] Tom Riddle was able to *hurt people* and *influence animals* before he even knew of the existence of the wizarding world,[1] and Lily Evans was able to use magic *to stop herself falling* as fast as normal and also *to manipulate a flower* [...] Albus Dumbledore has only demonstrated wandless magic a couple of times in the Harry Potter books.

So I'd say that a wand's purpose is only to make casting a spell significantly easier --- either in terms of required power, concentration, or understanding. Which means that if a wizard has enough Pwr/Con/Und to basically ignore the difference, they can stop bothering themselves with getting the wand and wasting time on wand movements.

*** A handful of those Dumbledore examples are only in the movies. For example, he didn't summon the names from the cup- parchment flew out of it and he caught it each time. In the fight in the ministry, it was the animated fountain statutes that held Harry back- I just reread that fight and nothing Dumbledore did was without a wand. In HBP in the scene in the orphanage, he uses his wand to light the wardrobe.

**** Fair enough.

Here's a bit more contributing to the discussion:

- [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm][Live Chat with JKR, 2001]]:

  - Q: Do you need a Wand to do Magic??
  - A: You can do *unfocused* and uncontrolled magic without a wand (for instance when Harry blows up Aunt Marge) but to do really good spells, yes, you need a wand. --

- [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2006/0801-radiocityreading1partial.html][Q&A with JKR, 2006]]:

  - Q: Can Muggles brew potions if they follow the exact instructions and they have all the ingredients?
  - A: Well, I'd have to say no, because there is always ... there is a magical component to the potion, not just the ingredients. So, at some point you're going to have to use a wand. I been asked what would happen if a Muggle picked up a magic wand in my world. And the answer would probably be something accidental ... possibly quite violent. Because a wand, in my world, is merely a vehicle -- a vessel for what lies inside the person.

Though generally I'm against consulting external sources (even if they belong to the author).
