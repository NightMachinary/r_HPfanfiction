Hey! Just made this template sheet for my fic characters. Thought I'd share: [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/vkyfhirp7vh59ed/CharacterSheet_notYetTakenName.docx?dl=0]] Maybe it's useful to some of you.

Have a nice day! (:


** Very helpful, thanks. :) I have a general character sheet for my writing but hadn't adapted it for HP yet.
