Given what most, if not every, HP fan thinks of Cursed Child; how would you feel if another author began writing an AMAZING spin-off series to Harry Potter?

Would it really matter if JK Rowling didn't write it and/or has no or little input into the spin-off series? What if the series is consistent with the Potterverse whilst also adding on it, with great characters, worldbuilding etc.? Sure, it may be VERY different, e.g. magical folk in the Wild West, with magically-enhanced handguns; or a storyline set mainly in the mid-2080s with a much older Albus S. Potter.


** That's what fanfiction is, isn't it? Masses of people are already doing it. You're on a HP fanfiction forum so you know that.

Am I misunderstanding the question?

*** He meant an actual published book series, not fanfiction. Cursed Child isn't fanfiction, although the quality is worse than ff.

**** It will never happen while Rowling is alive. She can't help herself from poking around in it anyway, she'll never relinquish control.

But my point is this: there are hundreds of thousands of fics. Statistically there must be plenty that are at least as good as anything Rowling or anyone else could come up with. Why is there any need for an official spinoff?

***** You still don't understand. Cursed Child is a spinoff, and a useless one. There was certainly no need for that shit.

OP was asking about the possibility of any one single author partnering up and making a spinoff series with Rowling, not about every single ff being made into official published spinoffs.

****** I haven't even mentioned CC. I said there's no chance of Rowling letting anyone else write an official spinoff series, and there's no need for it anyway because there's already plenty of fanfiction to go at.

** If someone was good enough to keep the series going on, I'd welcome it. Frankly I have a very low opinion of JK Rowling even if her Harry Potter books had great world. I am thankful for that but she really should pass on the baton.

*** If you're not sarcastic and genuinely confounded, yes. She didn't write it fully and only gave the "go ahead". It's written by British playwright [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Thorne_(writer][Jack Thorne]]) based on an original story by Thorne, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tiffany][John Tiffany]], and Rowling.

** What you're describing is literally fanfiction with JKR's mark of approval for sale.

I can't see why would any fanfiction reader take issue with well written fanfiction?

** My issue with CC wasn't the writing, it was the plot going against established canon facts. I personally would like to see a rewrite of the series aimed at adult audiences - kind of a Harry Dresden feel.
