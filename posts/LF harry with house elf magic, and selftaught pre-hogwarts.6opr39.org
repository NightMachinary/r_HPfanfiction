Im looking for well written fics in good lenght (60k-100k+ preferred) where harry either is taught houseelf magic, (go go dobby!) Or where harry is not a stupid kid and realises freaky stuff keep happening around him, and teaches himself magic at an early age.

Bonus for fics where harry uses this magic to evade/bash the Dursleys, and/or drives dumbledore/Order/wizarding world mad trying to find him/make him behave

Harry abandoned by the Dursleys at a young age truly believes he's an elf and learns different kinds of magic including house elf magic.

If I remember correctly, it has a lot of this after he is found.

*** I dropped that one at the sequel.. It was funny while he was little, but later on at Hogwarts he is basically a mentally challenged kid.. He behaves like a wild monkey, at best.

**** Well, he is a feral child by that point, just one who happens to have some language skills and magic. So yeah, he kind of is mentally challenged just by fact of having limited interactions with human civilization during a big chunk of childhood.

***** The main problem I had is that they let him get away with acting like that. A mind healer/psychologist would have been great at that point, plus enforcing basic hygiene. Instead of focusing on magical education they should teach him how to be a human being.

****** wizards demonstrate no use or knowledge of psychology in canon aside from Dumbledore taking 40+ years to figure out that little Tommy cared about the +founder Birmir+ founding four while leaving a child with abusive guardians by leaving him in a basket at their doorstep with knowledge they were unsuitable guardians and keeping him there after they regain contact.

It is not unfeasible that they assume that "the wonders of magic" will "civilize" him as follows Victorian era European philosophy.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.
