** You're thinking in the right direction, but the real question is this: why is /anywhere/ under attack?

In Muggle warfare, you can want to attack a location for many reasons, but the three main ones are:

- Command and control centres. A location that has the administrative and communications infrastructure which allows you to use it as a command centre, coordinating your forces. E.g. major cities.

- Supply. A location which is key to keeping your forces supplied with food, water, fuel, ammunition, and spare parts and/or key to putting pressure on the enemy's supply of the same. E.g. oil refineries, ports, ammunition stores, etc.

- Transportation. A location which is key to transporting your forces. E.g. ports, airports, and roads, but also enemy anti-air infrastructure.

Now ask yourself: do any of these really apply to the wizarding world? Not really. The one thing that these items all have in common is /infrastructure/, but all the infrastructure a wizard needs can be held in one hand.

Wizards have no supply needs beyond food (and they are surrounded by Muggle food supplies). Wizards can transport themselves anywhere, instantly. Wizards do still need to coordinate their forces, but they don't need a specific location to do so. If one location is compromised, they can simply bug out and pick another one, which will serve just as well.

In short, wizarding warfare is far more about human resources than physical ones. The Ministry can survive losing its building, but it can't survive losing its staff.

JK Rowling actually does a very good job of recognising this fact, because in canon we don't see these pointless attacks on locations with no strategic value. Rather, Voldemort's plans all revolve around:

A) Putting his people in positions of authority, and removing enemy people from the same;

B) Acquiring/defending rare magical artefacts; and

C) Killing the enemy individuals of importance.

He only ever attacks a wizarding location for one of these three reasons. And when he does so, his forces do not linger: their focus remains on achieving their narrowly defined strategic objective, not engaging in battle. We see kidnappings, assassinations, smash-and-grab operations, and skirmishes around these, but only one major battle, which only occurred because Harry Potter needed to stay within Hogwarts in order to find the horcrux which was hidden there (reason B). If he hadn't needed that, then he would have got the hell out of dodge, and no battle of Hogwarts would have occurred.

What people perhaps get confused about is that Voldemort executes attacks on *Muggles*, the sole purpose of which is death and destruction and chaos. But when you think about it, this also serves a strategic purpose: it keeps the Ministry of Magic busy, running around playing whack-a-mole to keep the Statute of Secrecy in place. They have little energy left to fight Voldemort.

*** There is a reason to attack Hogsmeade: The Ministry has to defend it. As the only fully magical village, it's pretty much a key piece of real estate - if you claim to run Wizarding Britain, you have to hold it. Yes, individually, wizards could just leave, and don't need any location - but as a country, you can't just give up a core part of your territory to an enemy without consequences. Abandoning or losing Hogsmeade pretty much ruins the Ministry's authority over the population.

**** I'm not so sure this is a reason to /attack/ Hogsmeade though. Rather, it's a reason to want to exert control over that territory as a /result/ of your military campaign. Hogsmeade is the end, not the means.

To achieve that end, you have to break the Ministry's ability to enforce their rule there and replace it with your own rule. That means breaking (or taking over) the Ministry's capability law enforcement capability, not burning down buildings in Hogsmeade and killing its citizens.

***** It's a location the Ministry has to defend. That means it's a button you can push to make the enemy react in a predictable manner. If you attack Hogsmeade, they have to respond. Need a distraction? Want to kill Aurors? Want to make the Ministry look weak and useless? Attacking Hogsmeade will achieve it. You can feint an attack, prepare an ambush, or simply take out a building or two before the Ministry can react. And if they fortify the village, they have to stretch their forces thin elsewhere. And if they don't respond... well, that's half the war won as the magical population loses faith in the Ministry.

And, even better: Attacking Hogsmeade doesn't threaten the Statue of Secrecy. You won't risk a FBAWTF-style response from the ICW.

From a strategic and tactical point of view, Hogsmeade is one of the biggest weaknesses of the Ministry - especially in a war where ensuring that the enemy can't simply retreat from a battle through various ways of magical travel is of utmost importance.

*** In my fanfic I have Voldemort attacking a lot (Not Hogsmeade) Mainly because he's trying to break the Ministry. (It's an AU HBP Fic) Fudge has been sacked, Scrimgeour he tortured and killed. Madam Bones is acting Minister who has put strict measures of security to weed out those in the ministry that may be working for Voldemort and then placed layers of protection upon the building, screenings coming into work, only two ways in or out. Trying to make it impossible for Voldemort to gain a foothold in the ministry or even come close to it again. As you can imagine the Ministry, which has a lack of Auror's have been training people quickly from other departments and calling everyone to help. This causes a lot of carelessness, confusion, etc and with everything so strict and needing to be done it puts alot of strain.

Voldemort realizing this, knows that if he were to attack brutally over and over again at clear targets it would draw the Minister out having to disperse some of the protection around the Ministry to Wizarding/Muggle and pure Wizarding Villages, along with Hogwarts, leaving the ministry even more stretched thin. She enacts Martial Law, more attacks happening, to kill off Auror's and such, they need to be replaced. Eventually the ministry is stretched to thin, with the public in pure fear, panick and chaos, it collapses and Voldemort is finally able to get through.

Do you think that's a viable option/story/plot etc in regards to Voldemorts plan or am I way off? War strategy isn't my strong point :(

** Besides everything already mentioned, it's also one of the few HP locations that can be massacred/destroyed without any unforeseen consequences such as having relatives of protagonists and secondary characters getting caught in the crossfire unless it's plot-relevant.

It's like a fanfic arena for all-out magical battles to occur in that way. You can showcase the wonders of using fiendfyre in battle without having someone go 'whoops, I just accidentally torched Canary Wharf by mistake' or 'whoops, I just set Snape's dangerous potions supply on fire, maybe we should r-'. You can have an attack with no survivors and you don't need to have a single student or Ministry official die in the process.

In short, despite it operating as a pureblood's version of a Potemkin village, it can act as an acceptable target to fanfic authors because it's consequence-free.

In terms of canon, it'd probably the last location the Death Eaters would want to attack because there would be so very few acceptable reasons for doing so.

Apart from serving as a staging ground for mounting sieges/attacks on Hogwarts, Hogsmeade's strategic value is nigh-on zero and, what with being in spitting distance of Hogwarts, bordering on the Forbidden Forest and, what with there being no muggles anywhere nearby, being one of the few places where everyone can ignore the statute of secrecy as long as their shenanigans can't be seen from orbit, any attacking force looking to occupy the village is in for a rough ride indeed.

It probably helps its use as a fight staging ground that it has numerous famous locations mentioned in the books and the films, has some decent maps published showing its layout and generally acts as a rather nice view into what a magical settlement actually looks like. As such, destroying it is immensely satisfying to the kind of fanfic author that goes 'see that shiny? Let's smash that shiny!' when coming across something others call 'twee'.

** Short version:

Its easiest place to attack kids without assaulting Hogwarts or the Hogwarts Express.

Long version:

Let me rephrase your question: why is it always New York City under attack?

There are multiple reasons for this though.

For one, Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley are the only set large communities of wizards/witches that can be assaulted with relative ease (Hogwarts is a all-or-nothing fight if you commit, most wizards are scattered across the country and relatively isolated from muggles as well, the Ministry may be the largest gathering of collective magicals in the country). And if you want to show larger scale battles (something that would not be practical for the Death Eaters who are more of a terrorist cell style force), they need a target with larger numbers of people to fight/assault/slaughter. It raises the stakes.

Second, most fics revolve around students. Since 11-17 year olds spend 10 months of the year in Hogwarts, the only time you can have reasonable access (or show off the kids fighting skills or abilities or whatever), is if the death eaters attack on a Hogsmeade weekend. Often, this is to breakup the monotony of school routine or show the war occurring.

Third, Hogsmeade has no real defenses from what we can see in canon. Sure, wizards are generally incompetent and thus anyone with half an intellect can rise to the top, but there are no real barriers and there are probably good reasons for it. This is what you would want if you are a town filled largely with artisans, salesmen, and service providers: to lower the barriers for trade to flow. If you make it hard to access, people stop trying to go there, and now people cannot live there anymore.

For another, like New York City, it is already well fleshed out for the author and does not require a lot of extra world-building. We know of more than a dozen shops and businesses from canon, which makes showing it being attacked feel more personal than "the Death Eaters assaulted Aberystwyth" or something like that.

For the sake of argument, I wouldn't say this is a good thing.

Surely open wizarding fights in muggle areas is an advantage to Death Eaters, as it means defenders like the Ministry or the OotP cannot operate using their full capabilities (due to needing to respect the Statue of Secrecy) whilst also heaping on extra strain for the Ministry after the fight, as they'll need to cover up the fight from the muggles afterwards?

Also, why would as it often portrayed in fanfiction, Purebloods and those who value magical blood wish to burn it to the ground? If it's the only magical place in Britain, surely it would be more valuable to keep it standing.

** The exhaustive list of places that Voldemort can attack:

- Hogwarts
- Hogsmeade
- Diagon Alley
- The Ministry
- An individual house
- Muggle areas

Voldemort generally wants to attack soft targets, and authors want to depict high-impact attacks. That just leaves Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Diagon Alley is a mixture of commercial and mixed use commercial / residential buildings, so if you're looking for a more residential target, Hogsmeade is your best choice. If you want a commercial area, Hogsmeade is still a good choice.
