Young Nicholas Flamel sighed as he dumped another failed attempt at the philosophers stone into the river. " This thing is impossible to make!" he grumbled loudly and went home.

Hours later, a canary plopped down near the river to drink fron it. However, once its beak touched the water, its body burst into colorful flames. Once the flames subsided a majestic red and gold bird stood where the canary once were. It gave an exotic squak and flew away.


** Addendum: It's not just phoenixes - that's simply how the 'eternal life' of the Elixer of Life works. You just explode when you get too old and then you're a squalling infant. Nick just happened to have tested it on a couple of birds first, and they're fertile for a large chunk of their eternal lifecycle, so when they breed enough, they become an actual species.

Dumbledore: "Nicholas, my friend, I must ask you an impossible question. Are you willing to destroy-"

Nicholas, sitting next to his wife, both of whom are in diapers for /very/ different reasons: "My wife is /two,/ Albus, and I'm in my eighties. We got desynchronized at some point, and neither of us wanted to kill the other or watch us kill ourselves. You want the Stone? Go throw it into a volcano."

Nowadays, desync is the death of everybody. Crap, that's how I die most of the time in games.

** And that is why Phoenixes instinctivly hate "evil" beeings, because they know their entire species depends on the Stone not beeing ruined.
