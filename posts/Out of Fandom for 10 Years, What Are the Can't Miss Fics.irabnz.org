#+begin_quote
  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** Gonna list stuff I haven't seen anybody else rec

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19193497/chapters/45627454?view_adult=true][to refuse the givens]] - an excellent Harry/Daphne work that covers sixth year to seventh year. Really good slice of life stuff that focuses on the characters as actual teenagers.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] - Hands down the best Harry/Ginny story I've ever read. Post Battle canon compliant. Harry, Ginny and family move into a country home and make friends with the muggle neighbors.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/][Limpieza de Sangre]] - Fair warning, this one might hurt. It certainly hurt me. An excellently written story featuring a positively unique dynamic between Harry and a female Voldemort. Uhhh, it broke my heart but it's really one of the best stories I've ever read.

The following are oneshots:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8125531][Hogwarts, to welcome you home]] - Really good lighthearted comfort food with a Harry who teaches Defense after the Battle of Hogwarts. Great stuff. Can't recommend it enough.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettles and Milking Pails]] - A pretty creepy horror fic based in Fae lore. More than that I won't say. Give this one a read. It's worth it.

** *Some happenings you might have missed:*

/HPMOR/ happened, introducing thousands and thousands of people to Harry Potter fanfiction.

AU fantasy epics became way more popular overall. There was a mild explosion of WBWL and Slytherin!Harry fics. /Prince of Slytherin/ became sensationally popular.

Haphne and Harry/Fleur kind of exploded in popularity. /A Cadmean Victory,/ whatever you think of it, is a result of the latter.

RobSt wrote some more fics. Investigate at your own risk.

White Squirrel started writing. As someone said earlier in the thread, highly recommended.

Taure wrote /Alexandra Potter,/ deleted it, and subsequently revived as /Victoria Potter,/ one of the most polished currently updating fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4095/Slide][Slide]] probably was around when you were still in the fandom, but she's just an absolutely fantastic author. I think she'd written /Latet Anguis in Herba/ and /Shade to Shade/ in the 2000s, but since then she's written the two concluding volumes of that series and then the next-generation Stygian Trilogy, which is just superb.

Inverarity wrote book 4 of /Alexandra Quick/, took a seven(!)-year hiatus, and released the fifth book last year. Sixth book is on the way!

**** Oh wow, you really have been gone long huh. I've never read HPMOR, but i've heard that it's a very unique fic. A lot of people love, a lot of people hate it, and a lot of people are meh about it. From what I heard, and take this with a grain of salt, it's a fic which tries to use science to explain magic. It has an OP Harry with a more OP Voldemort. I think I heard that Voldemort/Quirrel mentor him for a bit, but i'm not sure if they're still enemies.

Fleur/Harry are not fics i've read much of either, but it is very popular.

Also my all time favourite suggestion for HP fics is linkffn(Make A Wish)

** My Unordered Top HP 20 Fics: a copypasta.

Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. One look at my profile will show you I've got physical copies. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but it takes the idea and creates a gripping and emotional adaptation of the original story. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. Honestly, the story is less about the bond, but more the reactions of the characters to it, and it's amazing because of it.

Ongoing: Before I read Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Basically, he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore. A classic.

Ongoing: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] linkffn(13230340) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. It's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not an animagus, an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: Astronaut!Ron, CleverGirl!Hermione, and the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever.

Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you won't endlessly wallow in tears.

Ongoing: Path Diverged [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130353]] and it's sequel [[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130365]] by hp_fangal has a simple premise. Remember when Umbidge threatened to Crucio Harry in OotP? Yeah, that actually happens. The single change leads to a bunch a differences that could be arguably better or worse than canon. For example, Hinny happens earlier for some great Hurt/Comfort, but Harry was still tortured for an /hour./

Ongoing: Inspired by linkffn(10610076) Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki, ravenclawblues' The Heir Of House Black linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]) is another Peggy Sue, however Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the mystery of canon. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to the characters we know. It's just an overall good quality fic.

Ongoing: Now for something that isn't Hinny, but Drarry. The Time Twister series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/670418]] starting with linkao3(10021610) by YouAreMyHappilyEverAfter. It's a Draco Malfoy Peggy Sue from after the war where he regrets everything he did and goes back in time to be friends with Harry and help him out. Only it turns out to be a lot more friendly than he intended. What I love about the fic is just all the wholesome feels that come from it.

Ongoing: Magical Metamorphosis by Eon_the_Dragon_Mage linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/chapters/24670002]]) is a Transgirl Harry or “Holly” fic that I think is the best of its kind. The fic actually goes in depth on the Trans experience, focusing on gender dysphoria, the reactions of the Hogwarts students and general public, and the struggle it takes to achieve a trans person's preferred body. Also the fic has the absolute miracle of creating a good and friendly relationship between Holly and Rita Skeeter. As in, they even go shopping together. It's surreal yet makes perfect sense.

Ongoing: PadfootIsMyHomeDawg's Parsel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6146470/chapters/14082718]]) is a story where instead of going to the Dursley's, Harry, dubbed Silas, leaves the doorstep in the morning of November First in a snake animagus form to live among other snakes. After he has been missing for 10 years, he's discovered by Fred and George in the Forbidden Forest. It's a Harmony fic, cute as heck, and a cool exaggeration of Harry being a fish out of water, having to learn magic and how to be human at the same time.

Finished: In Care Of by Fang's Fawn, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.

Abandoned: I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a few things I take issue with, like the whole age line thing for instance. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and because I'm Hinny trash.

Finished: That Which Holds The Image by RubbishRobots linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/]]) is the only crossover in this list, that being with Doctor Who. That being said, you don't need to know a thing about Doctor Who to enjoy this story. Essentially, one of the most powerful monsters from that show is Harry's boggart, and the monster has some unique attributes that make them immune to the Ridikkulus spell. Honestly, the less you know, the better. Enjoy the thrills!

Finished: Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/]]) is a classic comedy fic. Instead of the main character being Harry, it's the part of Voldemort that became the Scarcrux. Hilarity ensues because Harry's insane, but not evil.

Finished(sort of): Like A Red Headed Stepchild by mugglesftw linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/]]) Harry has red hair, and so is mistaken for a Weasley. They don't mind, and in fact, they adopt him. A classic crack fic, that's basically a fever dream crafted by Fred and George, and McGonagall is close to having an aneurysm.

Hiatus/Abandoned: Three's the Charm by MissCHSparkles linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/]]) is another Peggy Sue, but with the Golden Trio. What I think this fic does best is its characterisation of a Post-DH Ron, who has made a bunch of mistakes and wants to rectify them. And honestly, it's just nice to see how far the kids have come and just /wreck/ canon.

Ongoing: A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14041326]]) and it's sequel by Shrikanth1808 linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14082594]]) is tagged as a “reverse parody,” in which it takes the premise of Umbridge finding and reading out loud to Hogwarts the entire Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, and attempts to takes it seriously. There are a bunch of fics out there like it, but this is by far the best executed.

Ongoing: Strange Visitors From Another Century by Izzyaro linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/]]) In an accident in the DoM's Time Room when their trying to rescue Sirius, Harry, Ron, and Hermione end up stranded during the time of the Hogwarts Founders. Salazar doesn't have a good time when he learns what the future thinks of him. They learn that there have always been and will always be Dark Lords. The version of the Founders in this fic is my official headcanon.

Ongoing: The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/]]) is a fic where Harry, and then eventually Hermione and Dean all either live at or become a common visitor of a Muggle facility for disadvantaged kids. Only for both the doctors and the kids to realise they can do magic. McGonagall doesn't know what she's in for when she arrives with letters.

Abandoned: Second Chances by Mara Rome linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4564794/1/]]) is the only traditional Severitus fic I can say I've completely enjoyed so far. Harry and Snape aren't related in any way, thank god, and it has all the things I love so much in hurt/comfort fics. It's set in the summer between GoF and OotP, and it all starts off when Harry uses a glamour charm when he gets checked on by Arthur. Cue warning from Ministry, Snape wants to catch the brat red-handed, only to find very familiar bruises.

Finished: Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary by The madness in me linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/]]) in which Luna steals Ginny's diary and become friends with. Naturally, Tom hates every minute of it, and it's great. Not only is it funny to see the lord of evil just BSoD at all of the Luna he has to deal with, but it also has a really heartwarming ending.

#+begin_quote
  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Updates once every two weeks. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!

** The Arithmancer which started in 2014 was stellar in my opinion, and I would say has been generally highly recommended over the years. Of course, it has its haters too like every other story does, and it's a very long read, basically original series length, but it's good quality of writing, creative interpretations of magic, and it's hermione-centric. You can check it out, I personally found it excellent.

  “Just... tell me.

  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret, lost but hidden in her mind, so she is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve until her mind can be cracked. Now illustrated by Avendell.

** The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding is a personal favourite of mine. It's still on hiatus after almost a year but a new chapter is worth that wait. I'm tempted get it printed so I can loan it to people who don't read digital books, but I'd want a full book for that. There is minor violence with warnings for that chapter. Fem!Harry, mostly canon until just before sixth year, some romance. I haven't actually been reading fan fiction that long so I read plenty of new fics. The good thing about 10 years out of the fandom is that some of the books published back then actually got pretty big. Reading mostly longfics is my dream but the amount of time spent them writing compared to time I spend reading them leaves me waiting for new material.
