i guess i really just wanna see some domestic fics where harry grows up with james&lily and also has close relationships with uncle sirius and remus?

like it could be after canon harry travels to an alternate dimension where he somehow wakes up in his other dimension's body with like siblings or whatever, or fics that are just james&lily survived that night

like a lot of the fics i see with james&lily are usually portraying them as unloving parents bc of wbwl circumstances - and while i do enjoy these stories, sometimes just feel like james&lily potter who sacrificed themselves for their son/“till the very end” wouldn't really suddenly decide “we only have one son anyways” - so yea i just wanna read some good sweet james&lily being parents

oof some other fics ive read are neville being the bwl/ role reversal of alice&frank and james&lily

but yeaa im open to anything!!!
