#+TITLE: LF a fic with manipulative Dumbledore but instead of bashing him for it the author embraces it. Perhaps Dumbledore teaches Harry manipulation as well or something.

** There's one (don't remember much) where Harry asks to learn this and for his first lesson Dumbledore manipulates Harry into thinking he's an evil manipulator that doesn't care about students and Harry pretty much freaks out until his friend (s) convince him Dumbledore was trolling him.\\
The lesson had something to do with questions people's motives and my memory today is embarrassingly bad.

I mean, it's still manipulative Dumbledore, but for me, as a reader, it was scary and impressive, so much so that I didn't really have time to hate Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Many have criticized Albus Dumbledore for not taking adequate steps to undermine Tom Riddle's plays for power, rein in Severus Snape's behavior toward Gryffindors, and see to Harry Potter's welfare... but what if that was the point? 'It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor...' (Manipulative!Dumbledore. Oneshot. Crackfic.)
