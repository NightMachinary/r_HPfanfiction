*** I'm listening to Mythos by Stephen Fry right now and got to the part where Daphne turns into a tree so Apollo will quit hitting on her and it made me think of the word "vegemagus" and I had the strong impulse to share it.

Also jeez I did not remember how very gay Greek mythology was. Cygnus was not Phaeton's good buddy, you guys.

*** Harry glimpses Daphne sneaking around Hagrid's Hippogriff pen and gathering dung. Incredulous, he follows her into the Forbidden Forest and sees her fertilize a really nice laurel tree. In retrospect, there was always something odd about her having green hair with leaves woven in, but no one wanted to be rude and ask what was that about...

****** She doesn't have any characterization. Everything we think we know about her was extrapolated from the Class List, which placed her in Slytherin, and an essay on the HP Lexicon, which places her home somewhere in East Anglia.

  What if Voldemort never heard the prophecy? What if he spared Harry and won the war? When just that happens Voldemort creates a way to prevent the new Britain he is building from ever defying him again, and it's called the Hunger Games. When best friends Harry and Hermione are reaped in their 6th year they are the spark that set the whole nation alight.. M for violence.
