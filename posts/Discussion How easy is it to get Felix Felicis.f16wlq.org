So I was thinking about how easy it is to abuse the time travel mechanics of Harry Potter (long story) but that's got me onto one of the most obviously OP things in canon: Felix Felicis. We're told that it's hard to make, but I've seen a couple of times in fanon Harry just kinda getting some really easily. So I was wondering, what is everyone's opinion on how hard/easy it is to either make or acquire the famous liquid luck.

(My head-canon is that to make it you need to perform a great feat of luck during the brewing process: Rolling seven dice, all seven sided, and getting all sevens. Which Iâ€˜m pretty sure has a 1/823543 chance of happening. Or, if you want to make it stupidly ridiculously hard, it has to happen seven times in a row. Which is, I think a 1/256923580000000000000000000000000000000000 chance of happening. (2.5692358x10^{41} !!) )


** My personal head canon is that brewing Felix involves bottling your /own/ luck, at least for the duration of the brew. Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.

And that's why it's so devilishly tricky to brew, you need to have such a degree of skill and preparation that there's not even a /chance/ to make a mistake thanks to bad luck.

*** This is from Seventh Horcrux, right? Very good fic!

It also takes 6 months to brew. Imagine cooking one meal for 6 months, and then multiply that difficult by 50, since potions are more difficult and precise than cooking normal meals.

It's also addicting. I bet you can only use it once or twice a century.

Edit: Not sure why you got downvoted. Upvoted ya. Why does this sub downvote so many comments? :/

** So, a little bit of "Hearthstone Pro Player Talk", but its relevant.

In hearthstone (and most other sports/games with elements of randomness), a lot of people who aren't good at the game will look at Pro Players and say "They only won because they got lucky."

That's true, but thats not all there is to it. They got lucky because they put themselves into the position to be lucky. They put in the work for that luck to happen.

As far as I know in canon, Felix Felicis takes a long time to brew and is known for being rather difficult to brew, along with (maybe) requiring a couple rare ingredients. But Super Carlin brothers have a video talking about how most of the ingredients for the potion are used in other potions (pepper ups, things that make you feel better) but none with any "lucky' effects. And after that video I looked at the Luck Potion differently.

We've already used Hearthstone to determine that a big part of being lucky is setting yourself up for it. So what if the long process for brewing the relatively non-magical (while rare[maybe]) ingredients together is a way of /magically/ setting yourself up for beibg lucky, or storing luck up for later?

If you're sat inside your house all day for months straight doing nothing but brewin a potion, you're not setting yourself up to be lucky. Yeah, nothing unlucky will probably come your way, but neither will something lucky. And where will all that luck go?

Into the potion.

The only problem with that is you need to be in a extremely luck neutral environment. Running counter to your own head cannon, any lucky things that happen to you while brewing would take away the "ambient luck" that would go to the potion, and cause it to be less potent or even fail depending on how lucky you got.

And that also explains why its so hard to make. Think about the all the little ways that you get lucky in your normal day.

*** Ooh, this is actually a pretty good idea... now I'm stuck between your idea of storing up unused luck, and mine of using an unlikely event as a catalyst.

** My headcanon on Felix Felicis is that it isn't really all that hard to make, but that it isn't really practically useful at anything but mundane events.

Basically, I headcanon Felix as homing in on your innermost and deepest desires, and manipulates your decision-making in order to get closer to them. This makes it worse than useless as a wartime potion, for example, because Felix would simply tell you to leave the war and do something you actually /want/ to do instead. For this reason, Felix is mostly just useful to solve mundane teenage troubles (love drama and whatnot) or similar things, and few people would bother spending half a year on a potion merely to get a good date, for example. The reason it was useful for Harry was that his deepest wishes basically boils down to getting free from Voldemort -- ergo, winning the war.

** "Squiring the Phoenix" takes the view that Felix Felicis doesn't make luck from nothing, it basically compresses your luck into a shorter timeframe. So, for all the good luck it gives you, you can expect an equivalent run of bad luck afterward.

**** In a later chapter, a space elevator is constructed with the help of "enough Liquid Luck to make a series of eight thousand lightning bolts destroy the lab where the work had been done and everything for a mile around. All the lab workers had been killed in the process, but the data had been carefully streamed offsite in real time so none of it was lost. All the lab workers had been terminal cancer patients who understood that this was a suicide job, and the lab had carefully been built in the middle of nowhere in South Dakota with the expectation of its destruction."

***** Haha, wow. That is super unlucky. Although, how did they stop the bad luck from affecting something important like the way the data was transferred, or how much of the needed data they acquired? (Should I make this a spoiler comment?)

****** The bad luck only hits after the potion wears off. As long as transmission is complete beforehand, and no-one who took any of the potion is in charge of any of the data, it could work.
