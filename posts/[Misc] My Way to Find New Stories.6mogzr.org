An idea that came to me naturally, but doesn't seem to have been thought up by anyone on this sub (or at least they didn't mention it). When I want a new story, I look at the favorites of one of the authors whose story I liked, and go from there; after all, if they wrote something I loved, their tastes can't be too different from mine. Occasionally this allows one to stumble upon stories that wouldn't be popular enough to crop up in a search by number of favorites, which seems to be how many people look for their stories.

*** I actually find that people with less favorites generally have a better selection fics on there. People with 1000+ favorites tend to favorite everything from absolute crap to great fics but going through 10+ pages of favorites takes too much time especially when the majority of fics are not that good.

**** I agree. I tend to only favorite what I consider to be the greatest fanfiction I've read until that moment. I'll admit that some of what's on there isn't great, or even good, compared to what I read now but what's important to me is what I thought of it when I finished.

***** The problem I find with my ffnet favorites is that the list began in early 00s and I was much less picky in my younger days. Not that I'd ever bother to clean it up.

****** I absolutely loathe some of the fics on my list but I don't remove them just because at one point I considered them worthy.

******* I know what you mean. I have definitely gotten a lot more picky in what I read so my older favorites aren't always very good. I even have a few super old Naruto fanfics in my favorites that are absolutely terrible that I must have added when I was way younger. Sometimes I wonder what I was thinking when I favorited them because they are completely unreadable (maybe I did not know what the favorite button did?) At the same time I haven't deleted them since I feel like they are a part of my account history.

******** Would they happen to be examples of what NOT to be in the HP community? Because I have a few in the Naruto communities.

*** It seems an excellent system. I might just do that. Thanks for sharing.

** Another thing you can do if you find a new author is to look at their favourite list to see if they like quality stuff or not.

If their favourite list is filled with bashing and edgy harem lord potter stuff you'll at least have a bit of a warning.

** That's one of my methods, too, along with recommendations and checking the newer stories on ffn and sorting them by favorites or follow and see if something hits my fancy.

I almost always check the profile of all author I read, even if I don't like their fics much, just in case. Their own stories and their favorites.

** That's what I do too. You can also go to review section of those same stories and then check profile pages of the more competent reviewers. A lot of people who review don't write fics, but keep a favorites list that is generally similar to whatever fic you are reading.

** That's what I do, especially since I read "rare" pairings. I'm pretty sure I read everything relatively good that exists for a few pairings, so checking my favorite authors favorite's has led to some interesting discoveries.
