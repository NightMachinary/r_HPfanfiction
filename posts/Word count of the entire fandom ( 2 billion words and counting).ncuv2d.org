Vaguely playing with the filters on FFN and AO3 indicates that the Harry Potter fanfiction corpus is well over two billion words in length.

*Back of the envelope calculations:*

FFN: About 91.6K Harry Potter stories above 20k in length. 91600 x 20k =1,832,000k words = 1,832,000,000 words = 1.8B words at the least. I have made the extreme approximation that every one of these fics is exactly 20k words and excluded crossovers.

AO3: Exactly 33985 stories under the HP tag above 20k in length. Many of these are probably cross posted and crossovers are included.

33985 x 20k = 679,700k words = 679,700,000 words = 0.67 B words at the least.

Adding them up gives you about 2.4 billion words of fanfiction as a lower limit.

For reference, the English Wikipedia is about 3.8 billion words and counting. The Original HP series is about 1084k+ words. The longest HP fanwork I've been able to find is 4345k+ words .

What do you think?

How much fanfic do you think you have read in terms of wordcount?

Can anyone with the proper background come up with the actual stats?


** Would be really hard to calculate seeing as sometimes stories are posted in both sites

** Honestly, quite a few stories could be cut in half, if you'd do away with redundancies, and unnecessary stuff, and filler.

Seriously, some long stories have whole, massive chapters of... nothing. And the actual story/character progression could be condensed into three paragraphs.
