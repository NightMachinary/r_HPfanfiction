Would love to read a well-written Draco fanfic where romance *isn't* a big thing. In the fanfic world he's such an interesting character. Am not into Drarry lol, and not Dramione, have read a number of those.

Any recommendations?

  Draco Malfoy awakens in Gryffindor Tower at the start of his sixth year with no memory of how he arrived.Can Draco use Harry's lingering impressions of the world to guide him? Can he navigate the politics of being the Boy Who Lived? And how long before he tips off Ron or Hermione?A bodyswap subversion and bromance, this story features a Ron Weasley convinced they are mates, a Hermione keen on the Dark Arts, a surprisingly friendly Blaise Zabini, and a Luna Lovegood who's just mad enough to find this all perfectly ordinary.

** I feel your pain. Last night I read this fic where Hermione went back in time and Draco was a side character for the first six chapters before she left and he was the most interesting part of the whole damn fic. Anyway, you might want to try searching by his character tag on ao3 and then excluding all the popular relationship tags.

This one is my favorite Draco of all time. He's a total asshole snob, yet so talented and cunning that you can't help but admire him. Also, one of the only ones I've found where he interacts with Sirius.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the problem of potions)

Draco becomes a Marxist and a symbol/leader of the Hogwarts rebellion against the Ministry and Voldemort in his fifth year. Hogwarts descends into riots. I linked the chapter of the rebellion instead of the whole series because a) it's amazing and b) the sequel is drarry

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9476138/chapters/22352399#workskin][the most satisfying chapter you'll ever read]]

Draco time travels and is introduced to his younger self as a distant family member.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor.  Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

  Narcissa wakes with the certain feeling that something is terribly wrong. Draco is acting differently, Narcissa is worried, Lucius is confused, and a meeting inside Madam Malkin's goes very differently from the way it happened the first time around.
