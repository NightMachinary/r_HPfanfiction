Veela and phoenix do the deed, then veenix/human crossbreeds is my most likely scenario for it. Though a very drunk and horny transformed fleur hitting fawkes with her allure would be amusing too.

** Probably a like a regular Veela but with literal flame coloured red hair that catches fire without harm coming to the Veenix. The issue is going to be how the phoenix's â€˜turn to ash and be born again' thing works for a Veenix because I think it's too much of a central thing to just cut out completely, but being born again every so often and having to start from scratch (presumably with all the memories of the previous life) would be hella frustrating.

*** Being only 1/2 phoenix, I don't think they'd have burning days. I'd imagine they'd be able to burst into flame to shrug off serious wounds, but it'd take a lot out of them. Things like the killing curse, death from age complications, and being forced to burn too often would probably still kill them
