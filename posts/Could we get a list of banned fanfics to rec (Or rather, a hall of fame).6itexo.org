It's a bit annoying seeing stuff like Seventh Horcrux, or A Black Comedy, or Like a Redheaded Stepchild, or other various fics recommended over and over and over. I feel like I've read 80% of the interesting premises posted on this sub because we recommend the same stuff.


** As much as I agree, I don't think it's really possible. And, even if there was a stickied thread at the top of the forum that just listed every fic certain guilty members have recommended 50+ times (because it is mostly just the same people reccing the same stories), they would still get recommended again anyways since people don't read stickies.

** Its not a bad thing really(especially for newer people) often times they are usually the best and most popular fics, but everyone should definitely try and include lesser known and newer fics when they recommend as well, I don't post to often but when I do I try and do this, hell iv posted fics I didn't really like before just to provide some variety, Im sure im not the only one who exhausts the search tab and google in search of recommendations before I post a request myself, its like if you've been around FF for longer than a few months you know the popular ones, you've probably made a request to get lesser known ones to begin with.

Everyone should just assume that the requester knows about Seventh Horcrux, or A Black Comedy etc and maybe include them but list of a few others if you know any aswell. Its when people don't link anything else that it becomes really annoying.

** Totally disagreed. If we want to ban things, I think I could make a better argument for banning "no slash", "no het", and other discriminatory restrictions in requests. You wouldn't request a fic, and put "no women!" "no disabled characters!" or "no jews!" in your request. Or if you did, nobody would respond well. So I'm not quite sure why similar restrictions seem to be perfectly fine. However, this sub is so small, and nobody is bothered by these types of requests, so I am not convinced we want to ban things. Also, it could well be that I'm missing something, and my comparison is totally off the mark. When I'm the only person who cares about a thing, that's almost always the case. Also, the slippery slope of what exclusions are discrimination and what aren't isn't one we want to go down.

What would be nice, though, is a way to have the bot post a predefined list of fics on command. So if someone asks, once again, for godmode Harry+Hermione fics, someone can just post a one-word comment and the usual suspects will get recced. This would encourage anyone else who posts to try and come up with unique fics, because the karma boost for recommending the usuals would be basically gone. Maybe create a bunch of lists for common requests on the wiki, and have the bot pull from that, by syntax like linklist(listname) causing the bot to check the sub it's posting in for a wiki page named listname to pull recs from.

As am I; I don't read slash, either. But at the same time, if I was asking for reccs, I would be massively uncomfortable putting "no slash" on my request. If I don't want slash, I can just skip the recs that contain it, without advertising my preferences to the world. It could, of course, be that I'm too sensitive.

I think it's just you to be honest. Would it be equally wrong for a gay reader to request 'no M/F'? Regardless, not everyone discloses that a fic is slash when recommending, for example, and I'd be annoyed if I got 30k words into a fic and got a slash scene not because I think gay people are inferior but because that's not what I'm interested in (in much the same way I would want to know ahead of time if the fic is Evil!Dumbledore).

We read for enjoyment. I don't think not enjoying literary gay porn is a sign that I'm homophobic. I just don't enjoy it because that's not my orientation.

Similarly, when it comes to excluding characters with a disability, or race, or gender, part of my enjoyment of fics is based on the similarity of the main character to me. I don't read fics to broaden my horizons. For example, I read a lot of Hermione-centric stories because, as a nerdy girl that got picked on for her hair, her experience resonates with me and makes me enjoy the story more than reading a story from Draco's perspective (though I still read those.) So if I ask for stories featuring specifically a straight female main character, it's not that I think the others are inferior. I just want a character like me. I expect a lot of people are like that too.

I hope that sorta makes sense.

I feel the same way. I think the difference might be that I believe that to be a flaw; I wish I was equally interested in everything, and I think that treating people equally almost requires being equally interested in them. Also, again speaking personally, I tend to get way more annoyed by surprise M/M than surprise F/F. So that reveals quite a bit of hypocrisy in my personal preferences. I also have a sneaking suspicion that in 75 years, our grandchildren really will find it strange to be interested in M/F, but not M/M.

Homophobic is a strong word. And like racism, terrorism, ableism, revolution, and many other words, so many people have shouted it so many times about so many things, it's almost impossible to use it in a conversation, because nobody understands what it means. Especially an internet conversation! While I don't want to accuse anyone of homophobia, and am not, I do think that the number of requests that go out of there way to say "no slash" is troubling. Especially when it's part of requests that wouldn't otherwise involve sex anyway.

It's the most well-expressed version of the opposing point of view that anyone has yet posted. I'm not sure you've changed my opinion, though.

********* I respect your wish to be equally interested in all things, but I think we'll have to agree to disagree here, and more importantly on the idea that treating people equally requires equal attraction (which is the kind of 'interested in' I meant.)

Now I do agree that a no slash request on non-sex-containing stories is a bit odd, but in terms of still reading Draco stories, for example, sometimes I'm just not in the mood for one. When that happens, I'll request Hermione only. Or the next day I'm really in the mood for Draco-centric stories, so I'll request Draco only. I don't think I'm excluding good stories because (setting aside the fact that 'good' is very subjective) some other day I might want something else.

Anyway, I respect your opinion and I'm glad to have had the discussion, even if we don't quite agree. (Side note: I love robst stories sometimes.

  treating people equally requires equal attraction
#+end_quote

Ah, I think this is where our assumptions differ. I wasn't using "interested in" to mean "attracted to". It's possible for me (and I suspect most people) to be "interested in" an m/f romance between two people, even if I am not attracted to either one, and wouldn't want to date anybody involved. And yet, the same thing doesn't seem to be true for m/m romance, for me and a lot of people. And that's where my problem lies.

#+begin_quote
  I'll request Hermione only.
#+end_quote

I think, though, that requesting one particular character is quite different than requesting the mass exclusion of an entire group. As an example, I wouldn't have a problem with "Immortal Harry, from Hermione's point of view." But "Immortal harry. No female characters!" would bother me. And it's this exact slippery slope problem that caused me to conclude that banning things would be a bad idea. It's too subjective.

Yeah, exactly. I'm a straight white male, so the wish fulfillment for me in some of these is just off the charts. As you're someone who identifies with Hermione, though, I'm surprised they don't drive you crazy. If I had to point to one major problem with robst, it would be how he turns Hermione into an Accessory for Harry, rather than a powerful character in her own right. As with most of robst, though, it's just fine if you don't overthink it. :-)

******* I read for my own enjoyment, and if I don't find reading such things enjoyable, then it's perfectly within my rights to ask if there are fics without it.

I'm not asking for other people, I'm asking for myself. If I don't want to read something, I'm not going to ask for recs for it. If I go on FFN and look for fics, I have to scroll past hundreds of slash fics that I'm not going to read anyway. It is, quite frankly, wasting my time. So in the interest of saving time, I have to separate the metaphorical wheat from the chafe. Adding qualifiers is doing exactly that. It's literally what they're there for. Asking for a fic with no slash is no different than asking for a fic with certain characters, or a specific literary genre. If I want to read SciFi, I don't want people giving me High Fantasy just because other people might enjoy them.

I'm not entirely sure that comparison holds up. Asking to exclude particular fictional characters, or a literary genre, seems somewhat different, to me, than asking to exclude people of a certain sexual orientation, race, or disability. However, that disagreement is exactly why I said, in my original comment, that trying to ban certain qualifiers would only lead to a slippery slope, before concluding it might not be a worthwhile idea.

** The problem is - people ask for the same kind of series over and over again. It's obvious that the same recommendations will be repeated. I've created a list of series to recommend in Evernote so I can just paste the relevant stuff.

You want something new? I suggest creating a list of things you already know (or at least those likely to get recommended) and ask for recommendations while posting it.

*** But quite a few characters didn't get even a single rec. I don't think it's fair to assume that there aren't any well-characterised fics for those characters. Again, it reflects the range of interests /on this sub/, and is not a reflection of the generality of fanfiction.

** Maybe there are simply not that many fics worth reading? I would imagine it is mostly good stuff (for whatever definition of "good") that gets recommended.

**** Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, though, the stories get recommended precisely for a lack of anything else; I mean, if you see a request that's without any replies for half a day or longer and one of those “oh so woefully overrecommended” fics fulfils those requirements then I think recommending those at least says to OP that people can see their request.

Personally I do try to link whatever less commonly reccomended I happen to have that fits, but sometimes it's hard for this-or-that reason.

Edit: Also, it reminds me of those times when different people create requests for the same kind of fics day after another, one user, then one day later another, then half a day later yet another ... at some point during that streak they start deserving copy-pasta for being lazy bastards.

***** Plus, you're asking people to recommend one fanfic out of a hundred thousand. Unless you're super into fanfiction and keep a comprehensive list, most stuff you read is pretty forgettable.

If you want stuff, GTFO and find it yourself. Job done properly, and all that.

*** Ehhh, it depends on your definition of "good". If you're very, very picky, maybe there's not much. But HP fandom is huge and there's something out there for everyone. The stuff that gets recced here is a tiny fraction of what's out there, and is certainly not all the "good" fic, IMO.

** I completely disagree with this idea and I dislike OP for suggesting it. As much as you may get tired of seeing the same recommendations these stories are new to somebody and they deserve to see them. Don't start banning shit because some people have a problem ignoring duplicates.
