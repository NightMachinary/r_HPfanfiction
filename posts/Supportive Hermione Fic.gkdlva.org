So I am trying to love hermione again. I have made the mistake of reading too many light bashing fics and as you all know Hermione often gets grouped into that.

I was wondering if anyone knows of any realistic (possibly long) fics where Hermione and Harry have a good friendship and Hermione doesn't try to change him or doesn't follow Dumbledore's order to not send him letters after fourth year. A fic where Hermione isn't annoying af. I still expect her to be a know it all but I would really like her to have independence and to think for herself. This could be a dark or light fic. It could still have light bashing but with Hermione believing in Harry without hesitation and with her being on his side knowing that authorities and parental figures can be wrong.

Please no Harry/Hermione. Nor any Harry/Ginny unless it's book Ginny not Movie Ginny.

SLASH would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you ðŸ˜Š


** I find that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5's fics]] often have a pretty good dynamic with respect to that.

A few notes about your request:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione doesn't try to change him
#+end_quote

I am not sure a Hermione who doesn't try to change people would still be Hermione, though. Basically, Hermione is not a very nice person. She exemplifies the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice][Good is not Nice]] trope. She is generally polite and well-spoken; she avoids unnecessary confrontations; she generally wants to fight the good fight, help people, and make the world a better place (whether the world wants it or not); and she wants everyone around her to be their best possible selves; but she is not /nice/. She does not go out of her way to spare people's feelings; she does not hesitate to do what she thinks is right even if it hurts someone, including someone close to her; and she does not love people just the way they are. This is a part of what makes her an interesting character.

Portraying a not-nice Hermione without descending into bashing requires walking a tightrope of sorts, which many fics don't quite manage.

#+begin_quote
  doesn't follow Dumbledore's order to not send him letters after fourth year.
#+end_quote

You mention this in the context of fics with this event, but this is a common enough misconception about canon that I want to point it out just in case, to keep it from propagating further. Ron and Hermione did send Harry letters throughout, and he wrote back. What Dumbledore told them---and they complied---was to avoid writing about the Order or Voldemort or any other potentially sensitive matters. This frustrated Harry to no end, but it was basic operational security: owl mail can be intercepted, and even if another medium could be used, Harry has a mental link of an unknown nature to the greatest Legilimens alive. The Ministry and Voldemort both would /love/ to get their hands on evidence that Harry was a member of a paramilitary organisation led by Dumbledore.

** I'm actually surprised you found a lot of fics with Hermione bashing. Other than a few rare Hermione-Ron bashing, it's usually a misunderstood Hermione. Who thinks she's doing the right thing but isnt, rather than her being an outright antagonist. I love with what I'm doing with Hermione in my fic. While she's not an overbearing character, she talked a lot with the love interest of Harry in order to better prepare her for what Harry is going to be like after the third task. Since she knows Dumbledore will never let her near him over the summer, she finds a loophole and makes sure she takes care of Harry through someone else.

Because I've always viewed Hermione as someone who genuinely loves Harry more than anyone in the books, as a sister or something more.

The kind of person to challenge Harry's own above-and-beyond style of caring for people. Willing to do everything they can to care for the ones they love. I love writing her character.

** These stories are the ones that stick out to me the most that have a supportive Hermione. Probably not the best list

Dancing in the Green - linkffn(11703507) - Hermione is very supportive and tries to help Harry as much as possible.

Harry Potter and the Vanishing Princess - linkffn(13275504) - Hermione is supportive in this story and well characterized.

Heroes Assemble! - linkffn(12307781) - Marvel Crossover: Also features a supportive Hermione

** If you haven't already read it, Harry has really good relationships with all of his friends (he makes sure of it) in Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. It's not available on FFN anymore, but I can link the PDF if you want (it's the only version I know of that includes chapter 43). Unfortunately incomplete, but still a really great read, time travel with a strong focus on preparing and protecting his precious people rather than speedrunning the horcruxes. Hermione is a bit more relaxed than canon, with Harry able to keep up with her and being more supportive of her drive to excel.

** Have you ever read linkao3(The Accidental Animagus)? Hermione's parents adopt Harry and she really is like a big sister to him; I love their relationship.

Since you said slash is welcome, I liked Hermione in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304714][Chrysalis]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12045300][Nearly Lost Things, Carefully Tended]]. She's a very good friend to Harry in all of those, but she only has a supporting role though.

  Three years after the war, Harry is lost, drifting, and feeling left behind. In an effort to get control of his life, he commits to cleaning out Grimmauld Place top-to-bottom and forcing it to be a home, whether it likes it or not. The rotten old house is stuffed full of antiques, and Harry is shocked to discover none other than Draco Malfoy running the local antique shop. Malfoy is polite -- too polite, and Harry soon finds himself with a mission: to annoy and bother Malfoy with the most hideous, absurd antiques he can find. But along the way, Harry comes to appreciate Draco, his work, and the power of connecting to the people who came before him. It's a hard lesson, but Harry learns that if he wants to build a future, he has to reconnect to his past, and Draco might just be the one to help him do it.
