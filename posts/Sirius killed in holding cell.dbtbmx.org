I read a ffn about dark!Harry and the only detail I remember is that: Harry had gone to Amelia Bones or something this way and she had promised that if Sirius come to her he would have a fair trial. But then when he goes there the next day his dead and Harry promised himself revenge on Bones and add her to his kill list on which is Voldemort and Dumbledore already there. Please can anyone remember the title? Thanks:*
