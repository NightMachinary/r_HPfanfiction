I know that for some, OC-centered fics are like a dirty word or seen as "lower fanfic," but I'm one of those people who enjoys reading them now and again. And what recent searches I've done for decent HP OC fics have not resulted in much success. So, can any of ya'll help a pal out?

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

** The Durmstrang Chronicles by Loup_Noir\\
[[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/loup_noir/]]

This series by Catherine Keegan/Loup Noir about a group of Dark Arts teachers at Durmstrang is chock full of interesting, non-Mary Sue OCs. Almost none of the canon characters are even mentioned--only one, Remus Lupin, appears briefly in the series, in The Contract, which you can read without spoiling anything of major significance. Loup Noir's characters feel very real to me, dark and knowing. She created original characters who aren't admirable or "nice" but who are compelling, and readers will care about their fates. The main characters are heterosexual, and there are some times when the issue of sex and relationships arises, but this isn't a romance, and that's not the focus of this rather dark gen series.\\
The Chronicles makes more sense read in order, and there are lots of stories in the series to savor. Do give this universe a try!

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  For the first time in seven years, Cedric Diggory won't be on the start-of-term Express to Hogwarts. Instead, his friends return to school for their final and most stressful year, still trying to adjust to the loss of their best mate amidst rapidly-escalating tensions in the classrooms and the corridors. Together, they must negotiate Quidditch, life, love, and learning, all while the Ministry of Magic is more intent on disrupting their education than dealing with the looming threat of the most feared dark wizard of the age - and that's without the small matter of the end-of-year exams that will affect the rest of their lives.A story about keeping on, about keeping it together. A story about keeping up.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

if so ; linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived) complete subversion of most of the wrong boy who lived tropes, Harry is a complete OC who goes to Durmstrang with other OC's, while his brother Nathan takes canon Harry's role and personality. it's a complete subversion of the WBHL tropes by having no bashing, and having Harry and Nathan raised together by their loving, still living parents. Also Nathan is actually the boy who lived, not the wrong boy who lived.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** YMMV, but I'll toss in Methods of Rationality, because Harry is nothing like canon and is basically an author self-insert (there are in-story reasons for this that are eventually revealed). Bear in mind that opinions on its quality are /very/ divided. I generally recommend the alternate introduction, linkffn(Daystar's remix of HPMoR).

  Fan edit of the first few chapters of LessWrong's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to smooth out tone/characterization, and make it more accessible to those not familiar with Harry Potter canon.
