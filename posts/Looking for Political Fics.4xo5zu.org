**** The accidental animagus also has a decent amount of political stuff once you get into the story, along with being a great read. Not the main focus but one of the fee stories I've read where the politics I feel ate a good as the rest of the story

  â€œThis will lead to another Time of Burning, mark my words; because the reactionary Muggles who figure out that they're being targeted or hindered in any way by magic will think to solve the problem by eliminating magical beings rather than attempting to secure magical allies themselves. This will in turn only tempt elements of our own society who wish nothing more than bloody conquest and a return to a darker age into action. When you take away the ability and rights of any people to self-govern, you leave them only with violence and hate to air their grievances."

** Well for what it's worth, this one is mine and while it doesn't exactly focus on politics, it does have quite a lot of politics in it, both plot and sub-plots. It's not a popular story though, so you probably won't like it. linkffn(11662486)

I seem to recall a very clever one where Hermione was (or was married to) an international diplomat? I can't remember what it was called though.

  It's nearly eleven years since Harry defeated Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts. Life for the youngest Head Auror ever appointed is busy and chaotic, but it's good. Not everyone in the wizarding world, however, is content; there are stirrings of unrest. A new adventure starts with the theft of a mysterious artefact from the Ministry of Magic . . .
