I'm searching for this one HP Fanfiction where Harry visits Voldemort as a spirit and annoys him all the time. As a ghost he travels to the manor where Voldemort lives and noone else can see him. One time Snape goes to the manor while Harry is there and nearly figures it out. I started reading it, but I accidently deleted it and forgot the name. Does anyone know which one I mean?


** Isnt it an azkaban harry story? And harry csb posses luna/hermione abd they can transfer him by kissing? Damn now i want to reread it too!

EDIT: if it is this one, then its linkffn(don't look back in anger)
