Instead of the usual fare where Harry is friends with (former) pureblood supremacists, I am looking for stories where he ends up in Slytherin but it is not the warm, welcoming place most fanfics make it out to be. And it should not be "Harry and most Slytherins vs Malfoy+goons" either.

Please no slash, no Hermione bashing and preferably no Hermione/Weasley pairing.

Why? Is that not how it would realistically and logically be? I mean if you flip yourself around and say you are a Ravenclaw or a Hufflepuff, and then you look at Gryffindor and you see Harry Ron and Hermione running around getting into trouble and losing points all the time and breaking every rule ever, are you just going to think every single Gryffindor is like them? No, because you have Neville, who is an anxiety-prone, stammery forgetful mess, and then you have LAVENDER who is into fashion and bunnies and divinations, and certainly does not have any interest in the heroic things Harry and co do all the time. Most Gryffindors were NOT like them, doing the things they did.

So why would you look at Malfoy and his gang of bullies and supremacists and automatically assume every other House of Slytherin kid is like them, or is into the same ideas as them? There are most surely a bunch of Nevilles and Lavenders in there too! Just normal kids who want to get by, who have hobbies and stupid problems and don't even care about why Malfoy and his friends are so obsessed with stalking and harassing that Potter kid. The majority of Slytherin probably didn't even CARE about Malfoy.

And I think THAT is way more realistic AND interesting to write about than just "Every single Slytherin is exactly the same personality and concept wise because Slytherin."

Unless you do not want realistic characterization in your story. That is fine though! :)

** linkffn(3559907) - What Would Slytherin Harry Do? covers the bases you're after. Hilariously enough that the bikini-clad mudwrestling /makes perfect sense in context/.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

Malfoy is antagonistic in this one and Snape is like his canon self more or less. Most Slytherins dislike Harry for most of the time, but he still makes some friends.
