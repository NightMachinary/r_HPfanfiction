Looking for fanfictions fitting several categories:

- Godlike, Powerful Harry Potter
- Dark Potter
- Harry Potter/Multi with smut
- Harry Potter growing up not with Dursley's

Fanfictions can fit one or more categories. Requesting finished or still being written fics. With a decent word count.


** In a singing voice "have you ever read fanfiction". Seriously though there are thousands out there. Just type dark, godlike, harry potter in google search, and you'll find lots, whole fanfiction community's are dedicated to this.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
