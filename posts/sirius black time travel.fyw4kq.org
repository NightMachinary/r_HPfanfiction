I'm looking for a serius black time travel fic, the story itself is split into something like half a dozen chapters scattered inside one of those partially complete story compilations. in one chapter Sirius supposedly uses loosing Bellatrix to Severus snape in a game of poker as part of his plan to fix the black sisters. he also justifies Andromeda's relationship with ted tonks as her keeping financials in mind because it is easier and less costly to have a muggle born disposed of if she were to tire of him. in the fic after learning of what serius did Andromeda's response is to tell ted that now that her family approves he better not back out of their relationship


** These examples are in chapters 161 and 164 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/161/Odd-Ideas]["Odd Ideas"]] by Rorschach's Blot
