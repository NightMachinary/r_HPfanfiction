"Any kind of advancement, be it magical or mundane, results in humans trying to control nature and reality," the stranger, claiming to be one of the Watchmen said, "So, as humans master different aspects of reality, they eventually start messing with Time. That's why in future, people will try to travel to past, either to learn ancient knowledge firsthand or to influence the future."

"So, time-magic is common in future," Hermione asked. She had a hard time coming to terms that time travel is possible.

"No, it is somewhat regulated using contracts and unbreakable vows. But no system is perfect. People fall through cracks," the stranger explained calmly.

"And these people, they try to change the past?"

"Changing the past is a tricky thing." The stranger sighed, took a slow breath, and added, "flow of time is very hard to bend. Think of it like a river, and time travelers as you throwing a rock into the river. It splashes, and makes small waves, but the flow, it isn't affected much. But if one were to take a large rock, it would make a huge splash, and if someone were to block the river, it will make a different route to flow. Who knows what the consequences will be then."

'That makes sense,' Hermione thought. "And the Watchmen, you are suppose to stop people from doing that?"

"Well yes and no." The stranger replied, "there are those called pillars. Think of these like parts of a huge canyon, that guides the river, absorbing any splashes made. These Pillars are people of immense power, influence or will. They protect the timeline. We, Watchmen, are supposed to help these Pillars, by giving them information, aid or training. We are informed what our task will entail, the source is reliable and involves magic not even dreamt up yet. Then we undertake whatever task we're supposed to do."

"So what's your undertaking now?"

"This period has an unusually high number of pillars. You, your husband, Headmaster Longbottom, Head Auror Bones and Mrs Scamander. The next generation will have Teddy Lupin, Victorie Weasley and the Scamander Twins. And that's just in Britain."

"So, Harry Potter is not involved with Pillars?" Hermione asked, half-relieved her best friend wasn't involved with this. Whatever 'this' was.

"No, Mr. Potter is not a Pillar." The stranger said, "far, far into the future he is the one who forms the Watchmen. He created all magics involved and became the first Watchmen."

"And you work with him. You know him?" Hermione asked irritated, 'So, Harry's going to get dragged into this. And knowing his luck.'

"Well of course I know him." The stranger said with a laugh. He undid all the glamours and charms. "I am Harry Potter."

It's a Harry goes back in time, but with some very big twists. Firstly, he doesn't go to his first year, or during Marauder's era, or Riddle's era. Harry travels to the point where Harry's generation is at the top of magical world. Secondly, Harry is there not to change past or alter things. He is there for a mission as one of the Watchmen. What the mission entails is entirely up to the author. And finally, time travel is not obscure ancient magic. It is in fact magic of future where curious researchers found a way to mess with time.


** this sounds really epic
