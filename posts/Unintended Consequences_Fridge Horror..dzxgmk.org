One time I was reading this fanfic. Indy!Harry(but a bit less shouty than normal)/Hermione.

Bunch of standard tropeish stuff, but done in a good way. All well and good. Well H&H are battling death eaters in a mall, and they come across a girl whose parents were killed. They of course take her with them. Girl turns out to be muggleborn. They fall in love with the girl and decide to adopt her via magic. A potion you give to the child, and they become your biological child. The process is painful, but it is worth it for them to be a family.

The unintended consequences come later. Manip!Dumblydore decides that Harry needs to be controlled or something, tries to take the girl away from the two HJ's. He fails because with the potion she is LEGALLY their daughter.

Do you see the missing step here? Nowhere in this fic did it state that the potion needed any emotional component. So you can KIDNAP a child, feed it this potion (THAT HURTS LIKE HELL) and it is NOW LEGALLY YOURS! No one can take it from you now! Hermione Granger? Nope. You are now Hermione Malfoy whether you want it or not! Not how the author intended it to be read, but is how I saw it...

Anyone else have anything like this? Things where worldbuilding or a powerwank cast bad lenses across the wizarding world when it was intended to be lighthearted.

The other ones I can think of are:

House elves requiring a master. (It very much echos slave owners rhetoric.)

Pureblood Hermione/Lily (If the muggleborn genius is a pureblood, that could mean that the bloodpurests are right.)


** I think Cursed Child is rife with this sort of thing.

- OotP - the gang break the Ministry stock of Time Turners in the DoM, and the potential of using time travel is wiped off the board for the following books. HOWEVER, in CC, it turns out that private families can own their own Time Turners, can experiment with them, and modify them to be able to travel more than 1 hour into the past.

- This Time Travel ability overpowers the Fidelius. The trio can go back to 1981 and see the Potters' house in Godric's Hollow, without being told the secret by Peter Pettigrew.

- Delphini uses flight as proof that she's descended from Voldemort. She was a baby when Voldemort and Snape (who both learned to fly) were killed in the Battle of Hogwarts. How would she have learned unaided flight? /Is/ it genetic? Then how the hell would Snape have it?

- Rose Weasley-Granger is a brat and bullies her own cousin Albus for being a Slytherin. The implication being that she acts like this because her parents didn't raise her right. And then it sort of makes sense when Cursed Child makes Ron into an alcoholic and Hermione into an incompetent and gullible politician who probably need marriage counseling, as per Word of JKR.

- The TROLLEY WITCH. An immortal cyborg with knife hands.

    *Trolley Witch:* I've forgotten. All I can tell you is that when the Hogwarts Express first came to be --- Ottaline Gambol herself offered me this job...

    *Scorpius:* That's --- one hundred and ninety years. You've been doing this job for one hundred and ninety years?

    *Trolley Witch:* These hands have made over six million Pumpkin Pasties. I've got quite good at them. But what people haven't noticed about my Pumpkin Pasties is how easily they transform into something else...

    */She picks up a Pumpkin Pasty. She throws it like a grenade. It explodes./*

    *Trolley Witch:* And you won't believe what I can do with my Chocolate Frogs. Never --- never --- have I let anyone off this train before they reached their destination. Some have tried --- Sirius Black and his cronies, Fred and George Weasley. ALL HAVE FAILED. BECAUSE THIS TRAIN --- IT DOESN'T LIKE PEOPLE GETTING OFF IT...

    */The Trolley Witch's hands transfigure into very sharp spikes. She smiles./*

    *Trolley Witch:* So please retake your seats for the remainder of the journey.

**** It's better than that. She's shifting 5,260 pasties per trip to have had to make six million of the things, assuming six Express runs a year (September 1, two sets of term break round trips and end of year) for 190 years.

To unload those from her trolley she has to sell them at a rate of just over twelve and a half a minute.

Faster if the train ride takes less than the fanon-standard 7 hours. (Which it can't, as the train arrives at or after sunset, which is about 8 at night on 1 September in northern Scotland, so it's more like 9 hours). But she's shifting them faster than one every five seconds from the moment the train starts until they arrive at Hogsmeade Station on a seven hour journey, and one every six seconds and a bit if it takes 9 hours.

I can think of one aspect from canon: love potions are mind altering substances that can force you to be temporarily attracted to somebody, and are sold in stores. (And nobody seems bothered by that)

Want someone dead? Give your patsy amortentia keyed to your intended victim's wife and suggest that removing the obstacle to future happiness can be achieved quite easily with just ... one... curse.

So you tell him you'll fix it, and potion the shit out of her to get her obsessed with you and keep her obsession unrequited so she drives herself to greater and greater feats of atrocity to try and 'win your heart'.

She doesn't lose her edge until you, in a moment of weakness, let her bear your child. After that she gets taken down by a /housewife/, of all things.

** The “living portraits” thing is a bit disturbing if you think about it.

Someone pointed a couple troubling aspects.

1) are they the spirits of the original, like ghosts, trapped in a painting? (doubtful)

2) if they are up to date to the time of the painting, can they be used to strip a person of all their secrets, possibly without them ever finding out?

Combine that with a bit of artistic talent and you can paint their greatest fear right there in the portrait with them, for their own personal Room 101 experience. "I've got the paint remover right here to get rid of it, all you have to do is tell me ... *everything *...."

  Harry is sick and tired of always being kept in the dark, of being lied to, and of being protected. He's had enough and he's going to take control of his life. Takes place at the summer before sixth year. HHR. Slight HBP spoilers. Some Dumbledore bashing.
