Its up to you why this series of events happen instead but what what do you think happens as a result ? Like the impact on rest of story?


** Do you mean that harry going to the department of mysteries would not happen so Voldemort would not be revealed, or that in the battle Sirius survives and voldemort escapes in time

*** you could go with either just that in the end Sirius is alive and the ministry does not acknowledge Voldemort's return going into book 6

**** Then the ministry would probably try harry for breaking into the department of mysteries and causing such destruction and sirius would be arrested as would other order members who could have been aiding sirius. Voldemort would then infiltrate the ministry like in book 7, and take over the ministry by murdering fudge. then Hogwarts will be taken with a larger force the same way as in book 6, and voldemort would rule a government such as the one under thicknesse
