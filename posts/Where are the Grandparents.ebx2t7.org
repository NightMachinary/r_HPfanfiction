I was listening to a podcast a while back that was talking about the Marauders Era and someone brought up how weird it is that we never see/hear about Harry's grandparents, and the more I think about it, the more confused I get.

Unless something drastic happened that I'm forgetting, James & Lily's parents were all alive during their time at Hogwarts...And James and Lily were what, 21? When they died?

Did all four of their parents die in four years?? I'm really just looking for some answers here because I can't imagine Mrs. Potter, the woman who took Sirius in after his family relations became too tense, being like “Oh yes, Petunia, of course a cupboard is an appropriate lodging place for you nephew!”

I know this isn't directly fanfiction related, but I'd love to hear if anyone has read any good fics that either explain some of this or change the narrative a bit so Harry actually /knows/ his grandparents.


** I believe in canon james' parents died of dragon pox shortly after he graduated?

*** That's what I found, apparently shortly after his wedding to Lily. But like...The Evans family? Who died “natural muggle deaths” .....?

It just feels incomplete lol

**** Rowling's is a good story teller horrible world builder. She has tons of problems like that all over the books. She wanted Harry growing up but failed in the basic task of thinking about grandparents, other relatives and etc... So she just said they were all dead when people started asking these basic questions and called it good.

***** She did think about Harry's family (in Philsopher's Stone he sees the whole bunch in the Mirror of Erised) but had to conceptualise them all as dead to justify his presence with the Dursleys from the beginning.

The rest of the Grandparents that should exist though, who knows. Probably just writing convenience.

And where are the extended Weasleys? Not one Hogwarts-aged Weasley cousin exists?

Pretty much. Not too surprising. Dad's got three brothers, and from them I've only got one cousin my age, the rest run the gamut from like... eight years older than me to somewhere between fifteen and twenty years. So if we attended Hogwarts there would not have been others. As for outside of Hogwarts, entirely possible that the extended family isn't very close or don't like each other too much.

**** Things we know:

For many generations, there were boys. We know Arthur had at least two brothers. Maybe Bilius is one, maybe he's a different generation...we get the picture that there's a million of them there for the wedding. It's implied that the family is known for having too many kids...is that ONLY this particular branch of the family, or the entire family? Surely it's not just /Arthur/ or the whole family wouldn't be disparaged.

But it's more than that...so, at the start of the series...Severus, Sirius, and Remus are all about 30. (Neville's parents must be close in age, too) Dumbledore is supposed to be north of 100, and Madame Marchbanks examined him in his NEWTs...and is still healthy enough to be working. Who knows how old Minerva is...she taught Scamander, which puts her north of 100 by 1990. Then there's Great Aunt Muriel, who was friends with Bathilda Bagshot, we've also got Aberforth and Grindelwald still alive at the time of the books, all 100+.

Where are the 50-60 year old grandparents? They'd have been Hagrid/Riddle's generation. Where are the 85 year old great grandparents? Where are the 110 year old great great grandparents? Surely they didn't all just have one child who had one child who had one child.

It's absolutely unfathomable that NOBODY in these books has any extended family.

** Most likely assassinated by Voldemort or died during the Grindelwald war. Voldemort's age is roughly the age of the grandparents of the students so they most likely knew him as Tom. He wanted to erase his past and what better way than killing your age group?

*** I'm pretty sure this is the right answer. Lily and James were fighting right out of school, and they were at the tail end of the war. It would mostly have been the generations before them that was fighting.
