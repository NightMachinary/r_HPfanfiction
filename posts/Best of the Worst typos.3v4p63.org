Have you ever seen a typo that's so wrong, it is almost intentional? (My Immortal aside, of course) Please share them!

I just found one today:

#+begin_quote
  He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he kicked out, connecting solidly with the surly professor's *crutch*.
#+end_quote

-Almost a Squib

/Then think about what "wand" means, like totally out of context./


** Can't remember where i read it, but...

#+begin_quote
  Harry wrapped his arms lovingly around her *waste*.
#+end_quote

Urgh.

**** Perhaps he doesn't know how to snap, and simply verbalizes instead. Infact, maybe it's a misunderstanding. I remember this book as a child that told me how to snap and clap along to songs. It would simply say /snap/ (clap) /snap/, and that'd be the order you would go with. But if someone doesn't know to snap or clap, they may think it's a lyric of a rather straight forward trible chant. And so, years from when they found this book, they will see everyone else physically snapping. And, thinking its wrong, they will exclaim the "proper" way to snap. "SNAP" they will yell to everyone. "SNAP!".

I don't think it was a typo at all. I think it was the author trying to show us a flawed and misunderstood character, who never learned how to snap...
