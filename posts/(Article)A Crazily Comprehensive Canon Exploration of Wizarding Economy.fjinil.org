Hi everyone, it's me again for this second installment (and last for a little while, phew), I was eager to take a look at wizarding economy. So, I tracked down every instance of someone mentioning a price in the books (oh yes... yes I did). This time, I'll put all the sources at the bottom, and the meat of the article up front (there is rather a lot of sources... nb:/I won't use the spoiler tag this time, so spoiler warning for the 7 hp books I guess/).

To facilitate analysis, I converted every explicit price ever mentioned to a common unit. I chose the *Knut*.

Okay, so that's a lot of data to wrap your head around. All in all... well it's not /absolutely/ horrible. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of weird inconsistencies, but I meant at least it's better then *totally random* prices... right?

Ollivander wands are apparently an absolute bargain, costing less then a 6th year potions book. I love how Harry overpaid super hard to get out of that tea shop as fast as possible. That necklace Draco bought cost him about as much as the daily prophet's lottery and the Triwizard prize money combined, and I can't help but think that he got scammed. Borgin and Burke seem to be in the business of screwing everyone pretty badly in general.

There is three instances of Hermione getting a Daily Prophet delivered at Hogwarts in book 5, she only pays 1 Knut for it every time. In our first-ever introduction to wizarding moneys, Hagrid gets Harry to pay 5 Knuts for the delivery of the Prophet. Hogwarts might have a deal with the newspaper agency? Or you pay extra for difficulties in delivery?

The priciest ingredient ever mentioned in the books is Acromantula venom, at nearly five time the price of a unicorn horn for a pint. Which sounds a bit ridiculous to me.

The Wanted prizes mentioned by Greyback are absolute lunacy. 10 Galleons for 2 mudbloods is ridiculously low, and I can just imagine Voldemort screwing his little fists in a fit and crying “I'll give anyone a billion million dollars for the capture of Harry Potter!”

As an experiment, if we consider that the price of a beer is about 5$ in a pub (I mean that's steep but let's be generous), we get 58 Knuts ~ 5$, therefore 1 Knut ~ 0.086$, so about 9 cents... but let's imagine that Aberforth is really scamming the kids and we put it at a nice even 10cents. That makes a Sickle 2.90$ and a Galleon 49.30$. So we just have to divide the Knut prices by 10, here are a few exemple:

#+begin_quote
  Daily prophet: .10/.50$

  Butterbeer: 5.80$

  Bus ride: 31.90$

  Hermione's quill: 43.70$

  Ollivander wand: 345.10$

  6th Year Potion book: 443.70$

  Hermione's birthday present: 493$

  A Unicorn Horn: 1035.30$

  Twins Common room sales: 1281$

  Fine for bewitching a car: 2465$

  Daily Prophet Lottery: 34510$

  Cursed necklace: 73950$

  Sirius/Harry Wanted: 493000$

  Voldemort tantrum: 9860000$
#+end_quote

Damn, the muggleborn dream is over everyone, apparently you gotta be flushed with cash to enter Hogwarts... I mean it /is/ a British boarding school after all.

/So here we are, I don't know if my Knut value makes any sense, but any lower and they'll basically pay you to read the Daily Prophet xD. I'm gonna head out now, here is a big wall of citation for your entertainment. Bye./

** I think this is just another point to add to the 'looking for consistency in the Harry Potter world is a fast path to madness and obsession' tally. Rowling may be able to write a world that feels magical and interesting, but she desperately needed a Continuity Editor to keep the series consistent.

I'd be really interested to see one of these where you do each book individually. See if there's any different in each book as opposed to the overarching series.

They did end up buying a huge piece of realistate in diagon alley. One of the most famous spots not too far from gringotts has to be worth massive amounts of money. Do you see the kind of traffic that place has during the summer parts of movies? And there just kids out of 6th year, think how big the wizarding world must be for some random kids in school to have scored a top retail location in the magical buisness alley and there basically doing what zonkos was doing but more? Its a little mind boggling and confusing on how that became a reality.

** I wonder...Knuts, Sickles and Galleons are literally made from bronze, silver, and gold. And 29, 17, and 493 seem like odd values.

Is it possible that Knuts, Sickles and Galleons are three separate currencies rather than one, with varying exchange rates between them and varying buying power depending on the supply of copper/tin, silver and gold? The exchange rate between Knuts and Galleons might have started off at 493-1, but over the course of the books it could have widened or narrowed.\\
With the second Voldemort war, Nicolas Flamel's death (and the destruction of the gold-making Philosopher's Stone), and ongoing mining activities, the exchange rate and prices on goods could have gone every which way.

*** Exchange rates like that are more set by law, at least in modern times (eg, the penny:dollar ratio doesn't actually depend on the price of the raw materials in the penny). Knuts/Sickles/Galleons seems to mimic the british pence/shilling/pound coinage, or at least the earlier one - which was 12p to the shilling, and 20s to the pound. The WW just made it a bit more weird, number wise ;) (though luckily has fewer coins).

My assumption is that there is some sort of reason to not melt down the coins for their metals - probably anti-tampering charms that are woven in to the creation process making it reliable as coinage in a magical world - though the events from the world cup seem to indicate that faking galleons is possible/not too difficult to pass off.

But I wouldn't mind a fic which took the exchange rate/base raw cost of the materials version you put up in your post and used that, it would give it a nice medieval feel.

** You are awesome.

But a simple quill for almost 45$, 500$ birthday presents? Ouch.

For that matter Arthur was able to pay that fine and they are considered poor?!

I want to know how the Weasleys manage to spend the entire Lottery money on a trip to Egypt.

Let's assume that a the cost of getting there is equivalent to that of a plane ticket for each person. Also let's assume that they are staying in some hotel and not with Bill.

That makes the round trip cost around 2*7*372(10% more than a wand costs)=5208$

The cost of staying in hotel, meals, entertainment, tours etc for a month would be around 1800$/person. That would be about

1800*7=12600$

So that totals to 17808$ or a little over half of the lottery price. Where did they spend rest of the money which amounts to roughly 340 Galleons go? Were they staying in the magical equivalent 5 star hotels?

*** Honestly, the Weasleys are lower-middle class, not poor. Arthur has a government job that is entry level, but seems to pay decently. They have to scrimp a bit because they have such a large family, and they're at risk of overdrawing on their bank account (or the equivalent) at least once. But on the other hand, they always have plenty of food on their table, even enough to take in a guest, and they take at least one holiday without the windfall of the lottery (Arthur, Molly, and Ginny to Romania in Book 1).

In other words, the Weasleys are poor by British boarding school standards, and Ron is poor compared with his two best friends, the daughter of two working professionals and the heir to a successful cosmetics business. But they're probably doing a fair bit better than JKR herself was when she wrote Book 1.

**** I think 'poor' vs 'lower-middle class' is something that's very hard to pin down - and heavily depends on the point of view of the person claiming it. (For instance in the US, /everyone/ wants to be middle class, so the boundary for 'lower-middle class' is set fairly low in a way).

In the case of the Weasleys, food wise they live in the countryside, and they have their own garden + orchard + chickens for food - so it seems like they grow a lot of their own food, instead of having to buy it.

In terms of purchases, we see that they have to save up a lot - not being able to afford another wand for Ron in book 2, re-using old clothing/school items, etc. They're not destitute by any means, and if they had 1-2 kids instead of 7 it's likely they'd be much more comfortable - but I don't know if that alone is /really/ enough to put them into a well-off category.

Part of what makes it difficult is the very narrow view we get of the WW and its economy - because we don't really have many points of comparison for the Weasleys in terms of wealth. I think a fanfic author can adjust them in whatever direction is appropriate for their story because of that.

**** Mr Weasley's job isn't entry level at all. Even before he's promoted he's right there in the thick of things and knows everyone. Lucius Malfoy, for example, specifically targets Ginny because of entirely ordinary aspects of Arthur's job. It's disrespected as opposed to insignificant.

The problem with the Weasleys is that the Wizarding World seems to consist of a society where almost everyone works either in the Ministry or in retail. There also appears to be no tax system whatsoever... it's entirely possible Lucius Malfoy funded the entire wizarding government (which explains /so/ much incidentally it's got to be somewhat true).

It's not even clear what exactly a Ministry job means. People like Mr Weasley are simultaneously bureaucrats and legislators... that's /canon/. Hell, often it seems like Arthur goes on the raids himself, which makes him a lot like a cop (Aurors are, after all, termed /Dark Wizard/ catchers).

The Weasleys aren't working class by our standards but nor are they middle class. They own their own home, the father is more white collar than bobby, they have well off relatives, are ingratiated in /the/ upper echelons of informal and formal society (between the Order and Ministry), their children secure what seem to be sought after jobs, the children go to school with the wealthiest members of society, the father has a personal & political rivalry with the wealthiest wizard and they have large durable household goods (the clock and the car fall in here). By our standards they're much more upper class... but of the land rich, income poor variety (beggared by tax and inheritance laws).

Applying "class" to the wizarding world is just not going to yield useful results. The Weasleys are poor is pretty much all that it makes sense to say. The entire system that underpins notions of class IRL just doesn't exist in the dystopic nightmare that is wizarding Britain.

But if we insist on applying class to the Weasleys... they're upper class. And not just because they're purebloods.

***** I never got the feeling that Arthur was a legislator. He wrote a bill that was relevant to his office (a bill that personally hurt Malfoy, at that), but legislators often don't write their own bills, while bureaucrats sometimes do--probably more in a parliamentary system, although I'm not familiar enough with it to be sure.

As for class, well, to start, you have the problem that the British notion of class is not the same as the American one, neither of which are exactly the same as economic status.

Jobs in the magical world would be a whole post in itself. Personally, I don't think it's /that/ different from the muggle world, but let's set that aside. Arthur's job may not be entry level, but it's still pretty low level. He only has one person under him; his office isn't given much space or seemingly funding; he's been passed over for promotions (not that he wants one), and most notably in terms of actual class, as you say, he's not respected by the elites.

I'll grant that the family broadly does pretty well for themselves. Most if not all of them are uncommonly intelligent or talented. You're right that they're cash-poor (something that's more common in rural areas anyway, I think). I didn't quite have that worked out before.

But I wouldn't call the Order the upper echelons, even with Dumbledore leading it. It didn't exist for the first four books (and the Weasleys weren't in the first Order), and when it did, it was a secret society of dissidents, not connected with the social or economic structure of society at large.

Well, I don't think Wizarding Britain has a legislature. The Wizengamot never does anything other than act as a court in canon... and Dumbledore's presence on it but refusal to be Minister is weird if it is a legislative body.

The important point here is that no-one appears to ask Arthur to prepare his Bill. If that was the case, Lucius would have targeted them instead of Arthur.

#+begin_quote
  he's not respected by the elites
#+end_quote

Mostly because he doesn't behave like he's meant to. He likes muggles. He doesn't want a promotion. He has a bunch of kids (in an era where few children is the norm... actually, hardly anyone appears to have relatives, especially grandparents). But when events overtake Arthur's own wishes he rises in importance quite a lot... and I think that reflects the amount of respect his department has in terms of its power rather than its social capital. It's a bit like internal revenue... lots of power, no respect.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think we have to remember that wizarding Britain is a dystopia (not, I think, intentionally but it is very much a dystopia when you look at what we know of it). There's a reason why the Order exists and spends its time infiltrating the Ministry (just like the Death Eaters)... there's no alternative way of doing things (that we meet).

It's pretty obvious that the Death Eaters are a Nazi analogue, but one of the most fundamental things about the NSDAP is that they were a political party. That there is no "official" political arm to Voldemort's cause really makes me think there's no room for it to exist.

I don't, for example, think the Minister is elected in any way shape or form. It seems, to me, to be a process of affirmation; as long as everyone believes the Minister has the support of everyone, the Minister remains in power. And as soon as that support goes? There's no election or any other event that allows the Minister to engage with the public at large. Fudge's actions make so much more sense from this perspective, Scrimgeour's ascension and actions likewise fit in here and, of course, the way that Dumbledore was always having to turn the post down. Shacklebolt's ending up as Minister also fits in here.

Now... it's obviously important that the Weasleys weren't part of the Order the first time (which I ignored before), but Molly's brothers were. I guess that might play into the whole "rich Prewetts and poor Weasleys" dynamic that Muriel's tiara rather implies but direct familial connections to people like Muriel is sort of another line of evidence, now that I think about it.

American class is much more closely tied to economic status, I think. Having a double barrelled name is not a class signifier in the States but it is in Britain (e.g. listen to Elton John's All the Young Girls Love Alice). But I think even British class notions break down completely when trying to coerce Harry Potter into them (nebulous though class distinctions are).

*** Being able to scrounge up $2500 for a fine doesn't mean you aren't still poor - it could have been all or most of their savings, for instance, or they could have gotten help. Their vault at the start of CoS had 1 Galleon and 58 Sickles - $217 by the OP's numbers.

What appears to be the case, in my opinion, is that they're poor because they have so many children. Arthur's salary - plus their inheritance, like the Burrow + its land - would probably be easily able to provide for 2 kids. But with so many, and at least /some/ decent chunk of their cash wasted on fines and side projects, they have to re-use a bunch of stuff for the younger kids.

The fact that they splurged on the trip after winning the jackpot is a sign that they really aren't great with money - so that probably plays some role in it too. But I think even despite that they'd clearly not be well off.

For the trip, I assume the costs would have been higher (travel wise) in the 90s compared to today - but I think it's likelier that they didn't /really/ spend it all on the trip, JKR just didn't bother itemizing everything. It's certainly possible that costs are higher in the WW for hotels and food and the like, since it's a smaller community with less travel than the muggle world.

**** Yeah, because it's completely terrible to take children who otherwise never get nice things on an overseas holiday.

Get some perspective.

A windfall isn't going to change your life if you don't have to pay bills, a mortgage/rent, fix durable goods or repair broken things. The Weasleys face none of these problems and appear to live in a society that doesn't have interest, let alone notable investment options.

That lottery could only be spent. And while you might say "but they could have spent it on new robes". That shit's really not at all important or meaningful. The money did not have the capacity to change their lives because as far as we can tell the only time they struggled was for seasonal purchases in a family where those expenses had /already/ maxed out (i.e. Percy's final year).

Unless you're honestly going to sit there and say second hand stuff is so awful it's better than visiting a brother you haven't seen in years? Second hand stuff is not that bad.

The last money related problem we encounter is Ron's Dress Robes. That's a bit like buying an insurance policy specifically to cover being struck by lightning whilst fishing wearing a tutu.

For a real family, it's silly. There's a reason why poor families don't go on overseas holidays, there is always something more important. But for a family that can magic away most of the issues associated with money and which faces an expected decrease in expenses? Nope. It's an entirely sensible decision... unless someone is averse to second hand goods (and as far as we can tell, it's only Ron that is).

****** You don't understand how it works, do you? You're probably one of those privileged little people who goes away to uni and treats it as a temporary holiday into poverty before graduating and being rich (read: being able to save money). All those povo student stereotypes? That's a lot of peoples' entire lives.

Let's look at things more closely... what extravagances do we see the Weasleys engage in? As far as we can tell their only expenses are food and school related. They barely cover these costs. But they also don't seem to have any other expenses (aside, for a time, possibly petrol). We don't see them buying clothes they don't need. We don't see them eating fancy food (and we do know they've got food production on the property). Maybe they blew all their money way back when on their clock, but I doubt it. The impression I get is that it's an heirloom of some description. If they bought it they'd either know it was one of a kind (and Molly implies it isn't) or be able to ask who else has one.

Are we going to start talking about secret gambling problems or other "hidden" expenses? Because, if we aren't, we're back at the same problem... holiday or not?

Also, holidays are massively expensive. Have you done a holiday on a tight budget? As in, "if we buy this, are we going to have enough money when we get back" tight? Or, hmm, we might need this cash for the petrol to get home, tight? Somehow I doubt it.

[[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ev3dde/most-money-advice-is-worthless][Bad budgeting is an anti-poor myth.]] Not having cash isn't a reason to not act human when you have it. If you don't? You die. Either slowly or quickly.

This could have been something JKR explored or at least justified.

This is actually a pretty funny situation. The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office would be the one in charge of issuing a fine for illegally bewitching a muggle car.

Arthur Weasley is the head of that office.

I.E., Arthur, honorable law-abiding man that he is, seems to have issued himself a fine and paid it.

Now, depending on how the MoM does its accounting, that fine could very well have been collected by the department issuing it rather than the Ministry's general Treasury.

In such a case, Arthur's fine may likely have been directly added to his own department's operating budget. A budget which he has discretion over the use of.

Its entirely possible that Arthur's tiny little department suddenly decided to comp its employees' lunch expenses for a few months or something to that effect after that fortunate windfall of a fine.

** Good write up! I'd always felt like JK Rowling had basically forgotten about sickles and knuts by the middle of the series and just started using galleons as the base currency with sickles and knuts as vague change even though it didn't fit super well. This gives some interesting clarification.

Book 1: 4/6 references include things other than galleons

Book 2: 1/3

Book 3: 1/4

Book 4: 3/7

Book 5: 3/12

Book 6: 1/10

Book 7: 0/3

So while it's not as bad as I remember, the indication is there that galleons became like pounds and sickles and knuts became like vague pence. Most of the references after book 2 that use sickles or knuts are used to highlight one of two things, exactness on the part of the Weasely twins (their bet with Ludo, their charging of Ron) or the general cheapness of something. If not serving one of those purposes, JK was far more likely to simply go with galleons.

This is most likely due to the movies, which I am pretty sure hardly mention sickles and knuts at all.

I did something similar to this once, though I just went off of the things I could remember rather than searching for every reference. I came up with $50 to the galleon as well, using the daily prophet as a guide rather than a beer.

There is also evidence to suggest that Ollivander collects his ingredients himself:

Twelve and a quarter inches ... ash ... pleasantly springy. It's in fine condition. ... You treat it regularly?”

But that still doesn't make much sense anyway, unless he's really not a all concerned by money and just barely recuperate his costs (and maybe not even that). He'd be a sort of philanthropist wand-maker who just wish for everyone to have a well-suited wand that actually chose them.

Coin and metal ratios:

1 Galleon = 17 Sickles = 493 Knuts [1 Sickle = 29 Knuts] or roughly the purchasing difference of

G = $24.65 | S = $1.45 | K = $.05

20th century floating average of Gold:Silver value by weight (despite being set as 1:15 by Revolution-era US govt) is ~1:47

The historical (like since birth of Christ) Silver:Copper ratio is ~1:110

Assuming the goblins would abide by something near these practical ratios...:\\
.1 oz Au ~= 4.7 oz Ag\\
1.0 oz Ag ~= 110 oz Cu\\
.1 oz Gold ~= 517 oz Cu\\
A single .1 oz Gold Galleon == 17 x .275 oz Silver Sickles == 493 x 1.05 oz Cu/Bronze Knuts

.1 oz Gold Galleons (slightly less than the mass of an old penny) == 17 x .275 oz Silver Sickles (mass roughly like a Susan B Anthony dollar coin) == 493 x 1.05 oz Cu/Bronze Knuts (20% heavier than an Ike silver dollar)

Since a Washington quarter weighs ~.2 oz, those hubcap-sized [more like drink coaster-sized] coins were actually Knuts!

"Err... keep the change."

Or... a 'bronze' Knut is .03 oz silver + .194 oz copper, a substance known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_bronze][Corinthian Bronze]]

As we're talking about relative purchasing power, the actual valuable metal content in goblin-made coins may be half of what's represented, the other half counted as anti-forgery charms and craftsmanship. Either that or they run the conversion from muggle cash at twice the metal value. A Galleon may be .1 oz of gold, but it may cost you $80 to buy one in the 90's when gold traded ~ $400/oz.

*** *Corinthian bronze*

Corinthian bronze, also named Corinthian brass or æs Corinthiacum, was a highly valuable metal alloy in classical antiquity. It is thought to be an alloy of copper with gold or silver (or both), although it has also been contended that it was simply a very high grade of bronze, or a kind of bronze that was manufactured in Corinth. It is referred to in various ancient texts, but no certain examples of Corinthian bronze exist today. However, it has been increasingly suggested that a number of artefacts previously described as niello in fact use a technique of patinated metal that may be the same as Corinthian bronze and is similar to the Japanese Shakudō.Long a mystery, contemporary thinking is that Corinthian bronze was "a patinated alloy of copper with some gold and silver", perhaps the same as the hesmen kem or "black copper" of Ancient Egyptian art.
