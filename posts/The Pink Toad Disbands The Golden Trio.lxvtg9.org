What if any group over two is considered too large by the Educational Decrees? Delores takes advantage and uses her power to stop learning AND friendship!


** Actually, this is possibly canon--if memory serves, the Decrees forbid the regular meeting of "three or more students."

Hermione, Harry and Ron doing their homework together would possibly qualify.

*** Let's be honest if anyone wanted to stretch or take word for word, then they shouldn't attend classes, go to dorms or have meals in great hall and yet... I actually remember one fic(not name of it) where Harry does exactly that and Umbritch is forced to retract or reword her decrees

**** Actually, I think the decree specified meetings that were outside of classes.

**** If you think about it the DA was also technically allowed since it wasn't regular, it was kept random and often rescheduled due to Quidditch practices

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five
