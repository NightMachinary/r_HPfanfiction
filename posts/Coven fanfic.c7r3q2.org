  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

** The two that come to mind are: Coven by Naidhe linkao3(Coven by Naidhe) and The Reclamation of Black Magic by ShayaLonnie linkao3(The Reclamation of Black Magic). Both are still WIP. The former centres around Hermione and Pansy, while the second is set in a world where Dorea Black ends up waking up from a coma after having dragon pox and wants to restore her house. Enjoy!

*** Coven was supposed to be the one in my post, but i accidentally pasted the wrong number. As for Reclamation, it seems like it'd revolve heavily around the Black Family and pureblood society, which I'm not overly fond of, but I'll check it out. Thanks!

**** I figured the link posted was not correct, though I was hoping you were referencing another one so I could add it to my queue. Reclamation presents covens as an old tradition. She spends a lot of time opposed to the MoM and Dumbledore. She is really big on educating incoming Muggleborns about magical society. I like her world building.

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled. "And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore." (Dark)
