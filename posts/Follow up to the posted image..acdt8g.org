[[https://imgur.com/gallery/j1LfF6R][“Dadfoot”]]

I want to see other people's response to this little bit of text. I'm going to add how I see things going, but I want to know how others think this would turn out. If you want to expand on my idea, please go ahead as well.

I think that Sirius would sputter in shock for a few minutes, maybe overdramatize a look of betrayal. But ultimately he would accept it and even embrace it and insist Harry call him dadfoot instead. And he keeps making dad jokes. And I think Remus just groans because he created a monster! And I think Remus avoids calling Sirius dadfoot unless it's in return for being called moomy. Until one day, Harry has a bad day and is super upset and Remus can't get him to cheer up or talk so he goes to ask Harry if he wants padfoot. Except he goes to say “your godfather” and “padfoot” at the same time and instead asks “Do you want me to go get your dadfoot?” And Harry bursts into laughter because Remus never uses that nickname unprompted. Remus decides maybe it isn't that bad.


** Dadfoot is funny but I find "dogfather" even more amusing
