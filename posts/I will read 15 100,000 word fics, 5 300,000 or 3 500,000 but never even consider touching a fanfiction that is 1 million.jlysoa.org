Why


** I find that with fics over a million words, a lot could easily lose 300k+ words and improve.

*** Oh yeah, many fics with a real high word count have a lot of repeated exposition (like bashing rants and ‚Äúhey new friend let me tell you my life story‚Äù) or canon rehashing

**** They reach the natural climax of the story at about 200k words, start coasting towards the conclusion, and 900k words later they still haven't reached it.....

** I love long fics, generally don't touch 100,000 or lower, but 1 million seems excessive. I love Prince Of Slytherin, but at well over 800,000 words some parts did get drawn out far too long closer to the beginning.

However, unlike what [[/u/potpotkettle][u/potpotkettle]] is saying, I will almost always have 3/4 fics on the go at a time, without counting the published fiction I pick up along the way.

*** Prince of Slytherin is one of the perfect examples on why one fic probably shouldn't include multiple Hogwarts years.

**** I mean, it doesn't? The first year is Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, the second is Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy, the third is Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace, the fourth is Harry Black and the Resurrection Game and the fifth one will be [Redacted] and the Boy Who Lived (with most readers guessing that "redacted" will be Jim.

** I dunno. When I first got into fanfiction and had a few 'discontinued' fics burn me, I went into a kind of opposite direction, just reading the longest fics available so that I'd hopefully get bored before it 'discontinued'. Yeah it worked. Generally any fics over 1 mill words have to be lengthened artificially and while it /can/ work well in an 'arc' style, usually it just betrays bad writing endless filler. So yeah, nowadays the sweet spot for me is 100k - 300k for fics, and if I find a good one which goes even higher than that I'm really happy. But unless I /Know/ a 300k+ fic is highly recommended I won't bother starting it, just a waste of time and sunk cost fallacy etc. Even if it's shit I'd try and power through long after I should have quit. That's what happened the first time I tried to read 'Harry Crow' and absolute shit fic which relied heavily on filler and straight up repeated the same scene 10 times with munro differences. I wasted hours reading that trash before finally letting it go.

*** Robst has to be the worst fucking popular author on the site. Every story is the same. I get so disappointed when I read an interesting description, read a couple chapters; it's shit and then I read the fucking author. ROBST!!! I was the same with harry crow, it was so unique at first and then they got to Hogwarts and literally nothing happens.

** In most cases, the story is just going to be extremely bloated with tons of filler that just doesn't matter. And the quality of a story is really determined by the sum of its parts.

** While it isn't a Harry Potter fanfiction I am currently reading a different fanfiction which has six or seven parts with EACH part having over a million words. In my opinion it is completely worth it. I get that it can get pretty boring if the story is drawn out so that a certain number of words is reached, but this phenomenon definitely doesn't occure in every ff.

** I'm hesitant at 200,000 and terrified at 500,000 these days. It's hard for a long long story to not be repetitive. I gave up on the original Rowling books for that reason. Year 1: defeat a Voldemort plot. Year 2: defeat another Voldemort plot. Years 3, 4, 5, 6: same same. Year 7: same and also finally kill the poor schlub to put him out of his misery. Ok fine, but maybe the middle 5 years could have been skipped.

** Most fics that I've read of such length were only long for the sake of word count, at least in the beginning so I gave up on them. Then there were the ones that start out OK but become shitty later on and I am not ready to invest that much time in something that later on turns out disappointing. My usual go to is less than 300,000 unless I know the author is really good (I don't consider RobSt a good author) who you can really trust not to fuck up the story along the way.
