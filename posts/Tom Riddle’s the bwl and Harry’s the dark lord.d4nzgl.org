Ahh I can't remember what the title was but the story went something like this: Harry somehow time travels back to 1940 in a different universe and meets Tom Riddle who's apparently the boy who lived (but Harry doesn't know that yet) and everyone's sorta scared around him because he looks like the dark lord except Harry doesn't know that because he's blind (not literally-)

Also all the houses are kinda swapped in a way like Slytherin's the main “good” house while in Gryffindor it's, well y'know, the opposite

Any help on finding this fanfic? Or just some similar to Harry time traveling to another dimension somehow to find some messed up stuff happening in that dimension?


** I know this fic.

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
