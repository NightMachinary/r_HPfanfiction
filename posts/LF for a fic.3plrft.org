The fic is about Harry and Hermione having an affair, despite marrying Ginny and Ron like in canon. They meet In secret over the years. Hugo and Rose are born but are actually Harry's children. Harry tries to leave Ginny, but she reveals she knew about the affair the whole time. Harry dissappears with Gabrielle for awhile. Also Al is gay in the end. Ring any bells?
