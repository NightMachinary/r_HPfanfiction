** linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li) had that, though those were House teams.

HPMOR is probably the closest to what you are looking for, with teams formed without regard for Houses.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

** I've seen this actually though I can't remember the name. Harry as Defense Professor set up an arena to fight in using 'paint' jinxes. Teaches aiming, dodging, etc. Even made the teams Slytherin/Griffyndor vs Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff. Make rivals work together or be crushed by Claws and Puffs.

  "Dueling?" said the Defense Professor. From behind it wasn't visible if the pale face was smiling. "That is nothing, Lord Greengrass, to what my students have learned. They have learned not to hesitate in the face of ambushes and greater foes. They have learned to adapt when combat conditions change and change again. They have learned to protect their allies, to protect more those who are more valuable, to abandon pieces which cannot be rescued. They have learned that to survive they must follow orders. Some have even learned a little creativity. Oh, no, Lord Greengrass, /these/ wizards will not hide in their manors and wait to be protected, when the next threat comes. They will know that they know how to fight."

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
