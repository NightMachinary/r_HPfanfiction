Well, i remember it had Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna going to an AU where they met the Potters, Dumbledore, maybe Sirius... They were all very close together, and kinda crazy too, and i remember they went back to their old world to fght Voldemort.

Also, another fic where Harry and Hermione suddenly arrive at Hogwarts, and I think Sirius was a professor, or something along those lines...


** Should be /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]/ (WL 94,563; Complete).

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
