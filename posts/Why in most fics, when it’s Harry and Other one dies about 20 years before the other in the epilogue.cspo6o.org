*** In a lot of epilogues or time travel stories, were Harry reaches old age, he either dies younger or his wife dies younger, why do the authors choose this action

**** Well for Time Travel it's usually one of two reasons:

1. So he has a reason to go back in time to try to live out a full life with his significant other.
2. So he is free to pursue a relationship with another person of the author's choosing.

I haven't experienced this overly much in epilogues.
