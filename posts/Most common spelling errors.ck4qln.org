** Imperious instead of imperius. The first is an adjective meaning "haughty" or "pretentious"; the second is the name of a mind control spell. I think this happens because "imperius" isn't in the spell-check dictionary and the other word is.

Incidentally, "imperio" is a misspelling of the latin verb "impero," which means "I command." If the correct spelling had been taken, and the incantation -> spell name pattern used elsewhere held true here, it'd be the "imperatus curse" rather than what we actually got.

** The standouts are: alter instead of altar, hanger/hangar, lie/lay/lay (lie down, lay down, lay eggs), and whom. These are especially annoying because the author is using a word that they don't know enough to use and breaks the fantasy, why would you keep a plane in a hanger??

Other typical native speaker grammatical errors (homophones): then/than, affect/effect, you're/your.

*If you're having difficulty with these, it's usually because you learned to speak/listen before writing and reading. Just google some exercises online that will train your brain to distinguish them.
