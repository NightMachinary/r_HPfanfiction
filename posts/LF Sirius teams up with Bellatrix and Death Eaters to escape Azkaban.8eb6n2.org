Any fics (though no slash) where Sirius has to team up with Bellatrix and other imprisoned Death Eaters (or just other convicts in general) in order to escape. They go on the run and despite that he doesn't join them.


** Damn it, I upvoted this thread in the morning, and there's still nothing! Agh! Sirius' unlawful imprisonment, abandonment by everyone he knew, and the subsequent decade of misery in Azkaban is like prime material for an AU with Dark!Sirius. I know that's a bit beyond what OP was asking for, but anyone? Anyone?

** The only two fics I've seen with anything close to this are Seventh Horcrux and Like a Red-Headed Stepchild. I too would love to read more.
