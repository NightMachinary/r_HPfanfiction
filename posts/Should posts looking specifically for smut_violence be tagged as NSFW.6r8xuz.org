Sure, they're usually obvious, but this is one of the only subs I've been to that doesn't flair NSFW content.

EDIT: Whoever marked this as NSFW made me snort-chuckle.

** No. For a simple reason of we aren't posting nsfw content, we are requesting, recommending, discussing, or criticizing stories that are nsfw.

The difference being, if a person is reading the posts, most of them will only see a series of recommendations, or a discussion, or a request. not an image, or such.

Violence shouldn't be marked nsfw unless its graphic, and if you are asking for graphic violence in this subreddit all you have to say is that HPMOR and the Cursed Child are the best works of fiction to ever be written, or something like My Immortal was actually good. (I kid of course). In all seriousness, whats the point? Our mod team does a damn good job keeping the trash away, and adding an NSFW tag requirement just seems like unnecessary work for them, along side everything else they do for us. Sure we could say that it has to be flaired correctly or the bot autodeletes the post, but again, whats the point? It is purely a text based medium, and if it isnt, then it should be in a link in the text box anyway, not posted directly here.

** To throw out my own opinion, I don't think it should matter.

This sub is almost entirely block text and I can't remember a single time somebody has looked over my shoulder and decided to read a mass of words. If we had more images that were clearly nsfw I'd say yes. As it is even smut requests are tame compared to some of the jokes that get thrown around my office.

** NSFW tags are automatic when the phrase is included in the post title.

NSFW content doesn't /have/ to be flaired. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. This actually led to a pretty heated debate a few months ago, as a proposed rule change(which pissed much of the sub off) included stricter enforcement of NSFW guidelines that have never been enforced. /At all/.

The HPMOR hate is especially hilarious to me.

****** I think most of the hate for HPMOR comes from the dislike of the author. You'll hear a bunch of reasons why people don't like HPMOR, but no one really criticizes fics that do similar things and have more likable authors.

So far as not liking Eliezer Yudkowsky goes, I suppose I can understand that. I've never personally looked into why people dislike him, but if he's an asshole he's an asshole, you know?

******* Honestly my main dislike is the fic takes itself waaaay too seriously yet simultaneously not seriously enough. The masturbatory tracts and smug attacks on canon are just unpleasant storytelling. Not that canon is beyond criticism but come on, you're not a genius for pointing out inconsistencies in a children's fantasy series. At the same time the fic just reads like a series of episodes where the goal is to see how smart the author can tell the audience he is. The humor isn't exceptional, the science is bad, and the story is a mess.

If it was a serious and tightly wound plot with interesting conflicts and tension it might be a good read. If it was an irreverent mess poking around at the limits of magic it would be fun. Instead it tries to do both at once and ends up being much worse off for it.

Also he likes inserting overly casual references to rape into his stories waaaay too much. It's creepy and tasteless.

*********** Yeah I think MoR has a ton going for it - his Voldemort + aliases is one of the best out there. What I think hurts it (and lots of other rationalist fics) is that it sacrifices good storytelling in order to show off how much the author knows/thinks he knows. It could have been a great 30-40 chapter epic, not the 120 chapter monstrosity it is.

******* I think part of that reasoning may be because Eliezer Yudkowsky never had a high school or college education and is self-taught. I guess people don't consider that a "valid" way to gain qualification in the fields he specializes in?

On the one hand, it could just be hate due to the fic becoming very popular very quickly. People love to hate. On the other hand, it could be due to the author being a dick.

Not that I'm standing on either side of the fence, but could you imagine /being/ the author? The amount of pure vehemence I've seen thrown at him over a stupid little story is insane. I could see myself being pretty dickish too after a while lol.
