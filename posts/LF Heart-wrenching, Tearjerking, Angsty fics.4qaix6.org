The title says it all. I've been reading too much fluff and pwp and need to read something that's very emotional. It can be about anything.

Characters/pairings don't matter, but I'd prefer something that isn't H/G or R/Hr.

** */Time Heals All Wounds/* by *brightsilverkitty:* a beautifully written Hermione/Bellatrix fic that explores the ramifications and consequences of time travel. The fun moments are wonderful to read, the angst is written marvellously, and it includes a rather accurate portrayal of a severe depressive episode.

*/Shadow Walks/* by *lorien829:* a great Harmony fic involving dimensional travel and tons of angst, but with a happy ending. And surprisingly (for Harmony fics), there's no bashing whatsoever!

*/The Changeling/* by *Annerb:* the best Slytherin!Ginny fic ever written, possibly even the best Ginny-centric fic ever written. Compared to the above two fics, it doesn't have /as much/ angst, but it's a real trip to read, and the writing is simply superb. It's incomplete, but I have no doubt that the author is working on the next part.

** The best of these imo is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/473335/chapters/819506][Twist of Fate by Oakstone730]] - Linkao3(473335). In this fic, Harry and Draco have a beautiful, albeit young love, relationship 4th and 5th year at Hogwarts that they have to keep secret. Then for Harry's protection in the war, Snape forces Draco to erase all of Harry's memories of them being together. The story pics up after the war at the trials when Harry finds out. It is so heartbreaking and beautiful. This story is expertly woven into the fabric of canon so much so that part of me wants to imagine that this IS canon, but it is also pretty heartbreaking... If you're not big on slash, this fic is very angsty with the slash, but it's T so not really graphic at all. I usually don't cry when I read fics, but this one was just so sad at parts.

Some other great ones are:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/852061][Kiss the Joy Until the Sun Rise]] - This is a beautiful fic where Harry and Draco both seek refuge in the RoR after the war and slowly heal together. Weirdly, it felt very in character even though it was slash - of course they hated eachother at first and the progression was slow and believable. And the plot device of what/who was "real" was heartbreaking, original and beautifully done.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164/chapters/527529][Eclipse]] - In this fic, Draco abducts Harry from school and takes him to the dungeon at Malfoy Manor to wait for voldermort. He undergoes a huge (and very understandable and well written) character change and decides to betray the Death Eaters and escapes with Harry. They go on a long camping trip to try to walk back to hogwarts and slowly become friends and then even more slowly, develop feelings for one-another. This fic was such an emotional rollercoaster!

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4707098][If the Sun Goes Black]] and the prequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6264406/chapters/14353156][There Is Always the Moon]] are super angsty and great. Read them in the order of If the Sun Goes Black first because otherwise the plot twists are nowhere near as good.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/495908][Friend Like Me]] and the companion piece [[http://archiveofourown.org/external_works/186520][Friend Like You]] are also really heartbreaking angst fests. Friend like me is a haunting and beautiful short that goes in depth into a daydream that Draco has where he and Harry became friends first year. It is really sad and really beautifully written. The companion piece is from Harry's POV.

  Draco's life after the war is everything he wanted it to be: it's simple, and quiet, and predictable, and safe. But when a mysterious curse shatters the peace he'd worked so hard to build, there's only one person he can trust to help him. After all, Harry Potter has saved his life before. Now Draco has to believe that Potter will be able to do it one more time. (A remix of If the Sun Goes Black by pasdexcuses)

  With the perverse clarity of nostalgia, Harry remembers everything that was. The trouble is, he can't recall anything that is.

  "You're dead, Potter... I'm going to make you pay..."  Draco swore his revenge on Harry for Lucius's imprisonment, and Harry all but laughed at him. But Draco is planning more than schoolyard pranks this time. The old rivalry turns deadly when Draco abducts Harry for Voldemort. It's the perfect plan, guaranteeing revenge, power, and prestige, all in one blow. But when Draco's world turns upside down, the fight to save himself and Harry begins, and the battle will take them both through hell and back. If they come back.

**** I know right!? I read it months ago but it has stuck with me. It is one of my favorites, if not my favorite fic of all time. Did you read Dumbledores letter in the "extras"? It was so well done.
