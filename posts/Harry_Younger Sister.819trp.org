** ...do you mean Harry and his little sister, or Harry/little sister? Because the distinction is VERY important.

  Lily and James Potter secretly had another child: a daughter, immediately after Harry. She has an empathic link with her brother, and can feel what he feels. Her existence has changed the fate of the world around her. What is it like, growing up in the shadow of the Boy Who Lived? AU.

** There's "Potters against the world", which has Harry/his twin sister/Gabrielle with some time travelling shenanigans. Definitely the closest I can think of.

PS: If you are looking for non-romantic/sexual stories, use & instead of /. / indicates a pairing, & a non-sexual relationship like a friendship or a family bond.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
