I would prefer no Harry/Cho and a positive Marietta


** I have always dreamed about a story, where Harry wouldn't be such an idiot going only for the fast first kiss, but he would decided to stick it out with Cho until she gets through her grieving for Cedric. I know, it is unrealistic (and poor Cho was meant by JKR just a stepping stone on his way towards Ginny), but when the seventeen year old can put down his life for others, is it more realistic than him staying and supporting beautiful crying girl?

Harmionians are angry about the perceived bad treatment Hermione got in HBP, but nobody stands for the poor Cho Chang.

*** Cho Chang and Lavender Brown are two hugely (unjustly) maligned and underrated girls. Their in-story actions are a lot more sympathetic than that nobody Daphne Greengrass.

We need a fic with Harry/Cho and Ron/Lavender pairings.

**** The fandom malgins so many classmates of Harry's ( many of whom were in the DA and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts ) for having the audacity to act like teenagers .

In a just world,the DA members would have the dizzying amounts of popularity the Ice Queen gets

*** No gonna lie, Cho x Harry is something I rooted for as a kid. I was actually kind of sad that it got axed so quickly in the book, I was kind of hoping for them to get back together once Cho could actually appreciate Harry.
