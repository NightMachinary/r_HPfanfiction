You know, where Dumbledore mentors Harry and they become really good friends of some sort. There's loads of missed opportunity there and I rarely find good ones. Where they have a very good relationship as mentor and student, with lots of badass magic going on, travelling around the world and meeting new people as his protégé. With Dumbledore in character.

I've already read Magicks of the Arcane, The Merging and The Life He Leads. As well as By The Diving Light and its sequel.

It's been a while since I last read it, and the first-person perspective is a bit annoying, but the Dumbledore interaction in it is nice.

******* Except our morality hasn't been tied to pure survival in thousands of years. People have been /gay/ for thousands of years. Hell, in many cultures it was perfectly acceptable until the emergence of the more modern religions. So I'm quite unsure how you've reached the conclusion that the anti-gay morality is tied to evolution.

FYI - Animals gay-love fuck all the time, bro. Are you going to tell me that we're more closely tied to our instincts and evolutionary patterns than they are?

******** You're not getting my point.

You're thinking of survival in terms of a daily struggle to stay alive, but that's not what I mean when I talk about evolutionary pressures. Survival - that is, natural selection - has never been "paused", and never will be. The criteria for it may change, but the core principle of nature selecting for certain traits through reproduction will always be a fundimental part of the human condition. We have not "conquered" or "stopped" evolution.

To think that these biological instincts which have manifested themselves in many societies will simply go away because, hey, it's 2018 now, is simply ridiculous. At the end of the day, we are all genes expressed in an environment.

I never made the argument that being gay isn't natural, in that it doesn't happen in nature. That was never my position. Of course it happens in nature, but as an anomaly, not as a rule, because of course, the animals that don't reproduce don't leave a line of descent and don't propagate their genes. I wasn't using the nature fallacy, and neither should you, because I can just as easily say, "well, animals eat their own shit in nature, hence it's good".

It's /implicitly/ tied to evolution.

Yes, there have been societies where these sort of relationships haven't been so frowned upon, like in Ancient Greece.

At the same time, also in Ancient Greece, they didn't particularly frown upon what we'd consider to be pedophilia today, so you kind of made my point for me.

I didn't say that being gay is good because animals do it. I said that implying being gay goes against an evolutionary perspective on morality is ridiculous because being gay is something that happens in nature - beings which have no concept of morality and care only for survival perform /gay sex/ with no matter of irregularity.

This is silly. You could make the argument that so long as people are having offspring that natural selection will always continue. The problem with your statement is that humans stopped producing offspring for /evolutionary purposes/ literally /thousands of years ago/.

We've *LONG* since passed the point where we choose our mates based off of anything more than social purposes and, more recently, love.

As a matter-a-fact, people who choose to (or are forced to, in the case of gay couples) adopt are likely sticking to your imagined ideal of natural selection more than non-gay couples. Imagine it - CHOOSING who you want to nurture and have for your offspring. Perhaps it's not a natural form of selection, but it's the next closest thing we, realistically, have.

Men are constantly selecting for traits, women are constantly selecting for traits, and the environment always affects the manifestation of these traits. Reproduction is the core mechanism of natural selection.

If you don't understand this very basic tenet of evolution - if you don't understand what natural selection even *is* - then I don't see any point in continuing this conversation.

From this position, it doesn't make sense to say I was comparing the two, because at the baseline, no action is inherently, objectively amoral, including homosexuality, including murder. Obviously, I'm not comparing homosexuality with murder here, right? All I was doing is taking a more realistic look at morality in general. Do you see what I'm saying?

He is really open and up-front about some of his own flaws and paths to power, but still has that /distinct/ tone of mysterious and secretive old wizard. He tells Harry about his similarities to Riddle, and his worries about Harry potentially abusing his powers pretty early. He similarly allows Harry access to a lot of magical materials whilst still very obviously observing everything he reads.
