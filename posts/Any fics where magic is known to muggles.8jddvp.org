** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8465414/1/Agent-Potter][Agent Potter]], linkffn(8465414): MI6 had a magical division, and it had enlisted both Sirius and Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942): Harry actively enlisted help from the UK government in his war against Voldemort and Goblins.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): At the end of the first war, the PM of UK was disgusted about what went on in Magical Britain, and she initiated a top secret program to infiltrate and enlist support from Magicals. Their first target: Harry Potter. This fic is the first installment of a series, and ended with [[/spoiler][a disorderly collapse of the SoS and the Ministry declaring its allegiance to Voldemort]]. Its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12769659/1/Nymphadora-Tonks-The-Last-Auror][Nymphodora Tonks, the Last Auror]], linkffn(12769659), is still in progress.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Hermione's revolution and systematic liquidation of Magical Britain's establishment enraged other European pureblood regimes. To even the odds, she used a loophole to enlist large number of Muggle special force soldiers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): The UK government paid more attention to what went on in the Magical world, and they intervened in several decisive events. Chapter 5 and 6 are a lot fun.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/The-Voyage-of-the-Starship-Hedwig][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): The Muggles had enough of Magicals hurting them with impunity, so after decades of top secret preparations, they surprised and killed off most Magicals. Harry led only one thousand wizards and witches left to a new planet. This story held lots of promise, and the author had some really great ideas, but suffered from poor execution.

--------------

FInally, there is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), where the SoS collapsed in 2009 and chaos broke out all over the world. Harry used this opportunity to make his bid for power. Voldemort abandoned his Death Eaters, adopted the identity of 'Mentor', and established a much larger power base in Germany [[/spoiler][and in Russia later]].

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world.

  The Statue of Secrecy has fallen. Voldemort has returned, and with the backing of the Ministry of Magic has declared war on the Muggle world. Dumbledore has been defeated and is retreating into hiding. Out of the entire Auror Corps, one woman is making a stand. Together with Her Majesty's Armed Forces, Tonks must somehow defeat the Dark Lord and his forces as war erupts everywhere.

Of course I would have read the spoiler anyway, but really...

huh looks like spoilers are done with this instead now... >!test!<

Edit: Yeah, apparently it's a different spoiler mechanic altogether, though it still works on classic reddit so yay I guess.
