*** This dumbledore wouldn't be comically evil (as that would preclude him from taking on Harry as his protege), so he would likely understand that the future belongs to the young, not men from the 19th century like him. He would additionally be smart enough (as he is in canon) to avoid making any sort of cultural statement - as he would be MASSIVELY disconnected from the zeitgeist on account of being incredibly old.

Ergo, his "goals" would be less idiotic than lots of stories paint them - they would be utilitarian, universal; stuff like "ensure no dark lord gets access to horcrux magic ever again" or "make sure voldemort is dead for good before I die" or "make sure the wizarding world continues embracing muggleborn" instead of stupid shit like "make sure harry marries random girl #2 instead of random girl #1" or "make Harry weak af so he gets stronger? And defeats voldemort?"

Honestly not sure if you could call this Dumbledore Manipulative, even. A slippery bastard through and through, but not meddling or petty. He would be an amalgamated politician who plays into a mask of naiveté but hides plans beneath plans, often decades long, slowly steering the Wizarding World against the other side, where people like Malfoy do the same thing.

This could make an awesome "mask off" scene for Harry. He goes to confront Dumbledore, and the man himself reveals just a tiny fragment of his plans, including how Harry played exactly into them without even knowing it, what Harry's actions caused and prevented, what sort of opportunities arose and which of these Dumbledore used in turn. and then he offers him a place as his apprentice.

It also addresses one of my main problems with majority of indy!Harry fics. The fact that a supposed child can out-think, out-smart and out-manipulate a master of the game, a person that has been in the business for ages and have possibly most of the country under his thumb or admiring him in some way or form.

Also it would be interesting to see Harry actually having to earn and work for his abilities, rather than just 'go to Gringotts and get 'core unblocked' and suddenly become god of magic and owner of all of britain'

** It's a really interesting idea. The problem I see with it is that Dumbledore has no reason to cooperate. As [[/u/turbinicarpus][u/turbinicarpus]] already pointed out with his little scene, a real Manipulative!Dumbledore isn't interested in an apprentice, or if he is, his first choice would be Tom, not Harry.

Some people have brought up the Sith. I think that's a fair comparison. The issue is that a Sith has a reason to adopt a student. It's a strong trope of the martial artist genre and eastern mythology (which Star Wars takes cues from) that you will reach a plateau in your training, and the only way to become stronger is to take on a student and teach them. There's also a certain amount of truth to that idea as well, since an intermediate-to-advanced talent returning to the basics is often exactly what they need to break down barriers. You really can learn more about a topic by teaching it.

To truly be a Sith Lord, you have to take on an apprentice to push yourself up to those heights. You'll hit a glass ceiling of strength that only taking on students can push you past.

But Dumbledore doesn't need an apprentice. He already exists on those heights. There's nowhere else for him to go. Dumbledore doesn't have any ambitions on MORE power, because a true Manipulative!Dumbledore already holds all the cards.

So the biggest single problem here is what would cause Dumbledore to suddenly change his mind? And if he DID change his mind, what would cause him to pick Harry, of all people, to be his replacement? Why choose a Pawn to become the new King?

I'm not dumping on the idea, I love things that break the sterotypes of the fandom genres we create in fan fiction, Harry Potter or others included. There's a whole slew of spin-off ideas you could build from a cooperative Manipulative!Dumbledore.

The problem is that you have to come up with a reason for him to cooperate. I'm struggling to think of one. The traditional M!D basically has the entire war charted out in advance, all the way down to Harry walking to his death in the forest. That version of Dumbledore is more powerful and more competent than Kira from Death Note or Lelouch from Code Geass ever were. He's unbeatable. The only reason Indy!Harry even stands a chance is because he's always a blatant Gary Stu.

So how do you entice the man who has everything to cut a deal?

*** I think it depends how you define Manipulative!Dumbledore. Do you equal it with the absolute dumbest "evil!Dumbledore" bashing fics or do you write one that has at least it roots in canon?

There are some fanfics out there, were Dumbledore has actually good intentions by being manipulative, you now, like he was in canon, but driven more to the extreme. We know that Dumbledore set up Harry for sacrificing himself. But in doing so he arguably saved Harrys live and that of the magical world. He knew as soon as CoS that Harry was probably a Horcrux. In my headcanon he started searching for a way for Harry to survive at exactly that point. It was only after Voldemort taking Harrys blood (and Dumbledore looking triumphant after hearing the fact) that he started looking for the other Horcruxes because he had now a way for Harry to survive. Not a very pretty one - but one anyway.

If you choose this at your starting point - a manipulative Dumbledore that also means well - I totally could see him taking Harry as his appreciate. He could be still very ruthless behind the scenes (like he was sometimes shown in canon, just expanding that) but would understand that the future belongs to the young and not to a man long past his prime.

**** Dumbledore being manipulative in canon is largely Rowling's fault, because she wrote the story in such a way as to require it. We were told, in DH, that you can only "claim" the Sword of Gryffindor if it is righteously drawn while in a position of peril. So by definition, Snape and/or Dumbledore had to have some kind of plan to trick or manipulate Harry or Ron into a scenario where their lives would be at risk and they would chase after the sword.

This is nobody's fault but Rowling's. She didn't have to put that stipulation on the sword, and if she did, you could easily say that the sword was claimed the moment Harry faced down the basilisk. The idea that the requirement has to be "met" every single time you need the thing for any reason is nonsensical. I can hardly understand how Godric could have made much use of the sword himself, if he had to hand it over to a dragon and then wrestle it to get the sword back every time he needed it for something.

That, and many other reasons besides, is one reason I'll never consider DH to be true canon. I just can't. It changes so many pre-established things. It retcons the rules for how the Fidelius works. It retcons how Patroni work. It has some of the worst characterization in the series. It basically made Ron bashing canon and then asks us to love him anyway in spite of it. The rules explaining what you could and could not do with food in regards to magic were literally introduced in that exact book, and Rowling broke her own rules in the book the rules were introduced in. You can't make food from nothing, but you can duplicate or transform it. So one cup of milk is enough milk to fill a swimming pool if you have a wand. One tiny piece of cooked fish and one heel of bread is infinite cooked fish and bread. Hermione EXPLAINED this, and yet somehow they were still starving in the woods, because not one of the three of them had the sense to use the food they had to make more food.

But I'm digressing. You're right. A true classic Manipulative!Dumbledore would probably never agree to cooperate with Harry for any reason, he has no real motivation to do so and everything is already going exactly the way he wants it to. However, if it's more of a manipulative-but-good Dumbledore, something a little closer to canon (or at least what Rowling seemed to have intended to be canon, even if she bungled the execution), then that opens up the possibility of something happening.

I suppose the real question then is how soft or hard you want Dumbledore to be on the scale of manipulative vs good.

I never got how people could think that, or seeing him leaving them as bashing. I mean honestly; nobody ever gave Ginny the fault for opening the chamber of secrets, not even in the worst bashing fics I've seen so far - but Ron (who was equally manipulated by a horcrux) is at fault? That literally doesn't make any sense at all. And it is stated that Ron tried to come back the moment he left the horcruxs influence. How that could be read as bashing I don't know.

****** Ginny was being possessed. The locket can only possess you if you open it and leave it open. The worst the locket can do while shut is make you feel worse about things, it can rub tempers the wrong way and instigate spite.

Many people feel it made Ron bashing canon, myself included, because all three of them were taking turns wearing it, but only Ron decided to throw a tantrum and leave. Harry never even considered abandoning the quest for the Hallows. Neither did Hermione. But Ron did. The locket affected all three of them, but only Ron threw a fit and abandoned his friends.

It's not like Ron was the only person who ever wore it. Rowling didn't give him that excuse. And it's not like Harry's own arguments with Ron were really out of line either, Harry was right. Ron was whining about ridiculous things that were a problem for all three of them. They were all hungry, they were all dirty, they were all injured, and they were all tired. Ron was taking the lion's share of the food, and still complaining. He was behaving exactly like how a Weasley bashing fic would have had him behave.

I don't consider the excuse that the locket was provoking him to be valid. As someone who has to deal with a family full of diabetics and people with low blood sugar and prickly tempers, I find that excuse to be pathetic. Shit gets rough sometimes, that's life. They were on a quest to defeat Voldemort's immortality. Can you imagine how pathetic it would have looked if one of the company that swore to protect Frodo and escort him to Mordor decided to just throw in the towel and walk off because the company was running low on food and their arm hurt? The only person who did anything remotely like that was Boromir, who had far better reasons than Ron ever did for his choice. And he only found redemption for his betrayal in */death./* Boromir /admitted he was wrong/ and then */died/* trying to set things right.

Maybe if Ron had died to get Harry the Sword of Gryffindor, he would be remembered more fondly. Instead, most people just wish Harry had let Hermione smash his nose in like she clearly wanted to.

Heroes are people who overcome adversity. They're not people who run away when the going gets rough and then come back later with an apology and expect everything to be okay. Maybe if Ron had pulled that stunt over a double date at Hogsmeade or something, it would be different. But the fate of the world was at stake. If their quest failed, Ron could have lived to see his entire family tortured to death in front of him before he was put out of his misery.

Fundamentally, it boils down to this: Ron was always defined by his ambitions. We know that from book 1. He told us what he saw in the Mirror of Erised, it was him but with all of the accomplishments of his brothers and more. He wanted to be as cool as Bill, as loved as Charlie, as funny as the twins, and as successful as Percy. He wanted to be Prefect and Head Boy and Quidditch Captain, he wanted to win the House and Quidditch Cup. In a way, I'm actually surprised he wasn't sorted into Slytherin.

Ron had six books to get over his jealousy and channel his ambitions into something healthy and productive that made him a better person. Rowling had six entire books to do the thing right and turn him into a proper, respectable man. Instead, we're on the slopes of Mt. Doom, and Mr. Jealousy comes back again for round five or six. It's the last book, it's the eleventh hour. Ron should be fucking over this. He should have been "over" this several books ago.

People still talk about how honorable and respectable Samwise Gamgee was, sixty six years after The Return of The King was published. He wasn't the smartest, or the fastest, or the strongest. He wasn't going to win first prize in anything. But his loyalty made him a legend.

Nobody would remember what a great character was if Sam had walked away after bitching out Frodo about how hard everything had gotten and how he just wanted to go home. And no, the ring "influencing" him wouldn't have made it any better.

Ron could have been great. Instead, Rowling chose to make him The Guy That Ran Away To Spend Christmas With His Family.

Rowling chose to have him behave that way. He's her character, she could have made him do whatever she wanted. He didn't have to act like a massive cunt. She made him a cunt. Then asked us to forgive him for it.

Nah. This isn't a ball, or a date, or some missing homework assignment. Ron didn't make a stupid mistake and land the three of them in detention. School is out. This is Voldemort's immortality. This is the quest to destroy the ring.

Sam never walked away from Frodo, and Boromir was a better man than Ron ever was, and he had to die to atone for what he did. Ron doesn't get a free pass just because he's Ron.

At least the Ron in book 2 had the wherewithal to complain about the person who sent them on the errand to talk to the spiders, instead of trying to chew Harry's head off for being there in the shit with him. Book 1, 2, and 3 Ron is an objectively better person than Ron in the books after that point.

Heroic characters are supposed to rise above challenges and grow as individuals. They're supposed to conquer their demons and overcome drama and trauma. Not become worse. Whether or not a character becomes worse or better over time is literally the fundamental difference between a hero and a villain. One rises, the other falls.

Ron got worse. Ron got a villain arc, because Rowling was so hell-bent on showing him as being the normal guy that she forgot normal people are and can still be heroic. Just look at Sam. Ron should have been Sam, but instead he's some guy Hermione and Harry would have stopped being friends with in any realistic version of that sequence of events.

Nothing would have done more good for Ron's character than for a piece of Voldemort's soul to tempt him into fighting with his friends and being jealous of Harry, only for Rupert Grint to tell it to sod the bloody fuck off and eat erumpent shit. That would have been a crowning character moment.

That's the kind of thing people expected to see. That's the opportunity that was missed. We wanted the Ron Weasley who went to face Aragog and bullied Lockheart at wandpoint to help save his sister. Instead we got a ginger-haired Malfoy. These conditions are filthy, I can't believe you would do this to me, I thought you jumped-up mudbloods had a plan. Wait until my mother hears about this.

I don't respect or forgive Malfoy, no matter what kind of ridiculous excuses and nonsensical epilogues Rowling offers up. He used the Unforgivables multiple times and was openly calling for ethnic cleansing as early as book 2. It is very strongly implied that he was party to rape in the basement of Malfoy Manor, though of course all references to sex are scrubbed from the series. And by the same token, you can't expect me to respect or forgive canon Ron either, when he could have turned into an angrier Samwise Gamgee that swears like a sailor, but instead just became a ginger year 3 Draco Malfoy instead.

What's worse, to have never had the chance to be great at all, or to come so very close to it, and yet still fall short?

Do you really think it's so hard to understand the position of the people who feel the second one is worse?

I miss the kid who helped Harry follow the spiders. I'm not the only one.

*** Honestly, I have thought about that (to the point where I hesitated posting this thinking it was an unrealistic prompt), but I can see this working to some extent, even with an evil!Dumbledore unlike what [[/u/Serena_Sers][u/Serena_Sers]] suggested to you with her own reply.

What if Harry somehow convinces this Dumbledore (or Dumbledore himself sees) that Harry as a willing pawn means the younger wizard would consciously assist with Dumbledore's plans? Or in the event that Dumbledore isn't able to manipulate stuff, Harry could directly come in his place to do that? Then I can see Dumbledore taking Harry in, to have a conscious enforcer in the place of an unknowing pawn. Maybe Dumbledore could even see himself continuing to manipulate Harry from under his wing, using the newfound mentor role to make Harry more supportive of him overall, not through mind magics and manipulations of circumstances, but through actual loyalty, which in some cases may be better, and leads to fewer strings to pull as one person you were manipulating (in some ways, indirectly), is now in your hands.

Also, with your statement that Dumbledore would take Tom as an apprentice rather than Harry, if he wants an apprentice, I can also see that subverted if Tom is a completely unwilling agent, one that gives Dumbledore benefits possibly, but one that is completely unwilling to work with him, would rather die than bow to him, and can threaten to ruin his plans too, kinda like the relationship between Ulfric Stormcloak and the Thalmor in Skyrim. This Harry, to Dumbledore, would be a cooperative agent, unlike Tom.

But then there's also the entire scenario that Dumbledore is wholly uninterested in an apprentice, he foresees Harry betraying him no matter what, or is uninterested in taking a more direct role in manipulating Harry (all of which, I'll admit are quite likely), then we'd be going back to the scene made by [[/u/turbinicarpus][u/turbinicarpus]], where Dumbledore just nips that bud when it starts to grow.

It's an interesting idea, imo, but as you (and [[/u/turbinicarpus][u/turbinicarpus]]) said, it may be far-fetched.

******* I mean, there's nothing more you could do really, but I feel like it was enough. While Ron didn't do much on-screen, I feel like you set him up to do a lot off it. Making connections and rising to political power, none of which are small, as you said.

On top of that, for an extra arc, you could also have Ron be affected the split that would happen between Harry and Hermione, kinda like split loyalties. Was Hermione truly trying to manipulate them? Or was this another one of Dumbledore's schemes? I know Dumbledore in this story is ultimately trying to make Ron Harry's main supporter, but that could add an extra layer of intrigue.

#+end_quote

Why not both? Hermione was (and still is, during the scenes in question) trying to figure out what exactly Dumbledore wants from them and how he would react to someone discovering his schemes. This was information critical to their future survival and freedom. The safest and the most subtle way find out was for someone to approach Dumbledore in the spirit of subservience and in private.

Doing it herself would have been a bad idea: she is, in some sense, the keeper of the trio's combined knowledge of the situation. She knows that it's likely that her mind might not be secure, but she also knows that it's the least insecure one of the three. But Harry, thanks to the prophecy and the newly forged political connections, isn't quite as disposable as she is. However, if Harry had his mind read, she couldn't be seen to be complicit, and so she manipulated Harry into doing it.

Will they split when/if Harry finds out? Like Dumbledore implies, it's another test for Hermione.

#+end_quote

In canon, when the Minister of Magic clashed with the Chief Warlock of Wizengamot, who won? Now, who is whose main supporter again?

I imagine that Dumbledore is aiming for a co-equal arrangement, with Harry running the Wizengamot, Ron the Ministry, and Hermione Hogwarts. Any two of them can check the third one's excesses. Together, they would control the three centres of power in the magical Britain and lead it into the future of their choice, while leveraging those skills they had acquired from resisting both him and Voldemort to protect it from any and all threats.

*** Another reason used frequently on media to have a character take up an apprentice is ‘cause they realize their own mortality. So a possible scenario: Manipulative Dumbledore has as his life ambition raise himself to previously unheard heights and mold the world in his image (to be fair we could do worse) so in his quest he has made friends and allies who will go on to do his biding forevermore, he has studied and created magic that leaves the rest of the world in awe, he has tranversed all moral horizons in his quest and is fully committed to seeing his vision for the world coming true. Then Voldemort happened, not a brainless curse-happy Voldemort, but a brilliant psychopath just mad enough to be truly beyond manipulation and totally unpredictable, this Voldemort not only set his plans back for a long time but also has actually managed to undo lots of his progress and even weaken his power-base by using the press and (accidentally or not) hitting close enough to the truth of his plans that an alarming number of his supporters have grown dubious enough to withhold their help cutting his influence enough to be more of a paper tiger than the Leviathan it was previously.

This setback is enough that even when Voldemort vanishes he can't really either control or do away with his more political savvy supporters (Lucius not being even close to the worst) nor can he reestablish his previous iron-fisted control over the ministry, now having to contend with multiple other factions with their own agendas. In time he would probably be able to not only recover his influence, but also fully achieve his goals, however...

He is not getting younger.

Oh sure, he has researched long and hard into immortality and all the societies and cultures who managed a form of it, however none of them are sufficient, not even combined. Horcruxes not only are unreliable but will cause the soul to become unstable, causing mental damage and eventually (as Quirrel was unfortunate enough to discover) start rotting the body of the user from within, body-jumping and some rituals can starve it, but eventually it /will/ catch up to the person. His little stratagem with the philosopher's stone only served to confirm what he already suspected from his time as Nicholas apprentice, the elixir of life not only can't stop aging even though the person stays alive, but also leches up so much magic from the user that they are left as borderline squibs and this side-effect is permanent upon first ingestion, something he just can't afford to go through. And after years of study he has come to the sad conclusion that the hallows just plainly don't offer immortality, great power, protection and knowledge to use this power? Yes, eternal life? Hell no.

So when a resigned Dumbledore is confronted by a Harry who discovered his plots while in the midst of planning how to best fit as much work as he can on his remaining years it is only the need of a distraction that keeps him from immediately brainwashing the boy back to normal (Harry is not the first to discover things he shouldn't and won't be the last, by this point Dumbledore has the whole process down to an art) when Harry surprises him by not throwing a tantrum as he expect, but to ask him to teach him. Upon hearing the request Dumbledore stops and contemplates... he hasn't really done anything /too/ terrible to Harry, it is not like he is wanting for money enough to be forced to steal from a boy who is important to his plans, risking making an enemy of the boy and the bank where he keeps his money, while he has been using the boys friends to manipulate him he is doing so by /also/ manipulate the friends (anyone who spends enough time around kids will testify that the worse way of getting them to do something long-term and keep it a secret is to actually tell them, if he tried paying R&H not only would it be a needless expense with an open door to blackmail but Harry would also know within the week). Really, on a scale from one to ten in how terrible he was he would wage his manipulations are only a five, no reason they can't be friends.

And so, after a mildly long Veritaserum-based interrogation that Harry won't remember to ensure that not only Harry is not planning to betray him but also that their goals align Dumbledore gets himself a brand new apprentice with the advantage of already being famous and mostly well-liked as well as a good student even if not a prodigious one, really, he could do a lot worse. Now to get Harry a time turner so they can squeeze as many lessons as they can before Voldemort crawls back from the grave to hog their time...

** Harry can ask to join, but would a Manipulative!Dumbledore accept?

*Edit for posterity:* A cleaned-up version of this three-shot has been posted to AO3: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31473704/chapters/77851889]]).

"It is very clever of you to have seen through one of my schemes, Harry, and your offer is intriguing. It seems that Miss Granger and Mister Weasley have failed in their duties to keep you on your path. I really must thank you for coming to me."

Harry, bowed, his new Acromantula silk robes shimmering in the torchlight. "Thank you, Professor. I will be a worthy apprentice."

"Oh, no, that's not quite what I meant." Dumbledore raised an eyebrow, and Harry found himself suddenly unable to move or speak. But Harry had prepared for this contingency. With a thought, he activated an artefact he had traded from the Goblins. (Learning their language and customs had really paid off!)

In just a moment, the artefact would activate and... Dumbledore shook his head, and the artefact remained dormant.

"Your coming to me saves me the trouble of tracking you down, Harry, and choosing to speak with me privately saves me the trouble of managing witnesses. We all have a role to play in what is to come, and we cannot have any rogue pieces on the board, now can we?"

Harry saw Dumbledore draw a wand he had not seen him wield before. His eyes crossed involuntarily as Dumbledore's wand was pointed at the bridge of his nose.

"It's for the Greater Good, Harry."

*** Harry was feeling pretty embarrassed as he walked back to the Gryffindor common room. After all, both Hermione and Ron had warned him---rather vehemently in Hermione's case---that there was no point in asking Dumbledore for duelling training. Dumbledore's time was precious, and at Harry's present level, there was nothing Dumbledore could teach him that Remus, Sirius, and Flitwick couldn't. Indeed, he was planning to ask Flitwick first thing the next day.

But now, it was time to eat humble pie, Harry concluded as he stepped into the Gryffindor common room. Neither of his friends were present, and, overcoming the urge to delay the inevitable, Harry made his way up to his and Ron's room: if Ron wasn't there, the Marauder's Map was.

He was surprised to find not just Ron in his room, but also Hermione, along with a chess set, what looked like a sheaf of papers with a list of chess moves, the Marauder's Map, and some other obviously enchanted knick-knacks. Ron was holding a mechanical stopwatch.

Several things happened the moment the door shut behind him. Ron clicked a button on the stopwatch. Hermione was at the door, casting one Charm after another, some nonverbally, others he didn't recognise.

"Just wait, mate," was the only thing Ron said to Harry's silent question.

A minute later, Hermione finished whatever she was doing and turned to him, her eyes wide open, her face a mask of earnest urgency.

"Harry... Do you trust me?"

"What?'

"Do you trust me? I know I've done things behind your back before, but do you trust that I always, always wanted the best for you?"

"I guess..."

"Then, sit down, relax as well as you are able, and trust me that this is absolutely necessary and there is no other way."

"Okay..." Harry sat down. Hermione pointed her wand at the bridge of his nose. Despite his proclamation of trust, /something/ almost made him recoil, draw his own wand. But he forced himself to stay still."

"/LEGILIMENS!/"

Dumbledore... His meeting with Dumbledore. Entering, sitting down, taking a lemon sherbet. Asking for duelling lessons? How did he phrase his request? What did he ask? How did he phrase his request? What did he ask? Images, sounds, feelings, /qualia/, to use Hermione's Muggle word, flashed before his conscious mind. The Goblin artefact he'd taken to carrying with him as a precaution, activated? Not activated? Activated? Not activate? Magic cast at him? Not cast at him? Wand pointed at the bridge of his nose. Wand pointed at the bridge of his nose held by... Wand pointed at the bridge of his nose held by... Dumbledore? Words? Words? Words?! "Greater Good." "Greater Good" what? What's "Greater Good" what? A sense of affection and trust for Dumbledore. A sense of affection and trust for Ron and Hermione.

"Five minutes!" It was Ron's voice.

Hermione ended the spell. She blinked and shook her head. Probing his mind looked to have taken a lot out of her... But, since when did she actually know how to do that? And Dumbledore pointing his wand at him, what was that? There were too many questions.

Hermione closed her eyes, took a slow, deep breath, and then opened them again, looking almost disturbingly clam.

"Harry, Dumbledore has modified your memories."

"But... Why?" was Harry's first question, then it sank in. "He has?!"

He wanted nothing more than to dismiss it out of hand. Sure, Dumbledore sometimes did things that defied explanation, but Harry was Dumbledore's man through and through, and proud of it. He had to have good reasons. And yet, that image of the wand pointing at him and the words... The violation... Of course, he'd thought these things through not a few weeks ago... Dumbledore was controlling him... them... everyone. It was bewildering.

"He..."

Hermione nodded. It seemed that she had known as well.

"Three minutes!" Ron called out.

"What are we going to do?"

Hermione clearly had a speech prepared. "We are going to pretend that this never happened, and that he had succeeded in pacifying you. You are going to get those duelling lessons from Flitwick. Maybe Ron and I will join you. We'll continue to pretend to spy on you for Dumbledore. You'll continue rebuilding your old family alliances, making inroads with the Goblins, and whatever else it takes. Perhaps one day, we'll be able to fight back."

The next realisation came then. "I'm pants at Occlumency. I don't think I could resist you, to say nothing of him... And if I start learning again, he'll know the next time he takes a peek."

Hermione nodded. "At a basic level, Occlumency is obvious to any Legilimens. At a more advanced level, one can hide that one is Occluding. I /think/ I am there, but if Dumbledore noticed, how would I know?" She looked haunted for a moment, then shook her head. "We can only hope that I am beneath his attention beyond the most cursory."

Harry reached the next conclusion. "So Ron and I need to be Obliviated?"

"One minute!" Ron reminded.

Hermione nodded. "Yes, until we can find some excuse for the two of you to restart Occlumency lessons and an instructor who isn't me. I'm working on that.

"I will also need to modify your memories to create a consistent timeline." She gestured at the chess set and the list of chess moves. "The two of you will need to play out this game, about 5 seconds per move, and I will stretch the memory to cover the whole period."

--------------

Dumbledore watched the game. Miss Granger's Legilimency was improving by leaps and bounds, almost but not quite reversing the Memory Charm outright this time, and getting useful snippets anyway. The trick of staging an authentic memory to stretch over an Obliviated time period was inspired, too.

He would need to up the difficulty next time.

Meanwhile, he needed to challenge her with a proper Occlumens. Rather fortuitously, young Mister Malfoy seemed to have acquired the skill in question. If Miss Granger's own paranoia would not drive her to try to take a look (and practice getting away with it), the headmaster himself might need to give her a push.

Of course, if she ever did succeed in reversing his Memory Charm, there would be a little revelation attached to the recovered memory---one that could shatter Harry's trust in her. How would she handle that? He was looking forward to finding out.

That was her own fault, actually. Harry didn't realise that the idea to approach the headmaster to join in his "manipulations" had been implanted by her with some clever reverse-psychology---a probe to see how Dumbledore would respond, without putting her own mind at risk; and it wasn't the first such instance either. How would Harry react when he learned that his friend was not that different from the headmaster?

On the other hand, he had to admire how she exploited the trust he had implanted into Harry's mind---purportedly so that they could keep him in line on his behalf---to undermine his plans with her own.

He was also looking forward to the next time he would have a chance to probe her mind. It was a close thing as it was. Crude, time-based Obliviation did not require Legilimency and bypassed Occlumency, but any Occlumens worth his salt would notice its traces. One needed Legilimency for surgical, untraceable Obliviation---and so the moment Miss Granger successfully resisted his Legilimency, he could no longer Oblivate her without a trace either. Now, wouldn't that be something?

Harry and Mister Weasley were coming along as well. What they had managed to pull off with the Goblins had surprised even him. Indeed, it had been Fawkes who had neutralised that Goblin artefact. The headmaster himself could have handled it, but not without a lot of trouble.

Certainly, in a few short years, Harry was going to be a force to be reckoned with at the Wizengamot, and Mister Weasley was learning to leverage his family to make inroads into the Ministry---the power of civil service was not to be underestimated. A Weasley Minister of Magic? Perhaps sooner than anyone might guess.

Their combat skills were coming along nicely as well. Miss Granger's (rather justified) paranoia drove her to seek out dirty tricks and gimmicks to protect her in an ambush and allow her to escape and stage an ambush of her own; but Harry and Ron could each already defeat any given 7th-year in a pitched duel.

That would prove to be far more useful than they thought. After all, the old laws under which legal and political disputes could be settled in a duel were still on the books, and wizards lived long lives and had long memories.

The only reason it was not a regular affair today was his own efforts: after defeating Grindelwald, he had declared that he would henceforth offer to be the champion of any party challenged to a duel---making it pointless to challenge anyone to a duel. With that one move, he had made Britain the most civilised of the wizarding nations. But, he was not going to be around forever. It was good to know that he would have at least two worthy replacements.

Yes, his pawns were drawing ever closer to the last rank, ever more ready to become Kings. It was most gratifying to see that he was leaving the Wizarding Britain in good hands. What more could a Manipulative Old Coot ask for?

And Tom, when he deigned to stop hiding, would never know what hit him.

I'm actually writing something like this.

Is a combination of "Harry gets adopted by someone random" and "time/dimension-traveling MOD!Harry" story, but with a few twists.

My Dumbledore doesn't know that Harry is Harry the boy-who-lived. He is under the impression his little apprentice is his mentor, Nicolas Flamel, brilliant daughter.

He teaches her how to guilty trio people to get candy, look all knowing with ominous phrases and sneak on people to scare the hell out of them.

MOD!Harry is amnesic, and the last he/she remembers is Dudley hitting him with a golf club, and Vernon getting rid of his body in some forest. [[https://www.resavr.com/comment/manipulative-dumbledore-but-harry-16338685][[Continued...]]]
