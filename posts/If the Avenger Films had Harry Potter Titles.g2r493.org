The Avengers and the Invasion of Earth

The Avengers and the Birth of Ultron

The Avengers and the Infinity War

The Avengers and the Time Heist


** Keep in mind Harry Potter titles are generally from nouns not actions, and they don't tend to reveal plot points (like, the titles aren't spoilers).

So like...

The Avengers and the God's Scepter The Avengers and the Mad Titan The Avengers and the Infinity Stones

I've been trying to come up with a good one for Age of Ultron but haven't found anything right. Maybe The Avengers and the Overabundant Plot Hooks lol

*** These are awesome, and I actually did have a problem with naming Age of Ultron.
