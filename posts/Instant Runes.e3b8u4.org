A Harry who is extremely good with runes and transfigures or conjures cookie cutter like shaoes and banishes them into things to instantly create a runic circle to use. Stamping a rune circle to explode on a dragons head and it dies. It could have a few other applications for on the fly runes.


** Maybe figure out if that flame writing spell Tom used for his name anagram could be used to instant draw runic circles in the air.

Do it wandlessly, add a cloak that's enchanted to fly and you're ready for a Dr. Strange crossover.

*** Couldn't you just like magick the runes to be seen in the air for the duration of their use?

**** Yeah, that's pretty much what that charm does, magic writing in the air.

***** I meant like not in fire but like in some cloudy type of writing or something like that, and then it would be like magic but cooler and more of a ”Look at my un-normal magic!” Type of thing

*** Draw runes on the Invisibility Cloak to only make it invisible on command, and then add runes that would make it fly. Damn, that's actually a pretty neat op!Harry idea.
