I have a few ideas and things written down for a few different Harry Potter fics and I was just looking for someone who would like to write them. All I ask is that if you are interested, allow me to watch your progress and proofread to see what you have come up with and allow me to make some suggestions and allow me to add some comments. If you're interested please PM me so we can talk more and work something out. I would really appreciate the help if you are willing to write for me and I would give you full credit for anything you write and I'm not asking for anyone to take the time away from their own fics to write my own. I only ask that you be willing and free to do this. Please email me at [[mailto:missdowney94@gmaail.com][missdowney94@gmaail.com]] if you are interested. The main characters name is my own so if you are not interested that's fine.

*** Yes but someone told me I would get better results if the flair was a prompt.

**** Oh whoops, that was me, but I wasn't clear how to do it. Just start a thread saying "Prompt: the Weasley Twins become space pirates" or whatever your idea is. Go into more detail in the post ("they find a crashed spaceship in the Forbidden Forest, and..."). Then see if anyone takes you up on it, makes recs of existing stories, etc. Look at some of the other posts that say prompt for examples.

Maybe you want something more like a writing partner, which is great too, but you'll be expected to do your share of the writing work. I don't think anyone wants to be in a collab where they're writing at someone else's direction and doing all the work themselves. It's one thing to put your idea out there and let people see it and decide if it interests them, but another thing completely to ask them to enter an email exchange with you before finding out what they are in for.
