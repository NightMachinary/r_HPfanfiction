I do have to ask, I've seen Parsleytongue and Parceltongue before, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-random-fiction-bits-and-pieces.480427/page-4#post-34348615][the latter on Spacebattles]], but has anyone done a crack fic based on Arseltongue?\\
A Harry who possesses the ability to communicate [[https://youtu.be/tp_Fw5oDMao?t=119][via carefully controlled gastic emissions]]? One who can understand the fearsome magical bovine, the Buttox? Who defeats Voldemort by pulling spell incantations out of his rear?

Edit: Oh, and mustn't forget about Voldemort being the heir of Snyfferin. And forming the Deaf Farters to achieve his goals.

They fell at Harry's feet as his dark magic skill Arseltongue emitted a poisonous green cloud, very much akin to the Killing Curse in colour, which drifted over to Voldemort and his followers, killing them all instantly.

*** Harry heard a dull quiet explosion he knew very well from his nightly escapades to the bathroom... a surprising sound of a fart that carried around echoes of a voice.

Deformed, yes, still a voice altogether.

"Rip. Tear. Kill."

It said.

And Harry for once was not sure if he felt amazed, amused or if he wanted to cry.

(aka that one au where canon parseltongue users speak buttholetongue and instead of basilisk you get abomination that is a giant living, breathing (farts that can kill instantly), old wrinkly butt with eyes and surprisingly thin but long sexy legs growing out from its... well, lower bottom)
