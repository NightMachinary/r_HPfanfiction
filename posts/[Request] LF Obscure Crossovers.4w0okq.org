I'm not talking HP/Naruto or HP/Starwars or even HP/LOTR. I'm talking about stuff like HP/Hogans Heroes or HP/Avatar, the crossovers you look at and go, "there's no WAY that would work" and then it does. As long as it's GOOD and not mainly a mushy and/or smutty romance fic, I want to read it. And don't worry about the other half of the crossover being not well known. I know how to use the googles to answer who's who and what's what. Thank you!


** HP/Hogans Heroes would make a great Grindelwald war fic.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

  See the free-range rabbits roam freely; enter at own risk. This would be my unfinished works file, containing things not worth posting on their own or being unfinished etc. Will be mainly Harry Potter, but not entirely. Things from here may end up being resurrected and expanded upon as full stories, but please don't ask too much of me - I have enough on my plate at the moment.
