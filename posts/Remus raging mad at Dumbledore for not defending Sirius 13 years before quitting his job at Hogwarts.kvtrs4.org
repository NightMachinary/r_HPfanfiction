:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm pretty sure it wasn't a full fic, I remember it was like a Tumblr post's screenshot posted on Instagram.

It was just this scene, the morning after Sirius is free again at the end of PoA, when Remus trasforms back into his human shape and for the first time in his life he knows exactly what happened the night James and Lily were killed.

He goes to Dumbledore and confronts him about the fact that he insisted that Sirius was guilty or to not put him under a trial and just send him to Azkaban, I don't remember exactly how they put it but it was something like this.

And the Remus barely listenes to what Dumbledore has to say in his own defense and just looks him in the eye and says like "That's it, I quit."

Like basically it was a cool alternative view on the reason why Remus leaves Hogwarts at the end of PoA and I loved it but I can't find it anymore :(

Edit: Nevermind people I found it! I took a screenshot from Google and am too lazy to find it again, so for those of you who are curious ima copy it in the first comment


** Remus Lupin, after the events of Prisoner of Azkaban, silently going up to Dumbledore's office, and throwing a freaking tantrum. "You told me not to pursue it! You /told me he was guilty!/ "

"I did not know." answers Dumbledore, "No more than you did, Remus."

"I - /DID - KNOW!/ I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU HE WAS INNOCENT AND YOU TOLD ME TO LET IT GO! You... I... TWELVE YEARS HE ROTTED IN THAT CELL! TWELVE YEARS, AND YOU DID /NOTHING!/ You... you..."

He draws himself up, stops shaking, and takes a deep breath.

"I quit." he says bluntly, then turns and walks away.
