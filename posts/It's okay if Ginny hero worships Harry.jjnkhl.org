Why wouldn't she? Why wouldn't anyone in her place?

Harry saved her life. And not like someone pulling you from the middle of the road so you avoided an accident(which I would still be very very grateful for). He saved her from certain death by risking his own life. He willingly and in full sound mind put himself in grave danger, went to face a 60 feet giant snake and he had no idea he was going to receive any kind of help.

Why wouldn't Harry be the biggest hero in Ginny's life? Who wouldn't be completely starstruck with that kind of person?

** I think a lot of people interpret "hero worship" to mean "celebrity worship", as in "Ginny fetishizes the icon, but does not love the man". That kind of infatuation is 100% inappropriate as the basis for a long-term relationship. The word worship in general is a negative ingredient for a relationship, in my and many other people's opinion, so we hear it and immediately paint something dark in our heads.

The way you reason "hero worship" is different: you take it to mean that she is extremely appreciative of Harry's innate qualities, especially because he employed them to save her life. Yeah, that's a much more positive interpretation and I don't have a problem with it as a foundation for her love.

Ultimately, I think it comes down to how the writer wants to use "hero worship". Both interpretations are fine by me if they serve the purpose of the story.

*** The problem I have with Ginny is that we never really see her have a defined moment where she goes from 'celebrity worship' to 'hero worship' to (as so many fanfics point out) 'just Harry'. We never really see Harry and Ginny as simply FRIENDS. We never have them (before the big damn kiss) in situations where they just sit and talk and share; we don't see them in little things that aren't related to any specific mystery, plot or major plan, where they just hang out and learn about one another without anything other than friendship there.

Look at the scenes with Luna and Harry in OOTP: it's actually easier to build an honest relationship between them in canon. They have much more in common, they both have internal pain that they share, they both connect and provide something that the other needs, and they see past what everyone wants to label them as. It's not 'Loony Lovegood' and 'The Boy-Who-Lived' - it's just 'Luna' and 'Harry'.

The same goes for Hermione. I'll just point to one scene - and in this case, it's from the films BUT it's perfect for both films and books: the library scene in 'HBP' when Hermione talks to Harry about how he needs to find a date for Slughorn's party. The interactions show perfectly how they're friends that can speak to one another about anything, even the opposite sex. The moment when Hermione whacks him over the head with the paper because he shows interest in Romilda is priceless - and if she thought the girl liked Harry for who he was, she'd have pushed them together herself. (It's also telling that Harry picked Luna. Granted, Ginny was dating Dean... but that opens up another can of worms, as (IMHO only) the reactions that Harry was having towards Ginny certainly felt like the reactions of a low-grade love potion. Remember, before people start screaming... IMHO only.)

There's also the fact that, to be honest, I don't think Ginny ever really could get past the idea of 'The Boy-Who-Lived', because she spent her entire life reading about his 'exploits and adventures', creating an image spurred on by her parents, family and the Wizarding World in general. All she's ever known is this image of a fantasy hero, and when he rises up to become real and saves her from a horrid beast no one else could defeat... yeah, there's little way that she's ever not going to have some feeling about THAT Harry in mind.

Lastly - if Ginny HADN'T started dating him during that year, if she hadn't had the Big Damn Kiss in public (and instead had taken him off on private to have a conversation where she said outright that she knows and understands the difference between fantasy hero Harry and 'just Harry' and knows that she wants the real one, the one with the surly attitude that year, the one that has issues with Snape and seems to get into trouble all the time but has so many good qualities as well... and then they have their first kiss) OR if it had been her idea for them to breakup because she kind of knew what was going to happen with his mission...

I always felt that Harry/Ginny was a thing simply because JKR wanted to have Harry end up with the one thing he always wanted, a big loving family. Thing is, he could have had that with either Hermione or Luna; it always seemed like Ginny was there to be his eventual wife, no matter how interesting she was/could be on her own. (Along these lines, the films SO screwed her character over.) To this end, I've said for a long time that there's an EIGHTH 'Harry Potter' book just waiting to be written by JKR...'Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Resistance'. Let's see Ginny in the role that would make her shine - as a co-leader of the Resistance alongside Neville - instead of just an ornamentation on Harry's arm.

Ginny, in my eyes, was wasted potential shoehorned into a relationship with Harry. She could have and should have been more than 'The Chosen One's Intended Bride'.

**** I actually remember seeing a scene just last week mentioned. book 5 even.

""Are you okay, Harry?” asked Ginny quietly.

“Yeah, I'm fine,” said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this.

“You seem really down lately,” Ginny persisted. “You know, I'm sure if you just talked to Cho...”

“It's not Cho I want to talk to,” said Harry brusquely.

“Who is it, then?” asked Ginny, watching him closely.

“I...”

He glanced around to make quite sure that nobody was listening; Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile of books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.

“I wish I could talk to Sirius,” he muttered. “But I know I can't.”

Ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully. More to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth.

“Well,” said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg too, “if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it....”

“Come on,” said Harry dully. “With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?”

“The thing about growing up with Fred and George,” said Ginny thoughtfully, “is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.”

Harry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate--Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementors--or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful...."

it seems that this implies a lot of off camera interaction. Still bad of she-who-must-not-be-named to not show more of it, but there's at least this scene that shows they have chemistry as well as a friendship that allows Harry to confide in her.

***** No - look again at what I said before. This is directly related to one of the plans they have, and it's NOT just two friends talking and relating... two people getting to know little bits about one another without the works intruding in on them. I like the line about how anything's possible if you've got enough nerve, but it comes as part of the major storyline, not as as an aside where Harry and Ginny are simply learning about one another as people. Of course they seem close - they do spend a decent bit of the summers together, but you could easily flip out Ginny, insert Ron and it would be the exact same scene with the same emotional heft except that it would add a little more depth to Ron; it would show him attempting to show more courage by invoking the twins and their attitude.

You also have to remember that Ginny getting close to Harry in this way was still another attempt by her to snag him. Remember how she tells him how she talked to Hermione about it, and was told that if she started dating other guys and stopped seeming to obsess over him, maybe he'd notice her? The problem is that she's still being dishonest with Harry, Dean and the others, and most importantly herself. Personally, if she hadn't been with Harry and he found out the morning of his birthday that she had broken up with Dean, then her giving him the present of that kiss (and his response to it) would have been awesome.

(P.S. - is it just me, or is Ron a real POS for bursting into the room? He KNEW what was happening BUT he also knows Harry that he's not a jerk with girls... and that he's got a hair-trigger when it comes to sudden entrances. The dumbass is lucky Harry didn't turn him into smeared Ronnikins jam all over the room and hallway!)

You really have to look at Ginny and say "Why is she here?" Everyone else has some motivation, good or bad - but Ginny's is simply 'get the Boy-who-lived and marry him'. Again, that's a sad fate for a character who's obviously got the potential to be far more interesting than just 'The Chosen One's intended'... it's sad that JKR was locked into her idea of 'Harry & Ginny need to marry, have kids and have what he believes is a happy life - a life the exact opposite of the way he grew up. There are other choices - other ways to have a happy ending - and I wish that JKR had allowed those characters the freedom to explore those other opportunities.

** There's a difference between appreciation and hero worship. Hero worship brings along with it the connotations of "putting someone on a pedestal". When you hero worship someone you blind yourself to their faults. You develop an unrealistic picture of them based on a small portion of who they are. If they say or do something that breaks that image it's utterly devastating to the worshipper. It's also completely unfair to the hero because it puts expectations on them that are completely unreasonable for any real person to accomplish or maintain.

Any relationship built on Hero worship will have spectacular problems down the line.

** If you want the very best reason why the idea of 'it's okay if Ginny hero-worships Harry and that's why it's okay if they end up together' ISN'T a good one... then consider the fact that Hermione has the much better claim using that point.

Yes, Ginny grew up on those BS books on "The-Boy-Who-Lived'... but Hermione, the girl who was born to read and learn, comes into the Wizarding World, meets Harry (having learned about him and what he's supposed to have done from ACTUAL textbooks) treats him like a normal person... and instead of going fangirl over Harry when he saves her from a monster (on the ten-year anniversary of his 'defeat' of Voldemort, more less), she becomes his FRIEND. Add to that what Hermione says to him before he goes to face Quirrell, the fact that he saves Hermione as well as Ginny (a dear, close friend instead of the sister of his other close friend who he doesn't even really know beyond her fangirling so badly that she can't even have an actual conversation with Harry [a condition that holds for her over the next four years]), and the idea that it's okay if Ginny hero-worships Harry falls apart.

Who wants a person like that around - especially if you consider a basic fact of life: this person can never truly be your friend, let alone love you, because they don't know you... they know the person they see you as and it's that person/qualities that they admire and love. How can that person possibly be a person be the one for you - and how can you actually know them, because they never show you their true self or feelings due to the fact that who they are is the person that they THINK you want, not the person you truly want OR the person that they actually want/need in THEIR life.

On the other hand, Hermione is there through good and bad for Harry, personally as well as in their scholastic lives and that as comrades-in-arms. She knows his good and bad points and is not afraid of pointing out either when its necessary. She isn't afraid to tell him what she thinks, and she shares with him personal moments (the best example of this comes from the films, in GoF, when she describes her relationship with Krum to Harry) and reaches out to him for comfort when she's hurting (in book or film, the scene in HBP when Hermione leaves the Gryffindor Common Room after seeing Ron kiss Lavender in front of everyone, and Harry comes to console her). Note that he takes the time to note that he finds her in obvious misery and yet is still composed enough to perform and maintain a spell perfectly. There's never a time when Hermione isn't there for Harry, because they balance one another out in temperament, ability and worldview. When Hermione is there for Harry, it's because she wants to be there to support him or because he needs her there to help him; it's obvious that she's a big part of the reason that he's survived his Hogwarts experience (and vice-versa).

It's just an overall bad idea, because Ginny doesn't even know who the real Harry Potter is - and instead, is into hero-worshipping someone who never even existed.

** There isn't anything wrong with it, it is simply that the Harry/Ginny relationship arc was... kinda aborted halfway through.

With how it was set up, you either needed Harry to embrace his fame and fangirls and become a magical rock star, or Ginny needed to grow beyond her hero worship.

That was clearly never going to be Harry's arc, and I think that was the intended arc for Ginny, but realistically she doesn't get enough screen time to make that happen. It is a conflict that is set up and then... you just kinda skip past its resolution. And that is the issue.

*** EXACTLY. Ginny DOESN'T worship Harry for what he did. How could she? He was a baby who survived an assassination attempt because of his parents' sacrifices!

What Ginny worships is the imaginary Harry - the image crafted through books that bear no resemblance whatsoever to Harry's true reality of being an abused child forced to live in a space beneath a flight of stairs. She's never tried to get to know the plain, unvarnished Harry Potter.

I think Weasleys do get more than enough hate - but I'm sorry... Ron gets exactly what he deserves. His actions in GoF ALONE put him on my Unforgiveables list - with the exception of Hermione, he knows how Harry loathes publicity and he STILL acts out because he's jealous? Even worse, he comes crawling back (and NEVER actually apologizes) only after Harry is a roaring success with the dragon. Sorry, but while Ron's not evil or horrible, he's a textbook 'fair-weather friend', more like Malfoy than he ever wants to admit (I have no problem seeing him call Hermione 'Mudblood' because he was angry, the same way Snape did Lily, and come back trying to apologize 'because he didn't mean it') - and even Dumbledore understood what a crappy mate he was. It's why he left Ron the Deluminator: he KNEW that sooner or later, he would turn his back on Harry once more, and would need a way to find his way back to him.

It's not 'Ron-bashing' if it's true.
