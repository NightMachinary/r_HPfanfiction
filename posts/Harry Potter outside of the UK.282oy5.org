I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions for stories in which Harry leaves the UK. I've read Bungle in the Jungle, and Make a Wish multiple times. I like the idea of a curse breaker Harry, or a Tomb Raider Harry.


** Several of my all-time favorite fics are about this. They are all worth multiple reads; I have personally read each of these at least four times.

- [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Exposure_a_Dark_Fic/Chapter_1/][*Exposure!* by Bobmin356]]

"He left the Wizarding World after nearly destroying it. Now he was drawn back into that world against his will and he'd make them pay for their crime."

Harry/OFC, magus!Harry

This story can only be accessed by making an account, but it only takes a second and Bobmin356 has multiple amazing stories about Harry leaving the UK and becoming powerful.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4186278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Soul-Gems][*Harry Potter and the Soul Gems* by shedoc]]

"Coming as it did a scant 10 hours after his defeat of Voldemort, the Minsitry's exile of Harry Potter must have come as a crushing betrayal..."

cursebreaker!Harry

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5946526/1/Runaway][*Runaway?* by Itsme66]]

"Fleur in France 19 years later, and something happens..."

Surprise pairing. crafter!Harry

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/1/The-Power-of-the-Press][*The Power of the Press* by Bobmin356]]

"Forewarned Harry makes his escape from Britain, leaving the tournament in shambles. Protected by family, Harry sets about to fulfill his destiny free from the bigotry and manipulation of others."

Harry/Hermione, trained!Harry

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5998729/1/The-Valley-of-the-Kings-Massacre][*The Valley of the Kings Massacre* by DisobedienceWriter]]*

"An adult Harry finds his destiny as an independent curse breaker in Egypt."

cursebreaker!Harry

Disobedience Writer is another fantastic author whose work you should explore. I heartily recommend The Birth of Evil, The Potter Family Grimoire, The Heir of Magic, and a Naruto fic called Master of Seals.

*** To the OP: I would strongly urge caution when reading a Bobmin story. There is very little conflict due to Harry being either extremely overpowered /or/ wealthy beyond anything you've likely read before. Also, there will /always/ be a Native American who either provides or circumvents plot devices in a lore-breaking way.

The dialogue and narration will be absolutely excellent, but there are drawbacks such as those listed above.

** RiddledWays covers a few I would've mentioned so just a few from me. IT recently began updating again after a too long hiatus, but I've hopes it will continue now:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8575201/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Escape-to-New-York][Harry Potter and the Escape to New York]]

It is a crossover with some TV series I never heard of, 'Beauty and the Beast' (no relation to the fairy tale other than inspiration apparently), but even with no knowledge of the latter, it is a good read.

Harry ends up in New York when 9 and is adopted in a unique non-normal community. Features a Harry/Hermione/Fleur trio.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9939304/1/][Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum]]

After the fall of Voldemort Sirius kidnaps Harry to Bulgaria, along with Narcissa and Draco, she abandons Malfoy in this story. AU story where Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour are the same age as Harry and Draco.

** Away From The Sun - hgfan1111

Hard to find, I think. I couldn't come up with a link as I downloaded an archive some time ago. If you really really want it, I can e-mail it to you. It takes place largely in the U.S. after the war, and quite a bit of it in my favourite city in the U.S., New Orleans.

*** I found it on [[http://www.scribd.com/doc/194944129/Away-From-the-Sun-by-Hgfan1111][scribd]] but you need a scribd subscription to get it.

On a side note, how do you keep posting when your account does not appear to exist?

**** I was shadowbanned - FOR NO REASON - and I have been unable to turn that around, last admin that looked at it said "you were spamming links," which is something I've never done. They can see my post history and so can I... no such thing in it. I'm completely stumped. Once my gold status runs out I guess I'll just have to bite the bullet and make a new account... this is the dark side of Reddit... someone's shadowed my account, maybe they didn't like my opinion, and there's virtually no way to get it back. I've discovered since than that it happens far too often and the admins don't care.

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6569][Here's]] a H/Hr story that's complete, fairly long, and MA rated. Please don't mistake this as an endorsement.

My own (extremely subjective!) review of it: I sincerely understand the motivation a lot of people have for having Harry leave magical Britain as a central plot point, given the wildly disparate ways in which that world tends to pay him homage or denigrate him. For Harry to leave like a thief in the night without acknowledging the extraordinary part Hermione played is an irredeemable character flaw.
