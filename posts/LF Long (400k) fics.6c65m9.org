  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) feels like a clich√©d WBWL story at the beginning but really develops into an elaborate magical world with interesting takes on magic. It also attempts to subvert some of the tropes found in WBWL fics. Second year is especially a blast. INCOMPLETE.

--------------

linkffn(Backward With Purpose)--- this and it's sequel are complete. The third one is WIP but you don't need to read it to have a complete /story/, if not a complete series. Each story is fairly self contained. After the Battle for Hogwarts goes horribly and most of their friends and family die, Harry, Ron and Ginny decide to go back in time to their first year. Supportive and competent Dumbledore and Snape. There is an idiot plot moment in the 2nd year though. Both books add up to around 350k words or so.

--------------

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. Non-magical AU. Harworts is a school where the children of some of the British aristocracy are trained to be spies. Hermione comes from a middle class family but is accepted after she does something dangerous and illegal but intelligent. This is a canon rehash but does creative things with technology (memory back ups instead of Horcruxes, etc) and is pretty interesting overall.

--------------

One of my favourite works of fiction --- linkffn(Luminosity) and its sequel linkffn(Radiance). Twilight fan fics. You needn't have read (or god forbid --- /liked/) the original Twilight books. This is the only material related to that series that I've ever enjoyed. Anyway, Bella is smart and rational (without being overly annoying like Harry in HPMOR). Once she learns of Vampirism, she decides to become one, of her own will (immortality, superpowers, good looks, come on!) and decides to take over the Vampire world as part of her long term goals. The plot is excellent --- no holes I can think of. So is the characterisation --- good guys have character flaws and make mistakes based on them, mistakes have consequences, etc. Luminosity is a little romance heavy but Radiance has little to none. Also, Luminosity's ending is a punch in the gut while the ending to the series itself (in Radiance) is a bit too happy IMO.

Overall, I'd say this is what rational fiction should be rather than HPMOR (which I also kind of liked). I recommend reading on the site or downloading an ebook, mobi or pdf from there rather than ff.net though.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
