I remember reading a H/Hr fan fiction, where at the end of the war, harry and hermione come out with an explanation of all that is canon into a H/Hr pairing with Weasly bashing. I remember they are invited to talk in the Great Hall, with pictures of Albus, Snape, Black, James and Lilly's picture on stage too...

I cannot find it for the life of me :(

  Everyone "knows" what happened during Harry's seven years at Hogwarts... right? Er... no. Find out the truth about Harry and Hermione. H/Hr Rating for language and mild sexual situations.
