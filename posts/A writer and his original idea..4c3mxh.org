'The writer slowly lifted his head from the keyboard, and stared at the number in front of him whilst he held a bag of frozen peas to his forehead. It was a big number, in fact he was sure there wasn't a word for how big this number was.

He grinned, which heightened the headache that was gradually coming on.

Looking down at the story checklist on the notepad, he picked up the pencil next to it and reread the list:

1. Letter from Gringotts - check
2. Angry and confused Harry - check
3. Go to Gringotts and get attendance with the head of Gringotts - check
4. Blood/DNA using knife and parchment - check
5. Harry is the head of a legendary house(s) - check
6. Harry gets a fuck-ton of money-

Looking up at the screen, the headache came back from the glare. He looked at the obscene amount of galleons Harry now had, then back down at the notepad

...of money - check

Next up was....

1. Dumbledore turns out to be a dick-

The writer grinned again, he knew he had something original here, he was sure of it. Looking in the small mirror on the shelf above the computer screen, he saw the imprint of the keyboard on his forehead.

Worth it...'

(In bed, on my phone. I bet this post is totally original as well)

*On another note, Harry gets all this money but does sod all with it, like wtf writer you fuckwit. I was waiting for a teenage Harry who has absolutely no concept on how he should/n't spend money, spend a lot. I may not be looking properly in the masses of fics out there but any thoughts?
