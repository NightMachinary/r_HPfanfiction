Would music written by wizards be any good? Would they have cover bands of muggle groups? What would be the preferred way of listening?


** There was a band portrayed in the books called the Weird Sisters, though I think that's all was mentioned about wizarding music

*** It's not portrayed, it's mentioned. Also, Celestina Warbeck.

** Whenever these types of discussions come up, I like to remind everyone that magical Brittain has the population of a small city. And while magic may give more leisure time and make a lot of essential muggle jobs unnecessary, there still aren't going to be a lot of people making music and other types of arts professionally. And smaller populations mean smaller audiences, which means it's probably hard to make a living as a musician. And obviously magic does make international travel easier, but canon makes magical Brittain at least seem very insular.

All of that is to say that most of the musicians and bands in the magical world are going to be hobbyists. Roughly the equivalent of a few local garage bands who sometimes do gigs a few evenings or weekends a month.

I wouldn't be surprised if magicals did listen to muggle music or covers of muggle music, even if they might not admit it. Or they might listen to what we think is muggle music, but was actually made by magicals who decided to turn to the muggle world because they realized it would be easier to make a living there.

I imagine that the Wizarding Wireless is the most popular way to listen to music, just like the radio was in the muggle world for a long time. But that might require then to have more music available than they are likely to without tapping into muggle sources.

*** Well, we know Celestina Warbeck is a professional singer, so it wouldn't be that far off to imagine there are more musicians who are professional. While they have a smaller population, they also have better travel accessibility, which allows them to do gigs in more places with less inconvenience, which means they could probably access the live music international market easier than muggle musicians. Additionally, witches and wizards have more money to spend on leisure activities, with all the money they save on utilities. They don't have to pay for heating, water, or electricity. That's /so/ much extra money to spend on leisure and the arts. But that could probably only go so far with their population size.

I like your idea of musicians toeing the line of the muggle world. It would be interesting if there were genres that were less than mainstream that tended to go that way. So Celestina Warbeck, the pop singer gets by fine, but Eviscerate the Puffskein, that death metal band has to go half muggle. It would definitely expand the world, and since I like the Wizarding World being more integrated outside of Diagon, I'm into it.

Wouldn't Wizarding Wireless be all radio, but then also magical stations? You've definitely got a point there

Edit: I improved my jokes

** Magical musicians would concentrate far more on live gigs than non-magicals do, because magical travel makes going to gigs much easier.

** In the US, every wizard song is somehow Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins; In the UK, it's all Bohemian Rhapsody and the Theme Song to the Bill played at the same time.

Weird. :)
