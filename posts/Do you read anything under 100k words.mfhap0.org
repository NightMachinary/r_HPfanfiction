Unless it's a series split in multiple stories, I don't bother going for anything bellow 100k words. It's just so short, and it leaves you craving for more painfully.

Or am I the only one.


** Actually, about 50-70k is decent. And really, I've read authors who are 150k and still going who have the most boring stories ever, and I've read a 20-35k story that is one of my favorites. It's so well written and the plot is good enough that it doesn't have to rely on length to make it enjoyable.

** I used to think like this, I used to love finding a new 600k word long fic to dive into, but over the years that has gradually changed.

Really, length is a really poor indicator of quality. Philosopher's Stone was 76k words. The Hobbit is 95k words. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is 38k words. Nineteen Eighty-Four is 89k words.

People often mention how 'epic' fanfics are often supremely bloated, with too little substance to keep them from collapsing into an unstructured mess, but what I don't think people mention so much is that unfinished 'shorter' fics have the same problem. They just cut off earlier. That, I think, is why some shorter fics can leave you with the feeling of being unsatisfying.

However, a completed fic in the 20-100k range is a rare gem. I've really come to appreciate self-contained stories that try to avoid getting bogged down in drudgery.

*** Yes. Fanfiction has so much extra content that unneceessarily bloats the word count!

***** Having recently written like, a 1500 word scene about Gabrielle trying and failing to make a treacle tart, I will not comment on that particular form of bloat ðŸ˜¬

** Yes, I used to think like you on this front, but there are tons of awesome one shots out there and you totally miss out on alot of excellent shorter fics.

** Some people only like long fics, but I have read many fics that were great of all story lengths. Variety is the spice of life for me.

** I do. In fact these days I don't read anything that's +200k just because I don't want to invest too much in a story only to realize half-way that I hate it. Also I think you don't need +100 chapters and +5000 words per chapter to tell a good story... sure there might be some authors that have these kind of stories because there is a lot happening but I feel like most authors just try to get the word count up there and become really boring in the process.

** Yes I usually go from 7000 words upwards. I like some shorter fics and oneshots from time to time. I easily start a 30 - 100 K work but everything above I usually mark for later to start when I got a bit of time

** I primarily read longer fic, but there have been plenty of shorter fics I've enjoyed over the years. My sweet spot is between 40k-200k, though I really love series that are broke into those amounts because it gives a chance for longer arcs intermingled with shorter arcs, which is what I aim for when I write.
