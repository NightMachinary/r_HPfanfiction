** - There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2531438/1/A-Better-Man][/A Better Man/]], by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/691996/Valandar][Valandar]]. It actually opens after the end of the series(but before the epilogue), with Vernon's funeral. He is in the afterlife, being made aware of the full weight of his deeds, but is offered a chance at redemption when Harry looks down at his grave and wishes he had been a better man.\\
  At that point, it goes back in time, and one little twist sends the story in a different direction.

- There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5329223/1/A-Different-Dursley-Family][/A Different Dursley Family/]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/579283/Lucillia][Lucillia]], which appears to be abandoned, but changes Vernon and Petunia's backstory(he gets expelled from Smelting, she gets a nursing degree), and he appears to be a much better person for it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7911105/1/Defending-Sirius-Black][/Defending Sirius Black/]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1297575/Luiz4200][Luiz4200]], which involves the Dursleys arguing for Sirius Black to get a trial. Arguably, it doesn't entirely fit your criteria but Vernon does make an effort to be more civil over the course of the story. My only issue with it is that it repeats itself too much.

- I haven't read it yet, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5488860/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Reluctantly-Paternal-Uncle][/Harry Potter and the Reluctantly Paternal Uncle/]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1313428/PenRifle][PenRifle]] seems like it might be an amusing read, if a bit on the short side.

** I sometimes wonder, if Vernon, in his heart, is a bit more practical man than we are led to believe in the canon. I think there could be quite canon-believable story where Harry explains benefits of Magic to Vernon and how it could be utilised for profit.

For example to improve his company's drills: unbreakable(or least lot stronger) drill heads, sharper, increases material strength, reduce production costs, etc.

I got a feeling Vernon might come around about magic if he saw there was more to it than megalomaniacs, crazy & hateful biased stories from Petunia, weirdos who grow pig tails on his son and general mess Harry makes with magic.

Any story like that?

This is why I often don't answer requests even if I know of a story or two that might qualify. This was a straightforward request with unambiguous matches so I thought was was "safe" to respond, but once again this sub displayed its petty side.

  This is a story of the life of Harry Potter. From his disappearance with his friendly relatives to Dumbledore chasing after him around the world, while Voldemort and muggle secret services loom in the background. Technology, Prophecies... one word: power.

** Another one to read, and it's fairly unique as it's entirely told from Vernon's point of view.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11456392/1/Proud][/Proud/]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2412600/Winter-Leigh-End][Winter Leigh End]]. Petunia kept magic a secret from Vernon, and she dies before that fateful Halloween sees Harry left on the Dursley doorstep.
