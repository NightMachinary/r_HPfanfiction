It is estimated ^{by me} that *80* to *99* percent of bad fanfictions contain multiple repetitions of *at least one variant* of the M-Word. This perverted cabal against an innocent and usually perfectly passable word *needs to be stopped*.

** The Manipulative Manipulator, Albus Dumbledore, wangled his exploitive maneuver to manipulate poor innocent Harry Potter into doing his conspiratorial machination of fraudulent deceit.

Harry kicked his charlatan arse through the power of an amazingly astounding and powerful speech in the middle of the great hall, causing the deceitful con artist to flee in the wake of his latest ploy.

"I can't believe that beguiling old cheat has been rusing me all along," he said.

*** And the etymology gives you reason.

* manipulation (n.)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: manipulation-n.
  :END:
by 1730, a method of digging ore, from French manipulation, from manipule "handful" (a pharmacists' measure), from Latin manipulus "handful, sheaf, bundle," from manus "hand" (from PIE root [[https://www.etymonline.com/word/*man-?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_52623][*man-]] (2) "hand") + root of plere "to fill" (from PIE root [[https://www.etymonline.com/word/*pele-?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_52732][*pele-]] (1) "to fill"). Sense of "skillful handling of objects" is attested by 1826; extended 1828 to "handling or managing of persons," especially to one's own advantage.

​

I was also surprised by the last line of this little gold nugget:

* manipulate (v.)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: manipulate-v.
  :END:
1827, "to handle skillfully by hand," a back-formation from [[https://www.etymonline.com/word/manipulation?ref=etymonline_crossreference][manipulation]]. As "to manage by mental influence," especially for one's own purposes, is by 1864. Financial sense is from 1870. By 1949 it served as a euphemism for "masturbate." Related: Manipulated; manipulating.

**** That's what I mean. I prefer using it for the physical act, as opposed to saying, for example, “Dumbledore manipulated the boy into doing such and such”. I might say “Dumbledore manipulated the boy's memories” if Dumbledore is using legillimency or obliviating a character, but, unless it's in dialogue, I don't like using manipulate where I could use more interesting, less clunky words.
