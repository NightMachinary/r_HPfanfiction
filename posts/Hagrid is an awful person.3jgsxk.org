At least in his first real appearance on the island with the Dursleys. I started re-reading the series for the first time (wanted to get back canon feel and details.) I'm only up to Diagon Alley which will probably improve his portrayal. I don't hate him or anything, but his, post decade old showing in chapter 1, introduction and interactions were kind of like slaps in the face to me.

I'll probably put a TL:DR in the comments I think.

- Hagrid shows up at midnight, uninvited, and when challenged by a scared armed man, the rightful renter, Hagrid smashes down the door. Maybe he doesn't know what Vernon meant by 'armed' but think about the fact that a scary intruder comes smashing down the door on a secluded island in the middle of nowhere where the man is with his wife and son in order to protect them (from something he doesn't understand, yes).

- Without introducing himself, giving explanation etc. Hagrid asks for a cup of tea. Which is generally poor form to request the service of those to whom you are a guest. When you aren't a guest but an intruder for all they know...

- Dudley is sitting frozen in fear and this unknown wild looking, 60 year old, giant of a man then insults an 11 year old boy 'budge up, yeh great lump'. Instilling greater fear in the process- to the point of running and cowering behind his mother. This is the kind of despicable thing Snape is, rightfully, damned for.

- When the frightened renter of the abode demands he leave in a possibly angry but definitely polite way (Vernon calls Hagrid 'sir' and explains that he views this as breaking and entering, a violation of the law.), Hagrid tells him to shut up. Then hurls another unprovoked insult calling Vernon a 'great prune'. Again any familiarity of a despised potions master who harasses others who he is aware of, without him being known to them?

- So Hagrid, the intruder, who has smashed in your door, insulted and scared speechless your son, demanded hospitality while also insulting you, now takes your gun, your only mode of protection, and destroys it, disarming you and making you completely defenseless against his greater size and strength. That is an exceptionally frightening prospect, at the absolute least it is a very bad bullying. Also there is the chance of an accidental discharge of the gun in being grabbed/broken, with a potentially harmful accident in its wake- gun safety is no joke.

- After ignoring the cowering adults, Hagrid finally introduces himself, if only to Harry. Then he asks about hospitality again- tea or if offered something stronger.

- Hagrid now without a word of explanation does magic to create fire. This in front of a muggle family, Vernon and/or Dudley, who for all Hagrid knows don't know about magic: We know of at least a few cases where a witch has taken a muggle as her husband and not told him about magic until after marriage. It is very reasonable to think that Petunia, the sister of a witch, didn't or for that matter wouldn't share the letter. Yes we know that Vernon knows but Hagrid can't be sue of this.) Regardless of that they have a boy who has just been insulted and scared and now Hagrid the giant intruder has disabled his father has just made fire out of nothing and still hasn't said anything to address their concerns... still sort of reinforcing the dangerous factor. How do you expect any muggle to respond to their first forced encounter with magic? Can you imagine? /McGonagall walks up to Hermione's house jumps in the window as a cat, goes upstairs to where Hermione is saying good night to parents, transforms into a human, and sets the wardrobe on fire. 'Congratulations you're a witch!'/ To me this seems a similar level of twisted or just a straight dumb screw up.

- Hagrid, without saying anything further, then makes himself a meal. This after he spots the crisps wrapper (their meal).

- I'm not sure Hagrid was going to offer to share or not but Vernon expresses distrust and concern telling Duddly not to take anything of his. The people are still clearly concerned with the situation and distrust Hagrid. Does Hagrid answer some questions or explain himself? No. What is Hagrids response to the huddled family? Insult the 11 year old boy again! 'Yer great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' any more'. Not a little Snape-y? Unwarranted attacks and insults on those who didn't even address him, who are decades his junior? Honestly whatever Hagrids travel difficulties I would understand Snapes vindictive petulant lashing out at children more than I do Hagrids in this situation. See Hagrid just doesn't and can't know the details of their family. Hagrid still believes these muggles have taken care of Harry Potter, James and Lilys son, and told him all about magic and who he is. He has no reason to dislike them so thoroughly or treat them so poorly, unless, to which I am doubtful, McGonagall has been gossiping and telling him how awful they were on one day 10 years ago.

- When Hagrid finds that Harry doesn't know he is a wizard he is angry and then frightens the Dursley family a couple more times, causes them to cower back even further.

- Switching tones a bit- Hagrid tells Harry he'll be "a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be?" Based solely on his parentage and talents of his parents Hagrid presupposes the superiority of Harry (better than the other, average, witch and wizard). A little later he says "good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. Head Boy an' Girl atHogwarts in their day!" To me the sentiment can easily be read as "exceptional parents, will obviously result in an exceptional child" which seems awfully close, and pure- blood-y, to "our parents are exceptional (capable of magic), we will be too. It stands to reason those who don't have exceptional parents (muggleborns) will not be as good as us" In the least it sounds like a Slughorn type of casual bigotry. 'oh no muggleborns can be skilled, why your mother and that other guy' 'obvious you have good wizard in your blood somewhere' etc.

- Followed up with Hagrid using Muggle very much like an insult. "great muggle like you", "biggest Muggles I've ever laid eyes on"

- Sidenote. Given the two above Hagrid also says the bit about "Never made things happen when you was scared, or angry?'" and then Harry realizes "every odd thing... [he] had been upset or angry". That sounds more like Tom Riddle/Dark Arts than Lily and her flower. Yet "Hagrid was positively beaming at him. ‘See?'" [you're a wizard]... uh yeah so you're telling me that using anger and fear to fuel my magic is what proves I'm a wizard, gotcha, I'll make my very first magical theory deposit to the dark arts bank.

- Vernon and Petunia are angry at Hagrid and Harry and vice-versa but Hagrid is angry and roaring that "Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!" This after Dumbledore says Harry should be told "when he's older." We and Hagrid don't know the details of the letter, and Dumbledore handed guardianship over to them- to make decisions for Harry. Harry is still a kid and only literally just 11- that seems like a judgement call any parents or guardian might make (even with the Dursleys being horrible and lying about the manner of death to keep it from him.) This is made more problematic for me because this roaring outrage is then perpetrated Harry by Dumbledore in later books (not being told very important information because he was still to young, horcrux etc). Again I think it is a little strange that Hagrid assumes everyone in this muggle family knows everything and talks about it openly when the directive his beloved Headmaster gave was not to tell Harry until he is older (without any know specifications).

- Which leads me to the Vernon saying something stupid and continuing, angering Hagrid further (though we obviously aren't on their side it should be said Mr. Flee-to-island-in-paranoia Vernon "MimbleWimble" Dursley might also be at the end of his rope regarding everything magic, hence his cruel words. Regardless the point isn't that he was in the wrong, the point is that Hagrid in anger and retribution then transfigures (curses) the man's 11 year old boy who hasn't said a word the entire time, and yet has been insulted twice already by Hagrid. Who isn't supposed to have a wand or to use it (and can't know how well it's repaired, given his lack of knowledge about the Elder Wand)- yet Hagrid attempts human transfiguration on an 11 year old muggle bystander. That seems worse, with worse potential results, than levitating camp officials which was called "muggle torture". Hagrid then insults the 11 year old boy further by saying he was already a pig and that all he needed was the tail. Is this not absolutely disgusting behaviour?

- Not nearly so egregious as the last point but Hagrid then asks for an impressionable 11 year old boy to keep his secret that he did magic, did magic on an innocent muggle. This is after Hagrid has already mentioned magic isn't supposed to be done on muggles except in special circumstances. Hagrid then says he specifically isn't supposed to do any magic, then says he was expelled, and then avoids the subject/further questions. Leaving it to the boy to trust in the man who is only ticket out... feels a bit like the abuse of/by an authority figure to me.

- Minor side point, I haven't got there yet but I remember Draco asks/says something about Hagrid being a savage ("lacking the restraints normal to civilized human beings")- given his behaviour elaborted above, the whole Cake out of coat. Owl out of cout. Mice in the coat. Can't spell Voldemort. etc. That is pretty accurate if impolite. It is certainly confirmed later with raising dragons, Fluffy, and establishing a colony of XXXXX dangerous acromantulas next to Britains only wizarding school.

If you consumed all of this anti-Hagrid writing without cursing me, can you really call yourself a Harry Potter fan? Discuss. :P

*** This is the same reason for excusing Dumbledore leaving Harry on the doorstep in November instead of simply knocking.

It's fine explanation if you stick to the first couple of books. However, as soon as you bring the other books into the mix, things get more complicated. It's not possible to read later scenes while simply dismissing scenes in the first book as "kids lit." You can't read Dumbledore's "ten dark and difficult years" while ignoring what the first book describes those years as being like.

That's JKR's fault for starting with kids lit then progressing to YA fantasy. On the one hand, doing so created a series that kids could grow up with, which is absolutely wonderful. She deserves lots and lots of praise for that.

On the other hand, it created plot and character problems by the bucket load.

But you know what? It's precisely those problems which help fuel HP fanfiction. I believe it is, in fact, one of the main reasons why there is so much more HP fanfiction than there is in other fandoms.

***** Sure, there are lots of things that a wizard in theory might do, not to mention the need to ensure Harry sleeps - he's a toddler, which means he may be physically capable of wandering off.

But the fact is that he doesn't do anything. Readers have to create such an event in their heads in order to preserve their mental image of Dumbledore not being a jerk. Of course, even with such reader-created actions, what Dumbledore did is still technically a crime. I believe it was 10 years in prison at the time, but I don't remember for sure now.

And what's more, it wouldn't justify not just /knocking on the door/. Wizards can do amazing things, and one thing they are definitely capable of doing is using their fist to knock on a piece of wood. To, you know, say hello. Maybe /ask/ if a family is financially and emotionally capable of handing the care of second infant. It doesn't matter how great the so-called blood wards are if the family is barely getting by or if Petunia is suffering from severe post-partum depression.

And finally, Dumbledore didn't do any of those imaginary things to make the cold and wet irrelevant because that's just not done in fairy tales, which is what the book is basically modeled after. Harry is a version of Cinderella, and in that context we are supposed to ignore such things. Dumbledore's lack of basic human decency is irrelevant in a fairy tale.

** To Hagrid, Harry is in a custodial hostage/kidnap-type situation. He's being forcibly kept from his world and his heritage. Therefore it makes sense that he smashes in the door, just as the police would do in a similar instance.

He is then greeted by a shotgun. By US police logic, he would have been justified in killing Vernon. Fortunately Hagrid is a wizard and a half-giant and so he has other ways of controlling Vernon. He's able to take the gun and disable it rather than getting anyone killed.

Hagrid is attempting to calm the Dursleys by asking for tea. It's the civilized British thing to do and a signal to them that he isn't planning on harming or scaring them further. Sitting down is more of the same. He's trying to defuse the situation.

Yes, it would have been more polite to introduce himself first but they've already gone beyond polite and the Dursleys know that he's there for Harry. It's better for Hagrid to go straight for the non-threatening body language before he attempts to reason with them.

The "great lump" remark is out of line, yes, but we don't know what sort of tone of voice Hagrid says it in. Keep in mind that he probably hears the same sort of thing himself all the time, and if it's said in a friendly tone of voice it's not really that different from the sort of friendly insult guys give each other frequently.

*** When Vernon demands Hagrid leave, of course Hagrid isn't going to leave. Remember, to Hagrid, Vernon has just freaking kidnapped Harry Potter and dragged him out here to the middle of nowhere to keep him from the wizarding world. He's not a "rightful renter", he's a kidnapper in a criminal hideout. So Hagrid gets angry and insults him.

Now, Vernon and Petunia both know about magic, and Hagrid knows it. Lily and James met with Petunia and Vernon and invited them to their wedding before their deaths. Presumably they would have talked about this to their friends, the circle of which included Hagrid and Dumbledore, so Hagrid would already know that Vernon knew magic. Also it's not Hogwarts policy to conceal the existence of magic from the parent/guardians of its students, so regardless of whether Vernon knew or Petunia kept it from him, he would have learned that day anyway.

One thing I agree with you on is that Hagrid's treatment of Dudley is rather despicable. For the "great pudding of a son" remark, he's not really trying to hurt Dudley, though, he's trying to insult Vernon. Hagrid is just not the best thinker out there. Whether he doesn't know or doesn't care about hurting Dudley's feelings, it's not good either way.

I do wonder if possibly Dumbledore has briefed him before his mission to collect Harry. Hagrid might know about Mrs. Figg's reports on Privet Drive, and he could be aware that Dudley is a bullying git who frequently beats up on Harry with a gang of other boys, and that might be a reason for his harsh treatment of Dudley in this chapter.

to anyone late: Dudley- this is really what the problem was for me. I don't care if Hagrid knows every sordid detail of Harry's treatment by Dudley- belittling, terrifying, and quite literally scarring the boy here and now is distinctly uncool. I don't even know how to argue the fact other than repeat his actions... it's like Snape or no lets use Draco calling Neville a 'great lump' (one of the insults Hagrid used), Neville 'deserves' that too- he has lost his toad, melted a cauldron, and broken his wrist off a broom. Yet Draco, a boy, is clearly represented as being bad here.

***** Neville's actions are all accidents and unintentional, though. Losing his toad and breaking his wrist aren't things Snape should care about- they hurt only Neville. Yes, Neville is clumsy in potions and has melted more than one cauldron, but he doesn't mean to, and part of the reason he's so clumsy is that he's terrified of Snape.

Dudley on the other hand spends most of his time "Harry hunting". Let me reiterate what that involves. Dudley is the leader of a gang made of himself and four other boys. They chase down Harry and one of them, Piers Polkiss, holds Harry's arms behind his back while Dudley, Malcolm, Dennis, and Gordon punch him. That's intentional and it's pretty damn cruel. If this is what Mrs. Figg is reporting, is it any wonder Hagrid has a bad opinion of Dudley?

******* The bit about Hagrid hexing Dudley rather than Vernon because of something Vernon did is just his medieval way of thinking, something quite present in the wizarding world as a whole. In that time, if an adult insulted you and you took revenge by doing something to his kid, it counted as harm to the kid's father and not to the kid (or at least not foremost to the kid).

Weird? Sure. But that's how it was, and that's what Hagrid's attack was; for all he knows, that's the legit way to harm Vernon for his insult.

PS. Many things are like that in the early books. If you look at it in the context of medieval times, it's nothing weird, but if you look at it through the filter of what is now, it becomes really weird and out of place. The detention in the forest, the whole leaving a kid on the doorstep thing, those are just two such examples.

*** This. Remember, the Dursleys have been going to all sorts of ridiculous lengths to keep Harry from getting his Hogwarts letter. Whatever magical feedback system keeps tracks of such things has undoubtedly kept Dumbledore informed of their efforts. Hagrid has been dispatched to do something that is not only tiring to him, but to his mind, should be entirely unnecessary--why would any decent guardians of a child try and prevent him from attending Hogwarts. When Hagrid discovers that Harry doesn't even know about his own powers, heritage, or family, of course that sends him over the top. I, too, was bothered by Hagrid's use of the word 'Muggles' when I first considered it, but like any word, it can have a lot of situational changes in meaning. In this case, it's pretty obvious that he's mad at the Dursleys for their willful ignorance, not blaming them for not being magical. As far as Dudley goes--Hagrid had to listen to him whine, and his parents didn't help matters much. Wizards, after all, are big on family as a predictor of behavior, for better or worse.

****** Ah, well, I'm not getting into the whole Dumbledore manipulation question, but suppose that what Mrs. Figg has seen is mostly Dudley and his gang beating Harry. That would explain Hagrid being so harsh on Dudley, but it's not evidence of guardian abuse, and in the 90's, bullying was seen as just part of life for children, something they had to learn to deal with. No one took it seriously until after the school shooting at Columbine, I would say. There was certainly no movement to stop it and if you reported it you would just get laughed at. Certainly no one would suggest removing a child from a home due to bullying by other children, no matter how brutal it was. (And I will say again, having one child hold Harry's arms behind his back while four others punch him is pretty damn brutal)

It's not in the book. It happens right after Vernon calls Dumbledore a "crackpot". Hagrid bellows out 'never insult Big D again!' and before you can say "poor impulse control" he gives Dudley his tail (which is described as a painful process for Dudley). I get the feeling that it's an old-timey form of punishment to temporarily turn a child into an animal representing their character flaw in the magical world (Draco to a ferret, Dudley to a pig). Adults usually lash out in the same form of punishment they received when children. That being said, I believe Dudley got swined only because of his weight, not for cake-snatching.

***** That's a cool little bit of head canon regarding the turning into an animal thing. I would be happy to run with that. Realistically though that isn't very likely since human transfiguration is studied 6th year. Transfiguration evidently being one of the hardest disciplines and not everyone continuing to that level. Hagrid certainly didn't. So as far as a series wide look at the situation- it was extremely hazardous. The tail was permanent. Dudley would have permanently been a pig or a partial pig until turned back by presumably Dumbledore or McGonagall (unless they were never told, as with the tail). I would think even if it was only hours that would be a traumatic experience.

It says Dudley howls in pain- maybe he is making the most of it (like fake crying earlier in the book) but it isn't written that way. Later after Diagon Alley I have read now that Dudley is still so frighten he runs from the room when Harry enters, on occasion screaming. The kids a bully but I just don't buy Hagrid punishing him in that moment as justifiable even if he knows everything (which I highly doubt).

He consistently acts like someone in his early teens. Might be a half giant or a Hagrid thing, but it means you can't judge him as severely for his actions. Dumbledore means well by entrusting him with a little responsibility, but Hagrid just isn't ready for it.

The problem is simply a bad mix of good intentions and Hagrid's limited understanding of.. everything.
