This is a little meta, I think? We're always complaining about OOC characters in fanfics, so I thought we should have a place where we catalogue the things we think make them out of character. And better yet, tips for keeping them in-character that we use when writing. It's all in the little details after all.

I'm going to comment a few character names, and then we can reply to the names (hopefully that'll keep everything organized). Feel free to add a name if it isn't already here!

*** I've found that people either go too immature with him (full on whiny arrogant child), or go too mature. It's really hard to write a teenager that has had to grow up too fast. Because he's really not an adult yet, and in the books that shows by some of his emotional reactions, and the ways that he screws things up. But he's also not 12... I think getting his mental age right is one of the hardest things to do, and many fics don't do it well...

**** Yes this. Rowling said she saw him as an "old soul", I can definitely see that (while many writers do not, or are too immature themselves to relate), but at the same time he's not an old mind or an old heart. He's astoundingly mature on some subjects - many of them the ones that truly matter, like justice, love, redemption and so on - while also astonishingly impulsive, almost willful on some other matters.

*** I would say Harry Potter is OOC in most fanfics, because he is the ONE character most authors like to experiment with.

Of my top 10 favorite fics, at least 6 Harrys are quite different from his canon version. On the other hand, almost ALL Hermiones are very close to canon.

**** Its sort of the nature of fanfics to change the protagonist. This doesn't necessarily mean they're OOC either as long as their behavior is suppose to be different.

For instance a more aggressive Harry doesn't mean he's OOC. Unless the story starts at X point and Harry is suddenly acting differently.

*** Harry is one of those characters that doesn't get portrayed in a certain way in the books since they are through his eyes, so we don't get a clear picture painted for us on who he is.

He's curious - but not in a Ravenclaw sort of way. He won't seek out information just for the hell of it, and almost everything he learns is just from other people. This is mostly just because he's the protagonist. As some people point out, though, sometimes he's just plain unobservant. A Harry that is motivated to do well doesn't line up with what we see in the books. I also hate when it portrays him as almost as smart as Hermione because we see him as having the same work ethic as Ron (and more similar grades too iirc).

He's angry, but you mostly see that in the 5th book because he's been bottling it up for months. You just know he's been staging arguments in his head and winning all of them while he's at the Dursleys. And he did have some anger when Carrow spat at McGonagall, that was hardly built up but I feel was more of a gut reaction. He's reckless and does things without thinking them through completely, or if he does, we don't see that thought process. He's hardly a planner. Look at the Ministry plan in book 7, which Hermione wanted to perfect but Harry felt would waste time. So a cunning Slytherin Harry doesn't make sense to me, unless he learned all of that from other Slytherins.

I think the one thing that drives Harry is his legitimate desire to see good in the world. It's not just because of his parents either. For this reason I believe dark Harry fics, by definition, are nearly always OOC. I'm sure there's one or two that would convince me but otherwise I don't want to see a Harry that goes so strongly against everything we see in the books.

*** Ron Weasley is *not* a coward, a terrible friend, nor useless, stupid, abusive, or even a crumb-spraying idiot.

Any Ron-bashing fic is completely OOC for Ron. I'm a Ron defender until the very end. Yeah, he's insecure from growing up with five successful, well-liked brothers and having a best friend that is /literally/ the most famous person in the wizarding world. But he's a Gryffindor through and through. From how he is portrayed in canon, he would never, *ever* abuse or rape Hermione. There are ways to pair Hermione with someone else without turning Ron into a villain. Personally, Ron and Hermione are my actual OTP, but because I love to read time travel fics most of all, I very much enjoy reading (Sirius, Remus, James, Tom)/Hermione, etc. I read those way more than R/H. Just because Hermione is dating someone else in your fic doesn't mean you have to turn Ron into an undatable slug or an abusive bastard.

Also, he's not a fucking coward or horrible friend. There are numerous circumstances where Ron shows his bravery throughout the series. Hell, he literally offered himself as a human shield for Harry against a believed mass murdered in POA. After Sirius had already broken his leg, he is still brave enough to say, "If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!"

And to those that think he's a mediocre wizard... no. He's just your every day slacker, guys. He comes from a family of very competent, and even powerful wizards. As he grows up and things become much more serious in the war, he learns how to hold his own in a duel. He becomes an Auror, for Merlin's sake! He's not stupid. I'm in the camp that maintains that he's the best strategist of the three, and that was his most useful strength as an Auror.

So if you're not trying to write Ron OOC, just *stop* with any of the above. I literally skip over every single fic that has "Ron bashing" or "Weasley bashing" in the summary. (Also, Dumbledore bashing, or any goddamn bashing, because honestly, bashing doesn't make any fic better. Whatsoever. But that's another rant for another post.)

I wanna pick this nit, really quickly.

Couldn't one argue that his brothers, while smart, aren't really successful, though? In Ron's fourth year...

- Bill's a professional grave-robber for the Goblins.
- Charlie's basically a zookeeper.
- Percy is a low-level pencil-pusher.

The only thing positive in this light is that they love their jobs. The only Weasleys we can consider truly successful in canon are Fred and George. They own their own business and even in the height of fear it's doing good business.

There is no indication that his family doesn't talk to him /because/ he's a squib. We know that A: One of their relatives is a squib and B: The Weasleys don't generally speak of him. There is no reason to be believe that B is because of A. Most people hate Filch because he's an arse, not because he's a squib. The case here is probably similar.

Given how enthusiastic Arthur Weasley is of all things muggle, and given that he immediately tries to make friends with the Grangers, the accusation that he won't speak to one of his relatives just because he happens to be an accountant is ridiculous.

*Dealing with Draco*

There's this really cool OC that pops up in a lot of HP fics. He's suave, snarky, handsome, a bit of a git, but super good-looking. For some reason, people keep calling him Draco Malfoy.

In canon, Draco is none of those things. He's whiny, spoiled, lacks willpower, rushes into dumb plans with a brashness that completely defies Slytherin claims of cunning, and fails at literally everything he tries. Sure, there's some hints of an angsty redemption arc, but he never does all that much. At the end, we get a vague impression that he's okay now for an ill-defined reason...a lot like Snape, actually.

The way I see it, there are three ways to deal with Draco in fanfics:

1) Just swap him out for cool-guy OC up there.

2) Make him a total git. This is probably closer to canon than the previous option, but it strays into bashing way too easily.

3) My preferred method: Try to keep Draco as close to canon as possible, then give him some vague redemption primarily in the background. Do not take this redemption, or Draco in general, seriously.

I think this had more to do with Draco being from a 'proper family' as Lucius hints in CS, not because of his sons intelligence.

*** A Hermione who doesn't understand muggle things. A good example of this is Hayseed's /Dark Gods in the Blood/, where Hermione doesn't understand media, like TVs and DVD players and video games.

Also, a Hermione who is overly competent in physical things, such as a sudden year 6 fixation with (and ultimate proficiency in) things like kickboxing, karate, and yoga. I just don't feel like that'd be in character for Hermione at all. She's not an athletic character, she's an intellectual character.

And lastly, a Hermione who is perfect at everything and the key to all--even more important than Harry Potter! Take for instance, /The Problem with Purity/, where Hermione is one of 2 people in the wizarding world with an extreme amount of power and the ability to gift it someone else. She is also a very rare unicorn animagus, for some reason possesses the ability to communicate with Fawkes telepathically, frequently shows skills like dueling and hand-to-hand combat, is capable of casual wandless magic, magically "hacks" Hogwarts, and that's only up to chapter 5!

I find fanon Hermione reliably the most annoying, nosy, entitled, controlling character in the story. I don't mind being curious but she'll always /demand/ Harry tell her every single thing going on with him as if it's a given she has to know it, make decisions for him and be pissed off if he doesn't go along with them, moralizing all along the way as if a teenage girl is always going know what's best for her friends more than they do.

At this point I've read this character so many times I've forgotten what canon Hermione is like. I know she did the thing with the firebolt and definitely was obnoxious for part of SS, but I don't remember being pissed off at her for the rest of the books?

*** I have so many opinions and thoughts on Albus, and fanon Albus. Let's see. Just like with Harry like someone said above, people tend to go to extremes with AD. Either he's pure evil, or he's really just a kindly, well-meaning old man (this one irks me in particular because it completely destroys everything that's interesting about AD, even more than the Manipulative!AD trope), or he's bat-shit crazy and senile.

He is none of those things. I see him as one of the most, if not /the/ most complicated character in the books. He's almost contradictory at times, yet he makes complete sense. Here is this charismatic genius, who grew up praised and adored by everyone he ever met, save his family (who were the only ones who knew the truth about him anyway), yet has had to keep this vital secret inside of him for all his teenage years. He's secretive and manipulative because he grew up that way, it's nearly something he cannot help at this point. His one lesson throughout adolescence was basically "keeping secrets is important and saves lives."

He used to be very arrogant - and still is, in many of his presumptions - yet he has an ultimately kind heart. He's capable of acting ruthlessly, forced by his position and power and more than anything, sense of responsibility to make some terrible choices and let horrible things happen, yet he is also fully cognizant of his deeds and regrets them deeply at the same time.

There are two things that are important to me here, regarding Dumbledore: the first is that he is (after Gellert left) no longer that person who would excuse his actions with the words "For the Greater Good", and he never really was to start with. It's a pet peeve every time someone let old!Dumbledore open his mouth and excuse some terrible thing he did with "it's for the greater good." No. Dumbledore would not say that. But the second thing is, neither would he let the cost of his decisions stop him from making them. He knew what Harry was in for when he left him on the steps of No.4, more or less, yet he deemed it necessary, and he made the call. This is, I've found, essentially what made his character so deeply morally grey - he's capable of doing some really shitty things without batting an eye, and he would not excuse it, but neither would he retract his moves because to him, it was always the "right" choice to make.

This is why, to an extent, I can believe part of the manipulative trope surrounding Albus. If he believed that shaping Harry a certain way would have helped with the war, I have no doubt that he would have done it, at least before he really met Harry and came to care for the boy more than he should. The uncertain thing here, however, is how much he really could have seen into the future and predicted the outcomes of his choices. He's scarily intelligent, yet he couldn't have been omniscient as he likes to pretend to be, and the balance here is crucial.

Another thing is that Albus, for all his appearances, is not nearly as selfless as Harry is, and he said as much himself. He's always had some powerful selfish motives that are integral to his character - they're not behind everything he does, but they've made some notable appearances in a few of his choices. The decision to keep Harry in the dark, for example, comes to mind. He refrained from telling Harry about the Prophecy out of his own selfish desire to see Harry happy. And then, the desire to atone himself and to be absolved of his crimes drove him to put on the Gaunt Ring in an astonishingly uncharacteristic bit of rashness and irrationality that eventually cost him his life.

Yet another point about Albus that fascinated me was his relationship with the boy Riddle. I never really got why he came to immediately dislike a mere eleven year old boy, it struck me as quite odd. Why, moreover, would he decide to watch this boy and thwart him in practically everything he tries to do, instead of trying to influence him in a positive manner and get him out of that hellhole he'd lived in? Two things: either Albus was truly blind to the way Muggles really are, and saw only prejudice instead of trauma and bad experience in Riddle's hatred (I wouldn't be surprised, he never truly lived in the Muggle world himself and was never quite targeted the same way - he was, in fact, targeted /because/ people suspected his father was a Muggle-hater), or, more likely he was just highly apathetic about really reaching out and helping unless he had to, until his conscience couldn't take it anymore (supported by the fact that he put off confronting Grindelwald until 1945.) Funnily enough, as much as the Diary Riddle complained of Dumbledore's meddling, Dumbledore's approach towards Riddle and Harry were in fact two extremes: Dumbledore never truly cared to help Tom Riddle, while fingerprints of his control could be seen in every step of Harry's life beginning from his birth. (It also makes me wonder if part of the reason Albus felt this guilt towards Harry was not because of the mistakes he'd came to realize he had made about Tom, making him partially responsible for Harry's miserable life, even though due to obvious reasons he couldn't have revealed his true feelings regarding that eleven year old boy he saw in the orphanage, since he cannot afford for Harry to sympathize with Voldemort more than he was already doing.)

Anyhow, piles upon piles of essays could be written about this character, that's how complex and fascinating he is, so I generally find the prevalent use of those poorly made caricatures as substitution for him in fanfiction pretty sad.

********* That was a wild magic surge --- wizards definitely can hurt themselves by falling, in fact Harry does that a couple of times. And other than this Neville incident, there's no evidence to wizards bring tougher that muggles.

On the other hand, werewolves are tougher, which often leads to this confusion, as people remember Remus and Fenrir being really tough.

*** This is one of the few things legitimately bothering me in the Pureblood Pretense.

They're not affectionate to first years and call them "puppy" - they give them experimental Puking Pastilles. They also don't switch places for the day. This isn't Ouran High School Host Club. They don't call each other Gred and Forge until Christmas when they get the G and F sweaters, and it's more of a way to poke fun at their mother than an effort to confuse their fellow students.

*** Evil, and obsessed with Lily are the common ones. They were best friends during adolescence and he's responsible for her death. His actions in canon make sense without some perverse obsession.

Also canon Snape is an ugly fucker. He doesn't look like Alan Rickman.

OOC Snape can also be completely evil, disregarding Lily's wishes and happiness, and over-the-top hating Harry.
