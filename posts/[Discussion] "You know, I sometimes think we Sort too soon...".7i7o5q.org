If Dumbledore, the Board of Governors and the MoM pushed through the change that would see students sorted later in the Hogwarts careers, where would you lot think to re-sort those students? Is there any character of the series that you think would have a definite alternate House if resorted in, say, their third year or above?


** Instead of resorting, I'd like to see a common class for the first two years, and /then/ +re+sort.

It could lead to interesting group mechanics.

*** That's what I think, too. You figure they start in the 6th-grade-age equivalent here in the US, so common class for 6th-7th and sort in maybe 8th or 9th equivalent. Maybe sort of like the first couple of years are your "liberal arts" portion and then the later years you focus on more specific things.

** Considering the attitude of most teenagers, what with thinking they know best I could only assume most of them would go in slytherin.

** It's kind of a trope at this point, but I think nearly every student would get re-sorted into Slytherin once they're age 15 or so. They're starting to become adults, they kind of know who they are and what they want to do. /Everyone/ has some sort of ambition, and that is often the driving factor in a lot of decisions they make.

This is really only if we take house ideologies at face value though.

***** So do the other aspects that are used to sort people.

The rebellious phase definitely has a use for wit, and despite yourself there are things that you are learning; standing up to bullies that are quite common that this age takes bravery, and when it is in defence of another there is also nobility; as people turn and escape to their own places, staying close to those whom you consider friends takes loyalty, and if you do not have unconditional support there are problems you will have to work hard to solve.

Being of a certain age does not mean one only has ambition, just in many forms.

*** And if we take the Sorting Hat for an idiot. It's pretty clear from how equal the numbers of each House are each year that he keeps in mind how many he's already Sorted into each house and tips the balance one way or another to try and get a decently spread-out year in the end. So if he noticed /everyone/ he was Sorting went to Slytherin, he'd realize something was amiss, demand we start over, and he'd leave Slytherin for the only /really, really/ ambitious while looking at secondary characteristics to Sort the others.

** Tbh, most characters have enough traits to have fit into several, if not all, houses. Not to mention that people generally get to choose. Case in point, Zacharias Smith.

In the end, it's all about putting new students into four nice columns to simplify logistics. Apart from some Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry (possibly Quidditch-fueled), houses never seemed to be a big deal like it is in many fanfics. Back when the Founders lived, sure, but now?

** I've always liked to envision a scene where the Sorting Hats finally has enough and complains about how it has had to sort people for years to protect them as much as they can from other students and from their own families because no one else will and then demands the staff start actually caring about their students and starts calling our resorts. Moving Crabbe and Goyle to Hufflepuff for their loyalty to Malloy. Moving Hermione and Percy to Slytherin for their ambition etc.

I feel that even just with some of the characters we know details about that this fits. Crabbe and Goyle are incredibly loyal but their death eater fathers would probably not have taken a Hufflepuff sorting very well. Hermione and Percy are both incredibly ambitious but Slytherin would have chewed them up for being a mud blood and a blood traitor.

** Harry I could see being re sorted into Hufflepuff. While Slytherin is what a lot of people see him as considering what the Sorting Hat said before, his loyalty is in my opinion what defines him.

I could see Percy and Hermione being in Slytherin for different reasons. Hermione wants equality as seen constantly through out the books, with the house elves as well as with Muggleborns. If a Muggleborn was sorted into Slytherin it would make Slytherins question if what they thought was actually right.

While Percy is a pretty ambitious person, he wants to be noticed by others and his desire to do that could get him re sorted into Slytherin.

Neville I could see either in Gryffindor or re sorted into Hufflepuff. He's had moments that show he belonged in Gryffindor, especially when the Death Eaters took over Hogwarts. But perhaps having a head of house that would have been more thoughtful to Neville might make him become more sure of himself sooner if he had been re sorted into Hufflepuff.

Ron I see as Gryffindor. Draco I see as Slytherin.

Luna I could see as a potential Gryffindor. Believing in things no one else does, and standing up for yourself and others in intense situations could be considered quite brave.

** There was a fanfiction that did do that, and I found that I partially agreed with some of their placements.

Hermione, had the blood status rules for being accepted into it lifted, would have been a Slytherin. She had to be cunning and ambitious. I feel like she embodied a little of every house, but her ambition for fixing the Wizarding World wins me over her to Slytherin. If we factor in her cunning in her 2nd year (Polyjuice and cupcaking Crabbe and Goyle), and her 4th year (Rita Skeeter), she'd definitely make the cut.

Harry could be a Hufflepuff. While no doubt he is brave as a Gryffindor, I feel his loyalty is what defined him, especially in the later books. Loyalty to his friends, that he brought Cedric Diggory's body back, to Dumbledore, instead of etting Aberforth convince him otherwise, hell, to a world that so easily turned against the Boy-Who-Lived. He was loyal to them even though they'd been targeting him since he was 14.

Ron Weasley would have stayed in Gryffindor. Abandoning his friends would have negated his Hufflepuffity, and he isn't cunning enough, I feel, to be in Slytherin. One could make a case for Ravenclaw, because his strategic abilities are amazing, but he is not a studious person, so his bravery and recklessness would keep him with the lions.

Percy Weasley would have been with Hermione, for very different reasons. His self preservation is very high, and it wasn't until at the brink of conflict resolution that he turns to the correct side.

Neville would have stayed or gone with Harry. That's ambiguous, but if we factor in his 7th year, I feel like he would stay in Gryffindor.

Luna could stay or go with Harry. She went to Azkaban for supporting him. She fought with him. But she's a rare kind of smart too.

Draco Malfoy would stay where he is. He's not brave, he's not loyal, and while he is smart, his cunning and self preservation win out.

I could see Gregory Goyle in Hufflepuff for putting up with Malfoy's crap all those years, and following him and whatnot.

You know, I've seen this a lot, but other than Chess, where is he a good Strategist? He's not even a regional champion or anything, he's just /good/ at chess. I might be forgetting stuff though.

(One of my brothers was regional champ some years ago, and he's... lets say less than brilliant, so I have that as a frame for Ron's character)

** I know many others will disagree with me but here are my thoughts:

Hermione: She would be resorted into Ravenclaw. She is brave and loyal, but Hermione seeks knowledge for its own sake and has a hard time disregarding the words she finds in books. Her default actions always seem to lend her as a Ravenclaw.

Percy Weasley: He should have been a Slytherin. Percy was ambitious. He wasn't evil, he just wanted to gain a certain respect for himself and raise his social standing. I often wonder what kind of change Percy could have had on his family in regards to Slytherins.

Remus Lupin: Should have been a Hufflepuff. Sirius comes back and explains about Peter and Remus is just on board? He's super loyal and should have been sorted as such. Just to add: Tonks was a 'Puff and it didn't mean that she wasn't also brave.
