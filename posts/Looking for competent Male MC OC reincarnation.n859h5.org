Hey I was wondering if there was any fanfics where it's isekai in the beginning and MC strives to do his very best. I'd heavily prefer no romance or no harem that traditionally comes with fanfiction. Thank you!!


** So, you want a oc that was originally part of the story but when he died he went back to the past?

Is this what you were asking? There is many fics with Harry like this but i never read one with an oc.

Or are just asking for guy from universe A goes to universe B? You can probably find tons of crossovers like this.
