I'm looking for a story I read a while ago here are the details that I remember:

- Harry joins a secret group after the war to hunt and kill surviving death eaters

- Harry is helped by a couple of unspeakables

- Shaklebolt is prime minister and Arthur Weasley is his deputy

- the story is pretty dark and gory including a scene where someone casting the cruciatus curse touches the victim with the wand causing their eye to explode

Thanks in advance for the help.


** Wrath of Merlin, I think it's called. I'm positive the sequel is called Auror Commander. Both are absolutely fantastic.
