** I used to love this brand but I don't buy them anymore. They feel really nice but I've never had a pair of underwear disintegrate as fast as these do, within 6 months there's always holes in them. For the price they just aren't worth it in my opinion. I live in Canada though, so the high shipping cost is part of the issue for me.

*** For me anyways, I've been buying them for over a year now and every design is still in tact. I usually air dry though, which they recommend. Also the shipping is free in America. Even my older pairs are still extremely soft. But to each their own!
