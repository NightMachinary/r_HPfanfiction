*** Seconding [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]!

The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/6/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One][They Shook Hands]] series is another Slytherin!Harry retelling of the saga and it's pretty good and has some neat characterizations but in my opinion OTWTG is better and closer to how Slytherin!Harry would have played out in canon.

** Hermione in canon. (More so than Harry, Draco, or Ron, anyway.)

For actual fics,

- A recent good one is [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/red-hair-green-tie-hp.334067/][/Red Hair, Green Tie/ by Kevin Vacit]], a rare Slytherin!Ron fic.

- The same author also has a neat SI (and I say that as someone who does not, generally, read SIs) [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][The Perks of Survival]], wherin the author finds himself to be Sally-Anne Perks, the witch that, in canon, was sorted just before "Potter" in PS and then was /not/ called up for OWLs between "Patil" and "Potter". Now, the author remembers the canon books, but we are never told what actually happened to her in-story (as it was probably just an error by JKR), so the author sets out to avoid whatever the heck it was that disappeared her. Of course, such preoccupation with one's own survival can only be SLYTHERIN!

Other than that, here are some recent threads on the topic:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2o2is6/looking_for_slytherin_harry_stories/]]

Other than that, in the "Slytherish"-not-in-Slytherin category,

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/][/Reign of the Serpent/ by AlphaEph14]]: A heavy AU, where Salazar took over and rules magical Britain with an iron fist. Hogwarts does not have Houses, but /everybody/ is a little more cunning and ambitious, particularly Hermione.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11076424/1/][/Heap Coals of Fire on His Head/ by White Squirrel]]: One-shot. After losing the war, being held prisoner by the Death Eaters, seeing her friends' lives ruined, and being sold to the highest bidder, Hermione finally embraces her Slytherin side and finds a way to take control of her life again.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8885902/1/][/Remedial Lessons/ by SymphonySamurai]]: Features a ruthless!Hermione (still a Gryffindor). Is an extended one-shot, so some aspects are iffy.

What happens to the characters we know and love when a certain BWL just... doesn't exist? Trace the lives of Harry's class as they react to things in a world where Harry Potter's presumed to have died. In particular, while she isn't sorted there, the changes the Hermione goes through bring to light a ruthless, cunning side.

Currently a WIP, but I love what the author has done with Ron and Percy as well.

** Another one that might fit the bill is [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/ by Diane Castle]]. It takes place in an AU where James Bond style superscience takes the place of magic, and "Harworts" is a posh boarding school for training secret agents, spymasters, assassins, and other personnel for Britain's tumultuous Intelligence Community. Nobility, like "Wellesleys" and "Malenfants" send their children there, but some children not born into The Community --- like Hermione --- get an invitation by doing something too clever and too vicious at too young an age, and doing it very well. Hermione is placed into "Gryff", but she engages in more than her fair share of cunning and pragmatism.

*** Just got sucked into this fic, +and offering up my seconds to [[/u/turbinicarpus]]'s suggestion!+

edit - Good premise, but I think I have to retract my recommendation; this fic devolves pretty quickly into overpowered Hermione worship. Meh. I'll keep reading until the end because the idea is unique and the world building is good, but probably won't bother trying to keep up with this fic (especially since it's hosted on a weird site that I can't follow as easy as ff.net). I'm fine with a child genius as long as I'm not getting beaten over the head with it. Show, don't tell; this story has at least three soliloquies per chapter talking about how brilliant this Hermione is, and the author has bundled every good trait in existence up and given them to Hermione, effectively creating a Mary Sue...

**** Yeah, in the grand scheme of things, Diane Castle seems to be pretty big on Girl Power in general; and while her strong female characters are a refreshing break from much of the rest of HP popular fandom (c.f. Robst and much of Dramione), she often slips into mild to moderate misandry.

An interesting parallel is how a lot of fanfics have everyone fawning over Harry's magical prowess when he shows off his stag Patronus, unmatched in size and virility.

For following it (and all the other fanfic I follow), I use Calibre plugin FanFicFare, which supports scores of sites, including that one.

***** Usually I'm not even a fan of the overly-powerful character thing to begin with, make or female.

I think another issue I had was just not being able to suspend disbelief regarding Hermione's accomplishments vs her age. I wish the author had aged her characters by about 5 years; it would've been a cool thing to do for an AU too.

Anyway, I did appreciate the really creative take, and it started off strong.

"Powerful" means different things in a non-magical universe, but, I agree. It's like the author gave Hermione more Character Points than she had anybody else.

I don't know about aging up... Hermione being precocious makes perfect sense, and the other children being more mature does as well, especially given that these /are/, in fact, child soldiers in training, except that they are being trained to be the elite special forces (some --- literally, others --- metaphorically), not cannon fodder like most real-world child soldiers would be.

Very well stated. I think a lot of my sadness with how this fic went is summed up here.

To your second point - if the other characters had matched or tapered Hermione's seemingly 'exponential' point gain, maybe that would have been better that 'aging up.' And the other kids do gain, true.... but I still stand by one of my original misgivings; Castle makes Hermione the heroine of every single plot point, and hinges all the tension/conflict of every plot point on Hermione's shoulders. Maybe this is an unreliable child narrator effect? I don't know. But that's where I felt the story begin to lose depth and became less enjoyable.

Although in the end, I understand that I am just one single reader, and my opinions are just that. (:
