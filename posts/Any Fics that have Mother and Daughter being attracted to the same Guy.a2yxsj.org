So its like this: During the School Years or from the Point of finishing School the Mother is attracted to a Guy and he also about her. But she assumes that they havent any future together so she break up and finds comfort and Love in another Partner. A Certain time later, they have a Daughter and maybe occasionally the Mother and her "former" attractive meet, but nothing serious happens, also tension might exist. Then at some point, the Daughter meets the Guy her mother was attracted to and become also attract. to him. So she might ask her mother about him. The Guy may be attracted to her, because the daughter is just a Doppelgänger version of her Mother, just younger.

​

Possible love making scenes are fine (whether between mother and the guy or Daughter and the Guy).


** There are a few stories with Harry, Hermione and her mum having a Threesome, but those aren't exactly rich with plot and probably violate the "no links to explicit underage" rule. Search for "Christmas with the Grangers" or the author red Jacobson, who has a two story series with that "pairing"
