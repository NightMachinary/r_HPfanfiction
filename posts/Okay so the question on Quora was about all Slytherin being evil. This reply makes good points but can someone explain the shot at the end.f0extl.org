'If all Slytherins are evil, why bother to educate them? Simply have them go from the Sorting Hat stool to jail.

According to Harry Potter Wiki, Slytherins are known for being ambitious, resourceful, and cunning. The way it is written, being ambitious and resourceful are considered evil. Is this something that would have been different had JK not been British?'

What is that last bit?


** It basically comes from the story starting out as kids' books. The difference between good and evil had to be clear rather than grey. Later they kept turning more grey and more complex and thus, blurred the lines to an extent but the line could not be completely erased once drawn.

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre.

** I assume it's a reference to our actor's tending to play manipulative bad guys quite often and quite well.

Or possibly an American remarking that ambition and resourcefulness (That whole 'we are a nation of haves and soon-to-haves' American dream nonsense) are very American qualities and thus evil to the British.

It's also possibly just a genuine question. Simply, 'cultural evils' are relative to different cultures. Americans often see supportive, welfare-concerned actions as evil, where a Swede might consider an American's 'no welfare but my own welfare' individualism evil, etc. If someone knew that, then maybe they're asking who the villains would be if the writer wrote from a different cultural perspective. Though I suspect that's overestimating the commenter.

I'm not sure what you're talking about there. The American colonies leaving can be tied to the 7 years war (or the French and Indian war as it's taught in America), but that's simply fiscal matters. French involvement in the American revolutionary war was entirely aimed at giving the British a humiliating bloody nose, and it worked to perfection there.

(Well, if you define perfection as putting us as much in debt as the British but with worse terms... and a finance minister that pretended it wasn't real and that the king didn't have to worry about it).

This made Britain decide that America wasn't worth complete bankruptcy by going all out and backed off. Then beating the french later.

******** Uh...

Sorry, but that's not quite accurate. The involvement on both sides was entirely focused in the Americas - and the French waited until the Americans had some actual victories before starting to back them (it's why Saratoga was a big deal). It's true that French involvement is a big reason why the British gave up (eg, by trapping Cornwallis at Yorktown), but the British didn't just back off to best the French.

(Edit - sorry, /almost/ entirely focused in the Americas - there were a few naval battles in the east Indies and Africa I believe, but hardly anything important in contrast to the Americas)

Besides, the closest you could point to a subsequent British victory is 40 years later, a half dozen government changes in France, and another half dozen French war victories later, along with basically all of Europe's monarchies needing to band together. Not really all that connected in my view

I don't know about witcher797, but I was taught (in summary) that we got involved first out of irritation and desire not to lose our interests in the US, got more enthusiastic when the French involved themselves, then pulled out when we realised we'd massively overextended and the French-funded Americans were doing better than we expected. It wouldn't surprise me if that was significantly biased though, we are a nation that still brags about how we won a football match over fifty years ago (Two World Wars and One World Cup was a popular chant, though less so these days).

Ah, okay. I would still say we were taught it was secondarily a proxy war - we really, really enjoyed fighting the French pre-WWII - but definitely not the focus. We also really, really enjoyed the income from having colonies [:D]. Though, this was never formally taught to me, mind, my GCSE History Teacher was simply really enthusiastic and went on a lot of Odysseus-level tangents. She once dressed up as Ambroise Pare (the Barber Surgeon) to answer questions about the history of his inventions and innovations and whatnot and ended up talking about the origins of the Sweeney Todd myth.

**************** Definitely interesting! And I can see how the war was taught as a proxy war (and emphasized as such), since it certainly was as a secondary factor in what was going on. The income bit is interesting too - since the whole American Revolution started over the americans not being happy at being taxed.

Your history teacher does sound like a lot of fun!

For Napoleon, there's a caveat that he's still somewhat of a contentious figure within France - you can find varied opinions on him pretty easily. Then again, that's also true for much of the revolutionaries - eg, Robespierre. But on Napoleon specifically, those tended to be more of the internal nature - ie, him being the end of the Revolution. Generally though, at least through the end of primary school and from how my french family/friends discuss him, he's viewed as a great leader (and military leader). Certainly not a proto-Hitler, as I've seen from some of the more british views of him!

The other thing there is that the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars were firmly put in a defensive context - ie, France getting ganged up on by the rest of Europe that just wanted to squash the revolution and put the Bourbons back in charge - and that whenever France (or Napoleon) won, they just were mad and would start the fighting again, forcing us to take more to try to stop it. It's just as much a national fiction as 'Napoleon the super aggressive proto-Hitler'! Oh, and you can't forget about how a lot of the reforms of the Revolution crystallized under Napoleon - the Napoleonic code, governmental reforms, education, etc - he had a big impact on a lot of that, that'll affect how he's viewed.

***************** Yep. We were big on money in those days, to the exclusion of those silly little niceties like human rights and basic morality (that was a joke). We literally got China so addicted to opium that we ruined their economy and ensured that several generations of their government (including the initial Communist Party revolutionaries) got most of their income from Opium taxes, all to get extra silver to buy more tea from them. We loved our money. And our tea. :)

That's very interesting. I imagine him ending the revolution is probably regarded as a generally positive thing in France, though? Stability and building on their successes and moving on from those events and all. But I mean, to be fair, don't forget we also see him as the cranky short guy who doesn't want people to see his hand despite him being over five and a half feet in modern terms. :D

I do get your point though, and it makes sense that most of those visibly involved in the Revolution would be contentious - it's the nature of a Revolution, after all. The new overpowering the old, and almost always with great enthusiasm necessitated by the old being so entrenched in society. The balance between their philosophies and their actions often make evaluating them holistically quite complex. But it's a really interesting point that the views on Napoleon are not just about Napoleon himself. It's a mixture of opinions on the things he did and the things that were connected to him and the things that came before him. Same with most historical things, yes, but it's always an important and interesting point to remember. :)

That defensive context is another thing I didn't know. It makes sense, one country needing to pull itself together to fend off a whole bunch of others, but it's not something I'd heard put to the Napoleonic/Revolutionary events before. I imagine it's probably somewhere between the two in reality. Napoleon needed a binder for a new social order to create a national identity and needed to unite people to get resources and approval for fighting off Europe and taking their stuff.

****************** Don't worry, there was plenty of that going around about money in those days. At least it can make for some interesting stories when we move away from the colonial aspects (like french taxation on tobacco pre-revolution brings up some nice smuggling stories).

Him ending the Revolution is viewed somewhat divisively in France. There's a few streams of thought on the subject - generally everyone agrees that the revolution of 89 was a good thing, then there's people who think that the /true/ revolution was that of 92 (and plenty of people who think that that is where it got way out of hand), and plenty of opinions in between and about what followed.

I actually recently dug up an article about a poll from the 80s on the subject (right before the bicentennial - the period brought a bunch of new takes on the Revolution, as well). To kind of show mixed opinions on them in France (% favorable, % dis-favorable):

Pre-Revolutionary: Louis XVI (15/23)

Early revolutionaries: LaFayette (43/6), Mirabeau (17/8)

Radical revolutionaries: Robespierre (19/40), Danton (21/26), Saint-Just (21/10), Marat (8/21)

Napoleon (39/21)

The only one that's clearly popular is LaFayette, and then Napoleon is generally positively viewed - but all the major ones are pretty clearly divided. So even 200+ years after the fact, it's not nearly as clear cut as the American revolution is in the US... Makes sense, given that the debate over the French Revolution was probably the biggest political one in France/Europe for at least 50 years after it started!

Huh. That's really interesting reading, thanks!

The positive or negative nature and outcomes, sure, but the actual 'definition', no. Do you have any recommended sources I can read to find out more about that period?

I'd be curious to find out how those stats changed post-Les Mis and Hamilton. I know neither of those are about the Revolutions, but I can see them having some influence in romanticising the events and general anti-governmental rebellion. Might be no change whatsoever, but it'd be interesting if there were. :)

******** So the story goes that George Washington was six years old and he gets a hatchet for a gift (because this was 1738 and responsible parenting just wasn't a thing back then). So he, being a rambunctious and lively six year old, immediately takes the hatchet to the first tree he can find - a Cherry Tree nearby his house. Him being six also means that he didn't know how to chop a tree down properly and basically just took some chunks out of it (there's another version where he actually chops the thing down). His dad, Augustine (who dies when he's eleven, incidentally) comes along and demands that George tell him who hacked bits off the tree (responsible parenting, ftw!) or chopped it down (depending on which version of the story you favour). George, being such a nice boy, admits to it "I cannot tell a lie. I did cut it with my hatchet/I chopped down the Cherry Tree." His father is supposedly so overjoyed by the boy's honesty that he proclaims that it's worth a thousand cherry trees, that his boy told the truth.

It's a common myth told to children in the States and American friends have told me that some quite earnestly see it as gospel truth.

So, we tried to get around their 'only trade in one city' rule by trying to smuggle Opium into the country (I think we grew it in Bangladesh?). It worked pretty well, so we fucked up the Chinese economic trade surplus (a technical term for them making more off us than we made off them) and got a bunch of them addicted to Opium. So, they tried a bunch of peaceable solutions like appealing to our morality and offering to trade Opium stocks for tea, the latter of which we very weirdly didn't go for. So, they were forced to action. Pulled a Boston Tea Party and seized the drugs, which we didn't like very much as they were our drugs and they were making us boatloads of cash. So, we sent over the navy and shot the shit out of them for a while until they surrendered, then we dickishly imposed our dickishly unfair laws on them, took Hong Kong, and the Opium trade resumed.

Obviously, that got the locals a bit miffed at the westerners.

So, the ruling regime cooperating (despite being shot into doing so) with them got the locals a bit miffed at them, too. Long story short, this unrest fomented into a rebellion, and a second Opium War when we realised the first one didn't entirely get us what we wanted - we were also fighting in India in '57 and '58, and had an anti-Chinese election in '57, so we were pretty focused on squeezing all we could out of them. We brought in France and Russia as buddies too, because the Chinese weren't doing badly and we had a habit of 'bring overwhelming force' back then. Again, Long Story Short, after doing a bunch of dickish things like burning cultural icons (The Summer Palaces), we won and made them sign some treaties giving us stuff again.

This all finally capped off with something you might've heard of called the 'Boxer Rebellions'. I forget their real name, but a group we nicknamed the Boxers for their martial arts prowess had been miffed with us for years. In 1890-something, they rebelled against us. Again, due to us being dicks with things like converting many to Christianity and protecting them over the locals whenever possible. The Empress of the time declared war when the initial rebellion went well, and again we brought in our buddies and beat them. We weren't good winners either, sacking the cities and executing anyone even suspected of being a Boxer. Again, money talked and we handled things very badly. But we did learn. Afterward, we decided to let the Chinese Government govern the populace and just dealt with the Government itself. They bowed to pressure and changed their systems, ditching a lot of the traditional cultural practices for a more westernised 'university-education' system.

I think the events are perfectly summarised by what the Chinese call the century between 1849 and 1949: The 'Century of Humiliation'.

But either way, the Dynasty government reformed a bunch of things until it fell in 1910-ish and the Republic of China became a thing and the people who started it really played into the concept of Nationalism to bring the new country together as a single nation rather than simply highly-involved provinces. The government was also very anti-foreign influence and talked a lot about it. Not much else interesting really happened until the 90s when the anti-Western/foreign thing kicked up again. Mostly due to us fucking up in Belgrade and bombing their embassy by accident and the Republic of China needing foreigners to blame whenever it felt a bit pressured domestically and the civilian population feeling that Western Media blames them a lot. That latter point originates from that Christianisation issue I mentioned earlier on, but an aspect I didn't mention where the less-judging-of-Chinese-culture Jesuits were out-competed by more 'yay westernism, down Chinese cultural practices' missionaries. This view is growing more and more since the 90s, due to the Chinese economy strengthening and our view that their rapid industralisation and media-apparent disregard for liberty, free speech, and civil rights are Bad Things. Right or wrong, when you keep yelling that you think someone is evil, they're gonna get annoyed that you keep yelling at them that you think they're evil.

They're also apparently talking a lot more recently like we do about Russian interference in elections. Lots of western-interference conspiracy theories there. They do act on it too, sometimes - investigating organisations with western funding, talking about changing things around to prevent western involvement in China, etc.

So, yeah. Basically, we broke their national power for economic reasons by getting them all addicted to drugs, repeatedly beat them and forced them to sign increasingly severe treaties giving us stuff, then started to see them as backwards and evil to our 'morally superior, comparatively liberal democratic values' while simultaneously modifying their culture. They reacted by pointing out how we'd fucked them over and some politicians used that sentiment to their own advantage.

*********** You're talking about the Pledge of Allegiance. It's almost entirely a religious practice which most people don't ever do. It's very old-school. I literally don't know anyone who can reliably remember all the words, let alone “chants in praise to our flag” everyday.

You've been hating on America all over this thread, for some reason, but everything you've said has been either outdated, out of context, or just entirely made up.

I mean, George Washington chopping down the cherry tree? It's a folk tale, dude. You know more of the story details than I or anyone else I know does.

************ I mean, I admittedly don't know if I'm definitively right, no. I can only speak from what I've read or seen, and a lot of media (news and entertainment) and such talks about how you do still do the Pledge of Allegiance and talks about a litany of legal challenges that failed due to 'under god' and such being 'patriotic and not religious' - I was under the impression that the broad current status was that you are supposed to say it, but aren't forced to if you have 'conscientious scruples' against doing so.

If I'm wrong about anything I've said, please do correct me. I am admittedly an English person commenting on a country I've never been to and only see through the lens of news media, academic papers, and textbooks, so I'd value hearing the opinion of an actual American here. Is the Pledge really not a thing? Or is it an regional-based thing?

No. You aren't "supposed" to say it. It's a thing some people do but it's trending towards uncommon. Perhaps 20 years ago you'd have been more on the mark. Like I said, earlier, I don't know anyone who even remembers the words with any kind of reliability.

The only group that has any obligation to recite the Pledge is our military, but more often than not it's just a silent salute to the flag itself, without reciting the words.

************** Really? Huh. I had no idea. That's definitely not how things in the US are shown here.

This ([[https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/the-seriousness-with-which-americans-take-their-flag-and-national-anthem-is-unusual-4055152-Jun2018/]]) isn't the most valid example given it's a solely internet-news site, but the sentiment is summarised well there.

'Anyone who has ever spent time in the United States knows it is a very nationalistic country'.

-And this ([[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/20/florida-boy-arrested-refused-pledge-of-allegiance-school]]) is also a good example of the sentiments we often see.

'The school district's code of conduct recognizes students' right to opt out of the pledge of allegiance with permission from a parent'.

There's also this ([[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/our-humanity-naturally/201411/pledge-allegiance-has-become-nightmare-many-kids]]) that talks similarly to the Guardian Article.

'numerous students from all over the country are reporting that teachers and administrators are reacting with hostility when the right to sit out is exercised'.

All three articles show sentiments that are often told to us here in the UK regarding the US. And to acknowledge your first comment on the separation of Church and State, we also get a lot of news talking about the erosion of the wall between those two entities and how many religious groups basically direct their flocks on how to vote (both explicitly and implicitly). So, your comment is very interesting. In fact, it rather mimics our approach to our National Anthem - most of us don't know the words to that either. I'm very curious how typical your experience is and how utterly biased our news might be. I was talking to someone else a while back who talked about how there's a lot of subtle variation between the regions in the US that we elsewhere don't really see.

I really hope this doesn't come across as hating, because I wasn't trying to be - though I admit I don't overly like a lot of what I thought America did. But I'm really curious at how valid this evident bias of ours toward 'patriotic america!' is in reality now. If you're not interested in talking to me about this (and you're under no obligation to do so, obviously), then would you mind/be able to give me a pointer towards where I might investigate myself? If what I'm sharing is wrong, I'd very much like to correct myself.

** i think the person who posed the question was wondering wether the british culture and its value could have a hand in the way ambitiousness and resourcefulness are seen as evil traits. personally, i think there are a lot of countries in which these traits are seen in a negative light, as an example of selfishness and individualism. that is to say, the key expression of the sentence is "a lot", instead of "all".
