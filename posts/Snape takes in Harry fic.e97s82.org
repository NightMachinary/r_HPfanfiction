:END:
I remember reading this a while back and I somehow lost the link. I think it takes place the summer of OoTP (could be wrong), Harry is kicked out and gets tossed in with Snape. At first, Snape constantly insults him but he soon see's Harry's wounds from abuse and how he won't eat and how his clothes are too big. I remember he gets Harry tailored and some nee clothing. It would be awesome if somebody found this or new what it was called.


** OH MY GOSH YES I DID JUST READ THIS LIKE A WEEK AGO!!! :) At least I think I did! :) It starts at the end of fourth year, and Snape does get Harry to live with him, and he DOES like you said, start to see Harry's injuries and stuff and realizes he's been abused. Also he does take him to get clothing. Yes it checks all your BOXES! :)

  Harry is called up to Dumbledore's office at the end of his fourth year and told he is to go and live with Severus Snape. Severus does what no one else bothered to doâ€• he takes care of Harry. Watch as Harry flourishes to all that he was meant to be: A Slytherin with a heart of a lion. No slash. Will Harry be able to beat Voldemort and save the people he loves? Read and find out.

** Do you maybe remember anything else? Because while I don't remember all the names, I have read everything you described at least 20 times in as many different fics. It is a very common trope and you really haven't included any identifyable or unique detail.

*** Yeah I realize that I should have specified more, unfortunately I can't remember anything else other than a few vague details that might not even be true. It could be possible that Harry was kicked out and left with nothing of his own belongings. Snape also wandered in on Harry have a nightmare. If this helps, I found this fic while looking for a Harry visits Snape's portrait fic and stumbled upon it in a thread.

**** Mhh, have you used the search function in the sub? I think looking through the past "Snape takes in Harry" request threads might be a good idea. Maybe you see the name or summary of a fic and recognize it.

  Petunia Dursley is cleaning the attic and finds a previously unknown copy of Lily's will. Ecstatic at her discovery, she promptly abandons her burdensome nephew, along with Lily's will, on the doorstep of her childhood nemesis (aka, Severus Snape). ***SEQUEL "Lily's Last Wish" NOW POSTED*** I do not own Harry Potter or make any money from these stories.
