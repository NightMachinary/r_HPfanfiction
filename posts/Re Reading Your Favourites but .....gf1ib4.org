Recently with all the time on my hands, I have been trying to find and read all my favourite stories from back in the day (anything from 5 - 10 years). All I can remember about these stories are they were terrific, and I thoroughly enjoyed it and read it multiple times at the time.

But after reading a few of them, I begin to find them to be a drag and overall lacking. Is it because I have been over-saturated with stories overtime? What seemed to be original at the time are now cliches? Or is it this one of those "expectation vs. reality" situations?

Interested in hearing if anyone else experienced this, and what do you think the reason might be?


** Your tastes change and get more refined over time as you gain more experience with good fics. So your perception of "good" changes, shifts upwards, and fics that were good a decade ago are bad now.

Writers get more experienced as well - back in the day, the only good fics were written by people with natural talent, but nowadays there are people who've refined their craft for close to 20 years.

Additionally, some fics are only good because they build tension well or have a compelling mystery, but if you read them again they become supremely boring because you already know how it is solved. Similarily to how we tire of tropes do you tire of a story that you already know the outcome of.

** Sometimes, it depends on your exposure to a trope or character interpretation. The first time you come across, say, a Daphne fic, her portrayal can seem novel and interesting. But as you read more, those might get revealed to be a trope - and so a while later, when you return to the first work, you're disappointed because it no longer strikes you as original.

The minimum quality threshold will also depend on your mood. Typically, I find that when first exposed to fanfiction or a particular sub-genre, my standards are a bit lower - so fics that first scratch that itch are more likely to have had me stick around and enjoy it the first time, but on a re-read they fail. I know that personally, I've become more picky on the writing quality to be able to enjoy a fic.

That doesn't mean that old fics /all/ lose their luster - some of my favorite fics are still some of the first ones I was exposed to. However, that might just have been the luck of the draw, and having found some good ones...

*** I never thought of it that way, I would have a lower level of expectation when I am reading something new. It definitely make sense and I probably do it subconsciously.

I have been reading quite a few of the older works, and so far none of them have measured up to my remembered expectations. Fingers crossed that some of them will hold up to it. If I may ask, what are some of yours?

**** Yeah, it'd depend on the way you remembered them too - sometimes poor quality (or made for a younger audience) can still be enjoyable with nostalgia, but that isn't always the case.

Fic wise, the first one I read was linkffn(Harry Potter and the natural 20), which I still find excellent. Another two that I read fairly early on are linkffn(With strength of steel wings) and linkffn(The Never-ending Road), both of which are really well written.

As for tropes, I can get overexposed to them and not enjoy reading fics in that genre. Even though I loved The Moment it Began as it was published and updating, it's hard for me to reread it because there's hundreds of fics using the same premise that I've read before so it all feels repetitive.

** There is a lot of suspension of disbelief among fanfic readers. We all pretend those stories are well written, when we all know that there is no way 99% of them could stand against the real literature. My two biggest pet-peeves: all fanfic stories longer than one chapter (and sometimes even that) could be cut to one half or even more, all serial written stories have convoluted and underdeveloped outlines. All fanfic stories are at the best case somewhere between the first and the second rewrite of seven or more they would require (“Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.” Michael Crichton).

*** I admit I am a sucker for long stories, the longer the better as I tend to be a fast reader and cannot stand stories that are short because of the length. But I agree, sometimes it feels like the author is dragging the story out. The worst is when something like this happens: out of 50 chapters, the first 35 is about the first year, then 2 chapters cover year 2-6, then the remaining is about the battle scene and the story is EWE.

**** Really (and don't worry about downvoting, I really cannot care less about points, I don't even know what I have and what does it mean). Just to mention some stories from authors I /really like/:

- linkao3(Friends and Foes by Northumbrian) ... first and half chapter is just Harry and Ginny getting down from the bike. Really. First four chapters could be just removed (or move to the separate work) and the story could start just fine with the fifth chapter as the first one (a policeman woken up by the phone in the middle of the night is not very original beginning of the police procedural story, but it works pretty well). Considering that whole story (still unfinished, and probably never finished) has only eleven chapters, ...

- linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) ... another brilliant story, which I really like. Despite that, I had [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][significant complaints]] about it.

And those are really good stories. Currently I am ploughing through linkffn(10914042) and it is just horrible how I have to go through every thought and every action at least three times, how the author completely forgot the rule “show, don't tell” and everything has to be explained, commented upon, and then re-explained again.

And concerning published novels, yes, the sickness is universal. Ehm, Gone Girl (2012), ehm ... all four hundred or so pages of it. Could anybody imagine that detective stories used to be just short stories?

Meh. See: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moonstone][The Moonstone:]]

#+begin_quote
  The Moonstone (1868) by Wilkie Collins is a 19th-century British epistolary novel. It is generally considered to be the first detective novel, and it established many of the ground rules of the modern detective novel.
#+end_quote

I mean, sure, Poe was earlier, but even so. There were, after all, Sherlock Holmes novels as well as stories.

Also, if the movie is at all like the book, I really wouldn't call Gone Girl a detective story at all. I mean, sure, there's a mystery and Nick (?) is kind of trying to figure it out... but the story's mostly about seeing what happens when a wife tries to put her husband on the hook for a murder that (a) hasn't happened and (b) is intended to be a suicide. Of course, the book could be very substantially different. I'd actually compare Gone Girl the film with The House of the Dead or 36 Arguments for the Existence of God or, hell, Vanity Fair before I would A Scandal in Bohemia, Feet of Clay, Death on the Nile or my dim recollections of reading some of The Moonstone (it's still on my shelf though).

Length... to a large extent it allows superficially similar concepts to become quite other. I do think many fanfics are way longer, perhaps even orders of magnitude longer, than they need to be simply because they can be very long... but it does mean things can be given as much time as feels natural.

** I think, when it happens, it's a confluence of four things...

- false memory... I don't know the precise way of describing this but to a large extent, what we remember is our experience rather than our reality, so memories might join things together rather than representing exactly what happened in the plot
- nostalgia goggles... this is where what you're really looking for is that first experience or the treasured memory/experience value "inflates" the quality of the work
- a natural evolution of taste associated with being older/intervening experiences
- changing ideas about stories ans fanfics... so the cliche versus original thing

It may not be easy to differentiate these, particularly the last two. However, I see the third as being more about a changing you and the fourth being more like changing stories. Reader and text contexts, basically.

I haven't really read fanfics for long enough to get this but parts of it are broadly familiar... at least, in the opposite sense (there's a CD I got given as a present years ago... at the time I didn't give it the time of day, but I found it recently and actually like most of the music on it quite a lot). That being said, I wouldn't revisit HPMOR now because I'm quite opposed these days to Lord Potter and Wards which it dives head first into. That's kind of that fourth point.
