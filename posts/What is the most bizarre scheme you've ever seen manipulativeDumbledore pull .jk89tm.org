***** It isn't in Jamie Evans. That scheme revolved around an interpretation of the line "Neither can live while the other survives" to come to the conclusion that Voldemort wouldn't return if Jessica Potter is in a situation where she is surviving, not truly living. It's a delaying tactic built on the dehumanization of a little girl.

Also, the story has 280k words and 6k followers, who are all calling it a masterpiece. It was punlished in 2007 and finished only this month meaning someone worked on this for 13 years and still thinks this was a good idea. which is even more concerning.

** Once again, linkffn(4240771) probably takes the cake.

An early example is Dumbledore kidnapping and repeatedly brainwashing Trelawney (causing her to act like she does in canon), trying to destroy the art of Divination (so that no one but him would have a personal Seer), and screwing with Harry's life in numerous ways based on his interpretations of Trelawney's increasingly confusing prophecies.

#+begin_quote
  It had been she who'd warned him in that interview that the child of Lily and James Potter would surpass him, if they were alive to raise it. It had been Trelawney who'd told him that Harry could lead the entire magical world into a golden age of peace and prosperity... something that had to be stopped if Albus wanted to preserve his own power and position in it, not just because of Harry's star eclipsing Dumbledore's own, but because his manipulations could not survive in such an environment.\\
  She hadn't put it in those words, of course. The interpretation was his own, but what else was he to expect on hearing the greatest wizard of the age was about to be born?

**** He's very good at coming up with story elements that I've never seen anywhere else, which makes the trope-heavy writing a bit odd in contrast. I can also state that very few stories I've read have managed to build tension and excitement as well as he managed a couple of times in my first reading of Harry Crow, and I'm not just talking among fanfics. Aside from that, at least his later works have characters' actions flow naturally rather than being dictated by the needs of the plot (I'm looking at /you/, JKR you raging transphobe).

On the other hand, his stuff /is/ very tropey, he's prone to super-Harry and lots of bashing, and rarely are the villains allowed to pose any real threat to the heroes. I've also noted in hindsight some occasional problematic bits here and there (mocking Draco for seeming gay is a notable one, though to be fair homophobia was pretty standard and mainstream in the 90s).

** Had the pumpkin juice at Hogwarts laced with loyalty potions that all the students drank daily.

Had all the staff and Order members under loyalty oaths. (Except Snape, because of his position of spy; he had only sworn the oath to protect Harry.)

Set up the Longbottoms and Potters to be killed by Voldemort. After all, once the child of prophecy fails, then anybody can defeat Tom. He wants that rush of adulation again, from being the one to defeat a dark lord.
