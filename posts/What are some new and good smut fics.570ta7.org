Maybe I'm bad at searching, but I haven't been able to find any good new fics that are smut over plot. So, if you guys know any, lemme know. Hetero pairings only please and by new, I mean within the last 6 months.

Also, the Fanficbot seems to be dead lately so linking the old fashioned way would be good.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia and Vernon Dursley never married and they never had Dudley. Petunia has always wanted a child, a girl specifically, so when she finds Hailey Potter on her doorstep, she's ecstatic.Petunia has never been pretty like her sister Lily and she has always found it difficult to have men interested in her. All the guys she had dated had left her when they had realized that she wouldn't have sex with them before being married. Because of this experience, Petunia has convinced herself that the only way to gain men's interest is to always be willing and eager to have sex with them. Petunia teaches this to Hailey because she doesn't want 'her little girl' to become a spinster like her.Hailey - following Petunia's advice - loses her virginity at 13. She soon becomes addicted to sex, willing to spread her legs for anyone who has a cock and that can give her an orgasm.When the Hogwarts letter arrives, Hailey is thrown into a very strange world where everybody there knows her name and has very set ideas on how she should be and how she should behave. They expect her to be the hero but all she has ever known is how to be a slut.

#+begin_quote
  After Vernon dies from a heart-attack when Harry is four, his Aunt Petunia reveals the truth; Vernon had been abusive since Harry first stayed with them, and had groomed his son into a mini-me; another abusive male -- as a result, Petunia drops him off at Vernon's sister as soon as the divorce papers are filed. She tells Harry about the magical world, before they move to the Lake District, buying a house with the Potter Family Funds, and begin a life that slowly devolves -- or evolves, depending on who you ask -- into little more than sexual acts and debauchery. Slow updates! Just to be sure: I do not condone any of the acts in this fic in real life. I do condone incest, actually, because to me it's the same as gay and lesbian relationships; if you genuinely love your brother/sister/mother/father/daughter/son/etc. in a more-than-familial way, and they do the same, go for it. Just don't make babies, because they'll be genetically defect.

But Snape was STILL the good guy and secretly concocted an elaborate plan to help them escape/win without their knowledge and they thought he was evil till just before the very end (well I mean he was pretty evil, but it was all a ruse? A rapey ruse). And there were weird crow-people. I can't remember what it was called, maybe something about the House of Corvid? Anyone else know?
