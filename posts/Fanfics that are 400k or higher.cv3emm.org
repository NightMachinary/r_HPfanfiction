I am free and I want to binge read fanfics like starving man walking into a All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet. Any harem, time travel, AU, Post-War, etc. are welcome. Any pairings are welcome, as longs as it is not Harry/Ginny or slash. I just finished the Runestone Path and I wish for more. Thank you for your time!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) is half a million words, and is the start of a series that is up to about a million. Has some really nice world building about the Marauders' generation, too.

Nightmares of Futures Past is sadly incomplete, and FFN took it down for spurious reasons (a bogus copyright claim), but is over 400k and has my favourite characterisation of Ginny, Neville, and Luna (seriously, when I think about them, I often have to stop and work out whether I'm remembering canon or NoFP). Links are at [[http://www.viridiandreams.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5629]]

And opinions on its quality are sharply divided, but Methods of Rationality is over 600k. I generally recommend starting with the alternate beginning, linkffn(Daystar's remix of HPMoR).

Incidentally, are you limiting your request to Harry Potter fics, or do you just want to read anything long?

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I cannot reccomend how much Fate is breaking everything. So underrated. Updated constantly and already over 1 million.

Trust me the first 5 chapters might feel weird but as soon as it hits Hogwarts is when it gets to the fucking chimichangas. It's so sad that not that many people know about it, or overlook it. No Harry/Ginny so far and no slash. It also has the best pairing that is so unusual I NEEd the next chapter now.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** Linkffn(12021325) Im pretty sure you like the billionth person I'm recommending this to. It's my favorite fic and my go to when people ask for recs. Just over 400k words, and it is such a wild ride. The story itself is absolutely incredible. The summary is a bit choppy, but if you can look past that I highly recommend reading it. It's DarkSlytherin!Harry and WBWL. I binged this in like a day and a half without sleeping. Try reading at least to the sorting and by then you'll know if you like the styles and where the plot is going. If you don't like reading on ff.net it's crossposted on AO3. I don't want to link it bc the summary gets all weirdly formatted. Anyways, happy reading!!
