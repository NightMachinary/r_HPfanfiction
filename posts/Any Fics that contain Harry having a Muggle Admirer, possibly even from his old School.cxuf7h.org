In Both Movies and Books Harry states, that the Magical World is his Home, where he belongs. So it would Canonically possible unlikely, that he ever set a foot and has a deeper conversations with all non-magicals. However, i still would like to know, if Harry gets into contact with the Muggle World again....lets say because of a Event or a "class reunion" or Work that coincidently "collides" with the Present of his former Classmates.

â€‹

With Muggle Admirer i would accept any Woman, but im also interested in said former Classmate. She recognize Harry and also that he has Developed in all these Years.

What conditions for Harry are doesnt matter. So if he is in a (Canon) Relationship or with a companion. But i would like him to be single.


** The only one I know about which strictly satisfies your criteria is linkffn(Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss by Ecmm), but I was not super excited by it.

Not exactly, what you ask for is however linkffn(Ten More Minutes by Litfreak89) and that is certainly great story, in my opinion one of the best outside of Hinny or Hermione main pairings. It has also lovely prequel.

  HPxOC. Runs along with the original storyline. Adele Polkiss is the younger sister of Piers Polkiss, a close friend of Dudley Dursley. This way she meets Harry Potter, a curious boy with a mysterious past, and a wonderful secret... Magic! COMPLETE

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!

*** If you dont like my Requests, please dont read it, but dont mock me. To each his/her own. And with "Developed" i wasnt talking about his Manhood at all. Children around 11/12 tend to develop physically during their Teenage (puberty) phase, of course also in the Private sector, but that wasnt what i wanted in the First place. After all, you can only see someones Privates, when he is in his Pants, atleast.
