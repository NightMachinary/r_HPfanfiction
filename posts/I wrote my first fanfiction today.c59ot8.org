** I look forward to giving it a look when you post it, as is sounds interesting.

I do have a critique though. The name Talia, is not a bad name (and believe me, have i seen some bad names for genderbent characters... Draconica...), but its a bit too exotic to replace Tom. I don't know if you where trying to stick close to Tom, maybe the T? Regardless, when writing genderbent characters, authors shouldn't marry themselves to the canon name. It better to think of a similar type of name of the other gender, rather than something is or that could be a feminine/masculine version of the canon name.

For instance, Tom is an utterly common male name, we literally have the saying "every Tom, Dick, and Harry." So a good feminine name could be names like Mary, Emily, Elizabeth, or Rachel.

That being said, as I mentioned, Talia is not a bad name. I mean in Thunderstorm her name is still just Tom (gag), and I read all of that story, but you might reconsider. Though whatever you do, if i like your story, I'll probably read it.

**** Well it seems we agree on quite a bit. And yes, Teresa or Theresa, would be a good fit if you want to keep the initials the same. I myself don't worry about that too much, but I can see the appeal of wanting to do so.

** Oh! As a fellow HP/f!TR writer I demand a link once it's published!

(Also, the premise of your fic sounds somewhat similar in premise to my own fic, Departure from the Diary. I really want to see what direction you go with it!)

**** Yeah, I drew a lot of inspiration from other f!TR fics. Departure from the Diary was heavily inspired by Descent, Thunderstorm, and Power is Control
