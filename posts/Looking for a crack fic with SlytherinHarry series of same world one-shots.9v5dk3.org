I remember reading a crack fic where Harry is in Slytherin, and it's a series of one-shots in the same world. Some of the chapters we're about him cleverly getting out of trouble by setting up events to his favor or just talking his way out of it or running a gambling ring. There was a jello wrestling chapter too. That one was funny!

It was on FFN for sure. Unfortunately I can't remember much else. Thanks for the help!


** linkffn(3559907) This one? It was mudwrestling instead of jello but I think it fits

*** I skimmed it and am almost positive it's the right one. Regardless, it looks like a fun read. Thanks!
