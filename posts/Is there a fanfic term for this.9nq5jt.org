Okay so real people inserting into a fanfic is a self-insert but is there a word for the opposite idea; characters being brought into the real world where they're fictional characters? I've seen this done seriously a few times in the Dragon Age fandom to fascinating results. If there was a word/term for it I'd love to know so I can search for some. If done right, it can be a really interesting concept.

** self-insert is specifically inserting yourself, the author, into your fic - usually gratuitous and therefore frowned upon. bringing characters into another world, be it the real world or not, is just AU.

Only one Harry Potter example in the fanfic section, though...

** There's a few characters read the books fics, so there is precedent but mostly having characters in the real world involves putting them in an AU where they're all muggle. Never seen a magical character in our world fic

*** They should lose their magical powers in our world or else they would take it over within a few years, absolutely lacking competition of any kind.

**** I'm writing a pic about HP characters travelling to alternate dimensions (cliche I know, but I thought of this idea in '07 when I was a teen and since it seems less stupid nowadays I'm publishing it) and I think magic like energy should be conserved. If you have magic in one dimension, you won't have it in any other dimension, which would be a corollary of Gamp's Law. However, that doesn't apply to magical curses such as lycanthropy

***** But them without magic makes for a boring story. Maybe a compromise is in order:

1) They either have significantly reduced magical power, or

2) They slowly lose magic power over the time, being cut off from their home dimension, so there's a time pressure on completing their goals with magic.

What's the main plot in your fic?

****** Harry has the ability to hop dimensions (it's blood based, so you give yourself a paper cut, write out a rune on the wall and you can target the dimension you want) It's something that he inherited on his mother's side, but it was dormant until it was reawakened by her love sacrifice. I unfortunately gave it up for a few years because it didn't really have a plot, it was too character based. Basically, he would interact with his counterparts (there are infinite universes, but he can only interact with counterparts that are direct children of Lily Evans who have been chosen by Voldemort as his equal, narrowing down his access to 200 or so.) There was an exploration of the usual AU tropes: fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, Werewolf!Harry, and one or two where Lily didn't marry James and it's some other kid just to switch it up. However, the cast was the main 4 Harry equivalents. The main plot involved hiding the existence of these worlds because of the ramifications, and the panic that ensued after the graveyard incident, since it meant Voldemort has the ability to travel as well. Not having magic in the main dimension posed complications since it would lead to disadvantages in fights, and make it impossible to enter Hogwarts, so they would have to be creative. But, they would also be able to use their grey area of existence to sneak around the castle undetected by the Marauder's Map.

Sorry that was longer than expected

** Have you read Fictional?

It is a Fate crossover which is sort of similar in which Harry is summoned as a Servant into a world where the Harry Potter Book series exists.
