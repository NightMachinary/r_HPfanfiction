What are some fics that are really good, yet never seem to get recced? Do you have a favorite fic that isn't too popular?

For me, it'd have to be the Albus Potter Series by Vekin87 Linkffn(4380964) It's hands down the best Epilogue compliant fic about Albus' adventures at Hogwarts I've seen. The first book is kinda rocky, but it quickly gains its footing. It's completed, with all seven books having been released on Fanfiction.


** There are quite a few fics out there that I think folks know are amazing, and yet they rarely get recommended because they are also abandoned or unfinished and many people hate that. I know I hesitate to read things that are abandoned or unfinished and usually ask for completed fics. And yet, I have come across unfinished ones that are so incredibly good.

*** I always wished there was a metric letting me know if it was abandoned in a decent spot. Sometimes it is on a cliffhanger, and sometimes it is where a decent epilogue could go, but the author never got to it.

** I'm very fond of "Nocturnal" by Red Garden Gnome, and have recommended it several times on here. It's a Charlie/Hermione romance/adventure story, in which I think truly captures the symmetry Charlie and Hermione could possibly have if they ever were to encounter one another, thereby starting a relationship after. It's well-written, long, and completed, which is bonus points towards the fic. The author clearly has an incredible imagination when it comes to the dragon reserve set in Wales (which is where the second half of the story is located) but the author also includes little wisps of magic here and there, and interweaves it within the characters and story, akin to what JK Rowling did within her books. The dialogue is probably the author's strongest suit, and it's both funny and readable and not cringe-worthy. Sadly, the fic has 127 "favs" and 187 follows (according to this posting) with 74 reviews. It's most certainly a gem hidden within the rocks.

** Choices by random-fruitcake04 Linkffn(7467796). Everyone always amps up the Red Knight, but Choices is actually a far better example of a Slytherin!Ron story. The fanfic's canon divergence actually doesn't originate from his sorting, but rather Ron's Seer abilities. Being sorted into Slytherin is just a natural progression from how his priorities shifted after experiencing several visions in his childhood, most notably seeing his brother's death. Ron is determined to prevent that from happening. He is still very much the hot tempered and stubborn Ron we know from the books though. Draco and Ron hate each other even more if possible, and instead he develops friendship of a sort with Theo and Daphne. It's still a WIP, but does not appear to be abandoned.

The Dumbledore in this story has no ability to think outside the box. Dumbledore himself mentally identified the fact that Harrison had identical eyes to Lily Potter, yet still completely discarded the fact that Harrison is Voldemort's son. I can't explain this further without spoiling though.

A real pity the author has been having problems in real life, and thus can't update the story. The story really has no equal.

** Linkffn(Hell Eyes by Jezaray).

I've never seen it on this sub but it's a really cool one. It's basically an original fiction novel branched off from the Harry Potter universe.

** I Know Not, and I Cannot Know - Yet I Live and I Love by billowsandsmoke Linkffn(11923164) has been recommended a few times on this subreddit but not that often. It's a great read about Snape and Luna, no romance and excellent characterization.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.

** I found this one yesterday in another thread. It's a bit weird and is a WIP, but it seems to have potential. It has an original premise if you like Evil!Ron/MorallyGreyRon with a dash of time travel.

I think it'll gain more popularity as it updates, since its a new fanfic (at least on fanfiction.net, but I can't find it anywhere else).

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

  Loki's in for it now. Odin has had enough and has banished him to Earth to relearn some lessons. Too bad he hadn't paid attention to where Loki ended up. Now Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has to deal with memories that aren't his own while he gets his revenge on those who sought to use him as a weapon. Can Harry regain what he lost, or will his past self take control first?

** I loved Quoth the Raven, Nevermore - Linkffn(6652537) but I feel like I never really see it on here. It's AU, but one that I actually enjoyed.

  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU

** For me, it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5843349/1/The-Other-Side-of-the-Coin][The Other Side of the Coin]] - It's certainly not without its flaws, but it's just an original story (as far as I know), with an interesting Tom Riddle.
