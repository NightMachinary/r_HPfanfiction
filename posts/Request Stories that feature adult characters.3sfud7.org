I'm looking for something that does not have any sort of "we must defeat Voldemort" type plot or the "we are all so happy and one big Weasley family" I'd like adults who have jobs and issues not sneaking firewhiskey adolescents. I don't want any super powered characters, if they are financially secured that's okay but nothing that's outlandish please. A mystery with a PTSD riddled Harry would be interesting.

I'm not interested in anything that takes place inside of Hogwarts. I really do not like the Marauders or next generation characters, they're just not interesting to me.

I like some romance and I'm not picky about pairings Harry/Anygirl is cool except for someone that was the same age as his mom same goes for Hermione/Anyguy. I like some smut just nothing that takes over the plot.

Edit: unnecessary use of the word "long" lengthy stories are fine by me!

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

*** I've been reading that for the past few days, is it me or is Hermione a bit passive in her relationships? I'm now at chapter 21 and I've only felt her react twice so far, and once only half-heartedly. I'm guessing this has to do with the PTSD, but does it get better in the story (so far)?

** Northumbrian's postwar short stories will be to your liking: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian]]

Besides those little crime mysteries, he also writes about less well known secondary characters such as Terry Boot, Lavender Brown, Susan Bones, and Dennis Creevey.

** linkffn(broken by inadaze22) is 5 years post-war, lots of issues for everyone involved, Hermione and Draco are the main characters. Lots of sadness within. The romance doesn't come to anything near smut though, the story really is focused on the main characters dealing with (huge) issues.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.
