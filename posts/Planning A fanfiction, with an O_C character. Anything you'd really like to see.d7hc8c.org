I have some scenes, a rough plot and a possible ending all ready write out. Including epilouge (but lets be honest, most books never stay true to plan)

I am planning to write out all 'seven' books.

Without giving too much away:

My character is ravenclaw, long lost daughter of Regulus black, a result of a one night stand.

Harry has accidental magic that makes his hair go red, and eyes brown, when his feeling a particular strong emotion. (This makes a seriously interesting intro for Draco)

Minor Dumbledore bashing (nothing extreme)

My Character, ends up being a hogwarts... advocate of sorts, I have a lot of scenes not normally covered. Such as her introducing mental health classes, designing some protective jewellery that alerts next of kin when someone is having a panic attack (it's her newt level charms project)

She is in the same year as the twins. But hangs around with the puffs more. And Lee Jordan.

I can't really think of anything else right now... but what stuff would you like to see added?


** Given that she would be a student in a world where they consider soul-sucking demons as adequate guardians for a school full of children and keep them around despite proven inabilities, any of her suggestions for mental healthcare would go straight to the bin.

As for the OC, make sure that she is actually a character and not just a collection of useful bits and pieces. Susan Bones suffers the worst from this since she usually is reduced to "hot girl" who gives Harry a connection to Amelia Bones, who then gets shit done while Harry and Susan make out. She has no character, no ambitions, quirks or hobbies unrelated to the main plot and Harry. Avoid such characterisations.

Obviously, you should try to limit your story to the necessary bits in order to avoid bloat, but establishing a character outside of their role is worthwile if the character is important.

*** The mental health thing, would come later on, towards the end, if not after the final book but be touched upon lightly before hand. And 100 % I agree with you points.

Seeing as my OC that I ironically have no name for right now is 3 years above the golden trio. It's not gonna be focal around them, but obviously they will be included, I'm not gonna rewrite it, judt to have it follow the same timeline. For one, I have an interesting way to get Sirius black freed a little earlier...

**** If she is in the twins' year, she'd be two years above the trio, not three

****** Wait, year 7 is 17 and 18 years old. Year 6 is 16/17, which is why the twins tried the little nudge with the ageing potion because they were only a few months short. But the twins were just two years above Harry.

** The problem with that is that mental health care wasn't widely accepted or destigmatized in the 80s to 90s. It's also not something the average person would have been knowledgeable enough of to make a suggestion like that. If it were Harry's kids gen, sure it would make sense.

As for suggestions, Haphne or Harry/Fleur, and then your OC paired with either a Puff or a Snake. Unless that contradicts your plans for romance. If I think of anymore, I'll edit my response.

*** Ooh. That's an idea, it kinda clashes but I can work around that. And the mental health stuff is gonna be more, future focused. Haphne... I think that could work, thanks for the ideas !

******** I've only written one story for it, and it's a gagstory. Keep in mind also I throw out her fanon personality entirely, and each chapter is one year at Hogwarts focused around snapshots in time. Basically, the prompt I was given was " romcom anime style Harry Potter". So I ran with it lol [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13215076/1/Hogwarts-Rumble]]
