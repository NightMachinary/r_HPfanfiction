In the scene in Harry Crow where Harry tells Augusta that he won't be going to the meeting where the students are to see what the electives have to offer. To this point, Harry had a pretty much universal reaction to anyone acting harshly when they jump to a conclusion. He NEVER takes it well.

Then he gets to this point. He KNOWS that Augusta doesn't see goblins as creatures. He KNOWS that she is supportive of the goblins, moreso since they are the reason her son and daughter-in-law are even aware of their surroundings. She has declared herself to be on his side numerous times and has not shown any form of bigotry whatsoever.

When she makes this announcement, Harry acts very much like Ron Weasley and starts raving. He downright insults her and starts implying that he, Remus and Henreca would be studied in creatures class. Had anyone even spoken to him with this tone, he would have been up in arms. Worse yet is that he later says that he had zero clue why Neville was upset. This entire chapter just doesn't align with anything that has been established so far. I seriously have to skip the entire chapter every time I read through.


** This implies you read it more than once, which is more than most would admit to. Kudos for your perseverance I suppose.

*** It's a good fic. The problem is, halfway through, it starts to take a direction.

** I agree. Even from the first time I read it, I thought ‚Äúwhere the hell's this coming from?‚Äù Frankly, I think that it was just to reiterate that he's a goblin. Somewhere while reading you get lost in the story and you just see Harry as a well trained student. At least I did.

*** Am I correct in thinking that the premise of the story is basically, What if goblins were much more awesome than wizards?

** Harry Crow is generally a pile of garbage that should be burned with fire and its ashes should be thrown into the furthest black hole from earth so it never reaches us again.

*** You know... There is a simple solution if you don't like a fanfiction... And I know that this is a radical concept... But don't read it. You don't have to bring your poison thoughts here, take them to [[/r/trashy][r/trashy]] where they belong.

**** Wait... i'm confused. Are you not ranting about the fic? I could be wrong. I dropped it at the raises the sword to the sky while standing on a table scene so I may be missing context.

***** Yeah, it does have some pretty cheesy parts. I'm not against the story, I just think that there are parts that are badly written.
