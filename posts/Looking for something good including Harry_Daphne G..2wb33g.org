I'm looking for something that includes Harry and Daphne in a loving relationship. Doesn't really matter how they get together (preferably within their time at Hogwarts).

All I ever read about Daphne was "Discount-Bellatrix" more or less. Thats one thing I'm not so into, but hey, I'm not picky. If the fanfic you recommend features a Harry that goes for a bit of psycho-spice in his relationship, why not?

Novel-length and complete if possible.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope][A Champion's New Hope]]

Beginning during the Goblet of Fire, Harry looks to different friends for support after both Ron and Hermione refuse to believe that he did not put his name in the Goblet. Including one unexpected friend: Daphne Greengrass.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]]

Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9415372/1/Beltane-Child][Beltane Child]]

Harry needs some time to let his guard down in the war. So he goes to a celebration just before he, Ron and Hermione plan to get Hufflepuff's Cup from Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. Who could have guessed what the consequences would be?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4508835/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chance-Meeting][Harry Potter and the Chance Meeting]]

After the fall of Voldemort, some people could deal with what they had to do in the War, others could not. Harry had pretty much left Wizarding Britain, thought not magic. Having a quiet drink in a pub, someone from his past re-enters his life HP/TD/DG

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6813897/1/Lord-of-the-Marauders][Lord of the Marauders]]

Everyone was so busy arresting Harry after the DOM debacle, that only Remus Lupin noticed the snow white Grim come out of the Veil of Death. Sirius Black is back, and he's had enough of his godson being manipulated. HP/DG/TD pairing, plus one. AU.

The plus one is Gabrielle Delacour and all three are the result of marriage contracts. At one point in the story Sirius tells Hermione (atleast I think it's Hermione) that Daphne was the only would he would have still married if he had a choice.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4379372/1/Ruthless-Revenge][Ruthless Revenge]]

Harry overhears Ginny plotting to force him in a situation that he has to marry her. Instead of going to useless teachers Harry decides to do some plotting of his own... - Set during seventh year; Harry/Daphne

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6926581/1/Thanks-to-a-Snake][Thanks to a Snake]]

Harry is affected more by the abuse at home,that, a chance meeting with a snake, and a marriage contract send him down a different path. In the process of being Beta'ed. Ch1 beta'ed March 13

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7508571/1/The-Fall-of-the-house-of-Potter][The Fall of the House of Potter]]

AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5071058/1/The-Reluctant-Champion][The Reluctant Champion]] WIP

Raised in magic by a loving family, trained by one of the best Aurors the DMLE has ever seen for a war always on the horizon and the world has a very different Boy-Who-Lived on their hands. Book One of the What A Difference A Father Makes series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9509557/4/The-Star-Chamber][The Star Chamber]] Abandoned, but short.

The Sorting Hat said I was ambitious, I guess it just took me a while to figure out what ambition meant. Dark Political Harry, Post DH.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9276562/1/The-Trial][The Trial]] Slow WIP

AU: Harry Potter, older brother to the Boy-Who-Lived and the Dark Lord's right-hand man, is now on trial for war crimes. DMLE prosecutor and former flame Daphne Greengrass comes to his defense. The secrets and manipulations will rock Wizarding Britain and reveal a boy who never stopped fighting and a love that never quite faded.

I quickly went through my favourites list and picked all of these out. I know I left a few out, but I got most of them.

** Have you read Angry Harry and the Seven? It's pretty long, complete, starts off just before Hogwarts, and Daphne isn't a younger version of Bellatrix.

*** Haven't read this one yet. Thanks.

The authors introduction already has me hooked, not to meantion the 490k words (fuck yea). I'll give this one a try.

And btw: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][link]] for those of you who also want to read it.

edit:After reading ~15 chapters I gotta say, its not what I hoped for. For those of you who go for it: Whatever the characters in this story are, "human" certainly isn't an appropriate adjective. Harry is basically the combination of Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein and Merlin combined into one eleven year old who has perfect memory that lets him destroy Dumbledore and take over the political landscape of wizard Britain in less than 15 chapters. Not to meantion that it takes approximatly 3 sentences for Harry to accept his marriage contract with Daphne while Daphne takes ~a chapter. I could go on about why you shouldn't read this fanfic, but I'll stop here.

Thanks again for the recommendation, though. While the ff didn't hold up to the promises the author made, it was definitely good enough for me to read 15 chp. of it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie][James Spookie]] wrote a number of Harry/Daphne stories and all of them would fit your bill I think. Beyond that:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope][A Champion's New Hope]] is pretty good. It starts with Daphne helping out Harry during the Tri-Wizard tournament but goes all the way through the war while shedding lights on some interesting magics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7038840/1/A-Chance-Encounter][A Chance Encounter (In-Progress, sorry)]] starts from the beginning but with Harry meeting the Greengrasses instead of the Weasleys at the King's Cross. Much happier overall and I found the slow pace and meticulous character/friendship development quite agreeable.

** I've never read any stories with Daphne in them, so I was wondering what do we know about her from canon? Slytherin, in Harry's year, younger sister marries Draco Malfoy... Anything else? It seems like fanfiction likes to make her an "ice queen" but I was wondering about the basis for it.

*** There is nothing about her in canon beyond mere mentions (only twice I think). The lack of detail makes her a wildcard or a clean slate, ready to be construed or moulded as one wishes which makes for a great creative outlet. The stony and aloof ice queen persona developed in fanfics is extrapolated from the fact that she is from a pureblood family yet doesn't hang around with usual Slytherin bunch to demand even a dialogue in canon.

*** Canon has basically nothing on her. Shes more of a extra in the books.

In Firebird, for example, shes nothing short of an assassin for the dark Houses, or Covens in that particular fanfiction.

I think the basis for it is her canon description of being "pureblood, blond, blue-eyed". I would assume these traits produce a pretty cold picture in ones mind.

*** One of the original, if not the original, portrayals of the character was in Jeconais's "Perfect Situations" where she is, more or less, that stupid ice queen persona. Other people loved the fic so much (and it was very good for its time; don't know if it has aged well) the ice queen business became the norm. Mostly exaggerated to hell though.

*** I'm with you there. I still don't understand why everyone seems to love using her. At least use a character Rowling named in the story. There's plenty of characters that were named and never characterized.
