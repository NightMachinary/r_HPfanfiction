** Cartoonish evil is real though. An ideology that others and scapegoats needs very little in the way of logic or "merit" to convince people. People are extremely talented at justifying bigotry and acts of violence committed by their side. I don't think there's any really interesting story to be told where Voldemort "has a point". What is under addressed is how his rise was enabled and in a lot of ways supported by the existing Wizarding society and what the process of reform looked like.

*** Americans have literally been living through this for the past four years, but especially since election night. What's been going on is definitely evil, but it's so outlandishly strange that if it was in a book/movie/tv show and not happening in real life it would /almost/ be funny. A president in the country that's the original example for modern (representational) democracy demanding votes be stopped? Blaming the violence of an attempted coup by /his own followers/ on a group of people who simply want to be seen as people, and to be treated with the same dignity and respect as the people responsible for hundreds of years of systemic oppression against them?

It's almost as if everything that's happened since election night in 2016/2020 was written as an absurdist political satire, and yet it's happened and is happening and is what evil actually looks like.

The only way that Voldemort can have a "point" is if you agree with his political stance and classism. The only way the current administration can be "right" is if you agree with his political stance and racism. The only way the Third Reich was "justifiable" was because people agreed with their political stance and racism.

It's terrifying how close the books are to reality, and it's concerning how many people believe that Voldemort and his beliefs could have redeemable qualities.

** In fanfiction it is common to see pure-blood opposition to Muggleborns as based on Muggleborns not understanding or seeking to change "wizarding culture".

In canon, this is not very present. We only just get a glimpse of it in PS, before it's never really touched on again:

#+begin_quote
  “I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname, anyway?”
#+end_quote

JKR pretty much abandons this line in CoS and thereafter doubles down on pure-blood supremacy being an entirely racial doctrine, probably to avoid complex moral and political problems in a children's book. Far better if the villains are magic Nazis.

Nonetheless, for more adult fanfiction, the cultural angle is an interesting one. An analogy can be drawn between Muggleborns and immigration and for real life debates around cultural integration/multiculturalism to play out in wizarding society. Of course, most fanfic (being fanfic) just deploys the idea as a way to uncritically make pure-bloods 100% right so they can have Harry switch sides and then bash Dumbledore etc.

All the interesting debates are thereby avoided - including the interesting disanalogy that Muggleborns are born with magic.

But I think there is an interesting debate that could be had.

A fic that really wanted to engage with this topic would address these issues:

1. What is "wizarding culture" and/or "our ways", and how do Muggleborns affect it? Is the effect of Muggleborns positive or negative?

2. Is the analogy between Muggleborns and immigrants a good one? If it is, what level of involvement in wizarding society are Muggleborns entitled to?

3. Does the fact that Muggleborns are born with magic (rather than willingly seek magic out) change things? Should membership of wizarding society be determined by some "biological" criteria (having magic), or can wizards justifiably consider membership of their society to be more like that of a nation: membership by descent, given to outsiders only as a matter of discretion?

4. If Muggleborns are not members of wizarding society by virtue of their magic, can the Ministry still claim authority over them (e.g. in enforcing the statute of secrecy)? Can wizarding society justifiably have it both ways: claiming authority over Muggleborns, but not considering them natural and full members of their culture?

** I can't make the racism component any less evil, but if he has his own idea of a solution then he'd at least have something to say, and that would make him less cartoonish. Perhaps he wants to completely separate the muggle and wizarding worlds, never bringing in any muggle-borns.

But I think [[/u/Avalon1632][u/Avalon1632]] has a pretty good point. Voldemort's personal ideology is mostly just fearing death and never wanting it to happen and trying to gather as much power as possible with some wizarding superiority thrown in.

The best option is probably to give the Death Eaters some goal beyond just ruling the wizarding world, and don't make all the Death Eaters have the exact same views. Ask yourself, who joins the Death Eaters? Who doesn't? Why would someone leave?

*** I will say again that you're not going to get many people who'll be sympathetic to bigots, no matter how you justify it or whatever you give Voldemort to say.

But if you insist on following this, I'd recommend moving away from the bigotry and focusing on the things around it. Don't deny that the villains are bigoted and that the bigotry is wrong, but focus on the things that support and exist around the bigotry. And really, don't do the 'but muggleborns are killing our culture/traditions' thing - it's overdone and nonsensical.

There's a thing in the US called the 'Rust Belt'. Essentially, an area that was once vibrant and powerful is slowly dying because the world has changed and no longer needs the things that made the area so strong. Industry falters, jobs disappear, money dries up, and people leave.

So, mimic that vibe. Grindelwald's war fucked Europe up, big time. Too many magicals died or never came back from Europe and it changed Magical Britain for good. Hogwarts used to be full, Hogsmeade used to be thriving, but more and more Magicals leave Britain for other shores as the remaining traditionalists cling harder and harder to the old way of life that simply doesn't work anymore. Cue Voldemort, who fans a minority that blame Muggleborns into a full insurrection and terrorist group. Make them into misused idiots who struggle to adapt to the new world they're living in and are keeping their children mired in the bigot-bog alongside them.

You can't make bigotry 'grey', but you can sort of focus around it to other things, if you have to.

If you're asking who joins the Death Eaters, then that's a very, very complicated topic. Radicalisation and cult membership is odd and while I have done some work in and study around the area, I honestly don't know enough about the Death Eater characters to take a reasonable guess.

I'd recommend you read this. It's an essay examining Bellatrix's character and motivations - it's pretty dang good and might be useful for you.

**** Wait. Are you talking to me? I wasn't the OP. If you do want my opinion though...

I love the idea of pulling a Rust Belt thing with Magical Britain. The idea of stagnation following the war with Grindelwald allows for us to get, well, Hitler vibes. I don't know if you meant that, but that's pretty much the start of WW2 in a nutshell.

I don't think that treating Death Eaters like a cult is really that good of a move. They present more as a radical political group, so going in-depth on the radicalization elements of the Death Eaters recruitment. (Draco Malfoy maybe). I use the BITE model to determine whether a group is a cult, and the Death Eaters don't present as one. If you use something different, feel free to let me know.

I was just using the pairing as a collective phrase to say that entry into that kind of extremist group is odd and complicated, rather than saying the group is a cult or political organisation or whatever.

Radicalisation and cult behaviours are relatively similar, but here I was mostly thinking about the 'onboarding' method. Cult membership tends to be recruited in very small, personable ways. The old stereotype is solitary people being approached in bars or restaurants and then slowly recruited over time as the recruiter becomes a friend, and that's kind of how I see a lot of Death Eaters being recruited, especially the younger and less powerful ones. Oddballs and outcasts being preyed upon by those who ought to know better. Political Groupings tend to be more 'organisational' as groups meet together and complain and foment and such. Never really thought of Death Eaters having rallies and workshop seminars, y'know? :)

But hey, this is fiction. We can always combine elements of both if it makes for interesting story or worldbuilding, no matter what the academics say. :)

**** very true. and good point. another part is to see why. the way is often more important. I agree do not make it grey, but make them human. the fact you mention Grindelwald is a part many forget and also was not explained in the books at first. with a wizards life span, any who teenagers when this happened, or even 30s could easily still be alive in the two wars with voldermort.

Never mind its cannon that many muggleborns joined the first dark lord of the century, which can create a lot of resentment.

***** >But hey, this is fiction. We can always combine elements of both if it makes for interesting story or worldbuilding, no matter what the academics say. :)

We write fanfiction, we /are/ the academics.

In all seriousness though, I prefer to imagine the Death Eaters as an actual political movement, because it both explains their overwhelming power in the canon, as well as makes them a lot scarier. The idea that they don't have to prey on the outcasts of society, but instead get people to join them willingly simply by existing. Scary right?

That might have something to do with me imagining them as a group that's been around for a while in some form. Knights of Walpurgis Nacht become the Reform Party, who work as slightly overzealous politicians, and then, in 1976, break off into the Death Eaters when given a leader in Lord Voldemort, who then leads them into battle. In 1981, those who got away with it move away from the Reform Party to some other conservative party. That's why the Death Eaters are such a small group at the beginning of the Second War.

I just don't like the idea that Voldemort was the only reason the Death Eaters existed.

****** Apologies for the delayed response - you responded to the bot and not me, so I didn't get an alert. :)

That's fair. Personally, I don't find the willing joiners of those things particularly scary. That's just... unsurprising. In fact, I was astonished when everyone was suddenly shocked about how much bigotry was still around. It's the manipulation that I find scary - they can take perfectly rational, otherwise typical people and get them to a point of such slavish belief and loyalty that they'd do all sorts of things for the group. And it works so incredibly well.

People already being arseholes doesn't scare me. People being so easily turned into them is far more disturbing.

And I don't know if I'd say Voldemort would be the only reason they existed. I think he was more of a catalyst. Adding him to the pot turned a slow, quiet bigotry up to full heat and the melting pot boiled over, so to speak, but it was still simmering before he came along.

** I mean, I'm pretty sure he canonically doesn't actually have an ideology beyond "I don't want to die and I'll do anything to make that happen." and just uses the Blood Purity rhetoric for power. I could be wrong though.

The anti-death thing is pretty easy to humanise. Have him die as a young child or tweenager. Temporarily, obviously. Then have him come back terrified because there's nothing on the other side, just void and absence. The rest follows on quite naturally as that fear grows and festers - he may not have been in London for most of the Blitz, but he'd probably have experienced some of the bombing and felt that fear. Make him so utterly desperate to cling on to life, to live every second and eke out every moment he possibly can, then tilt it, ever so slightly. So it becomes less about living and doing stuff with his life and more about just living. Just surviving. I'd say resentment would start to grow there, as he starts to hate everything that might make him powerless, like dying did, and everyone who threatens him. Thus, he finds out about Horcruxes, and the story unfolds how it does.

There's not really a good way to make the Blood Purity thing more 'grey' - discrimination is wrong, there's no ambiguity or relativism there, plus bigotry isn't exactly a sympathetic character trait. We're not sympathetic to people who discriminate against others due to who they are, regardless of whatever reasons they give or what 'merit' they feel that position has. It's why you'll always see people here mocking the 'Muggleborns are taking my traditions' fics, since they usually just come across as cheap discrimination gussied up with nonsense.

** Devil's advocate time .

Fact is you will never make Voldermort less Evil, but you can make him more Realistic you would need three things in your story which are easy but may piss off people including the people here.

1. Study the evil dictators. Humanity has a bunch in its past. Also, Tame down his Megomanical side some. Just a little no random killing/torturing. it had to be with more a purpose than the movies/books let on.
2. Explain How he exploited the Death eaters. I am not saying make them good. make them human, even if trash. but explain how he exploited them. The Main core we see ( bella, lusicous etc.) are horrible people? But what about all the other knights of walhurp and death eaters. maybe some are just normal people like the germans from " Ordinary men". a huge read if you need to face the evil in yourself and people.
3. Also, Take into account Why the pureblood felt the way they do. wizard culture stayed the same for hundreds of years, and now new people asking it to change? never mind in the story between 50 and 70 years ago, when their grand parents were kids Muggleborns were part of one the most wars. the first Dark war of the century. and the way wizards live so long, people than are still alive and may remember this.

I am in no way condoning what happened in harry potter or their beliefs , but as a writer I just learned villains with motives, reasons and story even if flawed/askweded make more sense than cartoonish ones.

If I were to try to change their philosophy to be a bit less completely evil, I'd make it about more thorough separation of the magical community. Stuff like muggleborns being taken from their family and raised by wizards, banning wizard-muggle relationships, etc.

Still definitely bad, but they at least could argue that the separation makes things safer for both the muggleborns and their families.
