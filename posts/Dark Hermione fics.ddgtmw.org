I recently read Hermione Granger, Demonologist, and I really, really liked it. Just wish it was longer. So... here I am! Any recommendations? Slytherin Hermione would be nice, basically any ships are fine. Just gotta be Hermione's centric+pov. Longer fics are also preferred. Thanks!


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/wholestory.php?no=30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] might fit depending on what you mean by dark. It's a nonmagical au (with a light crossover James Bond, and the mad science in that universe can create results that seem rather similar to magic), so you don't have the Dark Witcb/Join the Death Eaters stuff you would have in a more conventional fic.

 

However this Hermione is definitely harder than her canon counterpart, even before the training she goes through. The story /opens/ with an eleven year old Hermione gaslighting a man into killing himself. And, in line with your preferences, it is a fic with over 660k words entirely from Hermione's PoV

*** Oh yes, this Hermione is dope. The following conversation happens shortly after the Death Eater attack on Bill and Fleur's wedding, held in France:

#+begin_quote
  And perhaps she was not subtle enough, because her boss finally said, “Ms. Granger, please do not attempt to capture any more Death Eater tech, a term Charlie apparently picked up from you and your team. The French captured two cube vans with full-sized mind-control systems, and both were boobytrapped. Both exploded while DPSD boffins were studying the equipment in situ. Both vans were destroyed, and the French forces nearby were contaminated with radioactive materials.”

  Hermione checked, “Just vans destroyed, men in the vans killed, and a small radiation clean-up site around the explosion?”

  ”Ms. Granger, that sort of threat does not go with the word ‘just'.”

  She insisted, “I beg your pardon sir, but it does. Those devices probably have several kilos of possibly-fissionable material as a power source. If I was designing those boobytraps, I would aim for a low-grade nuclear detonation, say a tenth of a kiloton up to half a kiloton.”

  There was a long pause before he finally said, “Ms. Granger, I would quite appreciate it if you would refrain from becoming our next supervillain or domestic terrorist.”

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** I've been enjoying linkffn(13051824) New Blood, which is a Slytherin Hermione fic. It's a Hermione who is cautiously interested in darker aspects of magic as a way to make herself more powerful in order to accomplish her goals. Currently only in second year, but there's been a lot of interesting magic happening already.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** The characterisation is different enough that Valerie Campbell is not so much a Slytherin Hermione, as a Slytherin /replacement/ for Hermione, but linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House) is an interesting read.

Do not meddle in the affairs of this witch, for she is reasonably subtle, quick to anger, and "witch" is just one misplaced letter away from... Well.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

*** /Fervidity/ is an interesting one. It's delightfully un-angsty, and yet, it kind of goes off the deep end, kind of how porn often puts weird contrivances into the plot in order to facilitate sex of the kind they want to show (or so I heard <_< ). My summary (from a while ago):

- More-BAMF-than-canon!Hermione who is still recognisable: Cool.
- Poses as Snape's illegitimate daughter to help subvert Death Eaters from within: Interesting.
- Gets challenged by Bellatrix, fights, actually pulls off a win with a curse she had invented, and only spares her because Voldemort orders it: Cool.
- Builds a reputation and develops relationships (positive and negative) with members of the Death Eater inner circle, making moral compromises along the way: Cool.
- Is not a blushing virgin (Ron having been her first): Good.
- Learns that despite HPverse being far more egalitarian than Muggle and for much longer, and despite women in HPverse not being disadvantaged in matters of violence as they are in real life, Death Eaters have these mandatory monthly "revels" that involve participating in, and I'll phrase this as mechanistically as possible, group sex in which the female DEs must serve as bottoms to multiple partners whom they do not necessarily choose, and nor are the female DEs given control over the mode and style of the intercourse; and where a surprising number of male DEs avail themselves of this opportunity to inflict abuse, apparently unafraid of retribution and heedless of the fact that the next day, they have to rely on those very women to have their backs in battle: NOPE.

1. It has a lot of Dumbledore-bashing.
2. Hermione becomes extremely protective of Harry, for no clear reason.
3. I dropped the fic after yet another irrational and unnecessary sacrifice by Hermione on Harry's behalf, but another reader who didn't tells me that she eventually becomes a submissive to Tom Riddle.
