LF fics where harry receives Voldemorts memories or skills through the horcrux as a result of a ritual/accident etc.


** It's been a long while since I've read it, but I'm pretty sure linkffn(3655940) is along the lines of what you're looking for. There's probably others I've read, but that's the first that popped into my head.

â€‹

I vaguely recall there being a fanfic in which destroying a horcrux gifted all of Voldemort's memories up to the creation of said horcrux, but the name is eluding me. I think it was a Haphne, or Harry/Multi fic though, since I'm remembering Hermione having an important role.

  Voldemort didn't just give Harry some of his powers that night. He gave him all of his memories. With them, his allies and friends, Harry shall change the Wizarding World like no one ever before. LightHarry. GoodDumbledore. Chaotic magic. COMPLETE!

**** I don't think so. At least the first chapter isn't ringing any bells, plus its not on my list of favorites.

** The Legacy - linkffn(9774121) has that, though it hasn't been updated since 2017.

There's still 82 chapters, so it does scratch that itch for some time.

** I mean... DP&SW does have this happen, but that is a... very controversial story, and the writing, while decent, doesn't make up for its other flaws in a lot of people's opinions. The Legacy is probably the best one I know of.

**** Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches: Revenge is Best Served Raw)

My advice would be to read through the first book before seeking the opinions of others. But it's.../very/ controversial in certain places.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!
