Harry defeated Voldemort, but the entire Wizarding World turns against him. Dumbledore had been prepared for the possibility of that happening, and leaves Harry information about how to get to the Naruto universe and how to make contact with his friend, the Hokage. Harry doesn't adopt Naruto, but does everything he can to make his life better.
