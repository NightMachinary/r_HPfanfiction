It centered around Snape, Harry and Draco. In potions class there was an incident, that caused Harry to be de-aged into a small child. Dumbledore forced Snape to take care of him. I know there are literally tons of fics like this but the one I'm recalling has it so as Harry ages, day by day, anything that happened to him when he was that age originally appeared on his body. He was abused at the Dursley's and beaten. I remember one scene where Harry was in the bath and bruises began to appear on him etc.

I wish I could remember more, but if anyone has any ideas it'd be greatly appreciated.


** I'm sorry, I don't. But that sounds incredible! I hope you figure it out and share ir with us.
