I love Hermione, and I love Draco, but after a while the fact that Harry seems to end up friends with Hermione most of the time in stories has gotten rather repetitive. Same with Draco. So if Harry ends up in Slytherin I'd rather him be friends with let's say Blaise or Theo or someone like that.

He can be friends with Ron, if the story has it; but I'd still like him to be friends with different people; again as much as I love Hermione I'd love to see him befriend someone else other then Hermione, and Draco.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash. Would like it to be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Very little to no character bashing please.

If I can't find any stories where he doesn't end up being friends with Hermione or Draco I might be forced to write one. (And please don't make me write one as my writing still isn't at the level that I would like it to be).


** - linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) bc this Harry is friends with everyone
- linkffn(Hallowed) a good Ravenclaw Harry
- linkffn(Itachi is that a Baby?) Crack fic that has hermione but not draco
- linkffn(On The Way to Greatness) has Blaise and Millicent as Slytherin Harry's friends
- linkffn(Knowledge is Power) has an asshole Harry older than everyone else, is frankly not that great a story, but O still like it for some reason
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) is the /only/ good nbwl fic out there

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
