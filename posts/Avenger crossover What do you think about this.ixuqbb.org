Steve = Draco = Gryffindor Tony = Blaise = Slytherin Bruce = Neville = Ravenclaw Clint = Theodore = Hufflepuff Natasha = Daphne = Ravenclaw Thor = Ron = Gryffindor Loki = Hermione = Slytherin Fury = Harry = Slytherin

They would have a connection to all houses, means they can build bridges to new allies, especially in Slytherin. I also wanted to make them being reincarnated in different persons since I mostly found ones where Clint was Neville, Tony Draco and so on. Just Thor is still Ron. Just imagine what Loki is going to do to the other Slytherin as Hermione.ðŸ¤£ And of course, there will be quite some troublesome scenes with Neville in Ravenclaw when his Grandma wanted a miniFrank, Draco in Gryffindor and Theodore a Hufflepuff when his Father is a known Death Eater and will definitely not take that kindly.
