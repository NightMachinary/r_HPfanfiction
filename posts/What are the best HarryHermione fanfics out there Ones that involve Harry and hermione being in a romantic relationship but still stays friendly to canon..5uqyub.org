** Are you looking for divergent fics or more redo fics or?

Escape by Singular Oddities is crazy good. I feel it fits very closely to cannon characterizations. Diverges year 6. Can't recommend it enough.

Stargon1 has an interesting (redo) series going that is ending Harmony, although that is a good 400K words in. Starts in. Involves Harry leaving Hogwarts and starting his own school (o.o)
