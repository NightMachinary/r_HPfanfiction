These are the results of drinking Unicorn blood. Did they apply at all to Voldermort after his resurrection? If not, how might they have? Related, has this ever been explored in a fic?


** I mean he ultimately lost everything he was trying to accomplish only six year later and in those years he was only truly 'alive' for a little less than three years.

Compared with Harry I would say that Tom Riddle lived a tormented/half life chasing something he ultimately failed to achieve. Being obsessed with eternal life and dying around 70 (young by wizard standards) at the hand of your arch nemesis seems pretty cursed to me.

** Wasn't it more about the unicorn blood keeping the host body alive so that Voldemort could continue leeching strength from him? In that sense it was Quirrel drinking the blood and not Voldemort.

*** I had the same thought. I can see an argument where it applied to Voldemort, as he was (likely) the cause/motive force behind the drinking of the blood...but it could also just be QQ.

**** I don't know I mean by that logic if a person is cut and somebody uses unicorn blood to keep themselves alive, would that mean the attacker suffers? Besides unicorn blood is a physical thing and not only was quirell in control of his actions shown by the scene where he's told to turn around and all, but also Voldemort is only there in spirit.

** Unicorn Blood seems rather like a "dark" version of the Elixir of Life, and the point of both is to keep the body alive when nothing else could. As such, Unicorn Blood sustained Voldemort's possession of Quirrell's body, allowing the hybrid to more or less function as a living being --- though Quirrell was still rotting from the inside, to the point that as soon as Voldemort left his body he dropped dead. But though it was used to sustain Voldemort, its effects were on the body he was using at the time, and that was Quirrell's.

*** Here's a thought: maybe one of the ingredients needed to make the Elixir of Life is willingly shed unicorn's blood?

**** Good idea --- though it would be an ingredient for the /Philosopher's Stone/, I think, not the Elixir, which seems to be simple to create once you have the Stone (Voldemort and Quirrell certainly seem to think that getting the Stone is the hard part, rather than plan for a complicated process to get from Stone to Elixir). But I recall a story where the Stone was made of crystallized Angel's blood, so there is a precedent of sorts.

***** Maybe, but I personally wouldn't want to make it too easy to get the Elixir of Life even if one does have the Philosopher's Stone. They're both legendary in their own right, after all.

****** ...Are they? I didn't get the impression that the Elixir was ever thought of as a separate entity from the Stone, any more than you'd separate gold from a gold mine.

******* I guess it's more how I interpret it, and given how little is actually known about how the Elixir is made, I personally feel that something that grants eternal life shouldn't be easy to make, even if the Philosopher's Stone is (supposedly) a key component of it.

*** Maybe unicorn blood is like inverse Phoenix tears. PT's are willingly given and restore health and life. UB is forcibly taken and hold one back from the brink of death while at the same time cursing the individual.

** I guess considering how mutilated his soul already was, the unicorn blood didn't make much of a difference in his case.

** IIRC, somewhere Voldy mentions that he occasionally possessed animals - snakes ideally - but that his possession shortened their lifespan drastically and, I assume, eventually killed them.

Infering based on that, I assumed that likewise Voldemort's extended possession of Quirrel(lasting for months, if not years) was causing gradual damage to his body that would have killed him, and the unicorn blood was as much about keeping the host living as it was about sustaining Voldemort.

That might not quite fit with dialogue in /Philosopher's Stone/ though, but it's been years since I read it so I'm not sure.
