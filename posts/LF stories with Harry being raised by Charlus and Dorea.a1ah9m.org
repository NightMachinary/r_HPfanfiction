** linkffn(12058516) has Harry being raised by Dorea Potter. What is written so far is /excellent/, though I do wish it had a regular updating schedule. That said, the author has said they poke at it now and again, so it's on my watchlist!

*** How cliche is Hermione on this fic? Is she the typical fanon-authoraty-sucking/Aphrodites/BAMF/SmarterThanAtena level of shit or an actual good character like in Stages of Hope or hell, even canon she's better than 90% of fanon Hermione.

** linkao3(6334630)

I can't really think of any fics with him being specifically raised by them, but this one comes sort of close. Harry finds a portrait of Dorea and she mentors him and gives him advice on what to do. This plot point comes into play in the first chapter and comes back throughout the story.

I know this isn't what you're looking for, but I hope it's better than nothing.

A bunch of people like to use them on fanon as Harry's grandparents, to connect Harry with the Blacks beyond being Sirius's godchild. (Dorea is a Black by birth)

***** It was never confirmed that they were, we simply thought that because it showed Dorea's name connected to Charlus Potter on the Black Family Tree that Sirius showed Harry in book/movie 5 (I don't remember which one is the one that shows it)

She didn't retcon it because it was never a fact.

You and everyone else bruh. They fit way better with most stories because of the Black connection. There are SEVERAL fics that disregard Fleamont and Euphemia, though, so you get that a lot.

One of my personal favourites is Honour Thy Blood. It really goes in-depth about Dorea and Charlus and later on Harry's Black heritage.

******* Ofc, that's how fanfic works mate, How many fics have you read about Lily and/or James being alive after 81 ? Same concept.

There's a fic called Raven of Durmstrang in which Harry (wbwL fic) is raised by Dorea.

******* According to canon, they didn't have children. But yeah, they would have. And apparently they are a bit older than Harry's grandparents, so in a normal range of age for having children, they would've been around 25~30yo. Which, I think, is better than 21, if they were the same age as James and Lily.

Not that it makes a whole lot of difference, but just as a side thought.
