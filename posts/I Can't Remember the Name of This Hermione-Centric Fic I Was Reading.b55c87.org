I might get some of the details wrong since it's been awhile since I read it. I remember that negative sentiments towards muggleborns were growing in the wizarding world. Something unjust happened (I can't remember...maybe she was framed for something?) which prompted in Hermione getting removed from Hogwarts. Throughout the fic she confided in Sirius a lot and the author kept teasing if Hermione would end up with Ron or Harry in this huge love triangle which ended in her choosing Ron and made the Harmony fan readers leave angry reviews. Also Umbridge and/or Fudge might have been involved in framing Hermione.

Does this ring a bell to anyone?

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
