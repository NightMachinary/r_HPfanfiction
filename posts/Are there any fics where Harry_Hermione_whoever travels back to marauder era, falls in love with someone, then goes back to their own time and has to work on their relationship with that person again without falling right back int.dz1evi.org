#+TITLE: Are there any fics where Harry/Hermione/whoever travels back to marauder era, falls in love with someone, then goes back to their own time and has to work on their relationship with that person again without falling right back into things with hardly a problem? (No Harry/Lily or Harry/James pls)

** There's an amazingly written fanfiction with the pairing of Lily Luna/Sirius called Time Spiral.

She goes back in time, meets everyone in hogwarts, lives there for almost a year and comes back to her time where sirius is dead.

So it's not exactly what you're looking for but it's similar and the writing as well as story itself are amazing. I'm not into this pairing at all, and I don't read marauder gen stories but this one is so good I couldn't help but recommend.

** I know someone else recced it already but oh my gosh, Debt of Time by Shayalonnie. A bit tropey at times but otherwise, an absolute masterpiece.
