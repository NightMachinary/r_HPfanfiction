this is the absolute bullshit that made me throw up my hands and quit this fic. fucking read this shit! spoilers by the way.

excuse me but im going to get all capslock harry up in here. its unbelievable bullshit.

so the order and a bunch of aurors break into azkaban to free all the prisoners, and sirius gets into a duel with voldemort right? awesome stuff! but then...but then...the duel literally ends with sirius and voldemort both being knocked unconcious because of a power struggle, and sirius comes back to it a good twenty to thirty seconds before voldemort does, and you know what he does?! he has a fucking conversation with some of the other aurors, WHILE LORD FUCKING VOLDEMORT IS UNCONCIOUS ON THE GROUND NEXT TO THEM ALL, AND THEN THEY DECIDE TO MOTHERFUCKING JUST LEAVE AFTER HE STARTS FINALLY STIRRING AWAKE AGAIN! WHAT THE EVERLOVING BULLFUCKINGSHIT COCKS IS THIS FUCKERY?! YOU HAVE. GODAMN. LORD VOLDEMORT. UNCONCIOUS FOR THIRTY SECONDS, ON THE GROUND, AND A BUNCH OF ORDER MEMBERS AND TRAINED AURORS DON'T DECIDE TO JUST FUCKING STUN HIS ASS AND APPARATE AWAY WITH HIM, OR BETTER YET, STAND OVER HIS LIFELESS BODY AND UNLOAD A KILLING CURSE INTO HIS CHEST?! OR A BLASTING CURSE, OR A DECAPITATING HIS HEAD CUTTING CURSE?! IT WOULDVE TAKEN TWO SECONDS OF YOUR TIME TO SHOOT A SPELL INTO HIS BODY!!! WAHT THE FUCKING FUCK?!?! THEY DECIDE TO GODDAMN RUN AWAY AND LEAVE HIM TO WAKE UP AND BE ALL HUNK DORY, JUST THROW UP THEIR HEADS AND GO "WHOOPS HE WOKE UP, GUESS WE HAVE TO GO THERE'S NO TIME!!! THERE'S NO TIME!!!!!"

worst bunch of FUCKING BULLSHIT IVE EVER READ. JESUS FUCK.

thats like some CW superhero bullshit, where they literally get the villain down and disarmed but then they just randomly decide to stand around like a jackass and just LITERALLY LET THEM ESCAPE.

because fuck having logic in your story i guess. good guys cant kill! we cant even CAPTURE THE UNCONCIOUS DARK LORD LAYING TWO FEET AWAY FROM US.

WHAT. THE FUCK?!

dont fucking put your story even close to that kind of corner if you have to pull living plot stupidity out of your asshole to keep it going! .............................................

EDIT: it gets way worse on a closer reread. see:

"what happened?"

"we stunned both of you," said kingsley.

"voldemort-?"

"still unconcious." said kingsley.

THE FUCKING AURORS GODDAMN STUNNED LORD VOLDEMORT, AND KINGSLEY, FUCKNIG KINGSLEY WOULDNT JUST PUT A CURSE INTO HIS STUNNED BODY?! OR KIDNAP THE STUNNED MAIN VILLAIN?!

It makes me a whole lot more forgiving about the stuff that younger writers are putting out that is a bit wish-fulfilment and not very well plotted or a bit fanonish. They aren't at least lovingly describing things that make you wonder whether the writer is a general danger to humanity.

Potentially could of had a great story in that era. So now we have present time. Ok he's a young adult now in a time where he would still be a teen. Upon meeting up an older xyz. They try to keep the time travel thing a secret. And saying "try" is being very generous. It's barely a chapter and the secret gets out right in front of a teen. These people are supposed to be adults and the let this very sensitive secret get out in less than half a chapter. I stopped reading right after that.
