In wbwl fics, or just fics where he has a sibling and parents live we always see Harry neglected, ignored, etc right? In other fics with the same base, wbwl or whatevs, sometimes we see that Harry's twin is trained right?

Lilly and James are are 21 when Voldemort attacks. Assumedly the war's been going on their entire lives. I'ma be honest, but I can't quite see them being able to adjust as well as they do as in some fics. Where's the constant paranoia? The trauma? The worry?

So I propose that Lilly and James, knowing about the prophecy and assuming Halloween went the same in canon, except they live. They would train the train way to hard. Abuse levels of hard, all his life the twin has known that he's going to have to fight Voldemort. He hates it. He hates his magic. The parents constantly saying that they loved him and this was to help him made it worse. It's a slow buildup, but eventually the twins magic just stops. One day James, after being assured by healers that there was nothing wrong, goes to far. Not like, crucio or anything, just saying some really cruel shit. That's when the twin goes obscurus on them. Harry's always watching, whether it's from the staircase or through a charm placed that connected the library and dueling room by sight so he knows what happens. He rushed out of the library to find his twin destroying everything. Only the sight of his brother, the one whom he both loved beyond anything and was jealous of stopped him.

Cool idea right?\\
Basically Harry's twin is an obscurus after being trained too hard over the years and hates his own magic for it.


** That's a new twist to the old trope.
