Hi, I have recently been wondering about an old fanfic that I read years and years ago, probably before OoTP came out. It's HHr and it was pretty long, I think it may have been multiple docs. I can't remember the author or the title, I just remember that I really liked it. I also don't remember a lot of details. I can remember Hermione kissing Harry goodbye at the Hogwarts Express at some point and him tasting like peppermint maybe? And them spending time in the maze that was still on the quidditch pitch even after the end of GoF. I know it's not a lot to go on but if anyone thinks they know what I'm talking about or has suggestions please let me know! I'd love to read it again.
