** I believe but I'm not for certain linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT) May be of interest to you.

If I remember correctly there is a scene in there where Harry conjures up a chemical during his graveyard fight and causes an explosive chemical reaction when adding something to it.

** In Always Read the Fine Print, as the title suggests, Harry exploits some loopholes via contract law. Cracky.

linkffn(11118965)

Inspected by No 13 is of a similar premise, except this time Harry utilizes the power of bureaucracy. Also cracky.

  ONE-SHOT. After being entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will, Harry does some independent research on what precisely "magically binding" means...and comes up with a very different approach to the competition.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

***** Really, I was being slightly silly here, but I don't like HPMOR anyways. The fic may not have them doing actually capitalistic stuff (I haven't even finished it gave up halfway through), but I find that it has a bit of posturing in the sense where Harry - A eleven year old kid - is apparently super intelligent and all that jazz. Really boring to read.

It may have been another fic, but I may recall that in HPMOR that when Harry first goes to his vault, he loves having all that gold and stuff, which could is pretty greedy and bourgeois. Not sure though, not willing to look either.

ok, but in the interest of fairness, who wouldn't, especially if it's a kid...?

Like if it was you, would you find the money and then be like "Oh goddamnit, this is the LAST thing I needed today! Fuck all this money, I'll give it all away and go back to my job at Walmart."

If I won the lottery, I certainly wouldn't go and spend it on a mansion or expensive shit like golden cauldrons (jesus book Harry). But, you're right, my opinion on money certainly isn't shared by many others

******** I think money is a good incentive for motivating innovation and success in society, up to a point - I'd support pay caps, for example.

And while I think capitalism by itself is a disgusting thing in what it does to individuals and societies, I think communism is even worse. I do support nationalization/socialization of certain industries and services, though. A profit motive doesn't make any sense in healthcare, for example.

I'm in a strange place where I'm both a nationalist and a socialist - but I can't exactly go out and say that I'm a "National Socialist", because of the history and connotations of the phrase, which wouldn't be accurate to my position at all.

I just think it's ridiculous that we have this false dichotomy of the two-party system, where both parties are sides of the same coin. I really hate this neo-liberal, neo-con order.

Oof, didn't meant to get so hard into politics in this comment.... Whatever, lol
