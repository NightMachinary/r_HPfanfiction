This is the only thing I remember

I think harry comes across a pensive memory of a former Hogwarts headmaster putting a potter girl under imperius and abuses her sexually. He later oblivates her too. Later the girl father or it might be the lord potter of that time kills the headmaster in a honour duel.

That's all I remember.


** I don't recall which one it is either, but can supply more details. The main thing that sticks out to me is just how over-the-top and unnecessary that whole sequence was, its only relevance to the plot being the existence of living relatives on the Potter side because the Potter in the memory got pregnant and she and/or the baby were sent away.

- Harry hides in the RoR to avoid the Tournament
- He watches things in the school through a magic mirror

  - IIRC he follows classes and even has Dobby slip his homework into the piles to be graded.

- He ends up fleeing to America to live with the descendants of the raped Potter
- I /think/ it's also the one where he had Dobby sneak a stuffed Acromantula into Ron's bed after Ron was a dick to Hermione.

*** Yes...that's the one. The reason that this scene stuck was because it was pointless in the story

**** Please explain to me how that helped in the search? I can't ever find things on ffn because it seems to be limited to searching by story title or author name. How can you search by details such as this?

***** This is how I search for fics I where I remember just a portion

Enter this into the Google search:

Site:<url of site where you read the fic> <a line you remember from the fic or character names plus a unique detail>

For example:

site:[[http://fanfiction.net]] Percy Jackson Aphrodite Realm

Google will search only FanFiction and tell you which pages contain words Percy Jackson and Aphrodite Realm.

I tried the same with the stuffed acromantula and it returned some fics that had this.

****** Ah, so you don't use the ffn search at all. That makes sense, then. Thanks for the tip. Now all I have to do is figure out what search term will work. I remember a lot of details but not necessarily specific word strings.
