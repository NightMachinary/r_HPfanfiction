** In both *The Accidental Bond* and *Strawberry Fields*, Harry was adopted by the Granger family: linkffn(5604382;4940094). Strawberry Fields is a short story involving dimensional/time travel by Doctor Who, it would be great if someone could expand it to a full-length novel.

In *Darkness Within*, Harry was abducted and raised by Voldemort himself as his henchman: linkffn(2913149).
