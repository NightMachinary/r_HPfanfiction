I'm looking to save some fanfiction onto my reading list for enjoying when I don't have wifi, and longer chapters means it's less work for me to get the whole story. What stories would you recommend that happen to have pretty long chapters (ideally thousands of words)?


** On archive of our own, there is a button to view the entire story which shows you all the chapters on one page. You can also download the chapters in epub or mobi format from the fanfiction bot on here which may work better than limiting your self to fics with long chapters.

** linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) has very long chapters and also is a great read! linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) is still updating, but also has super long chapters. It's another great fic, too!

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
