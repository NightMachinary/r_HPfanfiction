I just realized I've never run across this particular type of story and am kinda curious now. . .


** I don't know the name of it, but there was an incomplete fem!Dudley/Harry one where she was actually fairly pleasant.

*** What did she look like? Because the image I'm getting of a female Dudley... isn't pleasant.

**** Think she's described as a little chubby and passably pretty. No great beauty, but certainly not on canon Dudley's level. Here's the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/543152/chapters/965756]]

***** Two chapters, with it being last updated 6 years ago. I'm sorry, but I'm bit touching that. If I really like it I'll just get annoyed that it's so short.

****** Maybe you should thank [[/u/AutumnSouls]] for linking you to a fanfic that met your specifications, even if it turned out to not be the right one for you.

******* I think your confusing me for the OP; I just asked what a female Dudley would look like. Took a peek see her appearance and saw it was abandoned at 3000 words. Though yeah, I do admit I came of a bit dickish in that post. Sorry about that [[/u/AutumnSouls]]

******** Oh damn, you're correct! Sorry about that.

No worries, it can be hard to convey tone over the internet.

****** Actually, the 1st chapter makes a pretty great oneshot, and it's sweet and very well-written. edit: actually, I just finished it, and it doesn't have any cliff-hanger or really NEED any more to it. It's good as it is.
