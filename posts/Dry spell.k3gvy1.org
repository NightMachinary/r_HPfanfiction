Is it just me, or is the HP fandom going through a dry spell. I routinely go both onto AO3 and FFNET, and search with my preferred parameters, and it just seems like there's not much going on, these days.

Anyone else feel like this?


** mine are being updated a bit less but really it might just be that this time of the year people are busier with irl stuff

*** I suppose you're right. I just kinda thought, that with half the world in quarantine, there would be some more stuff coming along.

***** I've heard a lot of writers say this--- they have time but not the emotional bandwidth to write because they're so stressed by the pandemic. And of course there are writers who have less time because the pandemic means more work and/or family responsibilities.

****** Yes, exactly. I'm still publishing once a week, since I have a backlog, but I'm definitely not writing as fast as I was before the pandemic.

**** Back in march-may there was a noticeable uptick in activity but since summer it has been much slower. Not that that is a surprise really, people are back at work (or looking for a new job), have to look after their kids homeschooling and juggle normal live. And if my author's notes lately are representative of the broader community we also have a lot of teachers and (college) students who need to prepare for classes more than usual among us.

I just ship my favorite characters with my other favorite characters lol. Or my favorite character with whoever so I get my content about my faves

** Same. I'm in a Harmony fb group and they just did a prompt fest a while back. Tons of people put up a few chapters of their stories and then it seemed like they collectively just decided to stop updating. I know real life happens but it's kind of a bummer when you get into a story and then it stops getting updated. The curse of WIPs.

** I'm on several discord servers with HP fanfic authors, and we've all been posting regularly for months. I guess it depends on what your preferred parameters are? Like, my favorite pairing is H/Luna, and those stories are few and far between, but I can enjoy any non-canon H/female pairing, so there's a lot of stuff to read.

*** Well, I prefer fics with a pairing. Harry/Tonks or Harry/Fleur. Or Harry/Hermione. Not much going on with any of those. I also prefer no smut. It's unnecessary, and does not add anything to most stories.
