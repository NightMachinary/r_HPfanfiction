The 5-year old was met with the sight of the ocean as he stood up from the sand.

"And who might you be?"

A deep, gravely, voice met his ears. Harry immediately turned around, and in front of him was an old man. He had long, balding white hair along with a long mustache and a thin white beard.

"I-I'm Harry Potter, s-s-sir..."

The old man smirked before saying, "A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Shang Tsung...."


** Years later, as Harry is preparing for the final duel with Voldemort, he shoots an Expelliarmus, disarming Voldemort then proceeds to stab him in the eyes with the two wands after which he casts a blasting curse covering the entire great hall in pieces of skull and brains.

Harry Potter wins. Fatality.

** This somewhat implies Harry will bevome Scorpion later on .

I can just imagine Harry/Scorpion taking of his mask, Voldemort see's his skull and thinks death is finally coming for him personally.

*** If Harry encountered Quan Chi instead, then there is a good chance. But I'd rather see James Potter become Scorpion. He's sent to the Netherrealm after Voldemort's attack. James is so driven by rage and revenge that he willingly becomes a servant to Quan Chi in order to gain enough power to wage a one-man war on Voldemort.
