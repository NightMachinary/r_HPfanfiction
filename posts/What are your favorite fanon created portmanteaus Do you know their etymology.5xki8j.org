** Whenever you smash two names together, it's going to sound cheesy and terrible, and its only purpose is for easy searching, and you can only hope that fandom catches on to the least terrible combination (Scorbus, for example, instead of Scorpal or Albius). There is one name I really like, though - I've seen a few places where Neville/Luna was called 'The Government Stole My Toad.'

*** Portmanteaus aren't only names though that seems to be most common. Examples: mageciety for mage society; lizards for lavender wizards as an epithet for gay wizards; hufflepoofs for, well obvious; scitches for scissor witches, obvious again.

** 'Wolfstar' is a portmanteau of an indirect sort I suppose. I don't care for the pairing but I love the name.

It's not a portmanteau but I was once told -- with some plausibility -- that an early name for the Sirius/Severus pairing (Snack, for crying out loud) was 'Malevolence'. I still don't know if that is really true, but I like to think so; and it did give me the title of one story and the name of a potion in another. So it was pretty good value for me.
