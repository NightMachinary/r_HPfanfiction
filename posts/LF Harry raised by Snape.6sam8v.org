Snape is guardian to Harry. You get the idea.

Help a girl out?

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

**** Oh okay. I tried reading one or two Snape raises child Harry but the character in question in those fics was definitely not Snape. These are some good in-character Snape mentors Harry stories.

linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) This fic aligns with your request best. Snape becomes Harry's guardian.

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste) and its sequel linkao3(Harry Potter and the Language of Serpents by Wyste)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Enemy Within by Theowyn of HPG) and its sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chained Souls by Theowyn of HPG)

****** I know! It's one of the few Snape mentor stories I enjoyed. It went deep into Snape's psyche and the interactions between Snape and Harry were realistic and done well. I love how Occlumency is presented in that fic and also the explanations of the Dark Mark. It's a great story. It's a shame it's not more popular.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** If you are ok with mentor-student relationships, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) both fit.

The first is a WBWL where Snape sees himself in Harry (young halfblood, ostracised by his parents, put into Slytherin, terrible hair) and eventually becomes close with Harry.

The second is similar but downplays their relationship, but has Snape let Harry live with him for a summer.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** linkffn(6413108)

I have not finished this one yet but it is very well written so far. Snape is more of a mentor figure towards Harry.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
