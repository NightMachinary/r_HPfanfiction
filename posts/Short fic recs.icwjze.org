Not too worried about categories or whatever. Just looking for recs of stories that are reasonably self-contained and not too long. 10k words maybe? Other than that, I guess I like it when the characters are smart.

I'm just amazed at how many HP fics are 100k+. That's really a full length novel! Some are even longer than the whole Rowling series, which amazes me. Thanks!
