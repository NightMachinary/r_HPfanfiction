** I recall reading a fic where Regulus actually snuck into Gringotts using entirely muggle methods to get Hufflepuff's Cup from Bellatrix's vault. Seriously, it was ingenious! The bank was meant to detect any /magical/ method of theft that it could left a hole in muggle means considering that they would not think anyone crazy enough would do a good old fashion break-in!

I'm seriously upset that I forgot the fic's name.
