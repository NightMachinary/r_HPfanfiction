It seems as if learning to nonverbally cast spells is more of a challenge because you're taking away some trait of concentration, rather than really using magic any differently. And Harry was still capable of casting spells while under the water during the Triwizard tournament, despite having trouble with nonverbal spells two years later.

So would someone effected by being hit with Silencio, despite not being able to verbally hear themselves, be able to properly cast spells without any inhibition purely because they're still attempting to use that form of concentration?

I bring this discussion up because "Silencio" is a common spell used in fanfictions to inhibit less skilled opponents. But I honestly don't think they'd even notice the difference.


** Well that actually happens in canon.

Hermione silences Dolohov in the DoM, so when he casts the spell that hits Hermione it does not kill her, though she nearly dies.

Here is a quote from OotP:

#+begin_quote
  She winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs. The curse Dolohov had used on her, though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in Madam Pomfrey's words, 'quite enough damage to be going on with'.

*** I had forgotten about that. I wonder what the reasoning for that is. Spells getting weaker the less able you are to pronounce them, I mean. With the only notable exception being nonverbal casting which just sounds... weird.

You'd think a wizard like Dolohov would have mastered nonverbal casting long ago, so why the holdup for him?

**** Ability with silent casting likely varies from wizard to wizard and, from what we see in canon, depending on the spell as well (ex. Levicorpus). There is a reason silent casting is not taught until NEWT level. Some spells in canon also seem to be more effective when cast silently or aloud, though the examples are a bit scant. This may be why certain spells are always spoken aloud (aside from obvious reader issues with silent casting).

Dolohov may simply have been poor at casting silently, or less skilled with the spell in particular. Of course, its entirely plausible Azkaban did not leave him and the other escapees firing on all cylinders, if they ever were, and damaged much of their mental faculty. Or they were out of practice with magic.

***** I think it's just the fact that Dolohov was relying on casting the spell verbally rather than non verbally that weakened it's effect. He could've done the same curse to full effect without the spoken incantation, but didn't feel like mentally concentrating on the spell hard enough in order achieve that. So he just decided to rely on the verbal incantation to summon it instead.

***** Actually, this has me wondering - when exactly did Hermione silence him? I feel like it was mid-incantation, which would definitely have a different effect than if it happened before he started casting.

****** Again, direct quote from Chapter 35:

#+begin_quote
  Harry, Hermione and Neville were all knocked backwards off their feet; Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view; Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry's head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react.

  'WE'VE GOT HIM!' yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry. 'IN AN OFFICE OFF--'

  'Silencio!' cried Hermione and the man's voice was extinguished. He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out. He was thrust aside by his fellow Death Eater.

**** I think just like the wand is a magical focus, so is the incantation and the gesture that accompanies a spell. Taking stuff like this away diminishes focus to the point that most people can't cast the spells at all anymore... for others who are more talented it will mean that they can't cast complex spells at their full power. I'm sure Voldemort would cast the killing curse silently if he could.

** I think that being silenced is kind of irritating, and thus undermines your concentration, especially when you are in a combat situation and try to yell out a curse and then are reminded that you're not making any noise. With enough practice that should be easy to overcome, but there doesn't seem to be much value in it since if you let a simple spell like Silencio get past your defence in a fight then it stands to reason that you would get caught by something a lot nastier as well. Probably better to learn to cast a silent Finite as fast as possible and with as little wand movement as possible.

** I think it is (at least partly) the same way that Kido spells works in Bleach. As in, saying

#+begin_quote
  "Hado number 31, Shakkaho!"
#+end_quote

might work but not as effectively as saying

#+begin_quote
  "Ye lord! Mask of blood and flesh, all creation, flutter of wings, ye who bears the name of Man! Inferno and pandemonium, the sea barrier surges, march on to the south! Hado number 31, Shakkaho!"
#+end_quote

Of course IMO the same should apply to wand movement, state of mind, etc...

** We can't really tell one way or the other, because the canon literature never explains how magic works to that degree.

One of the most plausible explanations in line with the universe is that it's a matter of confidence. Being silenced against your will, and then trying to cast a spell regardless, might put a damper on your spell-casting ability, whereas being underwater and vocalizing the spells expecting them to work might do just that.

It seems like silent spellwork is a later acquired skill, so it would make sense that, perhaps, spells are actually more effective said out loud than not, which is only avoided in the interest of stealth. There is also the possibility that it's like learning to read without vocalizing the text, after a while, it's the only way you do it and it's faster, but that comes with practice, and maybe some wizards do more of that than others.

It's also perfectly possible Rowling never gave this a second thought, and it was either a happy coincidence that it made sense anyway, or a bad one that it doesn't.

It's not something you can know for certain. I advise taking the fan fic authors' explanations and judging them on their own merits instead of trying to determine what the canon might've wanted to say. It's all made-up anyway, to one degree or another, and this is not a very well-explained topic.

** Why do you assume the mere ability to cast non-verbally automatically drops a compulsion (or even just a preference) of casting non-verbally at any and all times?

*** I didn't do any of that. I was speculating that removing the ability for your words to to be literally heard would, perhaps, not effect the outcome of the spell because it's the /process/ of speaking that helps you concentrate and perform a spell better, not that the universe literally requires the words to be spoken.

To support this speculation, I pointed to a situation in which Harry cast spells underwater. What that ended up sounding like is nearly guaranteed to have been nowhere near what the spell actually sounds like, and yet the spell worked. This would seem to lend credence to the theory that it's the process that helps the individual caster but not a requirement and why nonverbally casting spells is possible in the first place.

Not... whatever the hell your word salad was implying I was saying.

**** You are assuming that the caster has to hear and identify their own sounds for verbal casting to work and no-verbal casting is merely going through the same process but no longer being required to hear what you are saying. Canon contradicts that. Not just in Harrys underwater casting but also in what it tells us about the process of learning to cast nonverbally. It is the act of producing the sound that makes up the verbal component of the spell. That's why distorting the produced sound has no effect but the removal of all sounds being produced does. Furthermore, in learning to cast non-verbally a wizard has to actively learn to forego the verbal component, to stop even attempting to produce a sound, to move his lips to the words of the spell, to accomplish this.

Note that during a certain Quidditch game in the first book even Severus Snape, an accomplished non-verbal caster, chose to cast verbally. Non-verbal casting is not a simple and easy substitute to verbal casting. It carries with it enough penalties to spell power and control that even proficient non-verbal caster choose to forego it as the situation demands.

If you consider two straightforward questions "word salad" then you really should work on your reading proficiency.
