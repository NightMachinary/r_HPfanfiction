I'm trying to broaden my horizons by reading something non-Harry centric, and Hermione is probably the best place to start.

The kind of thing I'd like:

- Stories from Hermione's PoV where she the hero of the tale.

- BUT she doesn't steal Harry's thunder i.e. she is the hero of her own adventure, not a replacement for Harry.

- Hogwarts era. Never really been interested in post-Hogwarts fics.

- No bashing.

- If the fic is going to explore magic, it should be canonish magic.

- Hermione should be characterised as her canon self. She can be mildly beefed up but she shouldn't be like a mini-Dumbledore.

- Preferably no prominent role for either Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape (except, obviously, brutal death scenes).

- In fact, more generally, no "star crossed lovers" tropey stuff involving Hermione/Slytherin.

- Or romance in general, actually.

- Written in third person.

**** Lorien829 is a Portkey author so the Hermione love is to be expected. As it was written a few years ago, that wasn't considered a sin at the time, nor was twisting the canon magic to suit your story.

With all that riding against it I'd still say give it a read, because it's a good adventure with plenty of character moments for others like Harry, Neville, Ron, Ginny, Remus, Tonks, Seamus, Fleur, Percy and even Daphne Greengrass. The villains have their moments as well and the bulk of the story the good guys are running scared for good reason.

** I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11376508/1/fair-fortune][fair fortune]] by sweetasylums, a rewrite of one of her old fics. The prologue by itself is a short story told in Rose's PoV, which sets up the time travel element. It's a great read on its own and I'm rec'ing it mostly for that, as the rest of the story isn't far in at the moment. Marauder's era but interweaves moments from the Hogwarts era.

**** Yet 2.5k people favorited it, me among them. Then again, I really dislike Alexandra Quick (only made it partway through the second book before getting too frustrated with the character), so maybe we like different things.

I like characters that think before they act. I'll grant you that her brilliance with arithmancy is a bit huge in this fic, but it's amusing, and she still has flaws in other areas and doesn't always get what she wants. I don't see it as pure wish fulfillment, she didn't get Cedric as a date, she has a bit of tunnel vision on the math at times, she's (somewhat) isolated from her friends throughout the year because of the transfer in fourth year. She also has several big stress moments where she doesn't handle the stress well (trolls and dementors in third year for example).

I commented /once/ on one of your many recommendations of Alexandra Quick with some of the reasons why I disliked it. Why do you feel the need to do this every time with this story, despite a lot of people really liking it? I've seen another user do this with Green Girl. Somehow some people get really upset when something they don't like gets popular, but it looks so childish to keep mentioning it. I dislike several very popular fics that are within genres that I really like, yet when they are linked I generally just ignore them, because I know it fits the category and there's a good chance the person that requested it will like it.

***** /Alexandra Quick/ is an interesting character, but *she never learns from her mistakes*. I think that if /The Arithmancer/ has an overarching problem, it's that while the story and the agency are centered around Hermione, the major conflicts and adversity are still centered around Harry and Harry's canon (mis)adventures. It's not unreasonable, and it makes perfect sense (because adding a Voldemort-grade threat that would serve as Arithmancer!Hermione's quest would feel like it's coming out of the left field), and yet, it ends up being a bit incongruous --- an epic character in a slice-of-life story.

I am guessing that you are talking about me. To answer your question, ask yourself why you might want to /recommend/ a fic more than once. (This isn't the first thread asking for Hermione-centric fics, after all.)

--------------

[1] On the other hand, what if /Hermione/ is the cause of the conflict? For example, suppose that there exists some magic that can End the World as we Know It and is within the capabilities of a fairly large fraction of the population. The good news is that the Arithmancy involved is fiendishly complicated. The bad news is that Hermione has just done 95% of it and published it. A month later, she stumbles upon the remaining 5%, and it's only a matter of time before others do, because she's done most of the hard work. So, now she has to figure out what, if any, countermeasures there are, how they can be applied, and all while telling as few people as possible.

Maybe I should pitch that to White Squirrel.

I was, and I would recommend a fic again if it's been a decent while since I've seen it recommended, or when it /really/ fits what's requested.

As to the 'overarching problem', I actually like it if the main character in a story isn't necessarily the main hero in the main conflict. As long as her story is interesting I see no reason why a main character can't play more of a supporting role.

Fics that I really, really dislike despite them being in a genre I like include Ultima Ratio and Isolation. I think I mentioned my issues with the former /once/ on this board and with Isolation I only ever posted it in a review if I recall correctly. Plenty of people like those fics, so if they're recommended in a relevant thread I just ignore them. There's a good chance other people won't get annoyed by the problems I encountered the way I did.

That's answering the question of /when/ you might want to recommend a fic more than once. Not /why/ (I.e., what is your motivation and reasoning behind an action? What do you want to accomplish?), which is what you and I were both asking about. It sounds like semantics, but it's an important distinction.

Pointing out problems with a fic is more venting for me, because if the fic is still obviously popular, apparently plenty of people don't mind those flaws as much as I do.

Repeatedly pointing out why you don't like a fic each time it's linked is toxic behavior in my opinion, and this sub already has an issue with that. Semi-regular threads that do nothing but complain about fics or a genre of fics. Sometimes posed as a question but any defense of the fic/genre tends to be beaten down as much as possible.

I get venting on things you don't agree with, but on a whole it's better for your nerves and more constructive for the community to just ignore threads/fics you don't like in my opinion. (which is why I don't rage against the OP, despite dramione and snamione being my favourite pairings)

There you go: whereas criticism helps people avoid avoid fics that will disappoint and frustrate. There are currently about 728 thousand /Harry Potter/ fics on FF.net alone. Reading time is precious.

#+begin_quote
  Pointing out problems with a fic is more venting for me, because if the fic is still obviously popular, apparently plenty of people don't mind those flaws as much as I do.
#+end_quote

And if they don't mind the flaws being pointed out by the critic, it wouldn't stop them reading it; but if they do mind those flaws, it would prevent their time being wasted and their being frustrated. (I think that you will find that when I rec a fic and am not in too much hurry, I usually summarize flaws and reservations as well.)

There is also a possible impact on the greater fanfic ecosystem that may affect fics that will be written in the future: for example, calling out a bad characterization (e.g., one that is degrading relative to canon) in a popular fic may help prevent that characterization from becoming the dominant "fanon". (Examples available upon request.) How effective this is is unclear, though.

#+begin_quote
  Repeatedly pointing out why you don't like a fic each time it's linked is toxic behavior in my opinion, and this sub already has an issue with that.
#+end_quote

I think that our opinions differ on this. (And, what does "toxic" even mean in this context?) Both praise and criticism are necessary for a healthy marketplace of ideas, and because of the design of this forum, recommendations and discussions do get rehashed. If we adopted the suggestion to only criticize once, that criticism would soon scroll off the bottom of the page and be never seen again, even as praise gets repeated over and over and over, crowding it out of even the search results.

Yeah, those are mostly venting, but they are a different beast, I think, since they deal in generalities. I often read people's complaints and am confused about how often the thing being criticized actually happens.

I don't think that it's justified in this case. My general observation is that the DLP community members often act as if their specific preferences constitute the only possible standard of good taste; but it's not the case here: as OP wrote, "/Preferably/ no prominent role for either Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape (except, obviously, brutal death scenes)." (emphasis mine).

*** Mmm. Hermione is pretty good in this. Unfortunately my biggest problem with it is the magical theory... which is kinda important to the fic. I'm not a big fan of "mathematising" magic. I prefer a more mystical approach to magical theory oriented around symbolism. Arithmancy has a role to play, but I don't like versions of magic where arithmancy is the basis of magic.

** Off-FF.net, [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived by Diane Castle]] can be a bit heavy on Girl Power, but it's a very interesting reimagining of Potterverse in a James Bond superspy sort of setting.

linkffn(Kick in the Arse of the Wizarding World) is one that hasn't been mentioned yet.

linkffn(The most gifted witch of her age by Bagge) is a one-shot that fits the bill.

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew) may yet go there.

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah) has language issues, but is interesting enough.

linkffn(Effloresco Secundus) is a /Naruto/ crossover that sort of fits the bill.

Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
