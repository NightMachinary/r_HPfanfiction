Hey guys,

For the last week's I've been searching for a Harry Potter fanfiction, I've read some time ago and can't find it anywhere. I'm pretty sure it was on ao3 (archiveofourown.org), but I already searched through all possible tags.

The story goes as following: Harry Potter is Hadrian Peverell and the Master of Death. He seems to be one of the original Peverell brothers and is ca. 800 up to 1000 years old. The story is set during the war with Grindelwald and focuses on the war and on a young Tom Riddle, who is still in the orphanage when the story starts. Hadrian is somewhat of a mentor for Tom, but they only communicate via Owl and a special diary. They don't meet. Hadrian meanwhile tries to protect the descendants of the Peverell line (who are own characters and play a somewhat important role) from Grindelwald, who is obsessed with them and the deathly hollows. At one point Hadrian was romantically involved with Gellert and also Albus Dumbledore, but distanced himself from Gellert, because he changed and got more and more violent, dark and obsessed.

That's the gist of it. Unfortunately I can't remember the title. Hope, some one can help me, find it again.
