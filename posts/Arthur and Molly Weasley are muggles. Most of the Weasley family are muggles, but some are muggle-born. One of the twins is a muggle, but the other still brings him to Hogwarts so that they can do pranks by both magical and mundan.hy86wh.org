** Bill is a muggle, Charlie is not, Percy is a muggle, I like your idea for Fred and George but it's heart breaking if it's real so I'm gonna make them both magic lol, Ron is a wizard and Ginny is a muggle but she sneaks into Hogwarts anyway but something about her being muggle means that the diary doesn't work on her but she gets caught at the end of the year because of it and sent home
