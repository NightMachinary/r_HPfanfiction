I read a good fanfic a while ago where James and Lily survived the attack by Voldemort but when they woke up Harry had already been taken away by Hagrid. In their grief they decided to leave England and go elsewhere therefore everyone assumes them dead. Its not until almost 15 years later that they see a copy of the Daily Prophet and realize Harry is still alive. Also they had two more kids (twins) who were a couple years younger than Harry. Anyway, it was really good but was abandonned. I was wondering if anyone knew of any other good stories similar to this. For example the part about thinking Harry is dead and going into hiding. Maybe even having another child until they find out Harry is still alive. If possible I would love it to be established Harry/Ginny just because I've always loved the idea of Harry introducing Ginny to his parents and them realizing their "baby" is all grown up with a girlfriend. Anyway... if anyone knows of anything that sounds like this please let me know. Thanks :)


** Well, there's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6780275/1/The-Last-Casualties][The Last Casualties]] similar but devolves into the lordship trope quickly (it does it better than most though).

*** Thanks. I'm not a huge fan of Harry/Hermione but I've been meaning to give one a try so this may be the one. :)

**** Yeah, it doesn't cover your H/G request, but I quite like it despite not being a HHr fan myself. By the way, you wouldn't happen to have a link for the fic you described in the OP? It sounds like a good read even if abandoned.

***** Ok I found it again. I don't think it was as good as I thought in hindsight but I still liked the concept. The beginning chapters are really short and then it gets a bit better before going down hill again near the end. Like I said I just really liked the concept but not the writing as much. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2601312/1/]] I might end up writing my own fic based on what I was requesting as I can't seem to find anything else like it. Anyway, hope you enjoy!

******* I did. Only got 2 chapters in so far though and I'm really busy right now so have no idea when I'll start updating again. I'll post a link when I get home though.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.
