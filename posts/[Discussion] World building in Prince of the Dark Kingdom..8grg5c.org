I was thinking about it recently and I must say that PotDK was probably the most consistent and best world building I've ever seen in HP fanfiction.

Just think about it. Everything fit. Every single action taken by either Lucius, Snape, Dumbledore, Voldemort or even Hermione or Harry was perfectly in line with both their presented characters and their experiences.

True, the fic suffered from the plot sometimes overtaking the action, and it got weird with the Faeries, but it was still so extremely CONSISTENT. Example: Hermione was just Hermione, smart, bookish, very much like her early book counterpart (she wasn't years ahead of her peers like in some fanfics, nor was she a just a plot device like in DH). Another example: Very interesting Ron Weasley, who went from an intriguing Slytherin foil, to a troubled teenager way over his head. Not to mention Snape, Harry or Voldemort, who are really, really, really well created and DEVELOP as the story progresses.

I'm so sad the series never ended and that we're basically left hanging, but my question is: Was there anything else THAT consistent in the fandom? I can't recall any. Almost every other fic suffered either from Mary-Sueness or from some other affliction.

****** wasn't this the story with a seemingly super gay sirius/remus with tons of alpha/beta/pack interactions then the author posted a authors note complaining how all the reviewers thought srius and remus were gay? despite having them literarily sleep together in a pile? also wasn't the story abruptly abandonded in the middle of a dueling tournament in a forgiegn country (think france?)

what's your thoughts on empror or circular reasoning? i think both those did a better dark/indy hary than this

******* There are some weird references to beta and alpha, but it never actually seemed gay to me. Nothing actually happens between them so as long as you can ignore the references it's easy to ignore. The cliffhanger at the end was quite bad though.

I wouldn't call Harry dark or indy though so I am not sure why you would compare it to a fic like Circular Reasoning. I recall attempting to read that fic, but I just remember that it was way too dark, depressing and serious for me so I stopped reading it. They are very different in tone and writing.

One thing I love about POTDK is that while Voldemort won, the world is still a fairly normal place with regular people and reasonable rules. The school is still a school and no one is teaching students to torture or kill anyone.

The writing is often fun and humorous. The dialogue and various situations are occasionally hilarious and make me laugh. Despite having Voldemort as his "mentor", Harry is still a good person at heart. He is considerate, empathetic, wants to help people in need and never actually does anything dark. He isn't the edgy! or independent! or tortured! Harry that is often found in these types of fics. It's a nice change of pace and it makes the fic enjoyable to read.

********* [[/u/dehue][u/dehue]] already explained the most important topics, but let me add a few things.

The werewolf subplot is about Greyback making a deal with Voldemort which basically created werewolf enclaves, separate from the rest of Britain. There werewolves can live however they want. That's why Sirius and Remus are there, they were sentenced to live there as a punishment. And they are not homosexual, although it was hinted at in the earlier books the idea was mostly abandoned.

It's most definitely not an INDY Harry fic. It doesn't have a manipulative Dumbledore, OP Harry (though he's pretty bad-ass with time), best friend betrayals, secretly good OWL scores etc.

It's a Harry Potter story that was written with a lot of forethought, but it's obvious that some aspects of it only came out later.

********* Hm, now that I think about it I am not entirely sure what it means for Harry to be "Indy" so I can't say for sure if he is Indy or not in that fic. Isn't that when he is independent, powerful, doesn't care about authority, does what he wants, travels, etc?

Harry is very much not that way in the fic. Snape is a kind of an asshole, but Harry still recognizes his authority as his guardian and listens to him and gets saved/protected by him on occasion. He thinks Voldemort is immoral, but he still considers him a friend and learns magic from him and goes on trips or whatever he tells him. He knows that Voldemort is a powerful dictator that you can't exactly say no to and goes along with his plans. Harry is not really portrayed as being super powerful or all knowing. He is willing to break the rules to help his friends or people who can't stand up for themselves, but he doesn't usually initiate craziness (it just sort of happens around him because he attracts trouble).

He does end up in France a few times and visits Remus and Sirius at the werewolf colonies but he is still in enrolled in school throughout the fic. He is not involved in the vampire subplot, Victor Krum is the one who does. There is a significant amount of description of school life and Hogwarts. Occasionally he gets kidnapped and ends up in different places or he gets taken by Voldemort to various places. Then he spends time gets back to Hogwarts which is often the setting of battles and conflicts within the fic.

There are also a few stations of canon, but the details are entirely original. The basilisk storyline is still present, so is the triwizard tournament. A dragon and a lake are still part of it even if the actual tasks are way different.

Whats with the weird obsession with brainwashing and indoctrination in parts of this fandom? The cool part about brainwashing stories is when the brainwashed person breaks out of it (like when Harry realizes that his parents were good people and loved him in canon), not the indoctrination itself, but they rarely get to that part.

I can sorta understand it as a sexual fetish (creating your very own sex slave). Is prince of a dark kingdom slash? What's the non-sexual appeal of fantasizing about someone's mind being warped? Is it for sociopaths?

********* Prince of the dark kingdom is not slash. There is very brief mention of 2 OC same sex couples in the background, but nothing other than that.

And "sexual slavery" fetish? I have read some of those types of fics before and this fic is completely outside of that concept that it would be ridiculous to even put it in similar category. There is nothing close to slavery in this fic, it actually goes against all typical tropes of Voldemort torturing and enslaving people mindlessly. Unlike canon where I am not sure why anyone actually follows the guy, Voldemort in this fic is quite a clever, charismatic leader.

I would not say that Voldemort indoctrinated Harry into anything in this fic. Unlike almost all fics with a similar premise, Harry remains entirely good/light at heart and Voldemort does not torture/brainwash or do anything to him. Harry's parents fled to Europe, but died during Harry's late childhood in a robbery so Harry still very much cares for them and knows that they were good people. Even Voldemorts wizarding world is more or less a normal place. A few somewhat questionable laws and rules, but daily life for most people is normal and good.

Some characters like Sirius, even Harry actually are better off in this place. Sirius is part of a werewolf community with Remus where he is respected and rises as a potential clan leader. Harry even visits him occasionally. Much more pleasant than being tortured by dementors in a prison.

Harry does recognize that Voldemort is a sociopath and does not agree with majority of his methods at all. Voldemort mentoring is mostly hands off. He teaches Harry pagan and earth magic and rituals. He sets him up as his protege and gets him into the public eye, but a lot of it is to improve relations with other wizarding communities and his citizens (since Harry is a likable, compassionate guy who becomes known for his saving people thing and for promoting werewolf welfare).

A good quote:

#+begin_quote
  Help you? Help you what? Turn him into another one of you?"

  "Of course not. There can only be one of me, but I see so much potential for him. He can fulfill the roles I can't... do as easily. I am a conqueror, he is a defender. I lead by the lash, he leads by example. He might yet become my equal, but we shall never be the same."

From what you wrote the Voldemort in this fic is so different from his canon counterpart that I have to wonder why he isn't an OC or Grindelwald.

*********** Haha, I didn't even notice the similarity. But he isn't like Batman after that. He gets sent to his aunt and uncle where he pretends not know english, but still ends up in similar situation as in canon. Then he does accidental magic and gets taken to the wizarding world. One of the more immoral practices in the fic is that magical children get taken from muggles at early age, have their memory changed and get adopted out into wizarding families.

Voldemort is very different from canon, but his character is very consistent with the background that the author presents for him. I don't think I would call him an OC though. Plenty of other popular fics change Harry/main characters to the point where they are nothing like their canon selves and they are not called OC's so I would say that this is similar. I consider it more of a take on what would it be like if he was saner, smarter and more like Tom Riddle than in canon. Also, he has now been ruling for a good 10 years so he could have changed in that time as well.

There is a diary horcrux Tom Riddle around who thinks and acts just like his canon counterpart so the author does seem to understand his character very well.

********* The Brainwashing referring is not a direct brainwash, as in lets feed him potions and put under a lot of spells, although Voldemort considers it at first Snape quickly shot it down stating that a Gryffindor will not forgive such an action ever if he comes aware of it. Its not a slash, but there is a different relationship between them, with Voldemort mostly concentrating on making him his heir, but not obviously so - as in declaring him directly his heir - but he interacts with him more often.

It would have made for some great drama for Voldemort to be unable to retrieve him and Harry to slowly be seduced by Dumbledore's ideas (Stockholm syndrome and so on) and for him to start believing that maybe Voldemort was fucking up Britain instead of fixing it.

Instead Harry was kidnapped and rescued in a period of... two weeks? And basically nothing resulted off it.
