[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/0800-Rent-A-Hero][0800-Rent-A-Hero]] by brainthief is a good example in case you don't know what I'm talking about.


** Hmm. I'd like a story where Lily, desperate to save her son, summons someone to kill Voldemort instead of Harry, and instead discovers, horrorstruck, that all she's done is steal an alternate Lily's baby. Bonus points if it's canon Harry, fresh from under Petunia's stairs.

Perhaps instead of second Lily dying for them, first Lily's protection kicks in and burns Voldemort's body. Second Harry escapes the prophecy, canon Voldemort can't die because Harry Horcrux is alive in a second universe. Thus, canon is fucked.

*** Bonus mindfuckery: A few years later, the Dumbeldore of the thieved world manages to contact the abductors.

Lily now knows that the summoned Harry has to die, to save the wizarding world in the other universe.

She will have to kill summoned!Harry.

** There is an interesting one that I don't actually know the name of, and am looking for it myself, so I'll give a description of it in hopes someone knows. I think he's summoned by his family, but I'm not 100% sure.

Harry is summoned I think right as the final battle is finished. Here, in the alternate universe, Dumbledore is still alive and truly manipulative, and Harry joins forces with Snape to fight off both Dumbledore and Voldemort. I think in this story the AU Harry was a Slytherin, who was Draco's boyfriend. Dumbledore convinced this Harry to commit suicide with his own wand by turning it into a knife. Snape has a secret house that isn't Spinner's End, and I think it might have something to do with a garden. This is where he and Harry plan together, and eventually he lures both Voldemort and Dumbledore to the location and sets up both their defeats. Hermione finds a way to return Harry, and because Snape has no attachment left, he follows Harry back to his world.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war?
