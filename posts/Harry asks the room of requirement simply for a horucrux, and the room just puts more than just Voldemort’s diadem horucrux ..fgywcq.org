Just a bunch of random assorted items, like stuff you would actually look over when trying to find one. Nothing grandiose like a subpar lamp.

** I kind of wonder why no one had thought about that. I mean wouldn't it have worked? Or perhaps because they were protected by magic it might not have worked? Though I don't know.

*** I don't think Op meant all of Voldemort's appear, just the diadem and a bunch of random objects that are horcruxes for other people

**** It'd be interesting though if it were also Voldemort's Horcruxes.

Also Harry doesn't know it, but he is as well, oh God... what would happen with that? That's a morbid thought there.

**** You right, I meant it as Ol' Tommy boi not being the first time some dark magic user thought of using the RoR for hiding their horucrux's, just that they weren't going to be so full of themselves to get something that just looks like it could be important. Honestly, dark lords have no subtlety anymore smh.

** Now I'm wondering if all the horucrux's act a bit like toy story characters and just talk with each other until some dude comes around to f*ck em up. “My other soul peices were sooooo dark and edgy, I just wanna crochet after being cooped up in this knitting book my brilliant mind decided on as my inconspicuous soul canister decades ago.”
