**** Unfortunately no. I've tried googling it, and I couldn't find it and it was a bit weird anyway. If you want to try your hand, here's some things that could make the search easier for you. First, is that the eldritch being is a pervert, and lewd, lewd pervert. Second, if memory serves, then it was a young Harry that the being latched itself onto. That's all the information I can give at the moment. Now I really want to find it again... might ask for it in the reddit...
