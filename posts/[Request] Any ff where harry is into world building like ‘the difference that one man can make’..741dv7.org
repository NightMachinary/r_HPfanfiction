** This fic is a bit cringy, and the Harem thing is off-putting, but if you can get over it the story itself isn't bad. linkffn(12311732)

Then there's the classic linkffn(11255223)

These are all in the HP/Asoiaf world, but if you like Naruto and Stargate, the most obvious one is linkffn(10917821)

  Having check-mated himself into a corner with his acquisition of little sisters that needed protecting as well as freedom, Naruto resigns himself to the idea of taking charge of a nation for their sake. That didn't mean he was going to take the whole thing as seriously as his wife had intended though. Fourth in series.

***** +1 for Wizards of Harrenhal. It's basically about Harry being a wildling, and how he approaches the whole thing. It's a nice read.
