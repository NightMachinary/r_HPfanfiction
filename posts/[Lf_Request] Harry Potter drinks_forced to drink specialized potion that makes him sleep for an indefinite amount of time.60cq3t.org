  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

*** There is also

linkffn(summon the lambs to slaughter by la quera)

Although the fic is abandoned and it is in the POV of an exchange student who has a disability. Harry is poisened in this fic and is pretty much asleep for months and the OC does a bit of investigating. Great writing I thought, but I haven't read it in years.
