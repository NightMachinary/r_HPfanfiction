Does anyone have any lines that they just loved, made you laugh,or couldn't stop thinking about from a story that they read? I recently rediscovered a line from 'the Chamber of Secrets and half the adults are idiots' by des98 in chapter 16. It's in the Chamber of Secrets and Draco was talking to everyone about the Basilisk and he says 'I'm not comfortable sharing a castle with people gulping reptile do you guys realize how delicious I am?' I just thought that this line was so funny and so in character for Draco.


** "They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

After all these years I can never forget these lines....

** The ending lines of /Faith and Understanding,/ my all-time favorite one-shot, chronicling Ginny Weasley's friendship with Luna and her musings therein.

This passage has stayed with me for years.

#+begin_quote
  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** Olivieblake has a couple of OCs that are Dracos French cousins who occasionally make an appearance. They are marvelous.

"Hortense, you buggering fuck, it's Draco," the vampire said.

I read the fics for the first time over a year ago and every so often I think, Hortense, you buggering fuck.

** This part of linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) which is the culmination of Harry and Hermione's soul bond marriage ritual.

#+begin_quote
  Then was the day of the winter solstice, and only three stood in a small stone chamber, saying vows they had said times before. Vows that felt written into their hearts and on their skin, floating inside their bones in blood they gently spilled into a bowl that Flitwick held, voice gentle and commanding.

  They held hands and watched magic rise and twine and gather and release. They saw yellow tying together emerald green and violet-blue in a fragile thread, a knot over their heart. So delicate, and yet so strong.

  /Two are stronger than one. For when one would fail, two would prosper./

  Flitwick's final words, as he held their hands in his own.

  Then yellow swirled and was gone, collapsing upon itself out of existence.

  Then they, too, fell upon themselves, in a fever of magic and emotion.

  And between them, slender and strong as a spider's web, their souls grasped one another tightly and didn't let go.

** I don't remember the Fic but Dumbledore was duped by Harry into searching for the Dark Lord colonel Sanders and trying to stop him from taking over the world with his 11 herbs and spices and having snape try to figure out how that can be done.

*** That is my all-time favorite fanfiction scene, especially at the end when he tells McGonagall to go get another glass of wine because he's not finished shopping yet.
