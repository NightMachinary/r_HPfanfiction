** Some are pretty well known, and other appearances are so short I'm surprised they took true actors to do it.

But can we have a moment to talk about Carian Hinds, the guy look like 30 years younger in GoT, the beard really do the man.

Also I find it hillarius that Ian White played the "Body" of Madame Maxime (plus the fact that he played 5 differents roles in the GoT).
