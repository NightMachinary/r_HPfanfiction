Looking for smut containing the following themes: - Harry is a submissive

- harry is being used for the pleasure of others.

- harry is a slave

- harry is the Gryffindor house or dorm slut/whore/slave

- Harry transfigured into sex toy and conscious while being used. (ex. fleshlight)

- Harry is owned by someone

- preferably harry is liking and or thriving on the lack of control and humiliation.

I have no problem with slash but prefer that characters like Malfoy, Snape etc is not a part of the story or at least not a main character/focus of the story. plus if spells and potions are used in the story.

** I have to say, the idea of Harry being transfigured into a sex toy is new. But could he really be conscious in that case?

**** Was he transfigured in the book? It's been a while since I read it but in the films, it certainly looks like he's just hiding inside of it.

I suppose for a wizard transfiguring yourself would be easier than getting inside of a chair though.
