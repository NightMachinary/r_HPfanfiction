Oh and if you know some, please share some to me that end up with both of them being alive, I mean they don't die on Halloween because of prophecy.

Edit: I'd like novel lengths (150k+ words)


** You can try these two:

Linkao3(and he smiled (with a mouthful of bloody teeth) by justprompts)([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29236707]])

Linkao3(made weak by time and fate, but strong in will by Dialux)([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15086759]])

  James is sitting on the couch, Harry next to him, giggling and smiling and Lily's standing near the kitchen counter, James has his wand out, it shoots colorful bubbles and Harry loves them, he's clapping excitedly -The silver Patronus materialises in front of James so suddenly, that he can't even react."Peter's a death eater," Sirius's voice says. "He's sold you out. Voldemort's coming for you. Tonight. Run, Prongs."AlternativelySirius gets expelled after the Prank in Fifth Year, and everything changes.

** No clue how to use the bot, but here's an amazing series (currently in progress) where James and Lily live due to Peter having a last moment change of heart.

It's a chapter by chapter rewrite.
