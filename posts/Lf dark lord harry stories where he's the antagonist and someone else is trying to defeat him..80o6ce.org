Ron and Hermione are the good guys.

This is so old, you may not want to even read it haha.

Cannot remember anything much to be honest.

Also abandoned.

This is really just here in case you are completely out of options, and are desperate for a fix.

*** Huh, I'm not the only guy here who's read this.

Anyone who intends to read this, this was last updated over a decade ago, so it's probably going to come off weird as fuck, on the flip side no modern tropes.

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][/Too Young to Die/]] --- this one gets a lot of shit on this sub for some reason, but I think it's one of the most well written HP fanfics out there. Not a dark lord though.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/The-Prisoner-s-Cipher][/Prisoner's Cipher, The/]] --- IIRC, technically high writing quality. Not a dark lord.

Creackfics:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][/Nightmare Man, The/]] --- Harry's a dark lord, also has a dementor fetish.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11589304/1/Blood-is-not-family][/Blood is not family/]] --- HP Ã— F.E.A.R. crossfic. Not a dark lord.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][/Evil Be Thou My Good,/]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12410115/1/Harry-the-Blood-Demon][/Harry the Blood Demon/]] --- don't remember if these last two qualified for your request.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
