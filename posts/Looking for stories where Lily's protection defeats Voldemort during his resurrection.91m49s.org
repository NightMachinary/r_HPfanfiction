Are there any stories where Voldemort's "let's use Harry's blood" idea backfires? It just never sat right with me that this blood-based protection which already defeated Voldemort twice suddenly stops working because he is dumped into a sample of the very blood which keeps him at bay.

So are there any stories where Voldemort's "body" is burned once he is dropped into the cauldron or something similar happens?

Please, no m/m.


** Potions sort of change the properties of the ingredients they are made of. It makes sense to me that the ritual transforms lily's blood. Voldemort just misunderstood what using the blood protection would actually do.

*** But he came into contact with it before the ritual was complete and therefore he should, at the very least, have come out of that cauldron badly burned.

**** I'm saying it transforms as the potion is forming.

** It's not the same concept, nor can I remember what story it was, but there is one I've read where using Harry's blood backfired because of the basilisk venom and the phoenix tears. Instead of the phoenix tears combating the venom, the tears were doing something else, maybe keeping the magical construct of a body functioning?, and that left the basilisk venom free reign over the construct.

*** I like this idea too. I had a similar idea that the Brasilia venom and phoenix tears were still in Harry's system, but countering each other so he was "healthy" but phoenix tears only last so long (and basilisk venom slightly longer than that) so when the tears in Harry's and Tom's systems expire, Harry's body has had a couple years to develop anti-venom or such, and Tom has only had a few months between resurrection and the tears expiring, so he's left with a lethal dose of venom in his blood and Harry gets a bit sick as his body otherwise picks up the slack dropped by the tears.

Yes, I know the glaring massive pothole of how did Tom get snout tears (and venom) from a random cut on the opposite arm two years after the fact, for either agent to have any effect.

** I'm actually curious about this premise as well.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

** Linkffn(Functional Blood Protection by Right What is Wrong) ?

It is just putting what you asked in other words (of low length) with just some little additions though. Not much.

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC
