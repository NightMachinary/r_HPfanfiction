Long title! Hoping it has more than enough to jog memories. It's a pretty old one, at least 5, maybe 10 years even.

Spoilers here!

I only remember bits and pieces of it, but the two points that really stood out were that at one point "Harry" figures out his real name is Jack ______ (I can't for the life of me remember the last name) after visiting the orphanage he was kidnapped from. And the final battle was him fighting one of the three Fates on the other side of the Veil of Death.

Thanks for anything you find!
