The canon HP universe has surprisingly well-designed paradox-free time travel.

....that contradicts about 95% of time travel fics since the past can't really be changed.

At least HPMoR got it right. You can't travel back to save someone you saw die in front of you but you can save yourself if you remember getting saved by yourself.


** That's not how it works in canon, though. Only /HPMoR/ has /fully/ self-consistent time loops; the canonical stable time loops, more in line with the rest of magic, seem to work on a "close enough" kind of basis. Mintumble and Nott's experiments with time travel show that you /can/ change too many things for time to be able to right itself in a fully stable way, in which case it /does/ change the past, in erratic and sometimes dramatic ways. Even if you want to just stick to the books, there's the Time Bell in the Department of Mysteries to look at.

*** And in Pottermore there's that person who changed all the Wednesdays or something, and the Ministry had to fix it. So the restraints on time travel are artificially placed to prevent major changes and temporal screwups. But you can break them if you try hard enough. They aren't natural laws.

Which is why it always makes sense to me when time traveler fanfics worry about the Unspeakables coming after them. If they're the ones who put the restraints in place, they'd obviously go after anyone who broke them, or circumvented them.

**** The "person who changed all the Wednesdays" is in fact Eloise Mintumble, whom I referenced on the post to which you replied. That aside, spot-on.

Not to be bitter, defensive, or otherwise cantankerous, but Fuck That Noise Right Off. Just because the author spent 20 pages in self-circle-jerk talking about it doesn't mean that other HP authors haven't tried and in some cases succeeded in abiding by single-timeline time travel in their stories. cf linkffn(Retroactive by wordhammer)

  Harry takes a chance in hope of saving Sirius from the Veil, assisted by Luna and some stolen Time Turners. Working with Luna comes with its own complications, though.

**** First, if you want to not appear cantankerous, you might want to avoid the schoolyard-insults towards /HPMoR/.

But mostly, you misread me. I didn't mean /HPMoR/ was the only story in the absolute that had true stable-time-loops; I meat it was the only story /of the ones mentioned by OP/.

** Time travel in canon seems to be limited by man-made laws, not physical laws. When paradoxes are illegal, only criminals can tamper with time. The only physical restriction seems to be against moving forward centuries at a time, since it causes aging. [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/time-turner][Rowling's words.]]

She wasn't moving towards the future per se, just trying to get back from a trip to the past. Something, of course, which various people in /Cursed Child/ managed without growing old. We also see runaway aging (or, as it happens, deaging) effects in /Order of the Phoenix/, with the experimental Time Bell that rewinds a Death Eater back into an infant. In both cases, the clincher seems to be that the time-travel is sketchy and experimental; it's something you /can/ presumably correct for when designig a more refined time machine, such as Nott's Time Turner.

Either way, though, /nowhere/ in canon is travel into the /future/ shown to be possible. Before /Cursed Child/, it wasn't even clear that you could return to the present you originally came from after you'd traveled to the past; it seems that ordinary Ministry-sanctioned Time Turners make you wait it out if you're done with your business in the past and want to return to the present you came from.

** My headcanon: The world dislikes, and will avoid, paradoxes, but will not mind changing the past if doing so doesn't introduce any paradoxes. Basically, it self-corrects reality to allow for the traveler to do what he set out to do in the "new" present before he traveled to the past, to avoid the infinite loop of "traveler, changing the past, no longer has any reason to travel to the past, ...".

Example: There was a timeline where Buckbeak did die and Sirius' fate is grim. Harry and Hermione messing around in the past changed this, but nothing actually changed from the "pre-travel" point of view (McNair instead chopped a fruit, seemingly killing Buckbeak). Sirius remains in the cell, and nobody notified anyone about him fleeing until after the point of the time travel departure.

This, however, doesn't mean that I have anything against time travel stories. They can be good, and even if it departs from what I consider headcanon, I'm not going to call heresy on it or anything. It's a waste of perfectly good plots.

However, if I am to create a story involving time travel, the traveler will almost certainly be an Unspeakable, or one who is /very close friends/ with one. This somewhat reduces the headscratching of "if you can change the past, why not change the war for the better?" or the opposite for Death Eaters -- basically, the Unspeakables have means of preventing change and any opportunistic travelers deliberately trying to mess it up will find that out the hard way -- and changing things for the better is considered too dangerous to do (consider this: Potter won the war mostly due to sheer luck -- change things a bit and the luck might run out), which is why I'd probably start by having them accidentally create a bad future first to excuse it.
