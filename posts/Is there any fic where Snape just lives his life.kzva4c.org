I meant that Snape doesn't get involved in politics (as in no Order and no DEs), just be a potion master

  Suppose the Marauders torture hadn't driven Snape to Voldemort and he had been the better man. What would the future have looked like? Warning: may now contain DH spoilers.

** The time travel story Reboot by Kallanit has Snape running an apothecary and inventing lots of different potions. He does not become a deatheater nor does he join the order though he does help defeat tom and the deatheaters. It's the only story that I have read that even comes close to what you are looking for.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

** I vaguely recall one where Dumbledore and Harry go to get Snape to be the potions professor instead of Slughorn. But I don't really remember much more.
