** linkffn(Hermione Granger is Stupid) - it's a story venturing on how a Harry/Hermione romance was most likely to have happened during HBP. It's very insightful. It managed to provide reasonable explanations behind all the OOC weirdness that went on in canon HBP. And it does so without bashing anybody. Everyone's in-character. I was surprised by how well-written this is.

** linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre by TheEndless7) - misdirects the reader into thinking this is in Spanish or Portuguese, or that the story primarily focuses on the Iberian peninsula. As a historical reference it fits but that reference hasn't yet been mentioned within the story, so it ends up being 'that Limpy of blood whatever that TE7 is writing with the awesome fem!Riddle'.

*** There was more in an early plan that delved into the whole Blood concept and juxtaposed it with Reconquista Spain. But I was bored to tears writing it and figured that it I was bored to tears writing it it should never see the light of day. So I decided, "Screw it, let's drop most of that and focus on making Emily awesome and fun and see what happens." So really, without the title, Emily wouldn't be as awesome, so that makes it a good title, right?

Who am I kidding it's shit.

That being said, I'm now about ten seconds from changing the title to Limpy Blood now, so thanks for that.

On a side note, I actually detest that I need a title before I can post. But no one would read 'Untitled' so. My worst offender is probably the Pureblood Princess, given the title character doesn't even really appear in the story. Hint: In the plan it was Astoria. There's a reason there was a year between the postings chapter 3 and 4.

Oh and happy cake day.
