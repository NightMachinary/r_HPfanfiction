I read this fic some years ago. I can't remember the title or author but what I can remember is

-Harry goes to Diagon Alley where a mysterious shop owner sets him up to run away/go on vacation with a portkey that whisks him off. He ends up traveling around the world while disguised.

-While traveling Harry sets off several things into happening rather unknowingly. Talks to someone in a bar and they think he's threatening them. Things like that. I wish I could remember more specifics but its all very vague in my head

-At one point I believe he visits the site of a concentration camp and sees the ghosts there. I think that was this fic at least.

-Then towards the end (or at least the last of what I can remember reading) he returns home but keeps up the persona associated with his disguise.

I wish I could remember more but I really can't seem to. Its the impression that stuck with me not the actual plot. If it rings any bells please let me know. I remember if being a fun ride and I could use that right now.


** It's a classic.\\

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
