Either with Harry coming to a realization and saying 'Fuck it, I'm not risking my life for this shit', him growing up differently and not involving himself with either the dark or the light sides actively, explaining his reasoning for not fighting logically or any similar concepts.

There are two or three fics where a Slytherin Harry explains how the Slytherins basically have no choice other than siding with the dark since that's all they've known all their lifes and how they're ostracized anyways that I liked a lot, but they mostly stopped there or were abandoned and I'd like to see that concept taken further and how Harry would continue to act in that or a similar situation.


** Yes, there are, but sadly, they are usually wizard/Wizarding Britain bashing fics, where Harry escapes Britain and basically writes a self-righteous "fuck you" monologue to be published in the Prophet. Not that I don't kind of agree with that, but it's usually too boring and one sided. I think it would take a really good writer to write such a fic in an actually interesting manner.

** You need to read Sesc's linkffn(By that Last Candle's Light). Very well written, like all of Sesc's stories and I like it despite Harry's OOCness. It was going to be Harry/Bellatrix story, but alas, it was abandoned before it went anywhere.

Oh, and this is one of my favorite scenes in fanfiction:

#+begin_quote
  "So prove it, then!" I snapped. "Prove to me that you are strong enough to master something as easy as your own fate. Here, now, and we will swear that neither will die at the hand of the other, and both can live. This is your final chance to break the cycle and correct the mistake that began in that pub on a rainy night. 'Either must die at the hands ...' No! We shake our hands. We walk away. We live, both of us. We are the most powerful wizards of our generations. If not us, then who?"

  The whipping wind was so cold, and it cloaked me like the warmest blanket. It whistled around us, tearing at Voldemort's cloak. My voice rose.

  "And the prophecy as a rule? For us? We long since gave up on complying with anything. Rules are only there to be broken. We swear not to kill each other, and force the world to change its course, force our will onto the outcome that is set. We prove once and for all that nothing is greater than magic. This will truly mark our power."

  Green into red, we stared at each other, his face oddly twisted, a strange, hungry look upon it; suddenly reminiscent of another expression I had seen, three years ago, on a boy named Tom Riddle, then as old as I was now. The hints of that boy were still there, breaking through the surface now, for a single, timeless moment.
#+end_quote

The atmosphere Sesc creates is perfect for this, and it manages to make you buy the moment despite how unbelievable it might seem without context.

  More than just Sirius died that night at the Ministry. Harry is left strangely empty, driven by one thought, a burning desire for revenge on the witch who killed his Godfather. But the further he goes, the more blurred everything gets. HPBella done right.

***** He was tricked by a seventeen year old, who seemingly had far better long term vision than Lord Voldemort. Hence incompetent. It also undermines the brilliance of Voldemort's coup in canon via which he kept the entire country in doubt and fear, and common people would never have got the opportunity to run behind Harry as they did here.

But that is hardly the only thing wrong with the story.

#+begin_quote
  here had been rumors that Potter was descended from Gryffindor, but who would have thought that the mudblood was descended from a squib branch of Ravenclaw? And that the Longbottom brat was descended from Hufflepuff? They somehow managed to have the school's magic recognize Potter as a Slytherin descendent, giving them ties to all four of the founders and the right to claim the school their ancestors had founded. Under this magic and logic, they had removed 'their' library and family effects from the building.
#+end_quote

Lol. Really? The descendant of the founders, all coincidentally belonging to Harry's year. And Harry is the heir of Gryffindor and Slytherin too. How convenient.

Then the other stuff: Impenetrable family blood wards (if they exist, why did Dumbledore put Harry with the Dursleys?), constant mention of phrases like the 'light side' and 'light profession', Hogwarts conveniently becoming dead because the author said so, the idea that none of the DEs have any idea how to run a country despite Voldemort's intelligence and many DEs being prominent politicians from canon and general contrivances that Harry and co. somehow foresaw but Voldemort was blind to.

Oh, and this:

#+begin_quote
  Without muggles or Light fools for Voldemort to torture, the only fools available were us.

  With every setback, our Lord became more and more out of control and everyone knew it.\\
  You see, we'd never mentioned his tendency to break out in random crucios as the urge hit. Guess that secret is out. One day he moved through Hogsmeade and the Alley crucioing everyone he saw wearing glasses.
#+end_quote

Yes. Because Voldemort needs a constant supply of people to torture or he wouldn't survive. Seriously? If canon shows us anything, it is that Voldemort has endless patience. Showing him as an incompetent, torture-happy fool wins no points from me.

And all this is in about a thousand words. The premise is stupid and Voldemort's characterization is terrible. Hence Fail.

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and possibly the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, and politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming and enemies abound. AU. Complete.
