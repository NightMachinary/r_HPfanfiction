I've recently read 'The Observer Effect' and a couple of other fanfics where Harry/fem!Harry is done with Voldemort and goes exploring/getting a job/do what adults do. Anyone have any other recommendations of something like that? I love crossovers and AU's as well. gen is preferred, but not necessary.

Thanks!


** I'm reading a good post-Hogwarts, canon compliant(!) fic at the moment, though the focus is on Draco. I'm only in chapter 5 (of 42 so far), but the writing is good and the characterisation interesting. So far Draco does not have the hots for Harry, didn't turn out to be a hero in disguise or simply misunderstood, he's just Draco Malfoy, whose world was turned up-side down when the war ended. linkffn(6432055)

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** Strange Bedfellows is highly unusual but rather interesting. It's crossover and kinda qualifies as next-gen. Just skip over the boring parts about Sands and police stuff as it isn't really integral to the story. linkffn(4427065)

** linkffn(broken by inadaze22) if you don't mind crying throughout half the story (and it's a long one). It ended a bit sooner than I'd like, but I think I understand why it did.

  He felt something close to pity for the woman in front of him. And while that disturbed Draco to no end, what really disgusted him most of all was the harrowing fact that someone or something had broken Hermione Granger's spirit beyond recognition.
