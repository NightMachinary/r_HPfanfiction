I'm look for fics where Harry and ROn have an auror mission. Suprisingly they're extremely rare. It must be canon.


** It isn't canon, and it takes heavy inspiration from Archer if that sets the tone for you. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9121877/1/Midnight-Blues][Midnight Blues]]

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

** linkffn(Ron El Greco) doesn't have much of Harry, but it's a great character study of Ron as a "diplomatic Auror". It's pretty much canon-compliant.

I don't think JKR has written a Harry and Ron have an auror mission story. :(

If, however, you mean it must be canon /compliant/ I offer you A Stricken Lament linkffn(11269724) and Vows linkao3(3993565) Although in A Stricken Lament Harry is the boss, Ron has a different partner but it still a good read, so far at least.

  The Ministry of Magic is proud to say there hasn't been a Dark Lord in ten years, thank you very much. They wish Britain would remember this and not panic over dead magical creatures and vanishing people. Still? Senior Auror Ron Weasley doesn't care what the public thinks. He just hopes that all might someday be well. ---Auror mystery, Harry-Ron friendship, and canon ships.

  3 January 2002. It's Thursday morning at the Burrow and Molly has errands to run and a son to rouse from his slumber once she's back from buying groceries. Things are about to go sideways for the entire Weasley family. Romione, Hinny, and other canon couples Auror!Fic. Special guests in later chapters.
