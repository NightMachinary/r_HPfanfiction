Basically Harry's Bucket List would be the normal muggle stuff Harry always wanted to do up to the wild things he dreamt of doing. Also, 10 points to whatever house you're in if Harry's friends help out, and extra points if Hermione tries to talk Harry out of doing whatever insane action on his Bucket List he's going to do anyway.


** Sounds a lot like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]] where Harry decides that if he's going to be killed by Voldie due to a prophecy, he will at least have some fun first and goes on a Grand Tour.

Things then take on a life of their own (overly-helpful prophetic Shopkeepers, mad scientists, random misunderstandings, accidental magical upgrades, failed assassination missions) and by the end, Harry has inadvertently created a new personae as an Immortal Wizard Atoning For His Past... and he doesn't even realize he's done it!

** Linkffn(make a wish). It isn't really the plot, but it has a Harry who decides to travel the world â€˜cause he doesn't believe he would survive against Voldemort.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
