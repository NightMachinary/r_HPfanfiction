** Not sure if this is what you meant, but linkffn(The Substitute by BajaB) takes place during 4th year, though it is a little depressing. Terrifically written though, and it has a somewhat happier alternate ending in BajaB's WIP collection.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.
