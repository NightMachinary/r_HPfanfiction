Things I remember:

- Harry sorted into Slytherin, best friends with Draco and stayed at Malfoy Manor over the summers
- Harry is popular among the Slytherins while younger
- Fourth year, Harry and Pansy began dating
- After Voldemort is resurrected, and Harry refuses his offer to join him, Draco/Pansy and others of Harry's Death Eater connected friends stop being friends/dating him
- The story at least went into 5th year

I think it was on ff.net--I may be wrong though.


** That sounds like linkffn(8666085) and the sequels. Unfortunately, it seems to be abandoned during the 6th year.

#+begin_quote
  (1/7) At Madam Malkin's, Harry Potter introduces himself to Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to help Harry navigate the bizarre, new wizarding world, and Harry accepts. While Harry finds magic to be strange and amazing, there is no class to teach Harry about the complexities of friendship and social life in Slytherin... AU, Slytherin!Harry.
