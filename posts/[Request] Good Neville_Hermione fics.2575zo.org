I've looked for this pairing on FF.net but came up empty handed (I know there are a few but mostly one-shots and/ or not very good).

It's not a popular pairing apparently but if anyone knows of a good fic anywhere on ze internets with this pairing, that would be awesome!


** I keep coming over here to see if anyone has suggested anything and I keep getting disappointed :(

*** I was actually wrong saying there are no goods ones on FF.net

I started reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] which seems to be a slow-paced Hermione/Neville with Harry and Ron starring as the ungrateful douche-bags.

Here's the details:

Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation By: Vera Rozalsky Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters. Rated: Fiction M - English - Drama/Romance - Hermione G., Neville L. - Chapters: 66 - Words: 329,854 - Reviews: 1,025 - Favs: 369 - Follows: 418 - Updated: Jan 7, 2013 - Published: Nov 27, 2009 - id: 5537755

**** Oh, sweet! Thanks. I will check it out. I'm currently reading a few other fics/ updating and working on my own, which is super time consuming, but I will definitely put this one on the list! Neville is my favorite, I can never get enough of him haha
