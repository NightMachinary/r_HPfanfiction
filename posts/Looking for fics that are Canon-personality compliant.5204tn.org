I have had enough of fics that make Snape the walking caricature of evil or a sex god, Dumbledore and Ron idiots and Hermione perfection brought to life.

They are all brilliant characters and do not deserve this treatment.

So does anyone know a fic where the characterisation is just pure perfection (all the characters, the above is just examples)

A bit allergic to H/Hr but otherwise everything and anything is fine.


** 90% of the reason I adore linkffn(magical relations) is because the characters are so true to their canon personalities!

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3693052/1/Back-Again-Harry]])

Certainly the most in character peggy sue out there. Hasn't been updated in awhile though, even if scheduled for this year. Awsome read.

Also, I wholeheartedly second Forging the Sword.

** Well, "Revelations" is pretty good.

Hermione is trying to teach herself Occulemency (and it should be noted, doing a very *bad* job at it) and accidentally views some of Luna's memories.

** linkffn(Grow Young with Me) This fic has the best characterization of the adult trio. An all around great fic, but the scenes with Harry interacting with Hermione or Ron are amazing.

linkffn(Forging the Sword) Ginny dies in the Chamber and it causes a large change in the characters, but they stay true to themselves.

linkffn(C'est La Vie) An alcoholic war-weary Harry is sent to a dimension where Neville is the BWL and Harry can get a shot at a life of peace. The characterization of the protagonist is a bit shit, but everyone else is amazing. Lily and James is alive, their son Harry is a git. Neville is best friends with Ron and Hermione. Snape and Lily have great interaction. This is my headcanon for some characters that we don't really get to see in canon.

**** Yes. Fanfiction is about writing /new/ stories. If you want to read canon crap you should go re-read the books.

But, this is my personal opinion- i'm not going to hate on you if you do want them.
