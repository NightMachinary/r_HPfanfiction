** I only know of one crack-fic that could partially fulfill your request: linkffn(4525496)

It's worth a read because it's the only story I know that features Harry beating TMR with a shovel. Smut isn't really my thing, but an Author's Note claims cloneserpents/serpentclone has a truly NC-17 version on their ficwad page.

*** Serpentsclone's ficwad only had the Sword of Gryffindor story. The other way doesn't have a page at all.

Edit: Apparently ffnbot can handle this as well so linkffa(Lord Potter and Lady Bones).

  My unique take on a Harry/Susan story.  Takes place the summer before sixth year, with Susan taking the mantel of Lady Bones, she must make some difficult decsions that involve Harry as well, only time will tell how their decsions will change the world.

***** Pshaw. I laugh at the incest. It's everything else in that fic that pisses me off. They couldn't even spell Lily correctly...
