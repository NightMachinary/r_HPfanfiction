Hello! I am looking for any fics in which Harry has a younger mindset, acts younger than what he is, due to his childhood. I always enjoy him getting adopted, and someone caring for him. To clarify I am not looking for young or pre-Hogwarts Harry. Preferably the fic takes place in his first year or above. Any suggestions welcome!


** Harry is taken in by a kinder Snape and he's definitely more cheerful and light-hearted in linkffn(The Best Revenge)

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
