Evanesco is an absurdly powerful spell. It can send things into nothingness. So far, the only fanfic that I've read that uses it at anything more than a handy spell to get rid of trash is the Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] If anybody has read a fic that uses it, let me know


** The general idea seems to be that it gets more difficult to do the more complex an item is. Vanishing a spilled drink or a bunch of paper, easy. Vanishing a stopwatch, or a magical item? Harder.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7779108/11/The-Master-of-Death]] has vanishing used in combat. Vanishing heads is used.

As an aside, I would like to point out that it takes a whole test to vanish an iguana so canonically it's unlikely to be an effective combat spell. I believe some theories on canon magic also believe you can reconjure vanished objects out of non-being (though I have my own doubts).

** Yeah, a lot of mundane spells could have catastrophic consequences. You could wingardium leviosa a knife or a lovely big rock over someone's head and just drop it. Ron did a similar thing to a troll.

Splat.

** I read a recent story where Harry asked where vanished things go and Snape said this particular spell sends it to a certain volcano

  The things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, even if that involves a lot more form-filling, bickering, covert glancing, miscommunication, and flying furniture than we might expect.

** My headcanon is vanishing spell cobverts matter into energy. If the item was bigger then more energy would be released. So, it's dangerous to vanish bigger items.

** I've avoided using it in my fics since it seems overpowered. Can you imagine it in a duel? Vanish your opponent's body parts or wand, or the floor under their feet...
