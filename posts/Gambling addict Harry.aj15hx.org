I have recently started watching a gambling anime named Kakegurui and the protagonist is obsessed with thrills of betting itself without any regards to winning or losing even if it may mean losing her life(figuratively or literally). I am wondering if anyone has written a gambling addict Harry fanfic where he sweeps through Nocturne Alley and challenges asswipes like Voldemort or Malfoy just for the sake of gambling.


** There was a long one shot where Harry realized that British wizards didn't have anything like a casino, so he opens one up and basically becomes like a mob boss.

Thing about gambling stories is you gonna be really good at thinking outside the box. Gambling by itself it pretty boring to write. A writer would most likely have to reuse story lines or set up games similar to other series.

*** Yeah, which is why I am NOT writing something like that. I am not good at gambling.

**** Gambling really depends on the game and the usual game of choice is ' Poker'. When playing poker it less The Cards and Far more playing the Players. I can TOTALLY see Harry becoming addicted to reading people and the power that comes with that, less Legilimency and more 'He's a pusher, he pushes himself at work he bets big and wins, he doesn't seem to save much so he doesn't think long term. He is cold hearted and doesn't do things based around hope even when he bets big. He has the pair... But which pair'

***** I m actually more inclined of imagining cheerful but simultaneously callous Squib Harry being a master gambler who gambles not for money, not for game, but for the sheer joy of experiencing thrills. That would be a refreshing take instead of making him a legilimens..
