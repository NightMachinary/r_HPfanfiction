[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/43893][Tea]] is the best Snarry I've ever read, and maybe the best M-rated story in general. The love scenes are indescribable. Anyone know of similar stories? I'd just like mine to be true to characters, no mpreg or kinky stuff, slow-burning and passionate, secretive is always good too.

As an aside, does anyone remember a RemusxSirius that wasn't on fanction.net that involved Sirius magicking the basement of his house into a vast grassy field so wolf remus and sirius could hang out there together during transformation? also had remus moved in with sirius and in love with him but sirius doesn't know at first and eventually gets the hint.


** Have you read [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][If You Are Prepared]]? Long, with plenty of angst - but it has its funny parts too.

*** it looks promising, but...i have this huge aversion to fics written in first person. i wish i could get over that...but since hp was in third person stories written like that just seem more real to me.
