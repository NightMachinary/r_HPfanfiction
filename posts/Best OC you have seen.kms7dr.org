It doesn't have to be the MC. Or even in a good story. What character truly stayed with you so much that you wished he/she were in canon? What about the character made that impression? Plus if you remember the story where you found him/her.


** 1. Calista Snape from linkffn(Always in Your Shadow:Calista Snape Volume I) and sequels is the most detailed OC in the fandom. Around 1M words of what amounts to a detailed character study from age 6 to post-Hogwarts. Follows canon plot with mc 5 years older than Harry. Interaction with the trio is minimal. The story heavily focuses on OC's relation with her father and recovery from childhood abuse/torture with pairings later on in the series.

2. Guinevere Weasley & Co from Linkao3(Rose Petal Red): Not your typical SI fic with tons of original worldbuilding. An entire year full of Slytherin!OC's with their own backstories and interactions. See also a unique and complete Dark!AU of this fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14154777/chapters/69533256]]

3. Amalia Gray from linkffn(Monster by Phoenyx634) is a slightly OP OC with an innovative backstory. It is rare to see a character interact with Riddle on equal footing. Highly recommend.

It is difficult to find well-constructed male OC'S any recs?

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]

  A realistic Snape's daughter story. Severus Snape discovers he has a daughter, born of a brief affair with Bellatrix Lestrange. First, a journey to reach the frightened, emotionally damaged child, and then a full-blown mental war, as Bellatrix manages to possess the girl from her cell in Azkaban. Among other things, an in-depth exploration of Occlumency. AU, in-character Snape.

** Kitty from "Behind blue eyes" of elmembrila.

I know the name "Kitty" might not be the best (it's not her actual name but it's still a bit cringe worthy in the beginning), but she's honestly the first OC I ever cared about. The first two or three chapters of the fic aren't the best, and pairing is Harry/OC so if you like Hinny be warned, but her character has such an amazing growth throughout the fic it's amazing. By the end of the fic I cared more about her well being then pretty much anyone but Harry and Tonks.

It is an Angst fest of a fic, so be warned about that too, I think I stopped reading angst for abouth 2 months after I finished this fic.

Bonus points because it's got a great struggling Tonks trying to make her way in a world that doesn't exactly care about her.

Harry's development is amazing, as is his way of moving on from Sirius' death.

Calypso is your A typical grandaughter of a semi evil old man think Arcturus Black. He involves her in her schemes and shes super smart! Also good at the dark arts. Harry falls in love with her but because the way her grandfather is pulling the strings you never know if shes really into him or into being with harry potter the boy who lived. She teaches him dark magic and theres class projects. She is mostly a protect the family secrets kinda girl but she wants love maybe and uses him. Its not really romantic and everything is on edge cause a potter is hanging out with a rosier and she uses him big time in the story
