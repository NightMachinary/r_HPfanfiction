I stumbled over this fic several times (often when looking for Harry/Luna fics) - but the summary didn't actually tell me much, other than “nothing for your romantic mood“, so I ignored it.

How right I was. This trilogy is not your average romance fic, super!harry wanking or story rehash with abit of character bashing. This story is one of those few fics that transform the HP universe into something completely different and actually succed in making the world interesting, and not just weird additions that actually have no influence on the story. And I also understand now why the summary is the way it is: the story has elements that would make most people run away screaming, because of how cliche the subgenre is.

I'll try to write a summary of my own because of this, hoping to convince some people who do not know about this story yet, or have ignored it like me, to rectify this mistake.

“When Harry Potter enters the magical world, it quickly becomes clear that magic isn't the only thing different from the muggle world. An matriarchal government, dark traditions and dangerous conspiracies soon are least of his problems. A dark AU story with strong character development, which incorporates normally overused elements like prophecies, special magic abilities and relationships with multiple partners in such refreshing new/unique ways, that judging the story by its tags wont do it justice.“

Personal recommendation

4.2/5 score on the “I need to assign a numerical measurement of enjoyment“-scale.


** I'm reluctant to read this since the author always makes terrible things happen to his characters. It's a bit too grimdark for me. Then again, this gets recommended a lot, and it is complete...

*** It descends into nothing but torture porn at times for no real reason. They don't advance the plot or anything.

There are some really great things about this story, but I wish I hadn't read it, was too dark.

** The ending really soured the trilogy for me, but overall it was a good read, and I'm generally a fan of the author's work.

When I say 'the ending,' mind, I mean in terms of character rather than plot. The plot was tied up well, but the final actions and decisions of some characters (Hermione, mainly) didn't sit well.

**** It's more that, honestly, if it was going to devolve back into a monogamous relationship, I'd rather it have been H/Hr than H/L, but I go into harem fics expecting them to be, you know, one big happy harem, so it was disappointing. So was what seemed to be the sort of inherent selfishness of Aethers; I'd have loved for it to have been H/L/Hr in the end.

I supposed I have Four Founders for happy harems, though.

Based on your post hopefully lookuped my back up of HP stories for 'Four Founders' - was disappointed to see I already tagged it as "Overpowered_MC_Then_Babies"

***** Did you seriously just say that you think wanting to have a spouse to yourself and not be forced into having homosexual sex is selfish? And it didn't become a monogamous relationship, Astoria stayed, too. I find it really difficult to believe you got anywhere near the end of the first fic, never mind the third, thinking it was going to be a happy harem.

****** Hope springs eternal, and I just kept on hoping that they'd all somehow be happy at the end, alas.

Everyone's actions were in character, but it was still disappointing that that was how the author chose to write them.

I feel like I'm explaining myself really poorly, but basically: I wanted a happy harem, I didn't get one, it was disappointing. I feel like I read it just to see what happened than because I loved it; the worldbuilding grabbed me /way/ more than the characterisations.

******* Okay I'm gonna sound like a dick phrasing it this way, but I'm just flabergasted. Were you reading the same story as me? How the hell were you expecting any sort of happy ending at all? Nothing at all about that story says happy ending. Personally I thought it was perfect. Sad and horrible emotionally (not gonna lie, i shed some tears) but fitting for the story.

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

*** The problem with really calling it a harem and expecting it to have a happy ending was that being in a multiple wives situation was forced by plot and the AU world they lived in. It was the only way to gain any social standing.
