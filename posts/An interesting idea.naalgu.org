Not really sure where this idea came from, but are there any Harry Potter / SCP foundation crossovers? I've never read any but was wondering if any existed


** I've seen people bring it up in comments but I don't think I've ever actually seen a fic

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
