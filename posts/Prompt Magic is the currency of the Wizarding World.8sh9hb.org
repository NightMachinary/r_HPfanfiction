Okay, so this was an idea I got after watching In Time, a movie where everyone stops aging at 25 but only has a limited amount of time to live. Time is the currency, used to buy food, goods, pay utilities and rent, and even act as fuel. So what if this was translated into the Wizarding world?

After leaving Hogwarts, students start to drain their reserves. By working, they earn magic to use. This could also make a good magical cores fic. People born to parents with large cores get to live longer. Aurors are subsidised to use magic in combat. The Unforgivables are legal because basically only the very rich can afford to use them.

Thoughts?


** *Ollivander:* Here is your new wand Ms. Periwinkle . That will be three Fire Conjuring Spells, one Severing Charm, and lets round it down to two Dancing Feet Charms.

*Evelyn*: But Mr. Ollivander sir, I haven't learned how to do any magic yet to pay!

*Ollivander:* Well thats no good. Well, you can pay me off another way. Here, give me a true prophecy and we will call it even.

*Evelyn*: But I can't make a prophecy, I am not a seer!

*Ollivander*:....I didn't realize they were giving wands to squibs these days. All these dang welfare programs...

** Prompt-Magic as currency

Played straight as a F/SN crossover. Kinda drug-referencey if you squint a bit, so caution is advised.

Nobody knows why the world is as it is.

When a muggleborn enters the wizarding world, they go through Hogwarts, work throughout their lives, marry and have children at some stage and then settle down to watch their kids do the same. They're never entirely accepted into society, always looked down upon and treated like second class citizens for reasons nobody will ever explain to them. Then their half-blood child goes off to Hogwarts and a lot of the prejudice is gone. Not all of it, but a lot of it. Then they get working, get married, have kids too. Bear in mind that the muggleborn is still alive because 200 years is the average natural lifespan of a wizard and/or witch under poor circumstances.

And then, when their grandkid graduates and starts working, the grandparent, who's had to put up with what they saw as baseless bigotry and hatred for all their lives, finally finds out about why they're so hated.

That's when they find out about the pureblood curse.

Like my Hermione is doing now.

“Christ, Ron.” She whispers after she witnesses me buy a syringe full of prana from the apothecary for the price of a cheap wand. “Why didn't you tell me?” She asks in a pained voice.

“It's a curse Hermione.” I point out gently as I pull the surgical tubing tight around my left arm. “You just don't talk about curses like these in magical society because they tend to become worse as you talk about them. And it doesn't affect muggleborn or half-bloods anyway, so why tell them?”

“Then why are you showing me this now?” She demands, her wrinkles moving in time with her emotions.

Oh, but how I wish I didn't have to show her.

“Because Rose's youngest has just left Hogwarts.” I say as I slap the inside of my elbow, waiting for the vein to pop up. “And when he turns 21, he's going to have to start doing this if he doesn't want to end up a squib for life.” I point out. “And the more magic he uses, the more he's going to have to buy-and these shots don't come cheap, you know. So unless he works for the Ministry or for a Noble House of some description, he's going to end up shelling out dozens of galleons a year minimum on prana shots like this.”

And hundreds if he went for the top of the line Edelfeldt stuff, like his ancestors did before him.

My wife falls silent at that. “And?” She manages to ask through gritted teeth.

“And?” I retort incredulously. “Hermione, you're muggle-raised right?”

“Right.” She snorts out with a roll of her eyes.

“And what exactly would you have thought if our darling grandson had turned up on our doorstep looking like something the cat had dragged in, begging us for gold so that he could go buy a syringe full of glowing feel-good juice from a purebloods-only corner of the apothecary?”

Another heavy silence from Hermione's corner. I think I just broke Harry's record in rendering her speechless. Go Team Ron.

“You know me too well.” She grumbles.

“Yeah. Benefit of fifty years together, right?” I ask as I pull the plastic sleeve off the needle.

“Right.” She says, gazing out the window of the little corner booth of the apothecary we're in. “And you've done this ever since you were 21?” She asks.

“Yep.” I reply. “Though it's free for Aurors and ministry personnel who need it. Surprised they didn't brief you on that really.”

“This answers so many questions.”

“Like what?” I ask, wiping down the vein with a baby wipe.

“You know, questions like why we needed an economy in the first place. Or why every pureblood boy's club I've investigated had more in common with a methadone clinic than a muggle gentleman's club.” She says in that ‘I don't really care and I'm not really mad' tone she adopts when lulling her prey into a false sense of security.

“So you just thought that every one of your colleagues was a junkie and didn't let me in on the joke? For shame woman.” I banter as I double-check my handiwork.

“Stones and glass houses Weasley.” She mutters as she turns away.

“That's Granger-Weasley.” I say proudly before jamming the needle into my arm. “Now be patient, I'll be back in a minute.” I state as I press down on the plunger.

Just as the magic roaring through my veins reaches my brain and opens my mind to the endless expanses of the celestial voids, I can hear the voice of my wife mutter darkly:

“Harry is going to fucking freak.”

...Hey, something like this would give a lot more substance to Umbridge's claims about muggleborns stealing magic! If it were literally currency and there were common mechanisms for transferring it, of course it could be stolen!

** That reminds me a bit of the Black Prism series by Brent Weeks. Magic is color-based and called “drafting”. Each color has different properties and people can be monochromes---able to draft only one color---or polychromes---able to draft more than one. As the drafter uses their magic, color builds up in the irises of their eyes and they must eventually stop using magic. If they don't, they run the risk of “breaking the halo”, their iris, and can go mad. It's a pretty interesting example of awesome magic coming at a terrible price.

**** I wasn't able to finish the Night Angel trilogy--only got a bit into the second book. I really liked the first two of the Black Prism--super interesting magic system, political intrigue, interesting, likable characters ... but I've had the 3rd one since it came out and I've been halfway through it for a while. I'm kind of irritated because the focus is on characters and situations I'm not primarily interested in and the one I /am/ interested in is kind of stale right now. But, I'll push through. I think there are 4 books planned and I haven't heard any news about the 4th yet.

I did have a kind of "Squee!" moment--a couple of years ago at Emerald City Comic Con, I got to ask him a question about the magic system. And then between panels I got to chat a bit with Robin Hobb and managed to not pass out on the spot.

Another good one is the Darker Shade of Magic books by VE Schwab. I finished the first and I'm about to start the second.

***** Awesome, thanks for the break down! I might wait till the 4th is on the horizon before I touch them. Much like fanfic, I hate waiting for next installments and tend to stick with completed stories!

I have that problem with shifting haracyer focus too. It's the reason I'll never be able to make it through the Game of Thrones books.

I haven't heard of the Darker Shade of Magic. I'll have to look into it! Might have to be next on my reading list, thanks!

****** The good news is that the Darker Shade of Magic is complete! :D Ah, Game of Thrones. I adore it. I have them all on my iPad and my copies are so highlighted and full of notes it's embarrassing. I can't watch the show because it's too different and so I sit, gnashing my teeth as I wait for the next installment.

*** To what extent does Weeks' ‘drafting' overlap with Sanderson's allomancy? Are they similar in tone or is it just a surface similarity?

**** That's interesting. With allomancy, the metals must be consumed and not everyone can burn every metal and if you can burn it, you might only be able to push and not pull as in the case of steel.

With the color magic, most people must look at something that's the color they can draft, so a blue drafter must have a source of blue light---easy on the ocean, say, but maybe not so much in a shady forest. Most drafters use glasses with colored lenses. The sole exception is the Prism, who can draft all colors. So both need some sort of resource on hand. Drafters need the color source, allomancers need the metals.

Both stories have characters than can perform the ultimate magic---Vin in Mistborn and Gavin in Black Prism---but the way the magic functions is different. Both also have the notion that the type of resource one can use---metal or color---has an effect on the user's personality.

I would say there are similarities, but they're different in execution. Weeks has different characteristics for each color: blue is sturdy and good to build with, but relatively inflexible; green is more flexible than blue, but doesn't work as well on its own; yellow tends to be brittle and red can be sticky and volatile. Gavin, as the Prism is also a superchromat, rare in men, and is able to perceive many more finer gradations of color, so his yellow is always perfect, for example. It's really a cool system.
