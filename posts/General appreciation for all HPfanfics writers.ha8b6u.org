I'm a long-time HPfanfics reader and a new joiner in this sub, which boggle the mind because idek why I've wasted the past decade not discussing and reviewing my favorite fics and characterizations with the community.

I think one main reason is because sometimes I feel guilty. Because I never written one and never have a desire to do so and most of the time I didn't/couldn't even leave reviews because I don't have an account on AO3/FFnet and I'm too busy looking for the next good one.

I'm not sure why I started this post but this pandemic self-isolation made me a little bit raw inside and I saw that viral tweet about Gen-Z mocking Millennials about their HP obsession and the overall bad rep the fandom get for still caring so much about a series that have ended 13 (!!!) years ago --- it made me evaluate my own reasons for caring and I realized it's largely because of the fanfics I've read and I needed to show some form of appreciation for all the writers that I've ignored in the past.

I've read your words probably a thousand times more than I've read Rowling's. I grew up as a human and a reader with your words and consequently learn more about the characters in the books and about the people in my life better for it. I'm sorry most of you won't probably get to read this but thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I'm excited to explore more fanfics from this sub because I usually use character or ship filter to find one and I think I've missed out a lot on so many good ones, even after more than 10 years reading fanfics (my personal record is five days straight of reading with only essential breaks for food and shower --- I have an addiction problem).

I also welcome recommendations! Lately, I'm very into the trio dynamic as I'm missing all my friends and more interested to read about their friendship than romance but it's not mutually exclusive. I've searched up all variations of the trio keywords here in the past week so I probably have read most of the recommended ones (crying in Forging the Sword) but I'm still hopeful for hidden gems to will away hours of my time.

** That's really sad about Gen-Z (births 1997-2009), and I find that a bit weird, cause I'm Gen-Z (2001) and all my friends appreciate HP. I think the problem is more Gen Alpha (births 2010-2025), who were born after all the movies and books came out, so they never lived the HYPE that is HP.

HP books are the embers, imagination the spark, and fanfic the flames. The Harry Potter fandom is a bonfire that burns red, orange, green, purple.

*** I agree the problem is more Gen Alpha, but no-one really gets the boundaries so it all gets confused. For example, I'm sometimes put as millennial as I was born in the mid 90s. My suspicion is that it is the later part of Gen-Z and some of the older Gen Alpha's who are behind those memes.

I think where they missed the hype, they also missed the peak of the community and so to them it's 'just' books (and some fantastic ones have come out since). Back when you could find a booming group, landcomms to match any ships or interest. There were adulty adults writing fantastic books, young teens getting into disputes with each other about how they were better than other's their age. Dozens of active fanfic sites, plus some snailmail fic posting still going. I remember doing a sweet exchange with people form all over the world - I swapped with someone in the US.

Yup, I managed to get some highly coverted sweets I'd had in Canada plus some extra (red vines are way over hyped). My partner was in the USA and I accidentally spent way too much on pic'n'mix - so much the cashier kindly asked if I wanted to put the bag down and get less - and posted it off. It cost me an absolute fortune - pretty much everyone went over, except the one person who gushed over the box they received but never sent one out.

*** I'm Gen Z (2005), and I don't remember watching the movies or even knowing when they came out. But my mom introduced me to HP, and I read all the books at around 8/9 years old. The only reason I'm so into this fandom is probably because this is one of the few fandoms I'm in that has good fanfiction.

Httyd? No good fanfics. Narnia? Mostly the same few storyline, only a few epic ones. All the classics? No good fanfiction either.

I don't know why HP has such a large fandom and large quantity of fanfics, but it's awesome. There are so many different AUs to read, and even sticking to canon there's still so much good stuff.

*** “HP books are the embers, imagination the spark, and fanfic the flames”

I love this! The original Harry Potter books are great because they create a fantastic world and tell a good story, but there's so much room to expand upon that world and I think that's what caught people's imaginations and led to such a thriving fanfic community. Especially since Harry is an unreliable narrator so there aren't many canon limits to what's possible with magic.

Even with the mess she's making at the moment (both with Harry Potter stuff like CC and with non-hp stuff) I will always be grateful to JKR for giving us that world.

*** I am Gen-Z too(2001) and I read my first HP book when I was 11.

And I fell in love. My little 11 year old brain was blown away by the fact that such a world could exist. I became a voracious reader. Some of my best memories from my childhood came from HP. I have not yet found a better world or a better community.

After finishing all the books, I felt so sad. It was a bittersweet feeling, because the ending was so beautiful and I felt satisfied with it but I was sad, that I would never go back to this wonderful world that I found.

And then I found fanfiction. The rest as they say, is history. I still think that it simultaneously, it is one of the best and worst things to happen to me. I have a bit of an addiction, hehe.

Is HP perfect? Hell no. Just like anything that is created by a human, it has its flaws. There are plotholes, some characters aren't handled well, Dumbledore is a manipulative old geezer, Harry is a gullible child, etc, etc.

But despite it all, I have loved HP. And the fanfiction and the community that has sprung up. When I have kids someday, I am definitely gonna tell them all about this story that had enraptured me so much and entranced me so much. I just hope that they come to love it in the same way I did.

** I have a deep, deep dark confession to make.

I started reading HP fanfiction before I ever saw a movie or read the book. It was after a year of reading that I finally picked up the first book and started reading the series and shortly after, watching the movies.

I love HP, truly, but my love for HP fanfiction is much, much greater. I like how cannon played out but man I love seeing what people do in fanfiction. There's so many more options for you to read. If you didn't like something you could change it.

I write sometimes and would love to get back into it. I have so many ideas (who doesn't though?)

Sure sometimes I get an item of my house. But now who isn't collecting something? I'm not ashamed of it. But I wouldn't say I'm clinging to it or something.

JK Rowling made some statements that I personally disagree with but I can totally understand how some people would feel some deep hurt from it too. I don't think it's necessary a bad thing to express that hurt.

*** I laughed at the opening of your comment and I'm totally agree with you on the love for the fanfic.

For me, Rowling's influence on my feeling for HP ends with the release of the last book, maybe the last movie if I'm feeling gracious. The tidbits she sprinkled after often make me feel frustrated instead of delighted and I don't even want to get into her general personal opinion because of how greatly it differs with mine. It's not a bad thing at all for people to express that hurt, especially them that benefited the most from having HP to get through life.

  When Albus Severus and James Sirius mistakenly travel back to 1996, they seem to be hopelessly trapped in the past. That is, until a certain greasy-haired Potions Master finds them. This is NOT the classic "James and/or Fred II break a Time-Turner while fooling around" plot. This is a very different one and will NOT be focused on ALL the second-gen kids. Rated T for mild language.

** HP is what first got me into fanfiction, which then got me into writing. I've read countless fics that are better than some books I've read and writing is a huge creative outlet for me now. The community and fandom verse are a huge part of my life and honestly I kinda prefer the wizarding world that us fans have created to the actual books. I agree with someone above that purely from a reading standpoint the HP books don't rank that highly for me. But despite how much my fanfic reading has expanded over the years, I always fall back to HP from time to time.

Does a slightly expanded group count? Ginny is included from the start in the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series, and there are actually good in-story reasons for Draco to be around, too. He's still snarky and cutting, but since he has an older brother, his father deliberately conditioned him to become a Gryffindor, in order to have a bet each way. And he didn't tell Draco that he was doing it, but it worked in a twisted kind of way. Draco is quiet, and torn between his feelings and his family, but to Gryffindor he goes, and finds a measure of happiness in warmer and louder company, and he would no longer fit in Slytherin.

Note that not much of that happens in the first book, which is pre-Hogwarts (but it's an excellent read in its own right).
