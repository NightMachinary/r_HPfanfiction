:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
My fiancee asked for my help finding this and I have heard from her that Harry Potter fanfics are a dime-a-dozen so I hope you can help me find this. She said that Harry and Snape are captured by Belatrix and Snape is badly injured. Voldemort wants to kill him claim that Snape is his death eater to do as we wants. Harry stops him saying he is "drawn" to him/his mark and Voldemort make both Harry and Snape into his "war brides". I honestly don't know if it is a smutty fanfic or not, just that she found it on Wattpad. Any help finding this would be a big help and she would be super appreciative she said. Any ideas?

Edit: Found it. She is very grateful.
