** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7900250/1/Raindrops-on-Roses][Raindrops on Roses]] by Miss Saigon is my most favorite next generation fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] by Karmic Acumen. This fic has a dry start in the first chapter, but becomes a excellent epic later on.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. RW/SM. "drama, angst, love, happiness, action and brilliant story telling" - reviewer (Complete!)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]] by bennybear is a really good Draco centric fic that gives detailed accounts on the aftermath of the war for him. He is not paired with anyone either so that made me happy.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
