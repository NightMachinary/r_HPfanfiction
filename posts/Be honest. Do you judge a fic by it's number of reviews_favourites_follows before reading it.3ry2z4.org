*** /Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of/ [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=squick&defid=454728][*/squick/*]] :

--------------

#+begin_quote

  1. Noun. The physical sense of repulsion upon encountering a concept or situation one finds disgusting.

  2. Noun. A situation or concept which engenders this reaction.

  3. Verb, transitive. To cause someone to have this reaction.

  4. Verb, intransitive. To experience this reaction.

  The concept of the "squick" differs from the concept of "disgust" in that "squick" refers purely to the physical sensation of repulsion, and does not imply a moral component.

  Stating that something is "disgusting" implies a judgement that it is bad or wrong. Stating that something "squicks you" is merely an observation of your reaction to it, but does not imply a judgement that such a thing is universally wrong.

  The statement "kiddie porn squicks me" and "kiddie porn disgusts me" may both be true. In my case, the second sentence is true, and I assume that the first is also true, but, having never encountered it, I have no way of knowing for sure.

  In general, distinguishing between "squick" and "disgust" is an important part of living in a tolerant society.

  It is my contention that most anti-gay attitudes, for instance, are the result of people finding that gay sex squicks them -- and, because they don't know about the concept of the "squick", they assume that gay sex DISGUSTS them, which implies that there is something morally objectionable about it.

** Word count per chapter is pretty much my first criteria. You can't put enough love and care into a chapter below 2k. It just doesn't feel right.

After that it's a tie between pairing/characters and summary. I usually block Draco and Snape on ffnet and the majority of the rest of the dark characters if I'm using the Scryer in which case I block other keywords like mpreg, slash, WBWL, and a couple other keywords if I think of them. I already know I'm not going to be interested in stories with those summaries, so it's easier to just have them not show up at all. Also any mention of bashing (whether they say "no bashing" or "heavy bashing") is usually a skip.

Like most of the other people I simply don't care about reviews unless it's like below five per chapter with five or more chapters which is usually indicative of a bad plot. People just care so little about the story that they don't even comment on grammar and spelling. On the flip side, I'm generally hesitant to follow a story with huge amounts of reviews per chapter as, like at least one other person said, it's usually herd mentality and cliche ridden.

Lastly is the publish date, at least for incomplete or new stories. Less than 5k words a month, or if the story is a couple years old and doesn't have consistent chapters, I have no illusions that it'll be completed any time soon if ever.

Needless to say I read very few new fics.

The fact the large majority of OCs are female author inserts Mary-Sues means the quality of the story is not going to be great. There are some good fics with less then 2K per chapter, normally they update much faster then those with >2K per chapter. I think some writers tend to use the next chapter as a scene break.

***** This seems completely arbitrary. My oldest story (written in 2009) only just crossed the 2k favs marks and it has 1.5 /million/ views. I just checked, and there's only 1058 fics that actually fit that criteria (42 pages + 8).

I can safely say that the vast majority of those are either super old and haven't held up well with age (NoFP, Summer of Change), are genre staples that people bandwagon onto (Delende Est, ABC, TLIL, HP&BWL, etc), are stories involving pairings I won't touch (any slash, HG/SS, HG/DM, etc). Or, they're just outright bad (Poison Pen, Harry Crow, HPMOR.)

I think it's pretty safe to say that there are far more quality stories with less than 2k favs than there are with more. Like, Ectomancer just barely meets your criteria and that story is amazing, but stuff like The Unforgiving Minute, Incorruptible: the Dementor's Stigma, By the Divining Light, and Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod don't make your list. And you'd never come across something like Resurrexit which is a pretty new story of very high quality.

** It's what I sort by but I don't pay it much attention if that makes sense.

It has to be said that reviews on ffn are utterly worthless for judging worther a story is good or not.

** I usually order by favourites and/or recently updated, but I never actually bother looking at the fav/follow/review counts.

I generally judge by summary (which seems fine) and title (which seems pretty stupid but I can't help it).

** I don't. There are two main things that will put me off even considering reading the story: 1) bad grammar in the summary, and 2) any story where each chapter is less than 1,000 words!

** I try not to, but it really does help in filtering out crap. On the other hand, it's not foolproof, as some good fics have few reviews, and some bad ones have a bunch.

** I do take it in consideration but leave immediately if the first few paragraphs are written poorly

Ultimately I choose to look at stories based off what I'm interested at the time. Even if other types of stories (next-gen, Harry/Ginny, etc) stories are written really well at any certain time I will only be looking for a certain type based off my mood, and from there will pretty much read through summaries/starts and decide. But I will be more inclined to check out a story if it is popular

** No. I entered fandom through LiveJournal, which at the time offered a wealth of fests and communities and pairing-centric archives to help guide me. I latched onto favorite authors, friended their journals, volunteered as a beta, wrote recs for reccing communities, and kept tabs on stories I liked. I can usually spot within the first couple of paragraphs the kinds of errors or inadequacies in a fic that throw me out. And content warnings are also useful, because it lets me filter anything too fluffy, mpreg, bashing, etc.

I didn't really pay much attention to FFN, and it wasn't until AO3 became a major archive that I noticed the tyranny of kudos and review counts (especially because, for whatever reason, a lot of people are hesitant to leave comments at AO3, which skews statistics). My experience of scanning the top 20 - 40 titles for my favorite pairing tells me that my tastes don't really run parallel to the majority of fandom.

** I use to do that before but not much anymore. Now I just judge it by the summary and the pairing (if there is one) but then if I start reading it and the author does obnoxious author notes in the middle of the story and it drops the story out of sync, I stop reading it because its annoying and not very good writing style. Nothing is more annoying then that.

** (This is all for FFN)

Nope. I judge it by its word count and summary (+whether it's complete or not). With favs/reviews/follows the same, I'll pick something 200k words over something 10k words. I've found some great 100k+ works with less than 100 reviews before.

Number of reviews doesn't really mean anything, other than a bunch of people read it. It could be 3000 people asking for an update or saying it's trash or pointing out spelling errors. I'm not gonna go click on the reviews because of spoilers if I *am* interested.

Number of followers doesn't mean much, because a story could go massively downhill halfway through.

Number of favorites is a little more reliable, but even still that requires people to actually log in so already it'll be a lower number, and honestly everyone has different tastes. Something one person loves I might absolutely hate.

** I mainly read stories advertised here or at DLP.

But sometimes there comes an urge to download some random stories on my kindle. Then my criteria are like this:

- Completed.

- Language: German / English.

- Sort by Favourites.

And THEN I start reading the summaries to choose seemingly good fics.

Probably not the best process and too relying on other peoples favouriting-habit but it's the best I've got so far...
