Maybe a wrong boy who lived story. Where Neville is actually James and lily's second son, and maybe harry is presumed dead?

Maybe Neville was absent Halloween 1981?

Maybe Sirius took harry and the longbottoms/Augusta took neville?

Maybe due to Voldemort going to attack the potters he convinced the potters to have the two boys separate? One with longbottoms one at godrics?

Idc about pairings mostly as long as there's no death eater whitewashing and NO ron/hermione.

Also please no Dumbledore bashing or lordship/family magic.
