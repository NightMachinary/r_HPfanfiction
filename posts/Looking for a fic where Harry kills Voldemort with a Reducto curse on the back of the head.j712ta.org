:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Read it once and can't seem to find it again. It's a fic where in the final battle Voldemort is distracted dueling Dumbledore, and Harry hits him in the back of the head with a reducto killing him. Dumbledore gets gobsmacked with how easy it was to kill Voldemort, all his years of complex plans were completely unnecessary in the end.

Memory it's a bit vague here, but I think it was one of those "Harry goes back in time" fics, that's how Harry knew what to do to end it all easy.

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
