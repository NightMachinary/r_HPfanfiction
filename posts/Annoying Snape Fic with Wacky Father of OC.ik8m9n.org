:END:
Ok, this might be more relevant to those that remember 101 Ways to Annoy Severus Snape, but there is a take on that list that I have longed to re-read but have no idea what it's called. Female OC decides to annoy Snape for a whole year. May or may not be distantly related to Dumbledore and her father is even more insane than her. Features scenes where the OC guesses Snape's embarrassing middle name (Alfredo?) and where Snape is forced into a diet (kind of touching bit where he's pitied and allowed dark chocolate). Sequel includes (for some reason) Snape staying at her and her dad's house for the summer.

Is there any hope for me?


** Ugh, I remember this fic. Now I'm going to be trying to remember all night...
