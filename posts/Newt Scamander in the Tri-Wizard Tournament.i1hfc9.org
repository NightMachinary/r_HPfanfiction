He would 100% win! Whatever creature they gave in the first task would end up in his case or as his new best friend. The mermaids would because his staunchest allies after the 2nd task and he would just view the final task as a way to make more friends. The whole time he would be talking to the Daily Prophet and insulting the organizers of the tournament for “putting such majestic creatures in danger.” I would read this fic.


** He would die after 2nd task, the article would read "100 year old man dies of cold after being subjected to swim in Lake for an hour"

*** HP wizards are ridiculously healthy even in advanced age. Dumbledore in HBP shows this clearly.

And he wasn't the exception. In Deathly Hallows Harry meets some elderly lady who was over 100 at the wedding. But she moved like someone far far younger.

****** I don't say he absolutely can't, I say it it is not optimal for him. He might be very magically powerful, but he does not have a young man body, contrary to what some fics make you believe.

He doesn't go around running marathons on the book. He just stands and is awesome with limited movement.

******* Wizards stay quite healthy even in advanced age. While it has not been explicitely stated, it has been heavily implied in canon.

By the way, magic is allowed in the second task(can't believe I have to say this), so this whole conversation is pointless.

******** "Because magic" is not a solve it all argument.

Old people can be healthy and still not in athletic form. Magic does conserve Dumbledore to some point, but I would say that at his 100 he acts like a 50-60 man in good health. You would still wouldn't throw a 50-60 man into a lake.

Put him all the bubble heads and transfiguration you want. He would still need to and swim in that lake. That's gotta be taxing.

In a real war scenario, Dumbledore would be awesome by circumventing the need to go into the lake. Being forced to do it is not the ideal scenario for his skills.

**** Hagrid always seemed to me as simply not understanding that the fact that his creatures not being so dangerous for him didn't translated to other people while Newt seemed to genuinely understand that others wouldn't have the experience or skill to interact safely with his creatures while also understanding that the creatures themselves might be more comfortable/safe having their own spaces.
