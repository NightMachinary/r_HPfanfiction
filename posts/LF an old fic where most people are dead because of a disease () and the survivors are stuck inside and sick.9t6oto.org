Hi ! I'm looking for a story I read several years ago on ff. It was an horror/psychological fanfiction.

I only remember that something happened that made going outside difficult, I think it was a disease or a gas. A lot of people died and the survivors are stuck inside a building or a base. They are the only left of the magical Britain or world. They are wounded either mentally or physically, like the disease/gas/whatever changed their behaviour and/or body, and made them sick. It could be muggle or magical changes. At some point there was a dementor that some kids discovered but kept secret, and they were killed by it, I think. I also remember a girl becoming pregnant with a dementor baby at some point, I don't remember sex scenes so I think the dementor took possession of the foetus.

Any help would be greatly appreciated ! I hope the story is still available somewhere. Thank you !
