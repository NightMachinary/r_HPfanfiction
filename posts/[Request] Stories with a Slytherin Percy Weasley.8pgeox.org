I don't mean that Percy acts Slytherin or people call him Slytherin as an insult. I genuinely want Percy Weasley sorted into Slytherin House and it being a main part of the fic

etc

In book 2 Percy saves a Slytherin from Gryffindor attackers, the professors get involved and massive amounts of points are lost. Percy is brutally turned on by his house and transfers to Slytherin. He becomes a major supporter of Harry and his new status as Slytherin is important.

It's an old series, started a long time ago, the author rewrote the first four(?) books to bring them more in line with canon, but hasn't updated on book 6 in a while.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

  A tighter, more solid version of Y2. Not nearly as many drastic changes as in Y1, but a few things are different. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text where applicable.

** Hmm, there's a common one with Percy being sorted into Southern and befriending Pucey. Without giving the plot away I'm not a fan of it's pacing - too much of a time jump partway through. I'll see if I can find it though.

  COMPLETE. AU. Canon-inspired. Nearly eleven-year-old Percy's attempts to run away from home gets him far more than he'd ever bargained for. Encountering an Azkaban escapee, procuring an illness that brands him as dangerous by Ministry standards and being sorted into Slytherin, he tries to find his way back home again. DARK. Percy/Audrey endgame.

*** I think I've seen this one. I liked it a lot but then it jumped like 4 years and all the characters were different so I dropped it. I can't for the life of me remember what it was called.
