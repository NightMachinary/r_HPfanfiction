Anyone have any recommendations for some stories set after the Cursed Child? I really like the characterisations of James Albus and Lily in that and a lot of fics I've been finding were written before so the characters act completely differently. Not looking for anything particularly specific after that!

I just finished Put Your Guns Away it's Tea Time and it's sequel which were both absolutely fantastic! Anything along those lines?

linkffn(12096051) - it's something I'd highly recommend to anyone!

EDIT: whoops! Didn't realise safari had autocorrect...


** The same author from "Put Your Guns Away, It's Tea Time" is writing a sequel to those two fics [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9125506/chapters/21193490][here]] in which the Potter kids are in their 20s.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/556723][The Quietly Series]] focuses on Albus' and Scorpius' developing relationship, and the troubles both characters face at Hogwarts and afterwards.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/526537][Scorbus Arc]] focuses on some lgbt themes, and also deals with Albus/Scorpius after Cursed Child.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/torestoreamends/pseuds/torestoreamends][torestoreamends]] writes some good Albus/Scorpius, some dealing with events after Cursed Child.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8445304][Hallow's Eve (One Year Later)]] is a oneshot that focuses on Harry and Albus bonding.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.
