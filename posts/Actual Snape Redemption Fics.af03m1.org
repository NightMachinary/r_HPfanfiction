Hey! I was wondering if anyone knew of any fics with a Snape who actually undergoes the character growth for a redemption without either making the entire fic a snape whomp fest where he never actually did anything wrong or a snape shit fest where super MC harry only makes him face his shitty actions as part of a humiliation plot or something?

I really like the idea of his character, and would enjoy an actual redemption arc, but somehow I only seem to find either super apologetic fics that downplay stuff like his bullying Neville slash the whole creepy mess with Lily (or rewrite history entirely to make it so he just didn't do those things, or didn't do them as portrayed in canon, or did them but it totally wasn't his fault^{TM} or super anti-snape fics that read like author power fantasies or something.

Anyone got any recommendations?


** Does post-death redemption count? I really love Snape and actually feel sorry for him in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6329597/1/Snape-s-Memories][Snape's Memories]] and it's sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679130/1/Severus-Dreams][Severus' Dreams]]

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the problem of potions by wyste) It follows canon mostly, but I felt like he developed into a better person in it without being OOC.

I believe this one fits as well, although it has been a while since I can read it so I can't remember the details of it too well:

linkffn(Come Once Again and Love Me by laventadorn)

These post war AU's also have redemption storylines without making him really OOC:

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Voldemort is dead but Harry Potter's problems are far from over. Indeed, the very day after the battle, Harry Potter looks into a mirror and finds himself staring at a stranger and an old secret is brought to light. And what does this have to do with Severus Snape, still alive (unfortunately, as far as Snape is concerned) after being dragged out of the Shrieking Shack?

  Severus wakes up in the afterlife expecting something rather different than being almost-seventeen again. Seriously, what kind of game is this? But wait - Lily's come back, too - from 1981? Perhaps it's a second chance... but to do what? SS/LE

  What if Snape survived the final battle, but his innocence was not discovered? Epilogue: He sighed, and said slowly, “I would prefer to hear that... that Voldemort... does not have control over anything anymore, not even a single person's life.”

*** Problem of Potions is great. Very in-character Snape (and Draco), lots of laughs without being properly crack. It follows canon a bit closely, but the author writes well enough to get away with it. Sequel is in progress.
