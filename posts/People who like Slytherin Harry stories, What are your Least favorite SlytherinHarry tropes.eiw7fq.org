Big fan of Slytherin Harry myself and since I'm working on a fic for it, I got curious about other people's pet peeves with it.

Mine are

1. when all the first years are amazingly adept at political maneuvering, especially when they outwit students several years their senior.

2. Kids from dark families automatically know tons of dark magic even though they're only like 12

3. In the same vein, marriage arrangements. I don't care if in the fic it's not uncommon in that universe, 11/12/13 year olds should still be grossed out or resentful at being forced into a marriage

4. When there's no explanation for Harry being in Slytherin, a lot of authors change Harry's personality when he's in Slytherin but don't show/explain how or what caused the change. Whether it's a complex change where he had a completely different upbringing that changed his personality or something as simple as the sorting hat believing that Slytherin is best for him and overriding Harry's opinion.

5. The entire house automatically hating him. Voldemort is dead and has been for years and Slytherin is suppose to be filled with the ambitious students. I can see a few students wanting revenge, but not the majority of them. They were all kids/babies when Voldemort fell and since he's been gone for most of their lives I can't see them really being so invested in supporting Voldemort that they want to hurt an 11 year old kid. When he's older/Voldemort comes back it's different but when he's only a kid I think it's stupid.


** -Harry inexplicably always becoming friends with Hermione *and then using her to convince people like Malfoy of their wrongness*. I like Harry being able to change peoples minds but I hate this trope and it is so common.

- Weasley Bashing

-Like you, I hate the inexplicable manipulation skills.

**** I'm not the person you replied to, but I think it's ok if they become friends as long as it doesn't happen really early on. There needs to be some sort of legitimate reason for the friendship, and Hermione needs to be initially wary because of the inter-house rivalry. I imagine Hermione would be worried, spurred on by the rest of her house, that Harry was secretly another Draco Malfoy, just waiting to hurt her or use her.

#+end_quote

​

Eh, if you are doing a straight Harry-got-sorted-into-Slytherin story, I don't see any major problems with either Ron or Hermione:

Ron: Year 1 Harry was certainly clingy to friendships, so its easy to see why he would try to be friends with the kid who befriended him on the Train, even if Ron is confused/hard to deal with the house split. Now you could easily write it as Ron breaking off that friendship, but an in character Harry would hold onto it?

Hermione: The same events as in cannon could easily happen (Harry observing/hearing about Ron teasing Hermione and her running off), and cannon Harry would still go after her regardless of what house he was in.

And independent of the house thing, it is always kinda... weird when authors write different introduction scenarios for Hermione/Ron. They both seem pretty much.. up to chance, so why when they have a completely different introduction do they always end up the same? I mean, if you are going to have Harry have a wizard/witch move next door, why is it always Hermione instead of someone like say, Dean?

And usually fics that put Harry in a new house don't want a Harry/Ron friendship. Plus it is pretty easy to cast Ron as not continuing a friendship outside his house. But Cannon Harry certainly would. At least if he was in Ravenclaw or Slytherin. Maybe Hufflepuff he would have enough friendly contact that he wouldn't hold onto his first contact quite as much. Maybe.

There was a thread the other day that called Draco obnoxious, arrogant, without a thought to the consequences of his words or actions and I still believe Harry would be impulsive (at least with his words), sarcastic, and wear his heart on his sleeve. He'd really just be more manipulative.

I actually don't mind the 12 year olds knowing Dark spells and stuff. Not all of them mind you, but if Blaise is great with poisons and Nott knows his curses I'm fine with that.

*** Yeah, the Draco friendship is always weird, especially when Harry is a generally nice guy in the story but is somehow fine with being friends with a complete dick. One of the things I liked about the Sarcasm and Slytherin series is that Harry didn't start befriending Draco until 4th year and that was only because he had finally started to try being nicer.

Nice/mentor Snape is something I hate, usually bc authors end up ignoring how much of a dick he is to almost everyone once he starts to like Harry.

Tom Riddle 2.0 could be interesting, but most of the stories are just really poorly written, but I agree with you. I prefer stories where Harry doesn't go dark.

Gryffindor bashing is just ironic to me, especially when Harry still ends up friends with the twins/Hermione.

Hermione and Neville do make some sense, I think. Or they can be made to be so - he could run into both on the train, and depending on the background it's not hard for Harry to form a connection with them. I don't see how they make the 'least' sense of any Gryffindor?

I think a friendly Draco is a very easy one to achieve - in canon they got off on the wrong foot, but a Slytherin Harry seems easy to change that. But the /hard/ one is the combination of a friendly Draco and Hermione - that seems like the trickier one to have. For Snape, it's harder to say - I think it would be much harder for Snape to ignore Harry's difficulties when he's in Slytherin, along with his previous hardships. It's easy to do so when your entire interaction is in the potion classes - but if Snape does anything with his House, then it seems to me like he'd have to confront Harry differently over time. Might not be /nice/ exactly, but... IDK. I've always been partial to the take that if Snape had seen how Harry got treated by the Dursleys /before/ he'd set his opinion on him in stone, it'd have been a different story.

As someone said above, Harry didn't like Hermione until the troll and Slytherin Harry probably doesn't even know she's in the bathroom, but he's not running to save her regardless.

Actually, Slytherin!Harry can be simply canon!Harry who doesn't know of Slytherin's reputation and gets sorted before Malfoy, so he doesn't keep repeating "anywhere but Slytherin" in the sorting.

Slytherin would probably change him with time, but the troll is pretty early, so he can be very canon at that point - including run after Hermione.

Personally, I always got the feeling that canon Harry found her a bit annoying, but not too much - it was more Ron that didn't like her, and Harry was friends with Ron. Doesn't take much effort, in my view, to nudge their interaction on the train into the start of a friendship. Same with Neville, since she's already helping him at that point in canon.

It's not to say that it should be the default - but that it's rather easy to do believably.

#+begin_quote

Right, because that's how canon handles it. It wouldn't take much of an effort to have Harry respond more favorably or differently in their first interactions - and have it be a kind of neutrality at the start, from where friendship could grow. IMO a lot of their antagonism came from the first confrontation, mentally classifying each other as rivals, and then pushing it further and further.

If not in the train, he would have done it later. And Harry would, of course, reject the idea. You need to make a significant change to one or the other to avoid it.

Hagrid says something like, "Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," "There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't Slytherin."

Secondly, plenty of students in Harry's second year said he was a dark wizard because he could speak parseltongue. Ron says things like he wouldn't be in Slytherin if you paid him. Gryffindors would absolutely think Harry's a dark wizard in his second year if he was in Slytherin house.

** The main thing is that I read Slytherin!Harry to read about a /Slytherin/ Harry. So, you gotta change the Canon plot, and -- to the extent a character is defined by the actions he takes -- Harry's character. You don't /have/ to explain this (re: Your 4th point). If the premise of your story is "Harry is a different person, now here is what happens", that works just fine.

In all of which, to clarify, "Slytherin" is a shorthand for Think, Before You Act; Discretion Is The Better Part Of Valour; Nothing In Life Is Free; and a few appropriate themes more.

Consequently, the reverse is what annoys me most:

- Sticking to the Canon plot. Just to go through first year: Harry won't chase the Troll, won't make a scene over the Remembrall, won't smuggle a Dragon, /definitely/ won't go after the Stone -- not, at least, without a different motivation (say, for the last, he wants the Stone for himself). That qualifier, though, is no blanket pass: From an author's perspective, the entire point of making such a major change as Harry in Slytherin is to tell a different story. If you shoehorn all of Canon into it still, what is even the point?

- Tangential to that: If the author puts Harry into Slytherin, and then proceeds to "reform" Slytherin in the image of Gryffindor. Utterly pointless.

Everything else I'm pretty indifferent on. I enjoy miniature adults and scheming (if the author is competent at it, that is -- it's the usual problem, you need to be as clever as the characters you are writing ...), I enjoy kids being kids. I enjoy straight up selfish manipulative bastards and more reasonably tribe-loyalty kinds of characters.

I realise your pet peeves are just what you like and don't, however, just offer a counter-perspective, as your points 1, 2, 3 can be summarised as "they don't act their age": You can come up with somewhat plausible explanations in-story. Say, they are all forced to grow up early, because Slytherin is the house of old and traditional families, and 500 or 1000 years of combined magical ancestry and duty leave you no room to be a child. If you explore such angles earnestly, I think it can make for good plot; children being forced to grow up too fast is a sad thing, and yet, if there is no alternative, you have a powerful theme of a harsh reality that shatters dreams, of a struggle in a world that comes with so many privileges at first sight, but costs you so dearly in other ways.

*Edit:*

As for your last point -- if children actually /are/ children, account for the fact that children know infinite ways to be cruel, and at the same time lack the clear moral compass most adults have. One, two influential students hating Harry, peer pressure, group-think, a desire to be "cool" or at least to /not be that kid/ -- it's not a priori implausible that Harry is an outcast. Voldemort would be only part of the reason; Harry is a halfblood, has a Muggle background, doesn't fit in right away, perhaps ... you have the entire range of prejudice and children cruelty to play with, if you want.

Leaving aside the obivous ones you might have read, there were a few that stand out in certain ways. For instance, for a wonderfully insane character and character dynamics, and playing the Troll scene straight (Troll is there, Hermione is there, Harry is /not/ there, the end), the Malachite series by Lazov: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4798684/Lazov]]

Everybody also knows Sarcasm & Slytherin, but in terms of the appropriately tagged "Slytherins being Slytherins" (aka, everybody's scheming), I actually enjoy a different story by the same author more: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606]] . It's only first year, but fairly self-contained, so you aren't left hanging, (in my case) only wanting more.

If you're more interested in kids being kids, you might even be ahead of me, though; it's been a while since I searched for those. If you don't mind Fem!Harry, Victoria Potter fits, and other than that, also Certain Dark Things: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16940712]]

*Edit:* Oh, and the Chessmaster Series, especially if you /dislike/ Ron in a villain role: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/775506]]

For all of those (with the exception of VP, I guess, but then that's also fairly well-known) YMMV, because I like them for whatever aspect I enjoy, which allows me to ignore deficits elsewhere.

The next is the unwillingness to depart from canon ages. Part of the whole package of tropes that tends to come with these fics, as we all know, is the political/manipulative aspect of it. As you mention, it makes very little sense in 11-13 year olds. So just age up the kids to start at 14, and suddenly it makes a lot more sense - and makes the marriage contracts/arrangements workable (well, tbf, betrothal contracts arranged /by the families/ would make sense in an aristocratic society).

I do like the idea of the dark families knowing some dark magic, usually, and the same with the rich kids having already had some instruction on magic to give them a leg up.

Oh, here's another one - assuming that being sorted in a house is the foundation of one's personality and strengths. If doing a Slytherin house of schemers, not everyone should be good - or interested - at it. Some should be sneaky and cunning, sure - but they're still average overall. It's like how Hermione can be super sneaky and cunning, but is still a Griffindor, or how other various characters from houses display varied characteristics. Vary it up within Slytherin - yes, make it colder and rougher, but it doesn't have to feel ... weird. (And that extends to the other houses in those stories)

** I've seen occlumency training used as an explanation for advanced maturity, which can make sense in-universe. But you also then need a reason for occlumency being learnable at such a young age. I really really don't like the trope of "well wizards are lazy and just don't try" as an explanation of, well, anything, but particularly when it comes to learning magic. Especially since in these fics it's common for magical power and culture to be everything.

If wizards are lazy, it's laziness in physical exertion because they can do it with magic. Kinda like nowadays we're "lazy" because we drive cars instead of walk. If there is an obvious exploit in your interpretation of the magical system, it will have been exploited already until a counter was created. There is always a bell curve of ability and you need a jolly good reason to put your characters in the high end of it. If occlumency is your reason for your characters to be doing better than everyone else, then why isn't everyone else doing occlumency?

I think it's fundamentally a gripe about authors being lazy in world building power scales, though. To be fair, though, I do go a bit overboard and create graphs and spreadsheets and suites of measurement units to be able to calculate exactly how much any given character can do at a given point in their maturity. 🙄

There's a ton of different angles to come at population from. And the economics of the wizarding world is even more fraught with complexity. I'm still working on the economy, personally. Right now I'm more focused on the economy of magic itself, since I have a feudal-similar system for magical access. Hence the graphs, heh.

*** The easiest way out is to postulate an AU where purebloods /factually/ are better at magic. They can do Occlumency, others can't (or only later). Surprisingly, that is a fairly rare type of AU, though.

That aside I don't think it has to be laziness. It's the equivalent of children learning piano: If you got parents that drag your behind to lessons starting when you are five, then at 11, you will know /something/ about it. If you have no talent and no interest, it's a miserable, miserable time, but there will be results. And if those kinds of parents then typically are found in families in Slytherin (if nothing else, for the original reason: It's important to protect family secrets the kind of which your average family does not have), then the result is your above.

On the general point, I agree though, lazy authors and not thinking things through is annoying.

**** In mine purebloods have stronger magic but weaker bodies (due to inbreeding, though there are magical counters to many of the symptoms), put simply. And yeah, people tend to eschew such settings, likely because they want the pureblood ideology to be devoid of any conceivable defense. I think it's a better exploration of society for them to have a point, but a debatable one, and their solutions to it be equally divisive.

If occlumency is learnable at all by youngsters, and learnable enough to be able to protect against older thought-thieves, then yes, definitely. Upper-class parents would force their kids to learn it no matter how difficult it was. In my setting neither of those are true (in normal circumstances) but adults can put "thought locks" in their children's minds using their own occlumency to essentially keep family secrets in a safe despite the kids not knowing occlumency themselves. This means 11 year olds still act like 11 year olds, despite having state secrets in their heads.

Couldn't agree more. It's not as if the argument vanishes just because the facts are different. In fact, it only gets more interesting; it's a perfectly valid standpoint to advocate for more equality in the name of fairness, only, now this means people have to actually give up something, in order to achieve that. No-brainer obvious answers ("here is my patently unreasonable ideology that makes no sense, now let's debate this") on contrast are boring.

Which actually makes it super-annoying to read the same in reverse. I do very much enjoy the Sarcasm & Slytherin series, for instance, but like a few other stories, it has just that problem; with the tweaked background, whatever opinions the Slytherins have are perfectly reasonable, whereas the Ministry (or the "light side") isn't given a single good argument for their behaviour, it amounts to "it's dark, so there". That's not a nuanced debate, because you can't have one that way. One side makes sense. The other does not.

****** Oh yes, the classic "dark magic is only called that because of politics and cowardice and wussies" scene. 🙄 The 'light' side when it's called that seems to almost always be full of people scared of their own magic, obsessed about nonviolence, and idiotically manipulative. Whereas the 'black' side is just about honesty and the natural order of things and "really necromancy isn't all that bad." Even when the MC is 'gray' and doesn't agree with either side, just the whole light vs dark thing as a valid political categorization seems incredibly puerile and shallow. You can't have a civilized debate when people don't even agree on whether murder is right or wrong, which is fundamentally what a real dark vs light distinction would be.

Imo, and in my setting, everyone agrees dark arts are bad and dangerous (at least in public; there are of course those who secretly practice them, but they can't be proven to have done so). The political parties are groups like Dominatists, Separatists, Modernists, Traditionalists, and so on, who each take nuanced positions on key political questions like how the Statute should be enforced, what kinds of economic interactions can be permitted with muggles, what regulations on non-human magical beings should be in place, etcetera. When Voldemort became a Dark Lord, he was called such for various reasons, but primarily because he was apolitical and wanted to tear down the Ministry and civilization itself, ruling through power alone, without limits or hindrances. He wanted to become a god, and transcend morality and political squabbles. Which is an alluring prospect for a follower who craves anything the system isn't getting them. For a certain philosophical approach, his arguments have merit, even, making it that much more realistic and compelling.

** I'm the same, I hate child politic stories. It's hardly written well or believable enough.

I also don't like the manipulative Dumbledore trope. Too many Slytherin Harry's have Dumbledore as crazy for the greater good Dumbledore, and just no.

Marriage contracts, and Harems are one I largely dislike and stay away from. These are normally centered around Daphne Greengrass and the like, because of this, has made me wary to read any Harry/Daphne, even the ones that aren't marriage contracts/Harems. (If anyone knows of any really good Harry/Daphne, that either isn't the Ice Princess sterotype, or if it used, in a unquie/different way, let me know!)

I actually don't mind seeing the students hating Harry; but I'd rather it be the older students, like 5-7 years hating on Harry, though I hardly ever see it written well, it'd be so interesting seeing some of the older Slytherins hate Harry, and try to be cunning/sneaky in their way of hurting or getting rid of him (If anyone knows of any where the older years try to hurt or get rid of him, let me know!)

Harry becoming friends with Hermione... Just why? Each and every time, without fail. Look, I love Hermione, really I do; but I just want to scream whenever Harry is shown at the library, and strikes up a friendship with Hermione. Why not try and do something with the under used Slytherins? LIke Tracey, Theodore or something like that instead?

Weasley bashing. I love the Weasley family, they are my favorite family. But dang, it sucks when even if Ron isn't a main character, the author has to bash him. Just don't write him into the story, if you don't like him!

Harry ending up as super OP, or Super smart. Now Harry being a little more powerful, or slightly smarter than in canon is believable, but not Dumbledore levels of Powerful, not Hermione's level of smart.

I actually don't mind the younger years knowing dark magic, not all of them of course, make it believable. But knowing some isn't unbelievable to me. (I'd imagine that the trace isn't really a issue for children living in the Magical World).

*** There are plenty of those stories, though. The more interesting question is, how do you like your protagonist (Harry, usually) to react to that setting?

In structural terms, it's challenging to write a protagonist who rejects all of that. At a minimum, he has to arrange himself with the world he finds himself in, because -- if you want to stick with realism -- there is no chance whatsoever for one person to change all of that. Hence, if he tried, he'd fail, and failure is just not a satisfying story to read ("Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Here is the story of how he tried to reform the house -- and failed." ... urgh?) So he has to let the bigots be bigots, the racists be racists, keep his head down and try to carve out a niche for himself to exist in. Which would, actually, be a fairly (stereo)typical Slytherin character makeup and a definite fit, but on the other hand, a lot of people don't like that either, because it's "too passive". I don't agree, but I've seen those comments.

And the last way is to play it completely straight, that is, Harry acquiesces to his surroundings and becomes part of the "racist shithole".

Given those alternatives, it's usually more interesting to ignore the Canon black-and-white world and/or explain it with POV bias (do Death Eaters and Snape /really/ represent all Slytherin has to offer, or is the rest we aren't shown because Harry has no interest in it different?, Is there truly nothing more to pureblood ideology than mindless racism?, Etc.), because that leaves you room to create a type of conflict the protagonist can win, to a degree; and have it play out within Slytherin House, as opposed to Slytherin against the world.

  And the last way is to play it completely straight, that is, Harry acquiesces to his surroundings and becomes part of the "racist shithole".
#+end_quote

Now that I think about it, we could do with more fics in which Harry is a straight antagonist. Not an angsty anti-hero, not a sympathetic con artist, but an actual antagonist.

Why not a Harry who took after Vernon, who would take one look at Draco's brand new robes and Ron's hand-me-downs, and know whose friend he wanted to be? Who takes the easy way out, following Draco's lead in sneering at Gryffindors and bullying Muggleborns? Who exploits his name and BWL status to the hilt, thinking himself clever because he gets a lot for doing little? And. whose downfall at the hands of the real protagonist---Ron? Hermione? Neville?---the reader would cheer?

There could even be a redemption arc. When Voldemort returns, the party's over, and all his Slytherin friends turn out to have other priorities.

**** u/Hellstrike:

  There are plenty of those stories, though.
#+end_quote

I can think of one (Hail Odysseus), and that one bashes a lot of the good guys as well IIRC. A year too soon has Slytherins act cooly towards Harry, but does not put him against the whole house. Do you have any other examples?

#+begin_quote
  "Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Here is the story of how he tried to reform the house -- and failed." ... urgh?
#+end_quote

Why would he want to polish that turd though? The story would not be about Harry making changes, but Harry trying to survive in the house full with the children of Death Eaters. For realism's sake let's say that they leave him alone until year 4, or use Lily's protection to roast a few of them. After all, many initially believed that Harry had to be some kind of dark wizard because he defeated Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Death Eaters and Snape really represent all Slytherin has to offer, or is the rest we aren't shown because Harry has no interest in it different?
#+end_quote

I am fairly sure that Harry would have noticed someone calling Malfoy out, or a Slytherin begging to stay and fight Voldemort during the final battle. Hell, even someone giving him advise about Umbridge.

I mean, you could have a few of the background chars (Lilith Moon, the younger Carrow twins) friendly towards Harry, but that still leaves the "important" ones as antagonists and changes very little about the general state of things in Slytherin.

** 1. is awful just because its so easy to avoid. All you have to do is make Draco have a good impression instead of being stuck up and have Harry not meat Ron on the train. Even If Harry comes to not like being in Slytherin its too late after hes sorted anyway.

** •Harry being immediately hated by all the other people in Slytherin, and then after ”running around the lake and spell practice” for a month or so can beat everyone in the house one after the other in a duel because he discovered some cool ancient forgotten spells that are op

•11 year old political mastermind Honestly like come on this is absolutely ridiculous

•all that BS about Harry being completely immersed to all the traditions after reading a book or two in the leaky cauldron because he sure as hell wasn't going back to the Dursleys

•depending on the fic, MARRIAGE CONTRACTS GALORE AND LORDSHIPS IN THE MILLIONS, like who invented that trope

•discovers chamber of secrets, turns out Slytherin was a nice guy and the basilisk was to kill the muggles this is horrible in all fics but one linkffn(courage and cunning) mainly because Salazar is the main character

•”Harry mah boy you're going dark” it's ridiculous

• Ron absolutely hating Harry just because he's a Slytherin LIKE COME ON WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE LIKE SEVEN HOURS OF CHATTING TIME

•above is probably because he found a different compartment and started talking to some nicer people, Idk why it's always Daphne or Blaise or some other neutral Slytherin

I think this slipped partly into a trope rant but whatever

  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

** I tend to notice that in most Slytheri!Harry fanfics, Harry is depicted as more intelligent. Not just manipulative but also so smart that he can do all of his classes easily.

When I see a tag saying Intelligent!Harry and he's put in Slytherin, I never expect him to act like an adult or not act like a child. When it come to smarter Harry, I typically just want him to know a bit more about the wizarding world like the muggle-born students already do due to McGonagall taking them to Diagon Alley. I don't necessarily want him to be an 18 year old or older in an 11 year olds body.

But for Slytherin!Harry, it's like he's expected to have to be in politics and every move he makes is for a greater purpose or plan. First years range from 11-12, they don't have to think about politics and much stuff going on outside of school while at Hogwarts. So the usual tropes have become rather a turn off for reading generic Slytherin!Harry.

I love to see stories with Harry as a Slytherin, however I don't need him to be OP, manipulative, or adult-like just "survive" his time in the house.

** 2 and 5 are totally canonical, Malfoy & Snape are very advanced in the Dark Arts even as early as grade 2. as far as I am aware like most of the Slytherins have some family members as death eaters and they don't really like half-bloods too so...
