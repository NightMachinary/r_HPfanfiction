Actually I've been searching for hp fanfiction in which muggleborns go to Hogwarts, BUT their parents actually care about the safety of their childðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…I've searched so much but in the fanfictions I've read, their parents just don't care about what happens in Hogwarts or if they can trust an unknown boarding school in ScotlandðŸ˜„???? If anyone has got any suggestions please comment down below....I just want these fanfictions to feel realistic.Not saying that other fanfictions are not good or anything...but i just want to read something I can experienceðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…...
