-Something where Neville was the chosen one instead of Harry.

-Where Barty Crouch Jnr never joined the Death Eaters (maybe joined order/ministry)

-Novel length fics set after DH but not focusing on any next generation kids. OC's are a big plus.


** I can give you a novel-length story set fifty years after DH where the Next Gen kids are definitely not the focus. There are OC's, one of whom is the story's villain.

*** This is an awesome story, I read it a couple months ago or so. The villain is awesome, though their identity is slightly obvious early on in the story. Other than that, awesome story.

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] might be to your liking. It's 17k words and complete. Canon pairings.

  A mistake by a dying man drives Hermione to obsession as she seeks to unlock the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny.

** Definitely check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] series by greengecko for a novel length fic. It covers auror training and such and is beautifully written. Lots of OCs.
