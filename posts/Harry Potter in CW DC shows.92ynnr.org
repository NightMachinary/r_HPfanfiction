** There is Fanfiction but most of them is Harry having the exact same skillset as the main character so a lot of Harry on Lian Yu becoming a archer with Oliver or him getting struck by lightning and becoming a speedster, Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow are the least populated. Those that don't have him directly ripping someone's stuff usually have him playing a no heroic role with him being someone's Boyfriend (or girlfriend if gender bent) or Someone's kid and going to meet his real parent (usually father cause fuck James Potter apparently)
