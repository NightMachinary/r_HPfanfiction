#+TITLE: Is there any fic where Dumbledore was Sorted in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor and the consequences of it, even if we have no idea of the political climate at the time ? Just a Dumbledore who did as canon did but as a Slytherin, thus creating a different aura around him.

And because of that, Slytherin isn't considered evil, seeing as he defeated Grindewald, and is the same house as Voldemort, or if his choices, because he was a Slytherin changed Tom somehow ?

Just no slash.


** House affiliation barely even seems to matter outside of the school itself. How many people were even aware that Voldemort was a Slytherin, especially since his real name was known by so few? Sure, it spread around during Harry's time, but back then?

*** It might not matter in the way that you're thinking, but the way Slytherin alumni behave does change the perception of the house itself. Slytherin isn't viewed the way it is for no reason.

Then that influences which kids push for which house, which changes what kind of people come out of the house, which influences perceptions of the house, and so on and so forth.

So if Dumbledore was from that house - Slytherin, the house of the evil Death Eaters!... and the great nice wizard who fought them and defeated the previous Dark Lord. Hm.

** I'm not sure if it matters all that much - Dumbledore is a Gryffindor, but it's mentioned just once in the entire series.

His actions in the war against Grindelwald, his genius in Transfiguration and Alchemy and his efforts in the war against Voldemort have next to nothing to do with Gryffindor house as it is.

Voldemort was in Slytherin, but barely anyone in living memory knows of that fact. Albus does say that by the time he revealed himself as Voldemort, there was no one who could have identified Tom Riddle in him.

** Not sure about a Slytherin Dumbles, but I do know of a fic where Tom Riddle Jr was sorted into Gryffindor.
