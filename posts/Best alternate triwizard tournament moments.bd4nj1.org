Even though I'm having difficulty writing at the moment, I've been plotting out how I'm changing year four for darkness ascendant and I'm looking for stories that completely changed the events of the twt.


** If you want inspiration for different tasks for the champions to complete [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][Patron]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] have some good alternative tasks.

If you want canon tasks I have:

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and The Goblet of Fire]]

This one's on portkey, so make sure to download and view the html because the italics are broken on the site.

#+begin_quote
  What if it had been Hermione's name that the Goblet of Fire spat out? A complex spell cast one summer with the most innocent of intentions results in the Brightest Witch of her Age being entered into the Triwizard Tournament. How can she get out of this?
#+end_quote

the fourth book in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/][The Cupboard Series]] does some interesting things. I linked the first one because the canon divergence is enough for it to not make sense without reading the prior fics.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** No links, but I remember a fic where Harry tried to boost himself with runes. Cue Tournament, where one of tasks contains some kind of rune(!) pillars that "generate" persons evil counterpart which a contestant needs to defeat.

Harrys twin is absolutely immoral and more clever, and uses his knowledge to hack his pillar, disabling its safeties, so while for other participants it was safe and (moderately) easy, for Harry it was a matter of life and death.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] linkffn(3557725) - I really like how this fic used the idea of preliminary tasks to select a pool of entrants (the tournament stuff doesn't happen until chapter 13)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/918773][Games Almost Played]] linkao3(918773) is a bit of a strange fic, but I liked the alternate task it came up with.
