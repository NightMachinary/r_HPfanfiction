In the fic, there's two ways that Harry can go (he's not the time traveler), either Slytherin or Gryffindor, he'll still become friends with Ron, but not Hermione until later either way.

I really just want someone to choose between Slytherin and Gryffindor.


** It depends on Harry's goals and motivations.

A Harry who time travelled somewhat recklessly, without much of a plan, but only a desire to "do better this time", who wants to keep his old connections, or who may be uncomfortable with sleeping in the same room as several children of Death Eaters and possible future Death Eaters would lean strongly towards Gryffindor.

A Harry who has lots of things planned out, who wants to change the future by befriending Slytherins and changing their paths or who does not mind manipulating everybody for a better world may skew towards Slytherin.

*** Ah yes I agree, but Harry isn't the time traveler, he is but the second main protagonist, Draco is the time traveler, he didn't get sorted into Slytherin, so Ron wouldn't tell Harry about how bad a house Slytherin is, which is why he might get into Slytherin.

**** Well, the talks about Slytherin that influence Harry's decision happen /before/ the sorting. So, you have to think about how Draco's changed behaviour may have influenced those talks and if that could lead to Harry's "not Slythetin" wish to the hat.

Also, while the hat considered Slytherin for Harry, would it be what he'd choose for "mostly canon Harry"? honestly, the hat only mentioned Slytherin to Harry as soon aa the kid thought "not Slytherin". Only then he said that that house could make him great...

***** The hat says "slytherin could make you great" and Harry simply responds "I don't want to be great. I just want to be me".

** If you do Slytherin, please please avoid the common tropes. So no eleven year old politicians, or schemes, or quirky, smirky, sneery scoffs. Suffice it to say that "cunning and ambition" doesn't equal being a snob or even stunting your emotions to a nonexistent level.

Cunning means just that. You need to think quick, be witty, and always see the best way out of a situation. It doesn't mean you shouldn't get into those situations in the first place! All it means is that you can, for instance, leverage some meatshield friends to check out the forbidden corridor with. Preferrably slower than you, of course.

Ambition, likewise, means just that. An ambition for something. It does not have to be political, or even monetary - it could be an ambition to be the most powerful of them all, or the smartest or just the best. It could be to open a coffee shop, and having the drive to achieve that.

For example, if you do a canon divergence where Harry doesn't say "not slytherin", then don't suddenly turn him into a tightly controlled caricature. I've yet to see a truly plausible slytherin!harry persona.

*** I think it's hard to write a Slytherin!Harry in general - and the problem is canon!Slytherin, actually. Most of us who read fanfic are adults, and we criticize authors who write preteens as being super smart or political, but that's kind of what Slytherin /should/ be and isn't because really, how many in Harry's year are *actually* cunning or ambitious or clever? None of them deserve those accolades. And if someone wrote an 11-year-old Harry being /suuuuuuppper/ clever or cunning, it would feel weird...

Ambition is great though - a truly ambitious Harry would be lovely to see in fanfic...

**** I agree with both points, I have decided on keeping him in Gryffindor, but i'm most definitely going to write a Slytherin!Harry fic in the future.

Slytherin!Harry is a trope that I love, except for the stupid tropes, I especially hate the ones where they make an 11 year old Harry be more powerful than a fully grown Voldemort, it's impractical and there is absolutely no character development.

** In canon, the only reason Harry didn't go to Slytherin was 1) he met Malfoy at Diagon Alley and he reminded him too much of Dudley; and 2) Ron and Hagrid - his first two friends - told him Slytherin was evil.

If you remove those components in your time travel fic - Draco being nice at Madam Malkins - would be enough to put doubt on Harry even if Ron sat with him. If Draco did a better impression on the train, Harry would likely go to Slytherin.

I have a(n incomplete) time-travel Draco, and despite him in Slytherin and Harry in Gryffindor - Draco's canon dialogue is strangely geared to be helpful toward Harry at times if you change the tone.

That said, really decide on Draco's goals. I always find Draco in Gryffindor a much more interesting idea, since it parallels Sirius' story but with parents who actually care about him and have to reconcile what they care more about: Voldemort's ideologies or their family. Also, Ron and Draco in the same house? Draco and Neville and Hermione in the same house? What about Draco's childhood friends in Theo, Pansy, Greg, and Vincent? How would they take it? There's so much to work with there - as opposed to another Harry in Slytherin story!

*** really, you wouldn't even need to change how Draco/Ron/Hagrid act- just have Harry visit Diagon Alley at a different day/time so he doesn't meet Draco, accompanied by someone other than Hagrid, and then have him join a full compartment on the train or otherwise end up in a position where Ron doesn't sit with him.
