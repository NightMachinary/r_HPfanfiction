** I was just rereading HP and I noticed a scene when they are vanishing mice. The vanishing spell sends the object into non being, so essentially killing them. (doesn't seem to be a way to get them back either) I thought "okay mice, I guess muggles use mice in science class too"

But Hermione got so advanced that she moved on to kittens. KITTENS! HERMIONE WAS KILLING KITTENS! Cats are some of the most intelligent animals in HP and irl and they are my soft babies but that were just vanishing them like it was nothing.

Not to mention snakes and all manner of other animals. Almost like humans.

The amount of animal curelty in the books is tremendous. I am not even a vegan but I bet within a couple of years of going to Hogwarts I would be.

(And witches can turn a desk into a pig and back again, for example. Is that a real pig then? How does the pig feel? If she didn't turn it back could you kill it and eat it like a normal pig? These are the questions I need answers too.)

(Would it be less cruel to eat desk pig instead of one that was born?)

Anyway to answer your question, they wouldn't go wandless but only have unicorn hair and Phoenix feather wands. No killing dragons for their wand!

And I bet you can get most ingredients without killing the creature, like bleeding a dragon a bit instead of killing.

I personally would not kill any sentient plant unless someone needed it to save their life.

Wizards are cruel to house elves and goblins, so I guess it would be silly of me to expect them to care about plants....

***** The Seventh Horcrux explores the theme, although it's not a serious fic (and Hermione is a supporting character, it's Harry-centric). It does make salient points related to your comment that I think you'll appreciate, though that depends on your being able to read the fic and it's not everybody's cup of tea.

** Interesting question, but I don't think the one or two possibly-sentient plants (Whomping Willows, Mandrakes) should mean all magical plants are, any more than the existence of a few animated statues should make them default to the assumption that stone feels pain in the general case. Wood's fine.

As for wand core... I think it plausible that vegetal wand cores might be possible, though not necessarily as efficient or durable as the classic animal ones employed by Ollivander. Alternatively, we know from Fleur's wand (whose core is a hair from her Veela grandmother) that the hair of /sapient/ beings can be used as wand cores; I don't think vegans object to people giving a hair from their own head to other people.

***** The precise extent of Phoenixes' intelligence is unclear, but I don't think it's anything like a chicken's. At the very least as smart as a really bright (and well-trained) raptor bird, or Fawkes couldn't follow complex orders like "take the Sorting Hat down into the Chamber of Secrets and drop it within Harry Potter's grasp".

I think it very likely that Fawkes is as intelligent as Post Owls like Hedwig; perhaps more. And /that/ is very bright indeed; Owls understand English, by all appearances.

I don't know if we want all these birds to be /quite/ at human-level intelligence, but I'd say they're probably something like on par with a reasonably bright four-year-old child. Plenty discerning enough to intentionally give people feathers if they look like they want them and would use them for good purposes (recall that Phoenixes have some sort of magical moral-fiber-sensor).

Chickens allowed to exhibit natural behaviour hide and guard their eggs, it's pretty clear they don't generally want someone to take them.

** "Would an animal-core wand choose a vegan wizard?" And I think for cruelly or forcibly removed animal part cored wands, the answer would be no.

But wands aren't an industry, they're rather personally or crafted, so I think the ethics of the specific materials would be easy to research. "Ollivander, where does unicorn hair come from?"

If the vegan is as strict as [[http://veganfaq.blogspot.com/2008/02/are-feathers-and-shells-vegan.html][this one]], they would require a sentient creature to have consented to give its body part for wand core use. Otherwise it may be okay if the part was merely shed or came from a naturally deceased creature.

** people have touched on this in some nested comments, but the core of veganism for most people is consent. Ollivander says that Fawkes “gave” him the two feathers for Harry and Voldemort's wands; while it's possible that he was actually just taking them and phrased it oddly, I think most people interpret that as a consensual interaction. Unicorns could likely do the same, although we know less about their intelligence.

Harvesting discarded animal products is somewhat less clear, but most vegans I know are fine with it so long as it is clearly of no worth to the animal. Unicorn hair seems to be frequently gathered this way judging by Hagrid's collection.

Of the three cores Ollivander uses, only dragon heartstrings are clearly not vegan. They could be harvested ethically if dragons were capable of communicating a desire to gift their bodies after death, but judging by canon that doesn't seem likely.

also judging by canon, potions are a no go. ideological exemption to Snape's class, anyone?
