  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** These are in order of what fits the best, and some the fic descriptions I might have reused from a previous request.

linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn) It's on Hiatus, but the two people who wrote it says they will return. But still a good alternative, heavily inspired by C'est la Vie, but still has some really unique and interesting premises.

linkffn(Harry Potter & The Girl Who Lived by SilverAegis) isn't really that impressive or long, also abandoned. But it sparked a following of fanfictions to his fanfiction, severeal that will be on this list.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived by Agnostics Puppet) Is the complete spinoff of the previously mentioned original fanfiction. I think it's the only finished on this entire list... If you are going to read a SilverAegis spinoff, read this one. Tough it's probably the one you have already read.

linkffn(Harry Potter & The New Life by smaster28) is another SilverAegis spinoff. Though the original it was based off was erased from SilverAegis's account. (I think he erased it willingly)

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976
