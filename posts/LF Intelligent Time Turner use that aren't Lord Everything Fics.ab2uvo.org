Hermione was either an idiot, or it's an unexplained plothole with how badly the Time Turner was used. Asking McGonagall or Dumbledore for a place to sleep and asking for extra meals to use the Time Turner better. Doubling each day, including double meals, double sleep, and using the extra time to study, exercise or whatever, would be exactly how you use a Time Turner. She was also running late and having to run to get to classes on time, when she had access to Time Travel.

Are there any fics, outside of "Goblins give Harry Time Dilation/Time Turner to catch him up for Lord Everything so he can take his OWLs and NEWTs in a single summer and then marry Hermione as she's obviously the most beautiful character even if it's never mentioned in the Books and we're totally not Emma Watson fanboys" Cliche fics, that have proper Time Turner use.


** The issue with time turners is they age you faster which would be especially noticeable in the 11-17 age range when a lot of growth spurts happen. My issue with book 3 is why Hermione was given a time turner at all when students two years younger aren't even trusted with a broomstick. Yeah, there's a maturity difference between 11 and 13 years old, but there is also a huge difference between a time turner and a broomstick. It would make a lot more sense for a professor to be given control over a time turner and have Hermione go to them at specific times for supervised time turner use.

** linkffn(The Ambiguous Artifice) features excellent time travel use throughout the entire fic but to understand what's happening in this fic you need to read the first two in its series, starting from linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense).

  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.

** I believe that in linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) Harry haas a time turner and it's not something ridiculous. Sure he's powerful in it, but it's not from some overnifht timer turner montage.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** linkffn(Eclipse in the Sky) Though the use of a time-turner only happens about 800k words in, its one of the best logical uses while correcting but sticking to canon's idea of time travel. Its so well done that you get confused if you don't keep up with dates and hours that the author (who's a god in my eyes) puts when this shit starts to happen.

** In linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) Dumbledore gives Hermione a Time-Turner with the plan to train her for various tasks to help with the war but Hermione's turning goes way off course. It has adult Hermione/Snape in it, not much will-they-won't-they relationship drama but generally just a positive adult relationship.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
