:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember the title. In fact, the only scene I remember is the main character (which is an OC) is talking about the Wizarding World to her friend. It turns out that friend is J. K. Rowling. She went to Hogwarts, I think and experienced magic either during the books or the Marauders era. At the end, she and her friend are in the train and the OC made her friend swear not to tell anyone. That friend is JK Rowling. Anyone who can direct me back to that fanfic? Thanks!!!
