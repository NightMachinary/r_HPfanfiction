The relationship gets serious, and Erika wants Harry to meet her parents, and brother, who live in Romania.

PS: To clarify, Erika is just a name I came up with(not specifically based her on any character I know), but she's supposed to be Dracula's daughter. And her brother is a reference to Adrian/Alucard from Castlevania.

I imagined the Vlad and Lisa couple from the Castlevania series, but with Lisa alive(and immortal but not vampire, maybe PS), so they are still a happy family with a content Dracula(until British boy comes wanting to date his daughter).

The thing is Harry doesn't know anything(Erika is half-vampire so she can be in the sun) but wizarding people do. The Tepes name is kinda (in)famous.

You can go through this the more serious way of Harry wanting to date a half-vampire and having to deal with an overprotective father who distrusts humans, and having a more wholesome route. Can be crack-ish, or darker with Harry having to deal with heavy prejudice from many sides.

Just a plot bunny I have running around.

******* Mina Harker is the wife of Jonathan Harker, the protagonist (mostly) of the book Dracula. Dracula turns her into a vampire, sort of. In the original book, being vampirized is like an illness that gradually makes you waste away, but you don't become a vampire unless you actually die from it, which takes a fairly long time. Her husband and friends kill Dracula (and his brides) before she dies from it, freeing her from the curse.

Dracula bites her which causes her to have visions, leading the "hunting party". Now that I think about it, maybe that was an inspiration for Harry's mental connection to Voldemort.
