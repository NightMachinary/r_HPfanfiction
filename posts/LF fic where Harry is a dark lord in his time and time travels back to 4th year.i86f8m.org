:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember the fic had: - Dobby as a friend that also went back with Harry - was a Harry/Daphne pairing - Harry becomes Lord Slytherin - Harry was an established auror turned dark lord - bashing of Weasleys, Dumbledore and basically every character that he associated with and/or had a close relation with

Thanks in advance for your help


** You probably are referring to paid in blood by zaterra02. But apparently he deleted the story

**** No clue, it seems as if he changed/deleted his account now the pen name is "another none". Maybe he got tired of Fanfiction, who knows

***** That's a shame, to be honest. I really liked his stories. Fortunately, I still have a copy of Paid in Blood on my computer
