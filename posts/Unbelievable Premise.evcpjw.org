What fics have the most unbelievable, bullshit, wildly illogical premise (stretching canon like a cat held up under its front legs) that actually works? Y'know those fics where you read the summary and go "Um... what?" and then read the first chapter out of sheer, bloody, car-crash-tv curiousity, then look up and realise it's been six hours and you've just read two million words on someone's weird headcanon of how Snape ran a spin class for cash between his second and third years when he needed to make a potion for his dying (now dead) cat? Or how Narcissa Malfoy once got kidnapped by the Bulgarian owner of a Nundu drag-racing circuit looking to expand into dueling?

It can be stuff that shouldn't work but does, stuff that sounds insane but turns out fun, stuff that sounds cliche and isn't, basically anything that, upon your first look, you'd roll your eyes at and ignore but if you actually read it you'd enjoy yourself immensely.

*** That thing is 356700 words long?! Egad, that's... that's... that's impressive? Or possibly terrifying. Too early to tell, really.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** Linkao3(6765496)

Okay, muggles know about magic now. I guess that changes... just about everything. DeLoreans fly now. Dark wizards and terrorists (is there a difference?) like to use portkey nukes. And big pharma tries to profit off of magic.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
