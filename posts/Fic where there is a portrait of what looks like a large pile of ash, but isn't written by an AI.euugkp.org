See above

*** Hmm... Not quite the same, I particularly remember the portrait of what looked like a large pile of ash was a cameo of some sort.

**** In one of their fictions, yes. I think. It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure I remember spotting it.

***** Indeed. [[/u/Macallion]] , [[/u/ThePurityofChaos]] , I think you're both right. There's a literal Portrait of a Large Pile of Ash that makes a cameo in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), but what ThePurityofChaos is remembering appears to be the fact that I also penned a sequel to /Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash/ itself, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rest of Sentence).

And incidentally, yes, I know, neither story has been updated in a garishly long time. Real life calls, as does original writing. But I'll get back into it /someday/.

****** I think The Parselmouth of Gryffindor was right! Thanks mate.

Wait a second... YOU'RE THE GUY HE LINKED TO

I really liked your story :)

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth and arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this. ON HIATUS

  Brought to you by the questionable genius of machine learning, it's the exciting sequel to "Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash"! Botnik Studios is not responsible for any faces eaten by Harry Potter with hot sauce, headmaster hair scooting next to you at breakfast, or ribs fractured in hysterical laughter. Weekly updates.
