I don't dislike giving Harry a sibling, but a ton of fanfics turn that relationship into a bitter rivalry.

With WBWL fics they pretend Harry doesn't exist, or Harry's sibling is a James clone. The family unit feels so toxic.

I'd like some recommendations on complete fanfics where the sibling relationship's are actually good. Maybe lifelike relations, in that they can fight but always protect family. I'd prefer completed fics, but longer ones that are in progress would be worth reading too.

â€‹

As it's not obvious, I'd be fine if his sibling was a girl, or even Fem!Harry. I don't have preferences on relationships or pairings.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405386/1/My-Brother]]) Harry has a younger sister named Emma and both really love each other Harry really step in the older brother role. James and Lily still die on Halloween 81 but Harry isn't alone at the Dursleys anymore. It's a really good read!

  AU. Harry's little sister: Emma Lily Potter, most witches and wizards don't know she exists. How different would he be growing up with a someone he loved and who loved him back? Harry and Emma go to Hogwarts where they make friends, duel, brew illegal potions, form a guild, fight Wizarding prejudices and get burdened with a terrible secret. Now with Elemental Magic.

**** While being close to canon, the differences are enough that it is refreshing to read. Year 1 is mostly about how Harry and Emma feel being separated from each other, the plot of Philosopher's Stone isn't much mentionned. From year 2, Harry and Emma's friend kinda merge together and take the challenges head on (so it isnt just harry, hermione and ron but about 4-5 others as well). Also Ginny doesnt have the diary if i'm correct (i dont remember who howver)

** Harry and Archie pretty much act like siblings, though they call each other cousins and I think they're actually second cousins, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/][The Pureblood Pretense]]. The world is very AU, with Tom Riddle being a blood supremacist politician instead of a terrorist; there was no war, so lots more people are alive, but discrimination and segregation are legally enforced. Harry grew up with both her parents and so she knows a lot more about magic than canon Harry did, but she isn't allowed to go to Hogwarts. This Harry, though, truly belongs in Slytherin, and she isn't going to let anything stop her from achieving her goals. Sirius Black's son, meanwhile, has dreams of his own that Hogwarts can't fulfill. What's a little capital crime between friends?

** So this might not be your thing, but have you tried Nose to the Wind by Batsutousai? It is technically a Tomarry, which was not my vibe at all when I read the fic, but the author does really well and it makes sense here. Harry is reincarnated into another universe as himself and his parents live and he has siblings. The relationships between them all are really lovely and interesting and one of the reasons why I love this fic so much.

This is technically a sequel, but you don't need to have read the first one. I didn't, and I found the first chapter does a perfect job of setting things up.

  Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary on his first trip into Diagon Alley and finally sees someone he can look up to. Unfortunately, he's not quite right -- at least, not yet. Follow the unlikely duo across all seven continents as they embark upon a Grand Tour, finding knowledge, adventure, and maybe, just maybe, something like family. NOT a Tom x Harry story!

*** Considering Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is one of the most popular fics in the fandom you would think people would have copied the idea of the Potters being alive, and Harry have a sibling, and all of them getting along. But there are so few.

Even just having a friendly sibling also at the Dursleys is super rare. You would think that would be more popular. Maybe since self Inserts aren't that popular and in other fandoms when I see a lot of twin/sibling fics, the twin/sibling is usually an insert.

There's one where he has an older sister that's so good but then she ends up with Severus snape even though he's her teacher (and she has an apprenticeship with him, so it's just suuuper gross)
