** A wand is a lever, a tool, a translator, a lens, and a musical instrument. Magic itself is powerful, but not using a wand hinders its greatest execution. Wandless magic is slow, rough, limited, and imprecise. I believe that the advantage of wanded magic is what allowed European wizards to set worldwide policy in the form of the Statute of Secrecy.

*** Ehh, the last supposition is a bit ad hoc. Wands were around at least as far back as ~300BCE, based on the opening of Ollivander's. That's almost 2000 years before the SoS was introduced. I mean, it's somewhat true that wands make it easier to hide, but wizards are pretty hidden from Muggles anyway.

** I tend to see wandless magic used as shorthand to indicate that a character has remarkable amounts of power and sufficient discipline/focus to use it. The trouble with this is that if the character is the only one with wandless magic in the whole story, it means they're overpowered for the setting, which renders the conflict generally less interesting.

Thus, I absolutely agree that every magical skill, wandless magic included, needs to have limitations, not be some magical McGuffin whose mastery means you automatically win. I don't have a particular requirement for what the price of wandless magic should be, but it should most certainly have one. Since wandless magic isn't specifically taught at Hogwarts, I also like contemporary or Hogwarts-set fics to explain why. Just my personal preference, of course.

** I don't like it. Britain has the greatest wizards in the world in Dumbledore and Riddle. After them is Grindelwald, know what they all have? Wands. Clearly wands are essential to being a great wizard. If they weren't needed we wouldn't see them. Wandless magic is a step up from accidental magic and little more.

*** Surely it has some uses though. Dumbledore has used it, as has Harry to some extent (with the Lumos on this dans in OoTP), and if for some reason you don't have your wand on you, being able to do a wandless Accio to get it back seems like a very good reason for wandless magic.

** Smutty af

Seriously, i use wandless magic as simple things. An accio, a levitation, apparition. Things that affect the universe in some way like transfiguration require a focus or ritual unless you have the will and concentration of a god. Things where your magic versus someone else's like imperius curse also require a wand,

** You know what I think would be an interesting take on it? Wandless magic is magic that has no barrier between intent and execution; this makes it very difficult for most people because they just don't see the world that way.

A wand is a tool and your spells a way to declare your intent. It's very formulaic and reliable, impersonal, and most importantly, widely teachable.

Wandless magic on the other hand is literally shaping the world as you see it. You see that feather over there? To "make" it float with wandless magic, you have to see it, almost /be/ it floating. No seperation. It takes a lot of discipline of mind to do something like that which is why a lot of people don't do it. It's also only as precise as your mind, so any large feats of wandless magic require a very creative mind that is completely confident in its ability to shape the world.

I figure that might also be a way to differentiate the "kind" of magic legendary people like Merlin and perhaps the founders used from the average witch or wizard.

edit: Actually, come to think of it, the kind of magic I'm describing is a lot like the "Old" magic (or whatever it was called) in linkffn(By the Divining Light).

  but more volatile and harder to focus
#+end_quote

In my own fic, I basically go about it that way. However, I'm stipulating that outside an unreasonably small percentage of absurdly powerful and gifted wizards (Dumbles & Voldy mostly), one has to pick up wandless magic early in life, and more than likely mastering it beyond trivialities requires a true /need/ to master it. 'Need' as in survival, which matched quite well with the Harry I'm writing, as he's living on the streets. And since educated wizards learn to channel their magical power through wands, most lose the ability to intentionally do meaningful magic without a wand; it sort of atrophies with disuse.

I felt it was a reasonable extrapolation from how accidental magic is portrayed and described in canon. It can produce extraordinarily powerful magic, but it tends to be reactive to strong emotions and external pressures. I decided it would work better on larger scale, less delicate effects since the magic user lacks a way to focus it efficiently, but conversely it can produce much more powerful effects than most would otherwise be capable of using the focusing ability of wands.

** I feel like a wand is essentially a stick that you use to point your magic at what you want it to do. wandless magic is explaining thoroughly to your magic what you want, while nonverbal magic is essentially explaining it using very expressive eyebrow wiggles and sign language.

** I assume you mean wandless spellcasting because things like potions are wandless magic too.

Anyway, I prefer wandless spellcasting to be clearly separated from the wanded one. No casting of the same spells just without wand. Wandless spells also shouldn't be superior to wanded in power. The advantage may lie in the surprise factor, in not needing to have wand in hand, but in general, they should be auxillary.

** Wandless magic is more imprecise, maybe connected to emotions more (like little children doing some magic when they're angry or frightened). I think much stronger wizards can get away with more complicated spells but it takes a lot of practice and strength, although I don't think that a Killing Curse could be cast without a wand, nonverbal maybe but not wandless. Something simple - day to day spells in household, something more complicated but still simple in its form - yes, but complicated transfiguration of an object? I don't think that could be achieved without a wand. Considering a wand as a tool it channels magic, helps you shape it and use it. Providing a student with a wand from early age, I think it may not prevent them of growing those capabilities but makes it harder for them later in life. Like learning different language, as a child it goes far better than during your adult life (not for everyone of course)

** To my mind, affecting something outside of yourself wandlessly takes more focus and effort than using a wand because your wand is already acting as a focus for your magic. So, warming your own hands wandlessly is pretty easy because your hands are an extension of yourself, but warming someone else's hands wandlessly would be much more difficult. This plays a bit into Apparation as it's not clear whether it's wandless or not.

Desire and emotion plays into it as well. In my stories, Harry has gotten pretty good at Vanishing bits of Ginny's clothing (Never to be seen again. Goodbye, favorite jeans!) because he has a strong desire to see them gone.

The material and nature of the object the wizard is acting on comes into play as well. A feather is relatively easy to get to float wandlessly because it already /wants/ to float and fly. Gold on the other hand is very stable and likes being exactly where and what it is, thanks very much, so a wizard will need to work very hard and practice a lot to get it to do anything without the additional help of a wand.

I think that because wandless magic is just that bit harder to use and use well, that most witches and wizards don't bother with it.

** I like it to be only for the powerful and only for simple things. I like to think of it as not the same as casting wanded spells.

So even if you can use it you are not casting a lumos or an accio or wingardium leviosa but rather it is unfocused and less useful.\\
You might be able to create light but its just going to be a hazy illuminated area around you.\\
You might be able to pull on things but it is not a long range target spells its more of a line of sight pull (or push) on an area.

Similarly i like stave based magic to be more powerful but less able to do complicated spells but rather to have massive battlefield magic, meteors, fireballs, ice, lightning storms, earthquakes and maybe rituals as well.

** Since I know you mean wandless magic as in "casting spells without a wantd" I like it how enembee talks about it in Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone (chapter 6)

#+begin_quote
  "But that ritual magic that you showed me earlier was really useful," protested Harry.

  "And if you had been able to use a wand, you could have done it with a single charm. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred it is more practical and expedient to use your wand."
#+end_quote

But in general, there is already other wandless magic that people use: Potions, Herbology, flying and so forth. They just tend not to be as direct as using a wand.

** I read a story once, can't remember the title, where Harry advanced so far with wandless magic that in the final battle his awareness expanded to all of the matter and its magic in the room and the battle became a contest of wills between Harry and V to manipulate it towards one of their destruction. I really enjoyed that.

** I like to think that wandless magic can achieve anything a wand can do but takes much longer to learn for under half the power that you get using a wand.

Basically a wand is a training and power multiplier. Why learn a spell wandless when you can learn 15 other spells in that same amount of time that require a wand?

Before wands you would apprentice to a wizard and learn maybe 1 spell per year if you were good. Why would you need a school when that's about what you can expect from a good apprentice? After wands you're learning 10 or more spells per year it makes sense that with this new level of knowledge being thrown around you would create a center for knowledge and standardize the training.

Wandless magic then becomes more of a convenience thing like how to summon something without needing to grab your wand every time.

** I stick to what Rowling said; wands focus magic and make it more powerful and precise. Powerful wizards can also learn wandless magic and become pretty good at doing complex wandless magic, but overall it's less focused and controlled and there's no indication that it's more powerful than magic with a wand.

I generally prefer what Rowling says over headcanons, since she's the one who created the wizarding world and everything in it.

** I like wandless magic, but I hate how most people use it. In my mind, wandless magic should be more powerful than magic with wands, since it isn't hindered by an object or wand movements and incantations, but along the same vein, wandless magic should be incredibly imprecise and unpredictable, barely able to be controlled, making it inferior to magic with wands.
