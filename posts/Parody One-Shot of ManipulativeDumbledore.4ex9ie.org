[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11613187/1/What-Was-Your-Plan][What Was Your Plan?]] is a great story about the sort of thing you'd expect to /actually/ happen if an incredibly intelligent, powerful, cunning, evil and manipulative wizard had a child he'd been controlling his entire life turn against him.


** It was 99% great. I liked how Dumbledore calmly revealed how stupid and pointless Harry's ideas were and how he was just delusional and paranoid.

And then the author fucked it up in the end by revealing that he was right all along and Dumbledore really was evil "for some unknown and unclear reason" to quote the story itself.

*** Yeah... I mean, is he trying to make fun of evil dumbledore or encouraging it?

** And this is precisely why I dislike Evil!Dumbledore. It's /boring/. And there's no real way to make it not boring without writing poorly. The most powerful wizard in the world, perhaps even more powerful than Voldemort, and someone who knows the power of love. How do you stop him?

That aside, Harry is in fact not even remotely a mediocre student, but obviously Dumbledore would smash him silly.

There is, you just need to level up other characters plotting to match Dumbledore changing whole story into fight with more and more overcomplicated plots. Plots that could derail due to very small changes from predicted course and then would need to be corrected with other plots.

Basically make Harry Potter into Toaru Majutsu no Index.

***** We have Voldemort, who is similarly powerful and really intelligent. Others don't need to have this much of magical power. After all it's battle of plans, plots and ruses.

****** Except Riddle is also the bad guy, and if you're making him the good guy I'm probably closing the window because wut.

******** Ehh...can't really see that. That'd become evil vs evil basically, wouldn't it?

Nah, I like Good Dumbledore, just don't make him omniscient and you'll be fine.

******* He is supposed to still be bad guy. I never meant it to be good schemer vs evil schemer, but as series about hero who everybody want to use as their pawn. And his not fully predictable actions throwing plans out.
