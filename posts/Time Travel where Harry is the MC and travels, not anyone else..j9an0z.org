I know this is a cliche topic for fanfics, but I've been out of the Harry Potter fic scene for a few years now and suddenly got a strong urge to read them.

I've been trying to find good time travel fics, especially ones where Harry goes back to Marauder era, because I remember reading some good ones. Problem is all I can find are ones where Hermione goes back - and they're usually Hermione x Sirius. I've got nothing against her (although I do enjoy abit of Granger bashin) but I really want to read a good Harry fic...

As I said I'm mainly looking for Harry going to Marauder era, although a lengthy or complete fix-it time travel fic wouldn't go amiss either!

I'm good with most pairings, as long as both are from the same generation (and consensual!)

Please no gender swap! I prefer everyone to have their original genders, but trans!character is fine to :)

Sorry again for the cliche request, I'm definitely doing something wrong when looking through the fanfiction site (-∧-；) (It really has been forever!)

Prof. Binns notices no one is paying attention in class and gets annoyed. He sends the entire class (separately) on a temporal field trip to get a better appreciation for history. Harry ends up in his parent's 6th year.

Spoilers for explanation about why you might find the beginning bad, but people say it's good.

#+begin_quote
  Frankly, if you tried it before, and ran into this seems like generic revenge crap, that's fair. At the beginning, that's definitely what it is. The journey to getting there though through the past is fascinating, complex, and interesting. It almost feels like 2 different authors sometimes to me. The past is far more interesting than the future for quite a while. If you don't like it by chapter 12 or so I'd say drop it. The future does get more interesting and complex eventually, but it takes time.<

  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

Princeps by Lomonaaeran-- Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go /too/ wrong.

** Well, I have a few suggestions:

First off, linkao3(From Ruin by GraeFoxx) is a really good fanfic that is still being updated (I'm a Patreon subscriber of the author), and already has a lot of content.

Second, linkao3(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw by LeadVonE) - sorry if the formatting is weird, I don't know how to fix it on my phone.

And, finally, as an omake, a fanfic that doesn't fit your particular description, but screw it, rarepair, so maybe it'll tickle your fancy.

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

  Once again, she lifted the spell, and the wizard behind him moved forward. He reached down and took hold of Harry's arm, pulling his shaking body up and twisting his arm behind him. “We should take him to the Dark Lord,” he said, and Harry's heart beat wildly. Voldemort was dead. The war had ended. What was going on?
