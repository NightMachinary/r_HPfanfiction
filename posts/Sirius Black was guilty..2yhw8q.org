** Might be, but I haven't seen anything like it either. I think it's because Sirius is generally well liked by the community. It's a problem when you want to explore these kind of possibilites. I've been looking for 'Peter is innocent' FFs for a while and let's just say they are rarer then meeting shiny pokemon by accident.

***** What fanfiction archive have /you/ been frequenting? I think there must be /hundreds/ of stories where Hermione is sent back far enough that she can fall in love with Tom Riddle at Hogwarts. (I haven't read any of them, though, so I couldn't say anything on their quality.)

******** To be honest, I really love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6031176/1/Tied-for-Last][Tied For Last]]. Basic prompt: Hermione dies, and goes to a purgatory where all wizards and witches who have left pieces of their soul behind gather until they move on (in Hermione's case, she permanently enchanted something, I can't really recall). Tom Riddle is obviously also there to his Horcrux shenanigans.

The story is mostly about power plays and features great conflicts about blood purity, and is really one of my all time favorites.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4417534/15/Darkness-Falls-Upon-Us][Darkness Falls Upon Us]]

AU Where Neville is the Boy-who-lived and Harry is forced to grow up in an orphanage after a death eater attack killed his parents. Dark!Harry UPDATE: Chapter 28 posted 1/4/14

This is the closest I can think of. Sirius was an unmarked Death Eater who had planned to kidnap and raise Harry as his own, but Peter had got their first and killed Lily and James. Sirius killed Peter, but got caught by Remus who assumed he'd killed all three.

It's funny that you posted this today. Last night I started writing a fic where Pettigrew was a Death Eater and the Secret Keeper, but didn't sell Lily and James out to Voldemort. Although, I only write for fun and so far haven't published anything.

** I think it works best still left ambiguous in some way. Otherwise, it is Sirius /in name only/.

So Sirius Black /did/ kill twelve muggles with an explosive spell while trying to kill Peter. He just didn't /actually/ kill Peter, or betray the Potters. Then, for extra drama, Harry finds this out at the AU trial Harry worked so hard to arrange to exonerate Sirus.

Sirius is set free with time served for misdemeanor Muggle homicide, because the wizarding world allows a certain level of incidental Muggle collateral (see: aggressive obliviation of them to the point of mental damage, etc). He's also cleared of betraying the Potters and killing Peter (which would have meant a life sentence), but he now has to deal with Harry and the crew knowing he's killed innocent people. Lots of them.

And they have to deal with the fact that, despite hating dark wizards and not minding Muggle-born like Hermione (who are magical, after all), Sirius still sort of doesn't care about the accidentally killing Muggles bit.

*** It would make sense even, for Sirius to not really care about it. Growing up in a family like the Blacks, any thinking Sirius did about muggles would either be horror stories from Bellatrix and his parents, or as a convenient prop in his teenage rebellion. He doesn't harbor any real fear or ill-will towards them, but they are still less than people in his eyes.

*** Spoilers, obviously.

In Sacrifices Arc, Peter Pettigrew was a spy for the light magically bound (Phoenix web, much?) by Dumbledore to go to Azkaban in Sirius' stead.

Don't think it really applies in the context. James and Lily are alive, after all, and the 'betrayal' was a willing sacrifice, and planned by Dumbledore.
