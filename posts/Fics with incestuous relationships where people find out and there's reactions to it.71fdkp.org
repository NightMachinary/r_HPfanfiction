** I'm trying to think up a situation that counts as a clusterfuck and I think I've got one. Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel.

The Philosopher's Stone is based on phoenix rebirth. Brewing a specific pair of potions with the Elixir of Life causes one person to disappear and the other person to become pregnant with the person who disappeared. Combined with a gender altering potion Nicolas and Perenelle have kept themselves alive for several hundred years while also keeping the specifics of how the Elixir actually works a closely guarded secret. They're each technically the others kid. Also explains their frequent multi-year absences from public life.

*** FIrst cousin marriages are LEGAL in UK and most of Europe, they are often encouraged in India and many Islamic countries, so I fail to see what the big deal was if James Sirius or Albus Severus decided to get together with Rose.

**** Just because something's legal doesn't mean it doesn't squick people out. Or that they'd approve if their children decided to get it on. In America, it's perfectly legal to take upskirt photos in a lot of places, but that doesn't mean people are okay with it. In fact, most are very much not okay with this and are trying to change laws in those states so that it is illegal.

***** In case James and Rose, their parents wouldn't be happy, but if they insisted on their relationship, their parents should give in eventually.

Since the Magical World was so small, many Purebloods most likely married their first cousins anyway. I suspect their tolerance for first cousin marriages was a lot higher than in Muggle World.

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage][First cousin marriage]] does increase the risk of birth defects, but it only entails a similar increased risk of birth defects and mortality as a woman faces when she gives birth at age 41 rather than at 30. If you want to ban first cousin marriages based on increased birth defects risk, you might as well ban older women from giving birth.

****** *Cousin marriage*

Cousin marriage is marriage between cousins (i.e. people with common grandparents or people who share other fairly recent ancestors). Opinions and practice vary widely across the world. In some cultures and communities, cousin marriage is considered ideal and actively encouraged; in others, it is subject to social stigma.

****** Neither Harry or Hermione were raised in the magical world, though. They were raised in the Muggle world where the whole cousin thing is a lot less common and much less accepted in this day and age. Harry especially may have issues given his upbringing where "strangeness" was looked down upon greatly. I have a feeling there's some stuff from that kind of upbringing he couldn't shake even after years and years away from the Dursleys it'd be so deeply ingrained into his psyche.

Also, the whole Purebloods doing it thing may actually cause a /greater/ aversion to cousincest in their families as they /fought/ against all of that. They may view it as their children taking a step back and be unsupportive as they view it as them disrespecting what they fought for.

I'm not even suggesting it should be outlawed. People should be allowed to love and do who they want (as long as everything is consensual), but that still doesn't change that there are many out there who wouldn't be okay with it. For medical reasons, familial reason, moral reason, ect.

Because see, they're not put together at all and nor are they broken. They're in recovery, still trying to find the beautiful hidden in the ugly and stitch it into a life that can be happy.
