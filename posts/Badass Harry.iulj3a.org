Is there a fic where Harry goes all badass as an Auror? I'd really enjoy some action wizard v wizard fics where the final isn't over in 2 sentences.

** Kicking Gotham (linkffn(13521865)) is, IMO, a very good example of badass Auror Harry Potter specifically. DC Comics crossover, btw.

I especially like how the author throws in details about Auror training/mentality, and how it's relevant to what's currently happening.

Like when he's fighting someone, and they apparate, HP goes into an internal monologue about how Aurors are trained to be able to handle apparating foes.

Or how his enemy made a mistake by assuming he was running away when he apparated, and he goes into details about how Aurors don't back down and if you think they're running then chances are it's a trap and you're about to get stunned and arrested.

And it's not just combat aspects that he goes over like this, either.

It's little tidbits throughout the story like this that paint the overall picture that Harry is a badass auror.

** Harry isn't an auror in it, but i'm on something like a 14 chapter streak of "at least 1 fight per chapter" in my fic. Here's a taste of how an action scene looks:

-- A column of boiling water appeared, arcing over the Carrows and launching directly towards the two Flints behind them, while another column of wood formed from the wall opposite Amycus and shot directly towards him. Stone jaws grew out of the ground beneath Phinneus, trying to drag him into a pit of quicksand, while the sofa flashed and morphed into a swarm of hornets that descended on Alecto.

Shouts and screams rang out through the home. Marcus Flint, only a year removed from Hogwarts, was slow to react and took the blow from the boiling water head-on. A brief shout began but cut out almost immediately as the steam from the superheated water instantly cooked his lungs following his shocked inhalation. Boiled and blistered skin fell off in chunks, and the boy collapsed to the floor unconscious and asphyxiating. Paulus was able to erect a shield in time, the wide column striking a glancing blow against him but leaving him uninjured and able to watch his son's death in graphic detail.

Alecto used an incendio charm against the hornets, the insects burning immediately under her sustained blaze. Phinneus and Amycus both destroyed Harry's transfigurations with Reductors and turned towards the young man with curses of their own in reply. The fragments of the wood column, however, did not fall idly to the floor; as soon as they landed, they morphed into vines that immediately began to grow and seek out the Death Eaters, grasping their limbs and attempting to immobilize Amycus and Alecto. --

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
