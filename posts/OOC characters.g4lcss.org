What in your opinion makes a character OOC (out of character)? Conversely what is needed for character to not look OOC in your eyes?

Is it a personality trait, an appearance trait, a character's preference (like liking a tomato instead of a potato)?

What is too much OOC? Are there any character which are ok, tolerable when OOC? Are there characters you prefer to be OOC? If so, why? What kind of OOCsness was it for which character?

You can be character(/s) specific or write in general. Or both.

Feel free to write as brief or as detailed comment as you'd like.

I'd like for us all to share with a preset notion that no one here can state they are right or correct and therefore someone else is in the wrong. If you disagree, it's because it's your preference / opinion, not a fact.

It's all subjective after all.


** For me, a lot of it is the /voice/ of the character, and how that character reacts to events.

For example, most fics that have Harry go off on an OOC rant usually have him speaking in a way that doesn't sound like canon Harry, it sounds like someone ranting on a forum.

Harry is canonically generally respectful, unless you prove to be undeserving of his respect, then he's got snark for /daaays/. The line, “There's no need to call me sir, Professor” is one of the few parts of HBP that are just perfection. Another big part of his personality is he's /extremely/ curious - for the first few books most of the action is him hearing about a mystery and deciding to solve it. Harry confronts most of his problems head on, he doesn't tend to do things sneakily or let other people fight (what he believes are) his battles.

So if a fic has Harry behaving counter to those traits, there better be a damn good reason. The more your character is different from the canon version, the earlier in their life there has to be a change from canon events.

*** At first I agreed with you that Harry isn't really sneaky, but then I changed my mind - he actually is quite sneaky if he thinks situation requires it - when he's with Dursleys, when he wanted to hear the convo about Sirius in Three Broomsticks, when he wanted to free Dobby come to mind. It's just not his preferred modus operandi, so it comes in those flashes of unexpected brilliance.

But rants, oh yes, yes. I remember I had to stop readin a fic because it was this whole block of text only with adults slowly dissolving into sobbing messes throughtout.\\
Would it be better if the rant was still there, but shown more organically, e.g. if it's more of a dialogue than a monologue? I honestly think Harry is capable of wit and eloquency, it's just that he'd rather not bother most of the time. :D So maybe rant would be justifies if administered in smaller doses and the better thought out cause of why Harry would rant at all?

** Voldemort, Snape and Dumbledore's voices all have something in common.

They use formal speech.

Dumbledore speech is usually formal sparkled with eccentricism and sometimes absurdities of which makes some of the best quotes in Harry Potter.

Snape's voice has elements of bitterness and a biting tone, sarcastic and insultive.

Voldemort's voice has an aristocratic tone. He speaks as though he's the ruler of all.

What's my point? I hate fics that disregard this. Having Voldemort swear? Making Snape speak informally e.t.c. Having them use very simple words when these characters are known for their eloquence?

It pisses me off. And it is definitely OOC.

*** Well, Snape occasionally speaks informally, usually in emotional situations - like with Harry or Sirius, on few occasions with Dumbledore. Or in his memories - he wasn't always this formal guy at all times. Or what do you mean by "informal"? What would be a good reason for you to believe in Snape talking in an informal manner?

Also - if they only use simple words then yes, I agree, but you need simple words as well or you risk them sounding as if they were in a play.

Voldemort is trying to always be aristocratic, but when he gets emotional he tends to lose this manner of speaking, it's then usually replaced by pure viciousness. xd

** What makes a character OOC is, in my view, when their actions, thoughts, and voice don't match the interpretation I have from canon - or that the change from their canon personalities induced by the FF is not convincing enough.

For an example, let's take Snape. Snape in canon is a mess of different thoughts and emotions - but he's also a snippy, sarcastic asshole who likes to pass his anger out on children. If a fic has him as all bubbly and sunshine with no explanation, that'd be OOC. Conversely, a fic could decide to find a way to turn his dislike/hatred of Harry into protectiveness from a fairly early point - perhaps by having Snape go to deliver Harry's letter, and seeing his treatment at the Dursleys. There, a change from canon would be believable in my view, and would thus not be OOC.

In terms of concrete terms, minor details that aren't important are not that big a deal to me. Character A liking tomatoes instead of potatoes is fine - unless there was an important reason for that to be the case.

An OOC character is not always a terrible thing - but if going for canon + a divergence, that OOC nature is one of the changes. It does feel more natural to me if the shift in personality - for an important character - is explained. That means, as well, than any character can be tolerable as OOC... but, at the same time, that they usually aren't. The main vector for OOC is usually bashing, in my view, or as a character device to bump Harry along into whatever plot the author decided.

*** I don't think Snape would be ever protective of Harry in any way understandable to anyone. Well, maybe Dumbledore, but only maybe. He's asshole through and through in books, but I keep forgetting, because in fanfics him being accidentaly on the "good" side usually equals to "but really, he wasn't THAT bad". I don't think he would change attitude towards Harry even if he saw with his own eyes what's going on, but that's just my interpretation of his character. : P

So - if there was a slid groundwork for e.g. Harry to study more / think more of strategy, etc. - would it be fine with you, if the change was gradual and explained? Like, not having Harry give 10/10 speeches from the get go, but if it was warranted?

**** Snape's a complicated character like that, yeah - personal opinions will vary there. I tend to fall on the side of things that if he associated Harry more with Lily + seeing how bad the abuse was, it'd change something up in him - at least, before their relationship was /too/ antagonistic (so year 1 or 2 or so). Even so it'd be a form of protectiveness that would still come across as very asshole-y - there's a very well done female Harry fic with that idea (though not without a downside in far-future pairing choices).

For your idea, it would certainly be believable, I think. It doesn't even need to be /too/ explained - just showing him struggling and improving at it with experience would work, or working together with his friends to make it work better, etc. As long as it's not just flipping a switch and he's the best strategist ever, it's probably going to be fine!

*** Ok, so that's a very nice reply, thank you. I agree with you, so I don't really have anything to write against point you mentioned.

What do you think about about major changes that are would not necessarily change much of the story, because the story does not focus on those specific things all that much?

I admit I'm having a one particular think in mind - sexual orientation. I'm trying to understand if it's mostly just a personal preference or an apprehension or a sentiment or is there really a reason why character A could not be a non-straight person without being perceived as an OOC character if it would not have an impact on the story.

Sorry if it's not your cup of tea, just tell me and I'll let go.

***** Thank you for your replies. : ) They helped me gather my mind around this topic a lot. Basically - setup is important and it should be appropriately long for any given pairing. :P

Thanks. : )

** Well, if there is no difference in events that causes beleivable character development so the character is different from cannon, then they are OOC.

*** So are you of an opinion that the same situation cannot have different outcomes even if the character's inner drive as to why would the act differently is fleshed out?
