** If it's a parliamentary system like the British one, they don't. Instead, someone makes a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence][no-confidence motion]], and if it gets the majority, the Minister is out.

*** I looked it up after I saw this comment and I found out that it does actually exist but hasn't been used since 1806. It was used to remove and arrest the Ministers of the Crown.

**** The modern equivalent would be finding someone to be in contempt of Parliament.

I would have said that was an ancient relic too, but in 2018 the UK government was held in contempt of Parliament for the first time in history.

Lots of "first time in history" moments over the last couple of years in the UK...

**** Unless you want it considered to be a branch of government under the crown (similar to the commonwealth countries), then you can make it up. Britain and the rest of the commonwealth (such as Canada and Australia) are constitutional monarchies and we have a no-confidence thing. If you want an overview of how it works, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vqyfY7cZPk][this old Rick Mercer clip]] is a good introduction. Coincidentally, this video was made a year or two before Harper was slapped with a no confidence / contempt of parliament vote in 2011 after skating out of it (I believe) twice before.

** We have no idea.

That is to say, the Wizengamot is not at all explained in canon - meaning that the authors get to make a decision on it!

One option would be through a straight vote of the Wizengamot - say, needing a 2/3 or 3/4 majority, and that would be enough to relieve a minister of their duties. That may or may not need a trial.

An alternative could be that they can't do it themselves - but with a 2/3 vote, they could kick off a recall election, which would then set things up for a removal.

But whatever gets used, it has to be the author's discussion. We don't know if the Wizengamot is partly or entirely or not elected, we don't know if the minister has a say over its members, we don't know how the minister gets elected, etc. It's all /very/ vague, so saying anything as a blanket statement doesn't work well.

*** So if it had to be a 2/3 vote, then I believe that the leader of one of parties in the Wizengamot has to call the vote. So would it make sense that the only people that have the power to call for impeachment as: the Chief Warlock, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the Majority Leader?

Also do you think it would work, that to begin the impeachment process the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement has to agree with the decision ?

** A lot of fanfics have Wizarding Britain essentially be an oligarchy or aristocracy. And while I think the former can fit with canon, I think given the size of the population and the relative egalitarianism you would expect from a society where pretty much anyone can be powerful, it is possible to go in the other direction.

Wizarding Britain could be closer to a New England style town government than it is to modern Republics. The Minister and the Wizengamot have the power to handle the day to day and legislate, but anyone can start a petition and call a meeting where at least 20% of the population needs to show up to vote to overturn or pass legislation or oust someone from office.

** Ah, the eternal question of Magical Britain's political system.

It can be anything you want really, even (maybe especially) something absurd. What it probably shouldn't be is something overly complex that has all the trappings of modern political systems. It just doesn't fit the size or the general /wizard/-ness of British wizards...

In any case, you don't impeach someone that works for you, you just fire him. Or, said another way, someone says they don't like him anymore (i.e. a motion of no confidence), they just hold a vote on it, then debate who to pick next, then hold a vote on making that person Minister, like they would any other thing, with the same procedures. And maybe there is some kind of weird symbolic ceremony that makes no sense to proclaim it, because that's just how wizard do things...

Going a little more into headcanon territory: we don't know much about the inner workings of Magical Britain's political system, but it would make sense for it to be vaguely British and somewhat small. That means no american-style separation of powers or check and balances, no Presidential system at all really, and none of the complicated political rituals that exist in our world because of the size of countries.

Basically take the British system circa 1700, remove the monarch, then merge and squeeze all the institutions until you reach what's needed to govern the population of a small town, except fully independent.

You end up with something relatively pragmatic (if somewhat alien compared to the government of a modern country): no separation of powers, no fixed terms for ministers or Wizengamot members, no popular election, a weird mix of formal and informal, probably no formal political parties at all, and definitely a much smaller accumulation of litigation and precedent. Just a bunch of very old men and women who definitely won't be going around running the place, so they delegate. And they obviously get to pick who they delegate to (now whether that ends up being an oligarchy, an aristocracy or even a Greek-style republic, ... all three are possible).
