I've read basically any Sirius/Harry parenting fic I can get my hands on like Innocent, A Marauder's Plan, Wise One, Stealing Harry, The Letter etc, but most of those begin at earliest when he's 8 or 9, or the latest in the third year. Recently I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8588360/1/The-Dream-of-a-Waking-Man][The Dream of a Waking Man]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2086067/1/Wishcraft][WishCraft]] where 4-year-old Harry uses accidental magic and ends in Sirius' cell, really opened my eyes to the possibility of toddler/only-suffered-three-years with Dursleys Harry interacting with only-suffered-3/4-years in Azkaban-so-is-still-somewhat-sane Sirius. The potential for adorableness is too high for me to ignore...

â€‹

So, yes I'm sentimental and want a parenting fic where Sirus and Harry reunite sooner rather than later. (If any of you have some good recs where they're reunited in later years, I still welcome those recs).


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7624618/1/Love-and-Love-Again][Love and Love Again]] linkffn(7624618) - Sirius finds a 13-year-old Harry, 12 years after his presumed death. Tons of family feels with Sirius as well as Lily and James. Sadly incomplete.

#+begin_quote
  Lily and James survived Voldemort's attack, but their infant son was believed dead. Twelve years later, Harry Potter is found and brought home, but the real struggle has just begun. Ensemble fic about a family's recovery as old enemies return.

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4789151][I Want To Disappear]] linkao3(4789151) is similar in that Harry goes to Sirius for support even though Lily and James are alive. However, it's even more angsty than the above fic, as Harry has what is probably clinical depression, and James isn't the best parent (though it doesn't stray into bashing). It also has Sirius/Remus, which I know isn't everyone's cup of tea.

  The Marauders -- it's hard calling themselves that after Peter -- managed to defeat Voldemort, and are stumbling through adulthood without a war. Harry should get a normal life with his parents and his uncles. But Remus is worried. Because Harry doesn't seem okay. He doesn't seem okay at all.

**** The underage rape is a scene with Diarymort and Ginny and the sex otherwise is from characters of age and the scenes are far apart.
