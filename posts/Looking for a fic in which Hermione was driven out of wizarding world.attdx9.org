Hi. I read a piece a few months back and I'm now trying to find it. I remember the plot roughly so if anyone has read it too please help me find the title.

So here it goes: Hermione was captured and branded the dark mark and when it was found out, everyone took her for a spy. She was stripped of magic and had to live as a muggle again.

Some years later, she was a doctor of some kind in San Francisco. One day Dumbledore turned up and asked her to work as a spy for a chance of redemption. Then Sirius came and persuaded her to go back with a teaching position at Hogwarts. Harry and Ron still largely believed she wasn't framed but an actual traitor.

It is probably a Harmony since that's all I'm into. I've tried every key words combination and just couldn't find it. Pretty sure it is on fanfiction.net. I know chances are slim but if anyone knows it please let me know. Thank you in advance.


** Ugh, I know what you're taking about but I can't remember the fic
