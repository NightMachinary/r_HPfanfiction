I remember it involved a scene in the infirmary where Harry steals Dreeamless Sleep and one blood replenisher, which is how Snape finds out Harry is self harming. Also, the students were switched around in different houses--obviously Harry was placed in Slytherin for two weeks.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? I tried hunting for it on A03 or ff.net (it's definitely on one of those two websites.

Thanks in advance!
