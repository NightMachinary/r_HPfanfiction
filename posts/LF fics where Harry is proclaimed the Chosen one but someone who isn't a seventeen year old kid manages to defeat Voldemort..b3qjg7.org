IIRC in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10561760/1/][this fic]] Dumbledore still thinks Harry(whatever her name is) is the only one who can defeat Voldemort, only for a ministry hit squad to do the deed instead. She stays in America and has nothing to do with it. I haven't read it in years though, so I could have forgotten some stuff.

Voldemort would still have the stupid horcrux connection though.


** I wish I could remember the story, but it basically has Harry saying "Nah". Harry moves to America while Dumbledore begs him to return to defeat Voldemort. I believe he even used a fidelius charm on his own name to make people forget him. The story ends soon after Dumbledore winds up killing Voldemort. I would explain how, but it would be a spoiler.

  Admittedly, not much of a literary achievement, but worth the read for the sheer idiocy of Voldemort showing up in Tennessee.

** linkffn(Who Will Fill a Coward's Grave by robst) has that.

There's another one I've read that has a house elf born at the end of the seventh month of the house elf calendar who offs Voldemort (in the graveyard, IIRC) for betraying him. Don't remember the name, unfortunately.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
