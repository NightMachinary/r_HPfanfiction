I love the style and feel of the fanfics written by Jeconais. I've reread them a dozen times. Anything like that, please?


** Jeconais has pretty much written only one fic and repackaged it a dozen different ways. So, if you're looking for more authors like that, I suggest reading Clell65619, Esama, and James Spookie.

** I'm something of a Jeconais fan myself. So lets see what we can do hmm?

Bobmin357 and Jbern come to mind. They've both got a good mix of humor, powerful Harry, unusual magic, interesting pairings, and fast and furious adventure. jbern's The Lie I've Lived and Bungle in the Jungle are especially good, and Bobmin's Parallels, Power of the Press, Fall of the House of Potter, and a couple of others are equally good.

The Black Comedy has a powerful Harry who goes to another dimension, meets up with a still alive Sirius, and raises so much hell it's hilarious. Lots of humor, sex, action, jokes, and some pretty impressive magic thrown around.
