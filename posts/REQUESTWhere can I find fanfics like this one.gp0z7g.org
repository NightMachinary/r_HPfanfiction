Fanfic: LEGACY: Marauder's Era by CatchthePetals

So I just finished reading this fanfic and are waiting for them to update. It's about a muggle born called Raylynx Kingsley during the marauders era at Hogwarts, and it goes through her life from first year to after the war. It's nice and warm early in the story, but when she gets really sad. I swear I cried more times reading this than I ever had in a long time. It's mainly oc-centric but does include povs of her friends too. And some strangers and enemies. And yes she does meet harry. It's really good I recommend you check it out : [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10211776/1/]] But while I'm waiting, can some of y'all who see this recommend some in a similar pattern like this one? Thanks you guys!
