** 20/22.

One complaint though; when you showed the last slide, I could only see which questions I answered correctly and which ones incorrectly. You didn't show the answers. I think it would be great if I could at least see the correct answer for the questions I answered wrong, if not all the answers to all the questions, to nicely summarize it at the end.

** I'm very much not a Ravenclaw, but I got 20/22. It was a pretty fun quiz, I'd love to try them for the other houses (especially Hufflepuff, but hey, I'm biased)

Though if I was dropped into the HP-verse I'd probably either get sorted into Gryffindor or Slytherin, either for my bravery at being at Hogwarts at all, or my cunning intent to exploit the magical world for all it's worth.
