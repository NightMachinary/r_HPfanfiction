Harry's one eye is red, and the other green. James Potter being reminded of his failure of being unable to protect his wife, and thoe red eye of his son that reminds him so much of their most hated enemy, sent Harry Potter to live with Lily's relatives.

Because of a trick even Lily and James didn't know, Sirius thought to transfer or had Peter become the secret keeper, perhaps by the polyjuice potion.

Sirius was framed, and tossed into Azkaban. James refused to believe Sirius.

Seven years later, Sirius found out about Harry's horrid conditions and James' abandonment of Harry and escaped. As the British wizarding world is occupied with the sudden escape of Sirius Black, Sirius took Harry and traveled the world, from the Americas, through Asia, and even many parts of Europe, far away from the British wizarding world, and teaching Harry everything he knew, and what tutors money could buy. Also, adventures.

Harry was 15 when they stepped onto the British soil, and a single mistake lead to the capture of Sirius Black by James, Dumbledore, and the ministry and gave him the kiss after a sham trial.

Harry was 15 when he comes into Hogwarts.

Harry gets Voldemort's powers, and his twin becomes the Horcrux and the cursed scar.

** What about the Potter twins? Both survived the events of that night, but there was only a single soul fragment looking for an anchor.

How would life play out between the two if one could talk to snakes and see into Voldemort's mind and the other couldn't?

**** So Harry gets the power of a Dark Lord at age one with no strings attached while his twin gets a Voldemort-radar that works by giving him immobilizing headaches, the lamest superpower ever and the ability to spy on Voldemort with the little issue that Voldemort can use it to spy /back/, posses him and send fake visions, plus the whole “Voldemort can't die if you don't die first” thing... Yup, seems like a fair and balanced exchange.

****** Eh, mostly personal preference I guess. While Harry being super ahead of his peers is a guilty pleasure of mine I read too many stories that try to do it by making everyone else be weak and stupid in comparison, so I don't really like the idea of one twin getting all the benefits while the other gets the disadvantages.

** Even under those circumstances. It's hard for me to see James or Lily giving Harry to the Dursleys.

I mean Lily, basically died in canon for Harry. That doesn't sound like a parent who would give up their child because his eye is red.

And no mention is made of how Lily feels. It's as if James dictates what happens in their household without her input.

*** Or have Sirius at least be imprisoned again. In a higher security cell that also protects against the animagus transformation.

That way Harry has some motivation to get the people standing between him and Sirius out of the way.

*** Not necessarily. Yeah, it could be a bad read if done lazily and/or with too much angst or bashing, but it could also be great if done right. James loves his children but is mourning the love of his life and thinks his brother in everything but name betrayed him, he can't prevent himself from resenting Harry no matter how hard he tries or how he knows it is wrong, he has serious trust-issues at this point so he is not willing to ask anyone else on the magical world for help raising Harry (they thought Remus was the traitor, so with him surviving and both grieving I can see them having a falling off), the only muggles he knows are the Dursley's and he genuinely has no reason to think they would mistreat Harry plus giving Harry the anonymity that he could never get on the wizarding world.

Harry's twin grows up raised by an overprotective and bitter war veteran (PTSD maybe?) with deep trust issues, the shadow of a mother he never knew as seen by James rose-tinted glasses over his every action (a somewhat harsher version of Neville's gran comparing him to his parents), only finding out about his twin brother because a crazie (to him at least) broke out of prison and kidnapped him. And this is from the home-life angle, outside he has a rabid public that praises and vilifies him in turns at the drop of a hat, the Horcrux affecting him, Voldemort and the DE's gunning for his head and (potentially) the knowledge that the only way to stop Voldemort would be dying... then his supposedly dead brother comes back from the grave having roamed all over the world, showing himself much more skilled and powerful than him after having been raised by a supposedly DE that he swears is innocent and clearly resenting James and Dumbledore for having Sirius killed (which was an honest mistake in the part of both instead of an attempt at manipulating and when it comes to light that Pettigrew was the actual secret keeper both feel awful).

Harry... well, just not making the abuse unrealistic or making him an Edge Lord would actually solve any problem with his character that could possibly be opened by the prompt (Oh, and making him act his age, this is a kid who was raised by Sirius let's-make-Snape-Moony's-dinner Black after living in a house with severe restrictions for the first years of his life, he will be anything but a responsible, serious adult at this point).

** I just can't see James giving up Harry, especially to the Dursleys. It seems like drama for the sake of drama and nothing else.

Second, proving Sirius innocence would be much easier if James and the kids are alive. He'd be less likely to spiral. If he is not the secret keeper, then he either wouldn't know where James and Lily live or wouldn't be able to share the location. Simple open and shut case.

Third, giving Harry all of Voldemort's powers is a very touchy idea. It would take a very talented writer to keep Harry from being the key to pick all locks.

I feel like it would be less convoluted to just not have the twin and both James and Lily be dead. Harry's twin would seem useless, with Harry there. James won't be bashed, and there won't be a Sirius Azkaban plot hole.
