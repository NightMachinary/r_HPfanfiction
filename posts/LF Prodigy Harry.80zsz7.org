A story where Harry trains wicked hard to become a prodigy in magic. Relationship and smut is ok.

EDIT: Thanks all, looking forward to trying some of these out!


** Magicks of the Arcane is the first that comes to mind, one of the few fics that features a good mentor relationship between Harry and Dumbledore, there is a bit of relationships but nothing big and a lot of travelling around the world. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane]])
