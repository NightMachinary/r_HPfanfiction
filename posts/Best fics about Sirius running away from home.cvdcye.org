Sirius centric Something focused on his running away and the complications involving that. It doesn't have to just be about just that but that should be a big part if its not just about that. Im fine with all kinds of ships but No Marauder or Snape/anyone from Harrys year ( even with time travel) and no oc ships. And no genderbending. But het slash fem slash its all good.

But I prefer friendship focused I like longfic especially completed longfic but incomplete works too.


** Linkao3(the dog you feed)

Linkao3(putting out the fire with gasoline)

Linkao3(The Last Word by iamfitzwilliamdarcy)

Linkffn(a feast in Azkaban)

The last is the least directly related, but his running away is a large part of what he thinks about in Azkaban, and the story is mainly told from the POV of a Dementor...

  When Sirius ran away from home he went to live with the Potters, but before he made it there he wound up lost, alone, and hurt in Muggle London. With James out of the country, Peter stuck at home, and Remus trapped by the full moon, it's Lily Evans (who hates his guts) that Sirius is forced to turn to for shelter and more advice than he could have bargained for.

  The almost boring summer. Or, how Sirius ended up running away in the Renascentia-verse.

  After his near expulsion at the end of his fifth year, Sirius returns home to his mother's new plans for him and his father as his last hope. Orion thinks it's high time Sirius grew up and began taking his responsibilities seriously; he's beginning to realize how much he's indulged his son.

  How did Sirius Black Spend twelve years in Azkaban and come out relatively sane, when others in his situation went mad or died of despair in a matter of weeks? Complete, now in chapters, mature material, SBRL slash, but mostly gen

** This is a new fic that goes in depth on Sirius leaving in the first few chapters. It's definitely focused on the Marauders' friendships so far but it's not complete yet.

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from Dec 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.
