I just read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) and it's amazing.

Seriously, the first chapter does an excellent job of setting up Hermione with a just desire for revenge and Malfoy as a truly despicable villain, the heist scenes are thrilling, the parts where Harry almost notices something but is still fooled always made me laugh, the relationship between the two and the chaos after the discovery is well-written, the battle scenes are almost as good as in Divided and Entwined, politics and interactions between aurors are good, there's multiple villains with Voldemort, Crouch and Malfoy, there's no stations of canon or Horcrux hunt, and I just love how Hermione's thoughts are always subtly influenced by her spirit animal.

All in all: 9.8/10, just barely dethroned Divided and Entwined as my second favorite fic. I really enjoyed the brutal guerilla war leader Hermione blowing death eaters up but the heists here are less repetitive, much more creative and definitely more fitting for a Hermione in a slightly less dystopic and corrupt world.

Good job, [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]].


** Opposite opinion.

While the writing is better than average the story's only purpose is to make Hermione into another Merlin. Take an average OP!Harry story, replace him with Hermione and you'll get the same.

The world and magical system are built with it in mind (when only Hermione has and is allowed to use some powerful tools and magic). All raids are designed for her to succeed without many difficulties.

Harry's character is destroyed to a total failure in everything and a doormat without his own opinion.

All other characters are just plot devices.

And the line about that war veterans are deserved to be lied and deceived by their friends and families, because they don't want to talk about their war experiences, is totally disgusting.

*** Harry "didn't want to talk about his war experiences" actually was "he didn't tell Hermione and Sirius that he and Dumbledore used highly-illegal blood magic to kill Voldemort", so he can't complain too much about not being told that Sirius and Hermione robbed Malfoy's cronies blind to break their political power. (And you still refuse to acknowledge that Hermione would have told him, but Sirius forbade it because he thought it would destroy Harry's dream of being an Auror by forcing him to either protect them as an Auror, or join them as a thief.)

Hermione doesn't use anything special that others can't use. She was taught all she knows by Fletcher, and she had had to be saved by Sirius and was almost caught by Harry or fell into a trap during her heists. She is one of the best Curse-Breakers, though, since that's what she focused on - though not as experienced as Fletcher. (And, once again, Harry outclassing almost all Aurors apparently is a-ok in your book - double standards much?)

Harry a total failure? He personally killed Voldemort. He fought and killed, with Ron, Barty Crouch Jr. and the Lestrades. He caught Umbridge. And he deduced correctly, once he had the right clue, that Hermione and Sirius were the robbers he was chasing. (And he stomped her in their duel.) If that's a total failure, I don't want to know what you think is a victory.

Really, you keep lying about my story just because you think Harry should have never forgiven Hermione for keeping a secret from him - on his godfather's orders, no less! (The same guy who, in canon, named his son after two men who kept far worse secrets from him.) And while he himself kept an at least as serious secret from everyone.

************* OK, let's get philosophical.

Firstly, "Light side" exists in fanon, not in canon nor in this fanfic. Even if we suppose, for the sake of argument, that by betraying Voldemort---to protect himself and his own family, not for any altruistic reason---Lucius had, in Dumbledore's eyes, atoned for framing Hermione, corrupting the political system, treason, all of the support he had given Voldemort before turning on him, as well as what torture and murder he had personally committed while wearing the Death Eater mask, why is Hermione bound by Dumbledore's bargain?

Secondly, Hermione's initial expulsion and all subsequent events, including after Voldemort's defeat, showed that the wizard government was profoundly corrupt and systemically unjust even without Voldemort. As a result, it had lost its moral right to impose its monopoly on violence on those whose rights it was failing to protect---Hermione in particular. The right to retaliate against violence---normally yielded to the government---thus reverted to Hermione, as did the right to change the government outside the government's set procedures.

Thirdly, even if we suppose, again, for the sake of argument, that Lucius's betrayal truly gave him a moral blank slate, by continuing to work to perpetuate the unjust government Lucius and his allies were committing new crimes, crimes that were not covered by the bargain.

OK, let me try to be more clear. In Wizengamot, a 40% block (say) can't outvote a 60% block without breaking that block. If the 60% block is held together in part by Lucius's bribes, then it makes sense that impoverishing Lucius will facilitate breaking it. Then, if Lucius no longer being able to pay but Sirius still having unlimited funds, Sirius can now persuade or bribe his way to 50%+1 and enact the reforms, convict purebloods guilty of crimes, fire corrupt Ministry officials, etc.. It's been a while since I read the fic, so I am probably not remembering all the factors involved, but that's the gist of it.

It seems to me that by your logic, if a gang of kidnappers holds up their end of the bargain and releases the hostages, we are morally obligated to not just to pay them their ransom but to not try to arrest them afterwards.

Now, it is, indeed, wrong to give someone less moral consideration because of their birth---their race/ethnicity or magicalness of their parents. That's what the Nazis, Voldemort, and Lucius did.

I don't remember if there have been scenes of the sort in the fic, so we don't know either way. But, whether he did it himself or knowingly and deliberately helped others do it, his degree of culpability isn't that different. Also, in many criminal organisations, an initiate is asked to commit a murder or comparably heinous crime, to prove that they are not a spy and to make it harder for them to switch sides. To me, it feels like a very Voldemort thing to do, as well.

Again, not the point. The point is that bargains and deals aren't sacrosanct. And, even your analogy depends on the government's authority to pardon someone on everyone's behalf. For reasons I have amply discussed upthread, neither Dumbledore nor the Ministry have this authority with respect to Hermione.

Even within your analogy, if this turned mafioso continues committing crimes after his pardon---as Lucius had---not only can he prosecuted for the new crimes, often he can be prosecuted for the old ones as well.

Don't confuse intellectual humility with a concession. Even if we suppose that he never personally cursed anyone, he's been Voldemort's political cover and financier for two decades, and is therefore responsible for more death than any rank-and-file DE mook.

I also note that you haven't gainsaid any of my other charges against Lucius. Even if he is innocent of direct murder, the rest are plenty to justify treating him in bad faith.

Speaking of not liking someone, you seem to be awfully eager to convict Hermione and degrade and infantilise her motivations. Have you considered reflecting on that?

You don't want to accept it, it's your write and I have nothing to add.

I believe in the presumption of innocence. Mental arguments like “you are guilty, because there's no way you aren't guilty even if we can't prove it” lead to corruption and chaos.

Unlike the case with Lucius we have all evidence of Hermione breaking the law with the only purpose of having her revenge.

************************* I am happy to accept your analogy. Like I said, the mafioso (Lucius) turned state's evidence for one state (Dumbledore + Ministry) and was pardoned. However, another state against which he had committed a crime (Hermione) never pardoned him and chose to prosecute him anyway. In addition, Lucius continued committing crimes and could also be held culpable for those.

And, ultimately, this type of deal is explicitly foregoing justice in pursuit of greater justice. If you were able to both get the evidence against the boss /and/ punish the underboss, it would be better than punishing just the boss. So, based on your analogy, defeating Voldemort /and/ punishing Lucius is better than just defeating Voldemort.

So, your analogy isn't doing what you think it's doing.

​

The presumption of innocence argument might make sense inside the story, but we are not holding a trial for Lucius here. We are trying to infer what probably happened in the fic but wasn't explicitly on screen, and the preponderance of evidence is that Lucius is guilty of everything I had listed. That said, we could just ask [[/u/Starfox5]], but I don't think you'd like his answer.

​

> Yes, he is a shitty person and have opposite political views, but it's not a crime.

Even leaving aside that he used criminal means to promote his "political views" throughout, and that he never hesitated to work outside the system to promote his "political views", this sounds like another argument that just because something it's lawful it's good, and just because something is unlawful it's bad. We've already been over this.

What if that government were set up in such a way that no matter what A did to B (perhaps short of grievous bodily harm, but perhaps not even then), the government would /always/ pardon A? Would you accept that under those circumstances, B would, in fact, have the right to retaliate against A?

Because, that's pretty much the situation Hermione (B) was in with respect to Lucius (A). As I wrote several posts upthread, by systematically failing to protect her rights, the Ministry has lost moral authority over Hermione, and Hermione's right to punish those who have violated her rights has reverted to her.

**************************** Let's not continue this "what if and let's suppose". We have what the story has.

Dumbledore and Malfoy had a deal that stopped the war. Hermione didn't like it and decided to get her own way.

There's no evidence against Malfoy.

Yes, he's a shitty person, but again it's not a crime.

Don't want him in power? Go into politics and fight him there.

****************************** Personal insults too?

​

I gave you a flaw in your logic. Your answer started with "What if ...". As I said before personal thoughts and suspicions are not the proof of guilt.

The only thing Malfoy did to Hermione after the war is that he didn't make her innocent. But he wasn't obligated to do it. Also he was crucial in stopping the war. You were keeping ignoring this points.

[Edit]: also for almost everyone during the war Hermione was sitting in the library and waiting while others do the job risking with with their lives. Even from the 3rd standpoint I don't see any reason why a convicted thief should be cleared.

​

Fight with a corrupted government is a very long term project. Yet the heroes didn't see immediate results and decided that they are above the law. Especially after Sirius failed to use political potential of anti-Riddle movement and Malfoy (Riddle's high ranked ex-officer) managed to use pro-Riddle movement.

​

Author's words outside of the story mean nothing. We're taking about the story, not about author's notes.

​

I'm living in a country with very corrupted government. I see with my own eyes how it works and how the opposition works. The way Starfox wrote about it is huge joke and the straight way to a disaster.

Sirius very much used all the momentum of the Anti-Voldemort movement. But, and once again you prove you actually haven't read the story, or make up lies, as a publically hailed hero in the fight against Voldemort, Malfoy actually used the ANTI-Voldemort movement himself, and quite effectively. Hell, the fact that everyone knew Malfoy had risked his life as a spy for Dumbledore was one of the reasons political moves were not enough to dislodge him.

Unless your country actually is run by an aristocracy where anyone but about two dozen people have no legal way to influence the government, your experience means shit. In this Wizarding Britain, the Wizengamot is the highest authority, both for legislative and judiciary concerns, and controls teh Ministry - and it's made up of inherited seats. Which means if you control the majority of the Wizengamot, you control the country. And that means ruining (financially and through loss of face) half a dozen Wizengamot members is a viable way to take control of the country. Much less violent than a coup, and much, much more effective than trying to push reforms which would reduce the power and influence and therefore the security and safety of the very people who are needed to vote for it.

Or, in other words: "Hey, why don't you vote for a real democracy where the Wizengamot is elected and can't make up any law it wants and micro-manage the Ministry to promote their family members" isn't and won't ever be a very popular movement in the Wizengamot. It's not impossible to push it through if you have a lot of money, influence, a reputation as both a hero against Voldemort and a member of the darkest family in Britain and suppotr from a lot of people outside the Wizenagmot for that "we can always fight a war" implication, but you won't manage that if you're facing a man with lots of gold, lots of rich allies, an even better reputation as a hero, and a past as a Death Eater since that pretty much neutralises you and your goals run counter to the selfish interests of the Wizengamot.

So, yeah, your real life experiences mean shit because you're trying to apply them to a completely different system.

  This is a huge flaw in almost all Sarfox's world buildings. If purebloods have absolute power in the Magical Britain, why did they follow Riddle? If Riddle wanted power, it was more reasonable for him to start uprising of muggleborns.
#+end_quote

First, in my stories, the purebloods usually don't have the absolute power - that's reserved for a small clique of "Old Families" with inherited seats in the Wizengamot. The vast majority of the purebloods doesn't have a say in how the country's run, although many of them can exert some influence through an Old Family head related to them. Roman-style client/patron system.

And even those in the Wizengamot were not united - some of them not only wanted more power than they had, they also wanted to prevent Dumbledore's reforms since those were eroding their power. And among those people Voldemort recruited his followers - in addition to those purebloods who wanted more power and had none or not much. As the Dark Lord, he could counter Dumbledore.
