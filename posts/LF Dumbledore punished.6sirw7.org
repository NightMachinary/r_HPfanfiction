Hey guys (and girls/ladies of course, too),

I am again looking for fanfictions, this time I want Dumbledore punished for his sins (leaving Harry at the Dursleys, conducting the war badly (blocking stuff like letting the aurors fight with dark magic and killing deatheaters instead of capturing them - unless they are high value targets of course!), not pushing for the death penalty in the aftermath of the first war (throwing Lucius and "friends" through the Veil or having them kissed by a dementor...or even a plain an simple AK!), using his school as bait for Voldemort (endangering ALL OF HIS STUDENTS in the process!), forcing Harry to compete in the TWT (sorry, but if a binding magical contract was that easy to creat then why didn't they enter Voldemort in the fucking goblet or creat one that made Voldemort a squib by default or something like that?), not killing the DEs himself (after they have bribed their way out of prison! Take them out, interrogate them, steal their money by assuming their identity via polyjuice and when they are of no use anymore? Kill them!) etc. etc.)

Now I want it WITHOUT (the normal) BASHING (if possible!) and without stomping on a man when he's down (I'd be satisfied with Dumbledore's reputation being in tatters and him losing all his positions...not that I'd say no to sticking him into Azkaban...)

Bonus points for:

A more epic office scene (if there is one, it's not a must) where Dumbledore tells Harry the prophecy (can be anything from Harry declaring that divination is hogwash he doesn't believe in to Harry really destroying Dumbledore's office and ripping into the man!)

Durleys get punished (always nice, but again it's a bonus, not a must!)

The order (especially Harry's watchers during the summer) get shouted at, too (stalking kind of is illegal, right (?) - not matter who orders it!)

Dumbledore repenting and trying to fix his misstakes might be nice!

Dumbledore on the run from the law would also be great (I don't think he'd let them imprison him, after all he ran from the aurors when Umbridge came for him!)

Ok, done (except for: NO SLASH...and only really really really good Harry/Ginny (burned out on that!))...THE STAGE IS YOURS and thanks in advance for your work :)

greetings LAX


** Read the stories written by Sinyk and Jessiikaa15. Dumbledore gets absolutely destroyed in them, it's absolutely brutal how much he's fucked with.

Also read linkffn(6963092)

Do be aware that a poorly done Dumbledore bashing story is this sub's collective target for ridicule. These stories I actually liked. Whether that portrayal is realistic is dependent on one's perspective and current mood towards Dumbledore. My opinion on Dumbledore swings all over the place. At the moment, I fancy the kind, benevolent Dumbledore who makes mistakes, but atones for them. I suggest reading some as well.

  Harry walks the halls of Hogwarts seriously injured and is confronted by the Slytherins. They take him to Snape, who uses Legilimency to make a startling discovery. Is Dumbledore really who he says he is? Is Harry really on the right side of the war? Goodish!Voldemort, No Slash, Powerful Harry, Mentor Snape, Good Malfoys, super bad Dumbles, very abused Harry, AU Goblet of Fire

** linkffn(A Dramatic Reading) has him deposed as Headmaster. Nothing too harsh --- he was, after all, still doing things for the greater good and it mostly worked out. And I /seriously/ disagree with counting "not pushing for the death penalty for the DEs" among his faults.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

*** I'm gonna have to agree with you there. Even people like bellatrix don't deserve death. While I would not say no to life imprisoment in a dementor free prison, I don't believe we have a right to play god with a persons life unless there is literally no other way, and it's her or innocents. Otherwise where just as bad in a way as them.

**** What? Terrorists deserve to be killed and Bella (as much as I like the character!) is one, so yes:

She deserves death - but a clean one, no torture (you've got veritaserum, so torture isn't needed, as long as you know what questions to ask!)

Everybody who was/is for locking them up has blood on his/her hands if they ever break out (which they did in canon!)...every death they caused can be layed at the feet of people who indirectly supported Voldemort (without even wanting to!) by being decent human beings (note: In war decency is missplaced and causes more deaths in the long run! Hit the enemy hard, hit the enemy as fast as possible, don't let them recover and for fuck's sake leave your feelings out of it! Show mercy to children, but everybody else? No way!))

***** Yes, but what about when the war is over, you can't kill them then. Jail is the most humane thing to do. If you kill them after the war you're no better than them when they point a wand at a defenceless person. The only difference is their guilt or not in which case that is why they are going to prison.

***** Your spot on,I for one never quite understood why the so called light side saw it fit to handicap themselves the way they did,in a fight where YOUR life is on the line why d heck will u be throwing stunners and mild curses when the enemy is trying to force ur organs to rupture in your body?, it's like bringing a knife to a gun fight,no matter how lucky or good you are you will loose. In a war the dude with the nuke always wins.period.unless this other dude talking about being humane is one of the people that believe in honor in a fight and all that hogwash. In a fight ensure survival first then you can worry about your honor after. Even if they don't want to kill they could have put them down HARD,A lost limb or two will go a long way in ensuring that the opposition stays down good.all that being said it's one of the reasons I always believed that harry and friends should have died,they we're being hunted,voldie basically controlled the ministry,the sheep of the wizarding community weren't doing anything to help (left the fighting to school kids and professors)And while I respect flitwick and the rest of the Hogwarts staff for their skills the death eaters don't exactly pull punches.so all things considered they survived because of unreasonably thick plot armour,plot armour is all well and good but not to the point you start questioning the common sense behind some things. So killing is well a horrible thing but when the enemy are people that torture rape and think it's alright to murder babies in their cribs you really need to ask yourself between their death and incarceration(where they could escape if they really tried)which decision will you regret the least.
