My submission is [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger And the Goblet Of Fire]] because the Second Task is considerably more difficult for the Champions to accomplish than the canon Task. Instead of merely standing on the edge of the Black Lake and waiting for a whistle, Hermione and the other champions are taken to the Forbidden Forest and must travel back to the castle for several hours during the night and then rescue their hostages from the water.

The search function returned only three ideas from a previous thread: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter And the Temporal Beacon]], jbern's frequently recommended [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]], and robst's always contentious [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]]. Do you know of a story featuring an interesting twist or completely new idea for the TWT tasks? If so please post it below.

Thanks for contributing!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][Patron]] by Starfox5 is just starting out, but the Triwizard Tournament has been heavily reimagined, with four Tasks (one themed after each Classical element) for the Champions, as well as some interscholastic competitions for the rest of the delegates from each school. (When you think about it, isn't it kind of weird that a score of the best students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang spend a year at Hogwarts for no reason but to watch their Champions? In Patron, they actually get to /do/ something.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/][Hogwarts Battle School]] by [[/u/KwanLi]] has a variant where rather than a single Champion from each school competing, teams drawn from the best students of each school compete in team tasks. Needless to say, the tasks are rather different.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/][The Snow Queen]] by [[/u/Darklooshkin]] changes the venue of the Second Task after the amusingly homicidal fem!Harry's antics lead the merfolk to bar her from entering their fragile ecosystem.

I also seem to recall that /Harry McGonagall/ fics had different tasks, but I also seem to recall that the tasks were less interesting than canon, so meh.

--------------

Speaking of /Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/, are there any other decent fics where Hermione ends up being a Champion in the Tournament? I thought it was a very interesting exploration of how someone not as fearless or as athletic, but more diligent and better at magic than Harry, would fare.

**** And before you ask, no, it's not dead. I'm simply engaged in rewrite #15 so far after getting a new job, moving in with my future wife and generally adjusting to my life going from 'fuckmustfindanewjob' to 'holyshitIhaveanawesomejobbrbgotacareertomake'...

Tight in time indeed.

But it's almost finished! Halle-fucking-lujah!

** There's also Landstradd's The Sorting Hat's Stand. It's abandoned, and was being rewritten, but that was 3 years ago. But there are still more than 3 tasks. Thing is, it starts at Philosopher's Stone. So you'll have to go through 3 years of superpowers before the TWT. Still, it wasn't bad at all, to my memory. Just a little gratuitous with some plot points. (super occlumency, familiar revelation, flamels). But the TWT is really trying for him, so it's not like there's no conflict.

** The Temporal Beacon is fantastic and if you haven't read it I highly recommend it, basic premise is Harry and Hermione make a reusable time machine.

*SPOILERS*

Every time they go back they do something that causes the challenges to be different, like Harry goes through once and it's different from canon but still standard for the story, then he goes through through a second time and destroys a Horcrux early...causing an international incident that results in different animals being procured. Third time he's so well practiced they get suspicious and decide he's cheating so introduce new tasks and duels to try and trip him up. It's a fantastic story all the way through though.

** Completely tangential thought sparked by the first recommended fic.... Has anyone ever seen or written a fanfic where the characters of Harry and Hermione are combined? Like, Hermione Potter, bossy Gryffindor bookworm and girl-who-lived who was neglected at home and looked down on for being a know-it-all. I mean, that may be an entirely terrible idea, but I'm just suddenly wondering how Hermione would have reacted to being in the situations Harry was in, instead of just making 'Harriet'.

***** No I knew what you meant but couldn't resist.

The first task of Hermione Granger And the Goblet Of Fire is pretty similar to canon. Without Quidditch skills she's reduced to using some other tactics.

For a /main character/ Hermione Potter I think it would be really difficult to do. JKR had to give a purposefully unhelpful librarian in order to stretch out some of her plots: "I would like to apologize for you and any other librarians (crowd laughs) present here today and my get-out clause is always if they'd had a pleasant, helpful librarian, half my plots would be gone. 'Cause the answer invariably is in a book but Hermione has to go and find it. If they'd had a good librarian, that would have been that problem solved. So ... sorry." (HCG)

Imagine how much conflict within a story would be diminished by having someone with Hermione's intelligence as the protagonist.

****** Conflict within a story? /Me????/ When I'm not reading Harry/Voldemort I'm reading cliched time travel or do-over fics in which Harry already knows everything that's going to happen anyway, nevermind finding it in a book ;) And there's ways to introduce plot even with someone as intelligent as Hermione. After all, she may be intelligent, but unlike Harry, she's not reckless or self-sacrificing, she doesn't have a hero-complex, she has an overdeveloped respect for authority, was never naturally gifted at duelling, and is socially incompetent

^{hey, me too! /cough/}

It always bothers me that characters would be deliberately made incompetent for the sake of plot. Like, I was reading a book last night, and the ordinarily incredibly intelligent, well-read main character took another third of the book to solve the first part of a riddle that I understood as soon as I read it. Me. I /suck/ at riddles! Now, let me explain just how frustrating this is - the riddle told the location of three objects with clues, and the first riddle showed the first object to be *in the room she was standing in*. /All she had to do was turn around, and she would have got it./ Instead, she had to solve an anagram that /spelled out/ the answer for her, some countless chapters later. And yet, in other situations she is portrayed to be quick-witted and intelligent enough to become famous and feared across the country since the age of sixteen.

Anyways, I think there can be a successful balance of intelligent characters and satisfying challenges for them to overcome, but even if there isn't, it would still be fun watching her breeze through the problems of Harry's life.

Sort of... In PS she set Snape on fire. In CS she stole ingredients from him for Polyjuice. In PA she attacked him in the Shrieking Shack. By the time Snape had to leave Hogwarts in the final moments of HBP it was a wonder he could still walk.

In any case, though, I think I take your meaning that she has enough character flaws that it wouldn't be smooth sailing. It's an interesting idea. You should write it! =)

******** I guess attempted murder kind of reduces someone's authority in her eyes ;D but for some reason I could swear she was always saying "ohh, Harry, you should tell a professor" and "you need to tell Professor Dumbledore" and "don't do it yourself, this is the professors' job and they should handle it!" Things like that.

And either I lost the ability to write, or I always sucked at it but didn't realise. I mean, I can write /scenes/, I have a big document I just wrote yesterday instead of my term paper, but I can't do actual /stories/ with actual /endings/ and /plot/ and /story arcs/ and /foreshadowing/ and /conflict/ and stuff.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] by Jbern. New tasks plus interesting variations on the classic three. Plus the writing is very well done, witty, good story, and a new take on an independent Harry.

** Harry Crow isn't contentious -- it's shit by any standards.

TLIL undoubtedly has the best alternate TWT, but I always liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9818387/13/The-Amplitude-Frequency-and-Resistance-of-the-Soul-Bond][The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond]]. Its quite an amusing read as long as you don't take it very seriously, which is really the only way to enjoy soul bond stories anyway.

I actually think Harry Crow could have been very well done if there had been a lot more conflict. Unfortunately the Goblins fix nearly every problem and Harry & Co. are never really in any danger.
