I know this has been asked before...but! Are there any fics out there that are completed?

I hate coming across one that is perfect but incomplete and you just know the author won't complete it! Does anyone have good recs? I know most of them were scrubbed for some reason.

  for some reason

legal issues mostly. fanfiction is already in a grey area legally. if it was a totally free story originally it wouldn't matter, but lawyer types have to at least /try/ and cut down on illegal copies of the story (which "reading" type stories kinda count as)
