Easily one of my favorite time-travel stories of all-time.

Easily one of the best slash fics of all-time.

Incomplete, but frequent updates.

/Read it/. If you're really against slash, this fic doesn't get explicit, and the pairing is done very well and /realistically/.

Harry is not OP. He struggles and makes mistakes and is wrong and, in general, has a severe lack of control in a lot of things.

** You say Harry isn't OP, but there's a wide gulf of talent between canon Harry and OP Harry. Where on that scale does this Harry fall?

Let's say for the sake of argument:

#+begin_quote
  0 - Squib/Muggle

  10 - Early Neville

  20 - Average wizard

  40 - canon Harry

  60 - Snape

  90 - Dumbledore/Voldemort
#+end_quote

I'd identify anything 91+ as "OP", and generally only read fics where Harry is in the range of 60-90.

*** Mmm 50-70? Some very creative spell use involved, and he practices wandless magic, and eventually gets trained in more effective battle strategies. But I'd DEFINITELY recommend it. It's a great story, and very original and believable.

*** Harry in this story is definitely nowhere near Dumbledore or Voldemort.

I'd put him at 45-55 in the beginning. Maybe 60-70 near where we are now.

*** I'm gonna be The Guy(tm) but would you really rate canon Harry that much higher over canon average wizards?

He's an average student. The only impressive spell stuff we know he does is the Patronus, which adults apparently have problems doing, until he teaches all of the DA to do(making it obviously not THAT impressive after all). He spends the whole series using like 3 spells.

**** u/Taure:
#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes.

Firstly, it's important to remember that Harry knows a lot more magic (and a lot more /about/ magic) that we do. We see the series through his eyes but we don't see everything he does. Most notably, we see very little of Harry's time learning magic which is, of course, what he actually spends most of his time doing at Hogwarts. You know, given that it's a school of magic and he attends his classes and does his homework.

We see the above when Harry frequently pulls spells out his arse that we've never seen him learn. This was especially true during DH: confringo, deprimo, expulso, etc, not to mention the spells protecting the campsite.

Secondly, it's important to remember that the average wizard isn't actually very good at magic: recall that most wizards can't cast a shield charm, for example, a spell which Harry could cast at age 14.

The Shield Charm is tested in the O.W.L. exams. Those exams are the magical analogue of the GCSE exams which English children take IRL at age 16. The "passing grades" are generally considered A/-C. About 70% of children achieve at least one A/-C grade, meaning 30% of people fail completely in all their subjects. When you narrow this down to students who get 5 A*-C grades including the core subjects of English and Mathematics (which might be called the equivalent of a US high school diploma), that percentage falls to 54% ([[http://www.bstubbs.co.uk/5a-c.htm#table1][source]]). General wizarding incompetence is intended to reflect general Muggle incompetence.

Thirdly, Harry has a fairly impressive list of magical achievements to his name, though he generally learns best by doing rather than from books.

- As mentioned above, he learnt the Shield Charm at age 14, along with a number of other powerful spells like the Stunning Charm, Impediment Jinx etc.

- He mastered the Patronus at age 13. This is impressive because he can conjure it /in the presence of Dementors/. In PoA, Harry first conjures a corporeal Patronus against Draco, and he remarks that it was surprisingly easy to do. It is't until months later that he is first able to cast it in the presence of Dementors. The DA conjuring the Patronus in safe conditions doesn't hold a candle to Harry using it against Dementors, and doesn't really count as having properly mastered the spell (if you can't use it in the situation it's actually useful in, it's just a light show).

- He also regularly goes toe to toe Death Eaters: in OotP, in HBP, in the escape from Privet Drive and at the Battle of Hogwarts. he loses to Snape pretty badly in HBP, that Snape has some pretty specific advantages. Advantages which are later nullified because -

- In DH, Harry masters occlumency and legilimency.

- Most impressively, he beat Voldemort in a battle of wills, both by throwing off his Imperius curse and defeating him in Priori Incantatem.

#+end_quote

Uuuuhhhhh, does he, though? I would wager that, in general, you seem to have a much better grasp on canon off the top of your head than I do, so I'm aware that I could be 100% wrong, here - especially something like this that's just vague enough to make searching for the answer difficult.

I guess you could say that Harry had a handle on Occlumency by DH, but even then I was more under the impression that Voldemort just wouldn't touch his mind after Harry love-raped him in OotP.

But... legilimency? I don't recall /ever/ reading that Harry even /looked into/ studying it, let alone having used it, let alone having been good at it, let alone having mastered it?

****** Don't have time to fully address this now but see this comment chain for most of my answer: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/axw8kb/favorite_moments_in_the_hp_series_shameless/ehza9mi/?context=10000]]

The only other thing to add to that thread is that after the quoted passage where Harry masters occlumency, he proceeds to deliberately enter Voldemort's mind at least 2 times (and I think it was maybe 3-4 but I don't have books to hand). And as the linked thread mentions, Snape tells us in OotP that the scar connection is a /conduit/ for legilimency which allows it to bypass its normal limits of time and space. It's still legilimency being used.

**** I'm glad someone was able to articulate my feelings on the matter. :)

And yes, I've been simultaneously frustrated by Harry's lack of knowledge and intrigued that the author went this route.

I'm so used to reading fics where Harry/Dumbledore figure out that Voldemort has horcruxes in the first fifteen minutes of the fic that it's refreshing (even if I sometimes want to bang my head against a wall) he is completely unaware.

** So, so good. I really like the fact that Harry isn't really that great a person and that he's seriously messed up his friendships with people mainly because he's a prat.

Great world building.

Great characters.
