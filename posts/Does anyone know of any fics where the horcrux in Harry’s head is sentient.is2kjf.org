It's one of my favorite tropes, along with Harry befriending the diary horcrux.


** Linkffn(Soul and Body by LF74) is the most recent one I can remember reading and its pretty good. Still in progress and hasn't updated in a while, but not abandoned as far as I know.

  Everyone knows that wizarding children often take on an aspect of magic during their childhood. Innate specialties. Children of quidditch players might be able to fly without a broom for a time, those raised by fisherman might be able to manipulate water with great ease. Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts able to heal from any injury. At least he's got Tom keeping him company.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
