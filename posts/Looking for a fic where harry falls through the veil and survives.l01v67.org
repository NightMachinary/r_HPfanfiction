:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Sirius doesn't fall through the veil. They all think harry is dead. However after everyone leaves the department of mysteries harry is spat out of the veil. Harry decides to create an alias, I think he goes by the name of "phoenix" or something like that. He helps the order take down voldemort and eventually reveals himself as being alive.

  What if instead of dying, the Killing Curse sends Harry two years into the past into the Department of Mysteries? Will Harry be able to save those who died for him and destroy all the Horcruxes without Voldemort knowing or will he end up dead himself?

** I remember a story where Harry goes insane and they (as in the minister and remnants of the Order) try to off him but they just can't...

Now, I may be making this up mixing stories but he wasn't on Voldemort's side. He wasn't “dark” like the political side or magical side, but like the “this man is so fucking traumatized he went on a killing spree”. It wasn't angst either!

Damn it! Now I want to find it again. It was good...

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
