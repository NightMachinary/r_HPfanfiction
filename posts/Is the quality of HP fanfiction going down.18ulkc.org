What do you think? Has the amount of really quality HP fanfic gone down? Or is it just harder to find it?


** To me, it seems about the same; you have to sort through a bunch of very poorly written/clich√©d stories to find one that's worth your time, at least in my opinion. I still manage to find a gem every now and then. If anything, I think the amount of fanfiction being published is decreasing.

*** Have you noticed any correlation between the length of a story, and quality? I like to think that a novel-length story would be of higher quality, but I haven't forayed into the wild world of HP FF archives to test the theory.

**** It isn't always the case. Some novel-length stories are wonderful, and some aren't. A lot of it comes down to poor grammar and sentence structure for me; I'll stop reading almost immediately if an author can't spell. The same can be said for short stories or one shots. If someone thanks his or her "beta" in the author's notes, there's a higher chance of the story being...well, good; it means that it has been proof-read.

***** Ahh, okay. I think I couldn't stand a short story in he world of Harry Potter. I loved opening the first pages of the larger books, knowing that there was a long story ahead of me. I've read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, which I liked. I'm searching for other long stories to read, and will give this subreddit the once-over.

**** I actually find that more authors are comfortable with short stories than novels. Novel-lengths require a lot more initial planning and have to be consistent and well-paced for tens of thousands more words, and I'm usually a kind of disappointed with the latter half of novels (unfortunately, when I write too :P). But short stories tend to be character studies, and perhaps you prefer the novel-length adventure genre more, if you like Dumbledore's Army?

***** I've noticed that. I know an author with hundreds of fics, most of which are less than 5000 words. But a long fic doesn't mean a novel. Sometimes its more of a collection of one-shots with some common theme rather than actual plotted stories.

**** I think there is a correlation, though long=good. I read the first few paragraphs of the opening chapter and a lot of it hinges on that. I've been known to close a tab after the first sentence.

It usually doesn't take that much time to distinguish between the good and the bad.

***** Yes, looking at the stats for my multi-chapter fics, it looks like about 50% move on from the first chapters. Unless that is a quirk of ffnet's configuration (ie, everyone tends to go to the first chapter then jump forward to the newest one.

But from what I can see, it's true--people judge things fast and based on just a few sentences.

** In addition to the rest of the answers, the longer you read fanfiction, your standards probably tend to be higher, as you've read much more and when you run into great fics, you start comparing new fics to those.

*** This is a good point. I've certainly gone back months or even years after bookmarking or favoriting a fic, to reread it, and been stumped as to why the hell I liked this piece of crap so much.

**** YES. I started reading fanfic a decade ago, and I read SO much that I loved. Now, I realize a lot of it was bloated, inconsistant, wildly out of character, etc. I think that in ten years of reading and studying structure and character (in theatre), I've gotten a lot pickier.

It does seem hard to find a good, well-edited fic nowadays. But that may be more due to my life-experience/work-experience as an editor.

***** When it comes to issues of structure and style, I do try to be somewhat lax, since it's not professional, but something done for enjoyment in a writer's spare time. However, that is far easier said than done. I agree that it can be frustrating trying to find someone with /any/ sense of what makes good writing.

Especially heartbreaking to me are the basic mistakes -- when I can't bring myself to continue reading a story with a promising plot, or good characterization, or what have you, just because they can't be bothered about spell checking or giving their story a cursory read-through. Though I am not an editor by vocation, I was the copy editor of my high school newspaper and am the go-to friend for proofreading and editing when it comes to college papers, resumes, etc. for my friends and family -- so I definitely feel your pain.

** I'm still not sure if quality is going down, or people are so busy trying to be original that they pick bad plots and worse pairings.

Things get cliche because they work, and they get repeated. HP Fanfiction has been around so long that pretty much Everything is now cliche.

Personally, I just own the cliche, make it my own, apologize for things that look familiar because they should be familiar unless you are new to fanfic, in which case I also try to shout out to the great ones who came up with the cliches in the first place. That points people to the oldybutgoody authors/stories.

Some of the great ones are still out there writing new stuff, but you have to be willing to read WIP and possibly go months without an update. I don't consider myself an oldy by any means, but when it comes to smut-foo I'm a great one and I own it. I'm trying with at least one of my stories to go for substance of plot instead of hormonal addiction, but it isn't easy.

Do what I did, if you've read everything good, if you ask for recommendations only to find that you've already read all of them, it is time to start writing your own and possibly add some good stuff back to the community, or find a different fandom.

Personally I find it interesting that Naruto seems to be just as good in many of the same ways, as HP. As long as you can put up with authors who keep all the crappy parts of canon intact...I'm of the opinion that FF is better than what has happened since Kushina showed up to help Naruto***/spoiler removed/***...

Anyways, there has ALWAYS been a lot of crap in with the good stuff, but I agree that the ratio is way off lately. I almost feel like bad authors are just writing for the biggest fandom because they think they will get more reviews that way. As opposed to writing a really good fic, in a really underexposed fandom.

*** I agree with you about the cliche thing. I've read more than my fair share of big HP fanfic tropes, like time travel, powerful!Harry, etc. and I'm of the opinion that almost any plot device can be made enjoyable in the right hands. It's not like the Harry Potter books themselves are totally groundbreaking and unique. But all that said, often times bad writers cling to the cliches because it takes less effort, I think.

Could you link to some of your writings? I'd be curious to read what you've got.

** I also agree that the quality hasn't changed, but the volume has. With less authors posting stories, even if there are still 1 in 100 great fics, there are 10 times fewer out there now, leading people to bottleneck the few good ones, and wonder what happened to 'all the great works'.

** I think, as we get deeper into the fandom culture, we get pickier, and not all of it is about canon-correct detailing and writing quality.

Example: when I first got into HP fic, I read a lot of stuff on sugarquill and saved a bunch of that to disk. Nowadays that's just so much wasted space on my machine because sugarquill is a HeRon-shipping site and, after seeing how badly H/G, R/Hr were handled in canon, I regard anything written to those ships with revulsion. I'll still look into and maybe read a well-constructed H/G fic (NoFP, Mutant Storm) with a solidly-built relationship, but there's a real judgmental hurdle for it to overcome before I'll even consider following it. *That's me and YMMV on ships,* but I think we're all filtering like that.
