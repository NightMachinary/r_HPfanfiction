To help narrow down what I'm looking for, I've greatly enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005360/1/The-Dragon-of-Moria][The Dragon of Moria]]. It's a shame it's so short. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10884162/1/][Incendio]] could've been written better, but it was cute and I liked it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/][Enter the Dragon]] is technically well-written, but the goblin cliche and Harry's continued immaturity put me off it.

(Also if you know of any fics with dragon protagonists that don't involve Harry Potter I'll take them too.)


** Linkffn(We, Harry Potter) is a unique take

*** Unique is a good word for it. I enjoyed it for the first several chapters, but then it got ... weird.

**** Author here! In my defense, I wrote it weird because I wanted it to be weird. That was the sort of story I wanted to put on paper. I can't write for a general audience; I have to write for me and me alone, otherwise the ideas just don't come to me, and I share what I make just because. I'm glad you liked what you liked and sad you didn't like what you didn't, but I wouldn't change it --- except maybe to improve it on a technical level. Not everything I make is a hit, but that's just fine with me.

The bot is working for story IDs and I think direct links, just not for name searches.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

*** The first one is excellent, yes. I hadn't seen the rest before, but I love them. The Batman one is fun to read, and I wouldn't have thought that particular AU would work so well. The Good Omens one is just adorable, and the last story is incredibly cute. Thank you for the links. :)

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.
