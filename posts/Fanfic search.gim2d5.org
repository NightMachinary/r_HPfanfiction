:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic that, in one chapter in response to draco getting the Slytherin team nimbus 2001s Harry contacts foreign broom companies and said companies decide to sponsor Gryffindor quidditch team with said team using brooms that were created by said foreign broom conpany


** Hmm. Apart from specifically being foreign, something very similar happens in Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. It's not available on FFN anymore, though, and they won't answer questions about why (but the takedown seems pretty bogus).

You can get a PDF up to chapter 43 from [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]]

*** Found this on TV Tropes

#+begin_quote
  On May 13, 2019 the story disappeared from FanFiction.net, with the author clarifying on his website that this was due to an accusation of copyright infringement involving song lyrics, though it is still available at other locations and he is appealing to the site directors to undo their decision.

I find it weird that would happen. I'd think using lyrics as part of the story would qualify as fair use.

**** The message he received was a bit unclear, and could even have implied that he didn't own the story.But in any case, ffn have apparently ignored all further correspondence. I even tried emailing them myself about it; no reply.

***** It's really confusing, either way, that story was one of the most popular fics in the HP fandom (I believe it was on the first page when you sort fics by the number of favorites they have). FFN is digging its own grave slowly here.

**** That doesn't include chapter 43 though. Similarly, [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=9305][SIYE]] only goes to chapter 40, and [[https://www.hogwartsishere.com/library/book/979/][Hogwarts is Here]] only has chapter 39.

** Not exactly what you're looking for but in the story Can't Have It Both Ways by RobSt. Harry gets 4 broom manufacturers (Nimbus, Golden Arrow, Firebolt, and Vitesse) to each sponsor a house for a junior team. Then each Champion would coach the team. So they first drew the name of a champion, the house, and then the Broom company. And repeated until all 4 had been selected.

  If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr
