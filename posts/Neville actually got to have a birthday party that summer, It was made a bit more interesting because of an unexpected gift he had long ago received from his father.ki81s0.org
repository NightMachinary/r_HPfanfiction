** I think this has potential neville as a sort of walter white and( while I'd prefer harry ) draco as his jesse neville slowly dives deeper and deeper into darkness as he either has bad things happen to him like he gets a call saying that his parents had been killed causing him to fall further while malfoy realizes that this death eater/underworld shot isn't really for him he starts a relationship with a Gryffindor girl but she ends up dying because of neville's scheme putting him and neville at odds
