Other than this subreddit, of course. Most communities that were once active seem to have become ghost towns. Are there still any sites that have 20+ posters everyday?


** Dark Lord Potter Forums.

And the FF.net Communities

Other than those two the subreddit is the only place where I see constant activity.

**** It's more active than this subreddit, and you don't get the continual repeated topics. There's also a standard of quality, which some people might appreciate.

**** I'd say you should go ahead and join. I'm a pretty new member to the forums (I joined last July), and I've really enjoyed my time there until now. The community isn't as bad as people say it is, and it definitely is a lot more welcoming to new members than it has been in the past. As long as you act intelligently, back up your claims with solid reasoning, and don't go full troll mode, you'll be fine.

Before you join, though, I would recommend lurking and getting the general feel of the community before posting. There are several things that new members shouldn't do (e.g. try to change the DLP atmosphere and values, declaring your everlasting love for slash), and lurking will really help you know what and what not to do.

** Now, maybe it's the Stockholm's speaking, but there's no community I love more than DLP.

I know the site's always been a bit of a point of contention on this subreddit, but I wanted to share my thoughts on why DLP's still going strong after all these years, even as every other HP-oriented site started dropping like flies.

Been a member since 2009 and if anything, DLP's probably become /more/ active, not less - there's quality daily discussion on a whole lot of HP topics from the mechanics of the world to what recent quality fanfiction is out there, but HP discussion has really only ever been the tip of the iceberg.

There's an atmosphere of thoughtfulness to the discussion - people try to contribute and explore ideas together, and reading each thread you'll find the opinions or conclusions evolving as the discussion continues; it's a world of difference from websites like reddit that reward the best and quickest throwaway comment, where the hiveminds flourish and everything's forgotten the next day.

(Like this post. I probably spent more than 40 minutes writing this overall, but on reddit you probably shouldn't bother - you've already missed your window of opportunity if you don't reply straight away.)

The people on DLP are great. Bunch of bastards, but great. The somewhat caustic attitude towards idiots is probably actually what has allowed the community to flourish: annoying posters and fools, people who drag the discussion down, rapidly either end up shaping up or shutting up - and the result is a community full of people I really respect, and love to talk to.

I've made some of the best friends of my life over at DLP; shared an overpriced pint or six in a cramped pub in London with quite a few of them. A lot of the same people who were around ten years ago are still around today, probably for the same reasons I am: I've never seen a community more satisfying to be part of anywhere else on the web.

We didn't do it.

That knife covered in blood? Not ours. We just found it.

In fact, I'm pretty sure I saw Potter's Place 3 looking at FanFictionAuthors. You might want to question him instead.

... I want my phone call.

***** I mean, when DLP sends its fics, they're not sending the best. They're sending fics that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems. They're bringing bad writing, they're bringing terrible characters. And some of them, I assume, are good stories.

** The Teacher's Lounge at FFN is very active.

There is a very modest one I have just started at fictionpad.com, there's only a couple of us but it's only been open a few days. I'm hoping to grow it to be a writing focused forum
