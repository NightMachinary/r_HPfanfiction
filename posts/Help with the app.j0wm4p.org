Is there a way to mark fics to read later on the fanfiction.net app on Android without putting them on my favorites list? I just downloaded the app and can't seem to figure out if it's possible.


** I use the 'followed stories' section for my unread/ yet to read fics , and the 'favorites' section for my favorite fics.

*** Thank you for that suggestion. I never got a notification that someone replied here or I'd have said thank you earlier.
