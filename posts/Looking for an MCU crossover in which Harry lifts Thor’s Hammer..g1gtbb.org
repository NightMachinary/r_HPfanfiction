  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

What exactly happens in this fic? The description is singularily unhelpful. It sounds like a prompt that would make a good one-shot, but you can only stretch it out so long.

Like, the unhelpfulness of this description is perplexing to me for some reason.

**** All of that covers up to chapter 3.

It happens, they bond. They reveal themselves to the friends and family. James/Loki is punched in the face like four more times. Besides the training, there's some political stuff going on with the American Magical Congress, some stuff in the British ministry, and a few battles.

Ron isn't bashed. Dumbledore is showed to be manipulative, but not bashed for it.

The Harry/Hermione/Ron interaction is great in this one.

It's not 100% finished, the epilogue chapter is left.

For me, it was the fact that Harry channeled his anger towards something and made it happen instead of angsting in it or lashing out at his friends.

  Harry finds out that his dad is alive, has been the whole time. Instead of being overjoyed, Harry's disgusted. His dad left earth and abandoned his friends. Every painful thing he's ever gone through can be traced back to one man. Now Harry's got super strength he can't control and an almost unnecessary amount of magical power. His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.

*** God this fic, it so good but so funking long. When I first read it I was too worn out to continue onto the sequel. By the time I felt like giving it a go I had forgotten most of what happened in the first one and had to read it all over again, and then felt too worn out to read the sequel.

This has happened at least three time now.

***** I feel he suffers from the same problem that George RR Martin does, that he came up with an initial idea, but over the course of writing let it grow wildly out of control. I do feel that there wasn't a need for as many different fandoms that ended up being in the crossover, it's been a while since I last read it, but I think with some restructuring you could have cut all the Dresden stuff, and Im not just saying that because I have never watched/read/whatever he's from.

****** I disagree: my favorite thing is that there are so many fandoms involved (also, read /The Dresden Files/, they're excellent); it's that the author is so staggeringly bad at trimming.

Go and re-read the series: how many times does something get explained that the audience already knows, with no difference in the telling or in characters' reactions? How often does Harry or somebody else relay his entire life story?

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...
