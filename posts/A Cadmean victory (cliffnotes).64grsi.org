Basically what the title says. I wish to know a bit about this story before i commit to it like how close does it stick to source material? How powerful is harry in this and maybe a vague timeline of how that power increases and when? How is his relationship with the people of the ministry and hogwarts? And will he be hermione smart or luna spacey or ron weasley dumb etc...Sorry usually i don't want to know anything about a story until i've read it but at half a million words with i want to know a bit about it because when i start a story i don't read anything else until i've finished it.


** Well, Harry "powers up" pretty quickly and is more on the 'Hermione-Smart' end of things but more so. His relationship with basically everyone is utter shit.

This was a fic that I thought had a lot of potential, but then the summer between 4th and 5th year hit and it turned to crap.

**** Better than most/all students by end of 4th year, and at the end /maybe/ better than Dumbledore, but [[/spoiler][not quite as good as Voldemort]].

**** It never shows Dumbledore doing great magical feats, but i don't think he ever gets to that level. Most students sure, but not Dumbledore/Voldemort level.

He is quite smart, but not at the level of 'i know everything about everything'. His relationship with most people starts out antagonistic and slowly changes to indifferent. There are some exceptions, but it isn't really a fic about large friend circles and group hugs.

It is a good fic, and everyone has their own opinion about it. I feel that everyone should read it at least once.

** It's boring wish-fulfillment, at best.

** It's certainly not a fic a lot of people will tend to forget about, if only for the unforgivable waste of potential the second half of it is.
