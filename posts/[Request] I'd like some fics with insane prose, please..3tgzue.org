I'm aware of three:

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus)

linkffn(The Eyes)

linkffn(HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)

Others will be appreciated. Maybe a Luna centric fic? Thanks to all suggesters!


** linkffn(To Children Ardent For Some Desperate Glory; Phantom Limb by rbackwards) contain some unusual prose.

  To Children Ardent For Some Desperate Glory
#+end_quote

Ha, author here. People seem to have been remembering/discovering this story a fair bit lately, which is half-way between flattering and perplexing. (I wrote it when I was 18 or 19, and it is consequently bad in every way.) The prose is definitely experimental, to say the least, but I wouldn't recommend reading it.

I have been banging away, off and on, at an expanded and better-conceived version of what's more or less the same tale, so hey, do read that if it ever appears.

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
