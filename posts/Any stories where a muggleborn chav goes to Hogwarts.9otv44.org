I'm sick of all these "Lord-this-and-that" stories where the purebloods have an upper-class culture and the muggleborns (starting with Hermione) learn how to imitate it in hopes of being taken seriously.

As I understand it, chav is the Brit slang word for Britain's weird ghetto/redneck mix of working class culture? Any examples of a character (OC or canon is fine) like that getting a Hogwarts letter and being unapologetically crass? Maybe some crack?


** There was a funny and popular post on Tumblr a while ago that pointed out that Lily Evans was actually from a working class town in the midlands, so she probably had a strong working class accent.

** Hermione isn't imitating them. Quite honestly she is just her own and equally prissy flavour of snob...She spends her summers in France, both of her parents are in the medical field and have their own Dental practice, Hermione even has an upper class view of charitable works. Not every pureblood family has money, but the ones that do are pretty old families just like the peerage in England, but some eventual become impoverished due to their scions running off to North America and idiocy and whatnot.

​

TL;DR

Chavers are basically Dudley and his friends and I don't want that bloke representing Muggleborn Wizards. If it were me learning I had access to a huge world ripe for power vacuum, I would definitely just imitate those with societal power and study hard, fake it until I make it so that I can snag a man with elderly parents and a fat inheritance *coughLilycough*.

*** You are amazing, I don't even know why my first instinct is to ask this group something when I should just google, lol. I guess I just thought it was so unlikely that it would take some sort of deep hidden knowledge rather than be right there in the title.

As for Hermione, I agree that's the way it is in canon, but I was thinking more of fics like, say, Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, where she is specifically given lessons in ways to speak and even walk like purebloods, and then later rounds up a group of muggleborns to share the secrets of pureblood culture, that sort of thing.

** I'm not entirely confident that I would be able to identify a chav but linkffn(Not Fade Away) by Slide involves quite a few muggleborns from non-'generic' backgrounds.

The story also happens to be an absolutely amazing depiction of 1970s Wizarding Britain. Unfortunately, it is abandoned.

Edit: I don't know how to fix a bad FanFictionBot link so I'll just link to the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4095/Slide][story]]
