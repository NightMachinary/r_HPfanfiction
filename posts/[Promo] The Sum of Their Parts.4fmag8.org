** A good origin story for Dark Lord Harry. It builds a good world where Harry willingly becomes Dark without him going off his rocker or losing his friends.

My only complaint is that I want a sequel. This fic is about how Harry /becomes/ Dark, and I want to see what he does with the power.

** Just read this and I have to say, while it's not the most prosy fanfic I've ever read, it has a decent plot and is one of the few Dark Lord!Harry fanfics that explains how he came to the decision and managed to get Ron and Hermione to go along with it, without having to bash any one character specifically. I really enjoyed this and wanted to share it with everyone here.

*** Second his recommendation with a huge reservation that this fic could do with a third act. Yes, I find this fic incredibly realistic and Harry, unlike many other Grey! Or Dark! Stories is well aware that he cannot check himself, not be a one man army. It explores their friendship and bonds between all three of them. All in all it has that high quality that makes you wish the author could write more on the best portrayal of a Dark Lord Potter.

** Decent fic but it could have done with more violence or evil as a Dark!Harry story.

*** My interpretation is that he wasn't actually a Dark!Harry until right before the Epilogue, where it says

#+begin_quote
  [[/spoiler][A Dark Lord needed gold, and magic, and followers. Maybe it was time to take up some of those thinly veiled requests to swear allegiance to him]]
#+end_quote

Really, until then he is essentially just a vigilante.

*** Even in the epilogue, he wasn't evil or else Neville and Susan would have turned against him.

He was more like a ruthless dictator.

**** I'd not even call him a ruthless dictator. Just the kind of "Moral Conscience" this story's Wizarding Britain needs and deserves.

***** True. He would be no worse than Alexander, Caesar, Octavian, Napoleon, Peter the Great, and Chinese Emperor Tang Taizong (who butchered two of his brothers and still ranked as one of the best Chinese emperors ever).

****** He'd be no worse than anyone who ever took up arms to combat tyranny. In the story, it's quite obvious that the Ministry is, if not outright evil, then on the way there.

***** How about Napoleon? Power hungry, sure, but not evil. His reforms helped rid France of centuries-old oppression like serfdom, and his reformed law code bolstered religious freedoms, equality before the law, secular judiciary and government, and many other Enlightenment ideals. Considering the fact that in the following century France was second only to Britain in international influence, it also helped spread these ideals around the globe, and the Napoleonic Code is still the foundation or the strongest influence for most European, African, and South American legal codes

** I liked this simply because the goblins didn't like Harry, and Harry didn't like goblins.

The ending was a tad unsatisfying, though. There weren't any real battle scenes- more like lots of posturing.

** I didn't like this one at all. The dialogue seems so unnatural and the plot is so contrived.

** I don't generally read Dark!Harry stories but decided to try this one. My initial feeling of intrigue due to the superiority of the writing and reasonable characterizations of Harry, Ron, and Hermione gave way to a disappointment of potential left unfulfilled. Without giving away specific plot elements, a couple of the initial plot devices felt like slight modifications of the stereotypical magic-trunk and goblin-advisors rampant in fourth year Indy!Harry stories.

By itself that would be an issue of personal preference. A bigger issue in the narrative structure lies in a rather repetitive use of confrontation between Harry and former friends or mentors to progress the plot. The outcome of the confrontation was typically clear after only a few words, divided into those who accepted Harry whole heartedly and those who displayed no ability to coherently argue a counterpoint.

In the end, Harry reminds me of a student just after the completion of sociology 101/102 (or physics, philosophy, economics etc.) whose new knowledge leads to somewhat new, but rigidly held, beliefs. Unfortunately, no one was capable of counterpunching.
