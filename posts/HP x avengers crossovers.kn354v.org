I've been reading a lot of these lately would prefer ones with the usual formula for him getting into shield like MOD Harry lands in another dimension but I'd just good recs for fics like this


** Try linkffn(Child of the Storm) if you have a lot of time on your hands. Ends up being more Marvel than HP, just because the scales are so different.

** linkffn(Heroes Assemble) - Harry spends several years exploring the world after killing Voldemort and ends up lending a hand when the Chitauri invade New York. Things snowball from there. Eventually touches most (if not all?) of the MCU.

linkffn(Steve and the Barkeep) - A fluffy story where Harry runs a bar and serves drinks themed after various mythological figures.

linkao3(On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads) - Loki is Harry's father. (James Potter was a disguise he used.) Harry is not pleased when he finds out. The title rather gives away what he does. Not crack as such, but definitely humorous.
