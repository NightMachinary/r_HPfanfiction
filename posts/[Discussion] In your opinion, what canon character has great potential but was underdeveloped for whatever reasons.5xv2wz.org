While we have numerous characters in the Harry Potter world, few were really flashed out in canon. That is completely understandable because J.K. wanted to tell Harry's story, but sometimes I like to read character study fics in an attempt to better understand what the books would be like if a few others were given the chance to shine.

So, if J.K. was more like George R.R. Martin or something, which characters would you like to know more about?

For me, personally, it would be *Draco* /(what was his home life like? His hopes, dreams and motivations? How did he deal with the post-war days?)/;

*Bill* /(what sort of things did Bill see on a daily basis as a curse breaker? What made him decide to be one in the first place?)/;

*Professor Flitwick* /(what was his family like? Did he suffer any kind of prejudice growing up? what were his duelling years like?)/

and *Lockhart* /(when was the first time he obliviated someone for his own gain?)/

etc


** Ok, this is going to wind up being a bit of a rant.

Part of the reason Ginny is my favorite character is specifically /because/ she was underdeveloped, underutilized, and had so much potential as her own character.

There are many characters, some of whom you mentioned, that are drastically underdeveloped, but we learn so little about them that to go into their backstory is to be complete fanon.

But with Ginny, there is enough given in text to fill an entire book with her backstory without it seeming non-canon.

Let's start with the obvious: her possession by Riddle. The actual events as they happened would be compelling to read from her perspective. But even more, the aftermath of it all is really interesting too. Harry is also possessed/controlled/influenced by Voldemort, and he often reacts poorly, collapsing into himself, lashing out at others, and just suffering. Ginny, however, seems to go the opposite way, acting outgoing, friendly and boss (sorry, couldn't think of a better word). But the effects of Riddle stay with her, as evident in OOTP when she calls Harry out for forgetting she was possessed. But what was Ginny really dealing with those years? Was she having nightmares, doubts about herself, etc? Rowling wrote that ginny was possessed, yet we didn't see how it affected her. She then made a passing remark about it 3 years after the fact, and then we just moved on. I want to know a lot more about that.

Rowling actually screwed up with Ginny a lot, in my opinion. She was barely present in books 3 and 4. We learn nothing about her through her relationships with Michael and Dean, even though it would go a long way to showing her connection to Harry (for example, when she was with Dean, did she actually want that relationship to succeed or was she just biding her time until Harry noticed her). Then she is just one of those characters who support Harry but aren't really that close with him (Neville and Luna being the others). Finally, book 6 is supposed to be her big moment but we don't actually get much interactions between Harry and her until they get together. No big heart to hearts where Ginny reveals the depth in herself we know exists, nothing.

Then Harry breaks it off and Ginny sort of just accepts it, despite that not really being like her at all, and we don't get any more insight into her thoughts.

Finally, book 7, where she is non-existent until the final battle. We don't get any of her leading Dumbledore's Army (the book suggests its more Neville than anyone else). When Harry comes back, we have this great chance for her to finally say everything she wanted to about this past year, but instead all we get is Harry agreeing to keep her safe, and while she does escape and fight, she doesn't get any moment. Neville gets his moment, so does Luna. Hell, her only possible moment, when fighting Bellatrix, becomes Molly's moment and actually supports the desire on her family's part to keep her safe. Then, after the battle, we don't even have a reunion between her and Harry.

My point here is that, compared to other characters who justifiably have little backstory or moments of glory, Ginny is fully deserving of rich character development and significant contribution to the plot, but she gets none of that. When we talk about wasted potential, we can't not talk about Ginny.

Here's how I would have rectified her character development:

- have Harry notice her sooner, which would lead to a closer friendship with her where they would talk about her coping with Riddle's possession, his fears about having to kill Voldemort, etc.

- shorten the time she was with both Michael and Dean so Harry would start dating her much earlier. This would accomplish two things: accurately reflect the level of feelings she had for both boys (i just find it odd she could date both boys for so long when she never really was that into them), and intensify her relationship with Harry so that when he breaks it off with her, it carries more weight.

- give her a larger role in the final defeat of Voldemort. Harry tries to keep her safe. Her family says she is too young to get mixed up in the war. Rowling says she is powerful but we don't get to ever see it. Ginny is also the seventh of the seventh, so make that mean something. Harry also knows that it is the power of love that enables him to defeat Voldemort. Ginny is the love of his life, so do something with that.

- Explore the dynamic that would exist when Harry and Ginny start dating, and he turns to her over Hermione. Have Hermione get jealous of this and make us see exactly why Ginny is who Harry would turn to now.

There's more I could say on this topic, but I've ranted enough for now.

*** You said it all - completely agree with every word. This the love of his life and shes barely in the story at times, partially i think it was JK Rowling trying to keep everything PG but its such a waste. Harry never once in the series tells anyone that he loves them, that walk to the forest in DH would be so much more powerful when he passes Ginny if he had told her that he loved her at some point.

I suppose though if we are being realistic, they were what? 16 and 15 in Half blood prince that kinda stuff might be a little heavy for a relationship at that age and in DH they are barely around each other so in my opinion Harry and Ginny really wouldn't get started with a serious relationship until after the battle, and even then that period had to be full of grief and mourning, i suppose that's why I favor fics where they don't just get together the morning after the battle and live happily ever after.

But still Jk just missed so many interesting scenes between the two. And the lack of development really gives all the Ginny haters ammo to dismiss her as a fangirl with no interesting qualities at all.

The only plus from all this is the room it leaves for fan fiction, but even then i haven't found anything that really covers her in the way id imagine her to be after the battle or in Hogwarts. Strangely my favorite Fics tend to have her breakdown in some way - which is completely the opposite of the way she'd probably act considering how she bounced back from being possessed by the greatest dark wizard of all time at 11 years old.

Right?! I brought that up in another thread and people didn't really seem to agree that it was odd Rowling didn't go this route, but it's such a good and obvious thing to do. Harry wins because of love, yet he never hears it or says it to anyone in the entire series (i know Dumbledore alluded to him being loved, but he never heard the words "i love you.")

I agree that realistically, Harry and Ginny shouldn't just be in love when they get together, but also remember canonically, Harrys shows very strong feelings for her while on the hunt. His last thoughts before death were of Ginny, too. I am overall more than fine with them being at that point despite only having a few weeks together. Because if not, then it would mean that by the end of the battle, Ginny cared more at one time for Dean or even Michael than she did at that point for Harry. And that just doesn't work thematically for the story. We just need to accept they had stronger feelings for each other even when a part during HBP than Ginny ever had for Dean and Michael and Harry for Cho.

I agree with this a lot. It's funny you mentioned enjoying fics where she breaks down despite it being OOC. I find myself in an internal struggle when reading some Harry/Ginny fics because I want the two to just be happy together, but as far as an interesting story goes, it is bland when that actually happens. Fics where they break up and even date other people are like car crashes that I can't look away from.

***** She is just the epitome of missed opportunities shes such an interesting character to me. I cant wrap my head around the hate she gets some times, she was given the shortest straw in the series in my view. You've said it all and i don't mean to rant but like you this just annoys me so much!

The whole problem could have been solved as you said by them getting together earlier, by the time they are together in Half Blood Prince, Harry has nearly killed Malfoy, if Rowling had included various scenes of him and Ginny acting like a teenage couple throughout HBP- sneaking out after curfew, inside jokes around Ron, innocent little things like that - it would have lended so much more weight to growth Harry does in Hallows, have a handful of scenes of him acting like a 16 year old would have fitted perfectly into Half Blood Prince.

And yes! yes! yes!, Harry never telling anyone he loves them is just stupid to me. He literally defeats Voldomort with love and he never expresses it himself!, Its obviously heavily implied that Harry loved Ginny, with her being his last thought ofc, but still, it being said would be way more powerful.

The movies treated her far worse but in fairness to Bonnie Wright (and i think her look and acting were fine) she wasn't given anything to work with, at least they tossed in a couple of moments in order of the phoenix (if you watch closely) where she eyes Harry from the background or something which i always thought was a nice touch but ultimately Ginny was shafted to the bland girl that Harry kisses - purely to remind you that hes growing up.

Ugh sorry for carrying on with this, but to me its the biggest gripe i have with series, so much wasted potential! and i completely agree with Fan Fiction, Harry deserved a happy ever after more than anyone... but to me if he gets it straight away its just unsatisfying, the current fic im reading has me wanting to literally throttle the pair of them but im glued to it!.

****** I feel like I'm having a conversation with myself, we are so much in agreement.

The standard belief is that the movies butchered Ginny, which is true, but I'd argue Rowling did her no favors either. It seemed like she didn't know her character. When Harry breaks it off with Ginny, it seemed OOC for her to accept the way she did, right? She spent years hoping the day would come where they could be together, and she barely puts up a fight when he ends it. What happened to the Ginny who went after what she wanted?

******* I feel the same way! And it's rare! most people either hate ginny or accept the way she was written as enough!

Your absolutely correct by the end of HBP she was probably at the prime of her confidence and we see that with her "birthday present" in deathly hallows she was defiantly not over him, it's one of the scenes to me that just seem to just be a complete disservice to her character in favor of easing things along, she seemed far to understanding at the breakup which in some ways make sense as she, at least in my view understands Harry in a way no one else seems to, but still it's hard to belive to say the least ... lots of fic authors seem to put it down to - that she understands that he's trying to protect her and accepts it as part of Harrys nature, but I don't buy that, she is one of the DA that went to the ministry, she takes no shit and we are told multiple times that she is a powerful witch and if you attribute that she probably resents people trying to control her after the CoS or treat her like something that needs protecting (which i do) I think this would make her angry more than anything else - it's just seemed to easy. .... again another missing moment is what happened after the funeral, on the train home - I like to imagine she didn't let him get away that easy.... but then at the same time Harry had just lost his mentor so I suppose there is an argument that she just went along with it to spare him any pain and understood he was just being "noble" and they weren't really split, but again I don't buy it.

Another thing that's crossed my mind a few times after a particularly Angst heavy fic was - did she really recover from the chamber as well as we belive?? again it's never stated - I can't even remember if ginny was mentioned in Prisoner of azkaban, I mean to me she had to have had a rough time she was an 11 year old child and she was possessed by the most powerful dark wizard of all time and we hear nothing about what happens after! At very least she must have had terrible nightmares if not outright PTSD which make her transition into the as you said "boss" she turns into all the more interesting.

I'm probably gonna catch some flack for saying this but if JK Rowling was to write a series (or even just one book) about any other character that parallels the main series to me Ginny would be best choice that story of going from a mess on the floor of the chamber of secrets to leading the DA and marrying her life long love would be an inspiring tale to say the least. Of course this is what I've searched for in Fan Fiction but have not been able to find.

And as dumb as it might sound I dunno of id trust Rowling to do it! (The irony of criticising the person who literally created the character is not lost on me belive me) but it's just so obvious that Ginny was done badly and she deserved a better arc. And you said it seems like Rowling didn't know her character.

Sorry for the walls of text but as you can probably tell - this is a topic I could rant about forever.

You're in my mind!! Literally have this exact same thought. It would never happen as I don't think Rowling has the connection with Ginny that she does with other characters, meaning she would sooner revisit them over Ginny. Good example is all the Pottermore articles expounding on other secondary characters but not her.

I also agree I wouldn't quite trust Rowling. I just don't know what she really thinks of Ginny both as an individual and in context of her relationship with Harry. That breakup scene; I got what she was trying to show with both Harry and Ginny. But especially with Ginny, it just didn't make sense. It was more about showing Harry being the noble one with a "saving people" thing than whatever Ginny brought to the table.

I sort of wonder if she just didn't want to have Ginny become the woman pining and waiting while her man did brave things. But she only half-succeeded. She showed a strong Ginny, but an out of character Ginny. Canon Ginny says something like "i know you have to go defeat Voldemort, but we're not over. I refuse to let Riddle control our lives like that. You can't protect me since I'm a blood-traitor like the rest of my family, and I don't want you to. I'm going to fight this war best I can, just like you. And when you kill Riddle, we will be together. " Instead we get a Ginny who is strong in accepting his break up, but essentially still takes on the role of comforting girlfriend, letting him break it off so he feels better. I kind of hate that Rowling never clarified if Ginny really felt they were done. I suppose the kiss in DH hints that she doesn't believe so. But I'd absolutely hate for it to be canon that she dated after he broke it off. i mean, the torture-filled year probably made the possibility of dating moot anyway, but perhaps she dated to seek comfort? For my own personal curiosity, I'm very interested to know canonically what happened in that year and after the battle.

Regarding Ginny's PTSD, realistically she definitely would have that, but within the context of the story, I don't think so. At least nothing severe. One flaw in Harry Potter is the events in the story never quite impact the characters that much, from the serious to the trivial. For example,

- Harry seems relatively ok after the death of Sirius.
- Ginny was cracking jokes soon after the CoS incident (joking about Percy and his girlfriend)
- Ginny never seemed too broken up about ending both her long-term relationships (this certainly supports the theory that she never really cared much about either boy)

********* Ya I suppose your right and having a 11/12 year old deal with something that heavy probably wouldent make the publishers too happy and would really mess up the tone of the story... and I see your point about characters not reacting to events - when I really think about it I never really noticed before.

That quote is exactly what I'd imagine she should have said to him at some point tbh, it's a just seems too easy; Rowling wrote ginny as a strong female character that doesn't take any crap, but she just turned off that switch for plot in that funeral scene to avoid having to write an argument, I just don't see the ginny that has been waiting for years for those few weeks to give up that easily. And ya I suppose you could argue that she didn't and that was the whole reason for the birthday kiss was but why would she wait, if anything I think that Ginny more than anyone else is the one who'd outright tell harry he's being bloody stupid, isn't that part of the reason he likes her?!... they would have argued imo like all couple do, ginny rolling over like that is stupid - and in fairness kinda boring in a creative sense - at the same time though I understand this isn't a romance story about Harry and Ginny and their arguments so I suppose it make a sense a little. As for her dating others we saw that she didn't just wait around for him all those years but went off with Dean and Micheal but again as you said her feelings on them were never clear - were they just training for Harry? or did see genuinely care about them? But I agree unless she's far more stupid than she's portrayed (which i doubt) she knew as well as the reader that was Harry bring Harry and they'd be together again - at least that's the only truth il except!

It all comes back to unanswered questions and Ginny has far more than most other characters ..... it's just stupid that someone so pivotal to the main hero of the story was given such a bad shake. And ya I agree i dont think Rowling cared for Ginny much, I mean we got to see far more of Luna who in the grand scheme of things is far less important to the hero than we did of Ginny. It's just mind numbing especially because she's so interesting.

It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one who sees Ginny this way most other discussions iv stumbled upon are far less critical of how Rowling wrote her which I belive is the crux of the problem, we need to know that happens in Hogwarts in that year to get any answers and i doubt she will ever post anything detailed enough to answer all questions.

********** Another event that actually diminished the pair for me was when Harry agreed to keep Ginny locked in the Room of Requirement during the battle.

This is yet another example of Harry acting very selfish, suppressing the very thing that is supposed to like about Ginny, and Ginny just accepting it. Obviously since they wind up together. But how does Ginny accept that from him? She seems to easily accept Harry breaking it off to protect her even though she would vehemently argue she doesn't need protecting. Then, when she wants nothing more than to fight for her friends and family, he does the same thing and tries to keep her safe.

I just don't get it. Rowling has Harry do something that, based on everything we know about Ginny, would infuriate her and dump him cold. But she obviously doesn't. Because when it comes to Harry, Ginny is not the great character we know and love. She's someone who takes a back seat to what Harry wants and happily puts up with it. And I doubt Rowling meant to write it that way, but I don't see how the reader can interpret it any differently.

And we see it even after the series ends. Ginny willingly allows the kids to be named after people important to Harry (which in a vacuum I'm fine with but does look suspect given all the other times she acquiesces to him). In CC, she serves primarily to support him and offer words of encouragement.

I love the pair, and I think they make sense together and all that jazz. But there is that fundamental issue where Ginny is there to comfort and sacrifice for Harry's happiness and comfort, and Harry is not expected to respect and honor things that matter to Ginny.

That's why a story about the pair set after the battle would be so beneficial to her character, as well as their relationship. I think a good story would be a real hard look at Ginny and how she changes when it comes to Harry. I could imagine a story set after the battle where Ginny is so happy to have Harry alive that these issues lay dormant. And then when Harry wants to desperately get married and start a family even though Ginny might want to slow down with starting that part of her life, she might finally start to reexamine how she is with Harry. She'd force him to understand that things can't be how they were during the war, where Ginny was expected to be a comfort to Harry. They are equals and he needs to support her the same way she supported him. That's a story I'd love to read.

*********** Yeah your right, its as if whenever the plot need her too she turns into another character around Harry and I don't think its intentional, she was leading / if not heavily involved in leading the DA in what amounts to a rebellion for a year in Hogwarts against Death eaters, and she just agrees to stay in the Room of Requirement! when people younger than her are out fighting - that's not the Ginny we came to know.....its as if Rowling converts her into this "perfect" girl for Harry in moments where her true character should be most evident, it just screams poor writing to me.

The kids names will always annoy the hell outta me, I believe that Rowling wrote the epilogue first (or at least very early into the series) and that makes sense (but also makes Ginny's poor portrayal at times all the more frustrating) because she knew her ending for years and it seems to me that as she went on things changed in the story, but she still put the same ending on.... in my opinion that epilogue doesn't fit well, its not terrible but its definitely a rough fit after everything we've read to that point. I mean James Sirius is ok - even if there is nothing from Ginnys side, Albus Severus is a bad joke, Snape is a great character to read, but hes also an arse, he bullied Harry and others for years, and he didn't give a dam about Harry, just because he was a double agent and had a weird obsession with Lily doesn't justify naming a son after him even if its a middle name. I can see that he might give the Albus name to one of his sons, but probably more as a middle name. Its as if Ginny has no say in anything, Lily Luna is stupid as well, Lily - is ok, but Luna, i mean get shes a probably a good friend, but your going by friends names that why no Ron or Hermione! - i prefer to imagine the kids as James Sirius Potter, Albus Frederick Potter and Lily Tonks Potter.

Of course thats all going by what we know form canon across 7 books - we have no idea what happens next so as you said a follow up would clear so much of this up - for all we know there was more to Snape than we got, and maybe to Luna as well? but that's all guess work unless she actually writes something, which is unlikely especially given the involvement she has with the Fantastic Beasts movies, and i don't see them giving any more insight into post Harry Potter story.

All this just comes back to what a shame that a character with so much potential was utterly wasted, I know she wanted to focus the story on the trio but my god she could have gotten some really rich and interesting characters if she had branched out a bit...... Ginny had the potential to be Harrys true equal the one who doesn't give a crap that hes the chosen one and would tell hes being an idiot when he is being one, instead shes the perfectly obedient, go along with whatever Harry says kinda character and that's just such a shame.

** I always thought *Tonks* had the potential for an incredibly interesting backstory/childhood. Being a metamorphagus, the auror academy, being a Hufflepuff with a penchant for trouble. All interesting.

Also *Fleur*: does being part-veela mean anything other than prettiness? Is her haugty attitude arrogance, a defense mechanism because people treat her differently for being pretty, or does it come from her superior magical ability? I think the fact that she was both the most talented student at her school and was under higher-than-average scrutiny meant that she would have been able to empathise with both Hermione and Harry and it could have been interesting seeing her take on a big sister role with them.

** Hmm...well, I for one would like to know more about any of the house-elves, the centaurs, goblins, veela, giants...every character who comes from a different race/culture than the main wizarding one.

Seriously, we hardly get anything about how they tick. Why are house-elves so intent on being slaves? What makes the Forbidden Forest centaur tribe xenophobic? Why does Griphook feel justified in betraying Harry & co. when promises are apparently so important to a goblin? Are giants really as violent as popular wizarding perception claims?

2. Don't think you used the right word there, but I don't blame you, people throw around the word all the time without knowing what it means. If you mean, why do Centaurs like to be independent? I guess it's because they don't like Human interference.

3. Kay.

4. I think that there's only Hagrid's word to take for that...and he and Madame Maxime approached the giants just fine. And if hikers were disappearing in the mountains, wouldn't search parties and helicopters seek them out, and therefore spot the giants? It might be more likely that some 'Giant Control Office' has the job of tracking giants and setting muggle-repelling charms around them.

** Whatever are your most prominent traits. "You could be great, you know." Wasn't a lie, he was telling a hard truth, that at the expense of making two friends that continuously stab him in the back, he could become one of the greatest wizards of all time. Some theorize that the Sorting hat attempting to put him in Slytherin is Voldemort's soul-piece that was inside of Harry, but I doubt that, the Sorting Hat stated everything we already knew about Harry, but still arrived at the conclusion that, that was Harry's best bet.

What you state isn't being reactive, it's being proactive. Was he the one required to go down into the Chamber? Nope. Did he? Yes. Was he required to learn the Patronus? No, he could have just quit Quidditch for the season, that would be the reactive thing to do. But I agree, post-book 3, he was super inconsistent in everything he did.

Like I said, he isn't written like a human-being, he isn't curious about the magical world he is in, he isn't curious as to what his Animagus might be, other than alluding to wanting to master it before the second task, in case it was a water-involved form.

That's the thing though, we always hear Harry go "a Dark Lord is after me" or "I watched his resurrection, yet he still cared enough to attempt to kill me". Somehow he doesn't arrive at the obvious conclusion that someone needs to ask Professor Dumbledore for magical training.

** Harry, Harry had great potential. He was underdeveloped and pushed to the side, simply to fulfil the narrative, I would have enjoyed seeing Harry built up in some meaningful way, but sadly, he was confined to all these pre-dispositions set out to him. "You can't be Slytherin, you need to have friends." "You can't study magic, I need to rely on my Horcruxes and Hallows." "You can't look into your magical power, you need to be weak so you have no other option, other than to sacrifice yourself at the end of the book." Harry was used for the purpose of fulfilling an agenda, rather than for growing into his own. He is the most underutilised and underappreciated character, in all of the Potterverse. Just look at Cursed Child, they couldn't even characterise him, "Is he moody?" "Is he powerful?" "Does he idolise or despise his previous mentors?" Why would he name his child after a man who made his life hell, just because he wanted to sleep with his mother?

*** I feel like you've been reading too many manipulative Dumbledore stories. Harry could have been Slytherin, he just chose not to be. Maybe because of misconceptions, but he still chose Gryffindor of his own will.

Harry could study magic, he just didn't. Harry is, at heart, reactionary. He doesn't do much of his own will, he just isn't proactive.

Or, well, he did study magic, but not much beyond class, and he was decidedly average at it.

And Harry had no other option but to sacrifice himself. There were no goblin rituals or secret magic that could remove the horcrux. He had to die, no matter what. It wasn't until after Voldemorts resurrection that Harry had the possibility of surviving.

**** 1.) Nope, I'm of the opinion that Dumbledore was a good person, nor was he manipulative. It was just a non-genius attempting to write a genius, and failing miserably.

2.)Exactly, for some reason a thousand year old magical artifact designed to send kids to the house thats best for them, enchanted by Legendary Wizards, was circumvented by an eleven year old. Suddenly, you can have a choice.

3.) Contradictory, he wasn't reactionary when he said "not Slytherin". He wasn't reactionary when he went into the chamber to fight the Basilisk, nor was he reactionary when he learned the Patronus just in case he ever met a Dementor again. I could go on and on, the point is, like I said before, he wasn't written to become his own character, he was written with set purposes, with minimal internal dialogue involved.

4.) Not a full Horcrux, as the full ritual wasn't preformed. I don't get why people don't understand that? You'd think that a powerful piece of magic that splits your soul and places it into something, would require more than taking the ejector seat to Albania. Maybe Dumbledore was right, Voldemort just left some power inside of Harry? On a side note, Voldemort was supposed to have been a Prodigy at all magic, one would think that if Harry managed to inherit one ability, he would get the rest? I'm not saying Voldemort's memories, but his talent for subjects and unnatural control over magic should have followed along. Otherwise, why leave him with anything at all if it's going to be inconsistent?

***** Did he circumvent it though? I have to wonder, what makes the sorting hat sort a student? Is it where they would fit best, is it where they wish to go etc? It's not really stated, we just know that the sorting hat decides, I've always been of the opinion that it will place you in a house where you want to go if you got for more than one. Thinks it's on the wiki, but Lockhart was like Harry. He should have gone to Slytherin, but managed to convince the hat to put him in Ravenclaw, just.

And I agree, I don't think Harry was particularly well written, it felt like he was just an eyepiece for us to use. But I do stand by the idea that he was mostly reactionary. He went into the chamber, sure, but that was an immediate threat that he felt he needed to confront. He learnt the patronas, but unless I recall wrong, that was because he almost died during a match and had no choice if he didn't want it to happen again. What I'm trying to say is that it seemed to me that Harry, especially when it comes to learning magic, only shows proactivity when his feet are literally in the fire. There was nothing stopping him from learning magic, he just never did because he doesn't really care about magic.

This feels especially obvious in fifth and sixth year. In fifth year, it was Hermione that pushed him into teaching, otherwise he was have just spent the year bitching and not doing anything. And in sixth, did he try to learn powerful magic? Despite the country falling apart due to Voldemort, despite knowing that he had to be the one to kill him? He knew he had to kill Voldemort, that it had to be him.

Yet he did nothing, because there was no immediate threat to make him do so.
