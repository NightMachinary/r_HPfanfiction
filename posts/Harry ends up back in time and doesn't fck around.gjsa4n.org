I'm talking either Marauder Era or the 40s, when Tom was still in school. You all know the regular set up by now. Harry ends up back in time, he get's to witness all the sob stories and messed up, abusive childhoods of the upcoming Death Eaters, somehow ends up hooking up with Bellatrix or Narcissa, and bonus points if the older Purebloods support him because they don't want another war, even if they lowkey support Voldemort's ideas. Or if he is in the 40s, he undoubtedly ends up with Tom.

And that's well and fine. Heck, I love it when the lines are blurred and the antagonists are more than some cartoon mockery. But sometimes, that just doesn't scratch the itch.

I'm looking for a Harry that, for example, gets into Hogwarts and straight up Fyiendyfires the Slytherin dormitories. Or just immediately goes on a murder spree and demolishes the Pureblood mansions. You get the image. No whining about the timeline, no whining about how unfair life is to the upcoming Death Eaters, just straight up preventing the most brutal civil war Wizarding Britain ever saw.

â€‹

And please, only recommend *Harry* centric fics.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Not sure you'd consider this Harry-centric, as it is from Tom Riddle's POV throughout, sorry. Butbut Harry definitely doesn't fuck around in linkffn(Realignment), where his main goal is to straight up kill Riddle.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** Imagine if he accidentally became the next dark lord in the process of trying to topple a dark lord. Okay, sorry, this is a serious thread :(

But the idea could potentially be developed seriously. By a serious person.

Also, although the best course of action (in my POV), would be to kill TMR while he's in the crib, it'd be interesting to see the consequences of what he did.

Stuff like, the moment after he kills an 11 year old tom riddle, the time traveller screws up and is caught and sent to azkaban. Or something more creative, I don't know.
