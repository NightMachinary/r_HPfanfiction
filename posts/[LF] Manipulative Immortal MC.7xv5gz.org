So I recently watched the new series "Altered Carbon". And I was wondering if there were any fics along the storyline of "multiple immortal powerful people controlling society". Of course the MC would be part (and preferably the top-dog) of this group. It can be AU, crossover whatever. But please no "eleven year old Harry comes into his inheritance/gets adopted etc., and thus becoming powerful" fics


** linkffn(A long journey home) and linkffn(Basilisk-born) are the two fics that kind of fit. Both have an immortal MC. In the former the MC is reluctantly manipulative, in the latter very willingly.

The former is a 'clean' fic in terms of storyline and worldbuilding. While there is unique plot and worldbuilding, both is very well done and easy to grasp. Basilisk-born gets a bit confusing at times, and is really over the top at some points.

In general I prefer ALJH, but they both are quite good stories. ALJH isn't finished, but the first ark (which you could call "Book 1", but there is no Hogwarts or anything) is finished.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** I have sadly already read both of them, great fics. I too recommend it to anyone, although the Harry's aren't that slimy manipulative that I meant originally :)

** How do you feel about the immortal character not being a lead? I've read a couple fics with them as antagonists.

*** Well, that kinda defeats the purpose of the power fantasy here doesn't it? :D If you have any, link them anyway, I might enjoy them regardless.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] introduces one about half way through, he doesn't do all that much in the way of super major plot stuff but it's still a fun twist on Dumbledore.

The next two I'm iffy about linking because of the recent rule changes since there's some underage stuff in them.

For the Love of Magic by Noodlehammer has a cabal of vampires doing Illuminati stuff and it seems like they're on a collision course with the MC at the moment. It's got a fair bit of smut like everything else the guy writes but it's pretty skippable and I'm actually really interested in what the vamps have planned.

The Princess of the Blacks is... very polarizing. It moves much farther away from the weird child prostitution shit as it goes on and there isn't much explicit stuff to begin with, just unsettling. It also gets a lot of flack for being a tad bashy and essentially a wrong boy who lived fic. Anyway, I read it because it's the only fic I've ever found that has a legitimate Light/Dark Cold War going on with Black magic gods and White magic gods fighting each other via proxy worshippers. The entire second book (I think it's the second at least) is dedicated to one of the White Wizards trying to hunt down the MC and two Black Wizards joining forces with the MC trying to hunt White Wizard down first.

The Denarian Series has the Faerie courts from the Dresden Files. tl;dr Summer and Winter factions of faeries are both awful and quite horrifying strike bargains with humans and have a shit load of control. There's also some stuff with fallen angels possessing people via coins so you end up with immortal crime lords running a lot of stuff. Been a long time since I've read this so I can't say much more about it other than it's Dumbledore is one of the greatest Dumbledores in fanfiction. No smut at all so that's nice.

I've got a few more that I'll probably think of eventually. Will link them when they come to mind.

Outside of Fanfiction you may want to give "Overlord" a shot. It's about an OP as fuck undead lich character and his minions from a made up video game getting transported into a magical kingdom when the servers get shut down. The twist is that he's level 100 and everyone in the new world are ants to him and his minions. He's mostly tried to stay in the shadows and act through proxies because if anyone else from the game also got transported in or if any of the upper tier items from the game made it through (mind control, catastrophic destruction stuff ect) he could be caught unawares and destroyed and he's not sure whether he'll be able to respawn. It's okay overall. Not much more to say about it. Definitely a power fantasy but kinda funny since large swathes of it are told from the perspectives of the minions or denizens of the new world.

***** Thanks I'll take a look at the first two. The other's I have known about for a while. For some reason I couldn't read Denarian Series, can't remember what it was. PotB is a really good fic I think, and it has 3 books already. Although I have to say that I generally enjoy powerful female MCs so there is that :D

Anyway, thanks for the suggestions

****** Saw someone mention [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King][Harry Dursely and the Chronicles of the King]] and remembered it would be (almost) perfect for thread. It's a fic told from the perspective of a Harry (sort of but not quite) wrong-boy-who-lived manipulated by at least 3-4 immortal/semi-immortals vying for power, world domination or the eradication of the others. There's a lot of stuff with him being unknowingly possessed and entire subplots about various characters being obliviated. There's nothing quite like it in the fandom.
