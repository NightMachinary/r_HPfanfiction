:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read about a year ago, it was about Harry, who was trained by Kreia and took up the mantle of Emperor of the Sith Empire, married Bastila and converted her to the dark side, ruling from the shadows, and traveled to Earth and took on a few apprentices, including his brother(I think).
