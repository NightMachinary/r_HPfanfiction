:END:
I'm 99% sure the metamorphmagus he was dating was Tonks. The thing about metamorphmagi not aging was a big secret and described as a 'curse' (in the metaphorical, not literal, sense), and Harry already knew about it before Tonks told him. It may have been a time-travel fic, I can't remember. I can't remember if it was a same-sex or het relationship either.

***** Eh, it's vastly different than the Lord many names trope. This fic requires deeds AND blood in order to get it, and Harry is an adult, so his previous canon deeds made him eligible for the three titles. They didn't come with money, land, or seventy thousand houses either.

******** I'm curious on what your requirements are for something to fall under the multiple lord names trope?

Since someone being named "Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin" isn't it, somehow?

********* Oh it may generically fit, but imho when people start throwing; trope this, trope that, it implies a sub par fic. Meanwhile the other person in the thread says this is why it's not and your contempt prior to investigation had you go full Hermione 1st year. You fit the shitty commenter on [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] trope. Hope this helps clear up your confusion!

** Only story I can remember where it was claimed that metamorphmagi were potentially immortal was linkffn(For the Love of Magic). Doesn't sound like that's the one you're looking for though.
