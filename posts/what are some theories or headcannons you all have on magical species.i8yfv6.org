I just finished reading a post on Goblin tradition and couldn't help thinking about what else people consider Goblins, Merpeople, Werewolves or whatever to do as part of their culture or tradition.

I have a couple myself I'd be happy to share but just wondering what others think?


** I tend to view magical creatures through the lens of the myths and legends that inspired them.

For example:

- Goblins: I view them as innately malicious and greedy, like if you had taken Tolkien's goblins and forced them to integrate into human society. They have found a role for themselves as bankers, loan sharks, gangsters etc. but their essential, immutable nature remains fundamentally black-hearted.

- House-Elves: I view them as quasi-Brownies, coming into existence in old, highly magical houses, and remaining tied to that property (and thereby to that property's owner). It is possible for them to breed biologically but most will never get an opportunity to do so - most elves will have manifested directly like a boggart. Their fundamental nature is to derive their happiness and sense of worth from gratuitous service; Dobby and his desire for freedom was a kind of aberration, like a human who can't feel pain.

*** I love this allllll... I find myself alternating on Goblins, whether theyre actually mistreated creatures by wizards or if they are inherently greedy, so seeing these solid reasons really puts a twist on things.

And I've never thought about house-elves so thats a very good opinion ive never heard. it's in the name tbf. 'house'-elves.

**** Yeah in essence I find it much more interesting to picture magical creatures as fundamentally /different/ to humans: different in how they think, different in their biological instincts, different in their life cycles, etc.

This is far more interesting to me than portraying them as mentally identical to humans and just in different bodies. It means there is genuine species diversity, not just an analogy for racism. We already have anti-Muggleborn prejudice to act as a racism analogue.

All the various -isms in real life are morally wrong because they are based on /factually/ incorrect premises. The nature of a prejudice is to treat someone according to a characteristic which does not merit that treatment. A person's skin colour has no bearing on their moral worth or merit; a person's gender has no relevance to what roles they should be permitted to adopt in society, etc.

And Muggleborns serve as a great form of that sort of prejudice in Harry Potter. They have the same magic as everyone else, can bring as much to wizarding society as any pure-blood, etc. Their parentage is irrelevant to their individual merit or moral worth, and that's why prejudice against them is wrong.

With genuine cognitive and behavioural differences between species, you can to explore something else entirely. It's a world we can only imagine in real life, because we've never met intelligent aliens or created genuine AI, and all our /homo/ genus rivals are extinct. That hypothetical world is one where there are groups with innate characteristics which /are/ morally relevant.

Imagine there was a sub-species of humanity that were all sociopaths with an innate desire to subjugate humans. How would we treat them? Would it be moral to give them the same rights as everyone else? Those are really thorny, fascinating questions, and goblins give you the opportunity to explore them.

Imagine there was a sub-species of humanity whose happiness required them to exist in a state of enslavement. Not because they will die without being in that state, but because they have an innate emotional need to be subservient, a deep emotional longing as profound for them as humanity's need for love. How would we treat them? Would it be moral to force them into freedom? Again, thorny, fascinating questions which house-elves give you an opportunity to explore.

Given all the interesting complexity and moral dilemmas that genuine differences between magical species can create, I will never understand why some writers choose to make them boring and redundant analogues for real life historical prejudices.

***** the opening is incredibly true. many authors seem to accidentally use the other species as different representations of racism, which is shifted in view depending on the mindset of the main character, instead of where it should mainly be adressed in debates and psychological questions, (not that correct representation shouldnt exist within media, but you get the point...)

its definitely a weird place to explore with, as you said, the lack of first hand experience humans have with such levels of species, and thats probably a reason for the large variety we see within stories.

thinking about this really puts into perspective how much world building and how deep one could go with JK's entire new world of magic. u seem to have a very good understanding of these lil thorny questions, and my admiration to you for that.

** dementors are corrupted human souls. Imagine someone falling so deep into the Dark Arts that he completely disfigures himself and becomes a quasi-wraith who's only capable of sucking the happiness of other people. Their attempt to suck people's soul out of them would be to regain a semblance of humanity...

** I generally like to draw a touch more from folklore than Rowling but also treat them with the whimsy she applies to wizarding society rather than the broad metaphor she tends to use. It's a clear departure in canon usually but I think makes for a richer world.

Some examples:

- House-elves are brownies. They care for a location, and will help anybody who provides offerings, but if they're scorned they become boggarts and haunt the location in order to drive the humans away.
- Merpeople (merfolk? mer?) have a global civilization. Because they're a generally reclusive society, most interactions humans have with them are with outlaws or especially adventurous folk. Mer-pirates are a thing, and probably led to quite a few sailor's tales.
- Veela are shapeshifting spirits, like the vila they're named after. Swans are a classic form to take on, but some prefer to be more trendy. They don't actually have physical children, but when someone they are in love with has a child the baby will show some similar characteristics.
- Goblins are very distantly related to humans but learned to live in deep caves without light. As a result they mostly eat raw fungi and their arts tend towards tactile or auditory mediums rather than visual. Physical crafts like sculpture are extremely popular, and the texture of the materials they use is considered more important than the appearance. Most goblins consider the ones who trade jewelry and such with humans the equivalent of hawkers at a tourist trap.

*** Like I said before on a different thread I think, this could be taken very far, and with the large selection of folklore abailable to take from across the planet it all depends on what you like personally ig, so thanks for sharing urs.

*** I was planning on asking another question on what people thought specifically on werewolves and what they would want to be cannon about them, so this is as good a place to start as any.

i definitely see this. it makes sense, and with the nature of how one becomes a werewolf, you could compare it to the classic zombie infection.
