There are quite many HPXNaruto crossovers, but I'm wondering if there is a specific one, that I just came up with. One where there are no "hidden barriers" that separate Elemental Nations from the rest of the world, or where Konoha is simply in Japan or similar. I wonder if there is a story, where the Wizarding World is hidden in Elemental Nations? As in, there's no England, no France, there's only the continent of Elemental Nations. Where Harry lived in one of the districts of Tanzaku Gai. Where Diagon Alley is hidden (officially. Unofficially every high-rank Shinobi knows about it) in the middle of Konoha. Where Hogwarts in halfway to Uzushio.


** The root of darkness. Si into naruto with the gamer power. Half way into it, SI gets transported into HP world. The most saddest thing in my life was that learning that the author did not wish to continue it anytime soon.

*** Probably not exactly what I had in mind, but I will check it out. Thanks.

Also, not continuing anytime soon is better than just outright abandoning it.

** Sounds like way too much work since you want a fusion of the worlds.

Would Voldy or Dumbles be ninjas or wizards? ( Like the Third and Orochimaru but it seems weird) Would they speak japanese? What would be the difference between magic and chakra? Who would be the main character?

There would be many too coincidences just for plot convenience and I wouldn't read it.
