I'm still waiting for a time travel in which they killed Riddle in his orphanage, but led Grindelwald to come out on top.

**** Oh, I think I saw a fanfic like this. Don't recommend it though, the quality was barely above “congratulations! You've just learned how to form paragraphs, but perhaps try for them to make sense next time”. It was really sub-par, I think it's name was cursed child or something of the like, can't remember the site.
