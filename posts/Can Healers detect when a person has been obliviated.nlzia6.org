I'm making a fic and I'm preparing for a scene where "Person A" rushed "Person B" to the hospital wing since Person B had a memory changed (the reason was, Person B was obliviated). There was no head injury or any damage, /physically./ I was wondering if Madam Pomfrey would know that Person B has been obliviated or not, would no one know what happened to them? If no one here knows the real answer to my question, should I make something up for it?


** Bertha Jorkins was obliviated by Mr Crouch, but Voldemort broke through it, so obliviations should be detectable. Of course, it might require some seriously dark magic, so Madam Pomfrey might not have the necessary mindset.

** It's your fic, as long as you make it consistent enough it will be fine. So if Madam Pomfrey could know it, then St Mungo's healer should too, and if either your hero or villain use obliviation later in the story there should be at least a mention of why they're not afraid the victim's ally would figure it out.

** If the situation was explained then Pomfrey would understand and probably refer the patient to st Mungos for a specialist. Then depending on the extent of the time /memory that needs to be put to rights, the healer would be able to give a better treatment plan.

** My headcanon is that there are two modes of Oblivation:

- Time-based: i.e., "Erase the last X minutes of memory." This is easy and isn't prevented by Occlumency, but is easily detected. Also, the amount of time it can cover with any amount of accuracy is very limited. It's what a typical wizard would use on a typical Muggle who saw too much.
- Legilimency-based: This version requires Legilimency to target the memories to be erased. It can erase any memory the Legilimens is aware of, and it can be undetectable if done particularly well, but a sufficiently skilled Occlumens cannot be Obliviated this way.

** I think it is requires extensive examination by competent Legilimens with search of memory abrupt inconsistencies and gaps.

** I would think that if the wizards were capable of creating an obliviate spell, aurora would at least have created something to return those memories... otherwise you can commit a crime, get rid of the witnesses, obliviate yourself and not even truth serum could say you're guilty... there's probably somekind of artifact that can restore memories... i think i remember a fanfic were neville's remember ball had this function were if a dark red light shines when you're touching it, it means you been obliviated and when that happens you just put your wand on the remember ball and it restores your memories... and that's pretty op, canon remember ball was useless... i can almost imagine Dark Harry pulling a Kira (where he touches the notebook and suddenly remembers that he is Kira)

** I don't think there's a real answer for your question, but personally I would invent a kind of Mind/Memory healer that specializes in cases such as Obliviation and helps people recover their memories, if possible, or their lives after incidents that involve some kind of damage, distortion or destruction to their mind. They would have to have studied every case of Obliviation ever recorded, and have a lot of background information in magical (or muggle) psychology, psychotherapy, or physiatry (these are what comes to mind) and probably have a lot of knowledge and application of the Mind Arts.

Maybe a school nurse such as Madam Pomphrey would be able to diagnose memory loss or modification, but not do much about it, and would call a person who specialized in the field from St Mungos.

** No but a leglimens apearently can as seen with Bertha Jorkins and Voldemort. Reverting it however canonically gives brain damage to the obliviated person.

** It is canon that after the CoS events, Gilderoy Lockhart was delivered to St. Mungo's long term care, and by the time Harry & company went there to visit Weasley Sr., he had already regained some faculties. Still a moron, but not a veggie.

So, we know a full Healer could diagnose it. We know a specialist can heal it.

Does Mrs. Pomphrey? Possibly. But once the claim is made (Person A rushes in Person B, claims B's been memory-charmed), she could check for irregularities on them both. Primarily, this would be a check for compulsions and potions on Person A. If they came up clean, then Person B could be moved to St. Mungo's non-critical care.

While a serious problem, and one that can get worse with time, it is by no means urgent. In fact, it's even possible A and B would be sent back to class, with an appointment with a Healer schduled to sometime that week.

** From what I remember, there are 3 cases in Canon where a wizard manage to detect that someone has been victim of a memory char, and manage to find the true memory. First you have Voldemort, that discover Barty Crouch Jr survival thanks to Bertha Jorkins, even after Crouch Sr oblivated her. And then you have Dumbledore who managed to find traces of Memory Charms in both the mind of Morfin Gaunt, and the House Elf that served Mrs. Smith (forgot the name).

But, while it is technically possible to detect a Memory Charm, I doubt Mrs Pomfrey would be capable of it (at least in Canon). Outside of the fact that Dumbledore and Voldemort are both Master of the Mind Arts while Pomfrey is not (it is implied in OotP that Snape had to teach Harry Occlumency because he was the only person able to do it in the castle outside of Dumbledore), but also because they had special circumstances. In Voldemort case, he was examining every memory of Bertha Jerkins, pretty much discovering the Memory Charm by hasard (and breaking her mind in the process). As for Dumbledore, he only found the Oblivation's traces because he was looking for them, years after the events.

Anyways, in my opinion Pomfrey should not be able to detect a Memory Charm. She may suspect potentially suspect that it is what happened depending of the behaviour of the patient (if he acts like Lockart in CoS, or just have a suspicious "hole" in his memories), but shouldn't be able to confirm it like Dumbledore could. But that's only in Canon, and you are totally free to give Pomfrey some knowledge in the Mind Art in your story if you want.
