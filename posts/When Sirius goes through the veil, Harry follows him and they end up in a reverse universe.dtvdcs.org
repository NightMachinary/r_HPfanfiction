I remember Riddle being the headmaster, and Dumbledore being basically the new Voldemort. Read this like a year ago and forgot the name

#+begin_quote
  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** There are a decent amount of time travel fics, but there really needs to be more alternate universe fics. Seems like an underexplored fan fic genre. Or I am just ignorant to a ton.

Hope you find what you are looking for OP. Ive not read it myself but I want to.

** I remember this fic as well. After Harry beat Dumbledore they went back through into another dimension where Harry had beat Voldemort but become the new dark lord after it, then he won there and finally him and Sirius were about to return to their original reality and then the author hadn't posted the next chapter.

Sadly I also can't recall the name

*** Don't think so. In the new universe:

Tom Riddle was the Hogwarts headmaster

Dumbledore was the evil one who may have made Horcruxes (can't remember)

Harry /might/ have been in Slytherin. I forgot

  AU. Picks up near the end of OotP. Harry saw Sirius fall into the veil after being stunned by Bellatrix Lestrange. What would happen if he ran in after him? No Pairings yet.
