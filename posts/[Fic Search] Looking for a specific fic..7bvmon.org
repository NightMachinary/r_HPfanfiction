One, possibly two fanfics:

Dumbledore had the knowledge that Sirius wasn't the secret keeper hidden in his own mind, and Sirius used a quote to unlock it.

Umbridge was arrested, and died in the holding cell, where they found the Dark Mark on her right arm. Snape reveals that she was a Death Eater Pretender, using the intimidation factor of the Dark Mark to extort service.


** Dang. I KNOW I've read the fic with the code word unlocking Dumbledore's memory but I cannot remember any other details about it.
