Fics where Harry defeats Voldemort, settles down (or not), gets restless, and then goes to explore. He could be exploring magic, Britain, the world, Hogwarts, whatever, but I'd like to see Harry just learning or doing cool things that have nothing to do with death eaters. Thanks!


** Well Potter had a different plan to defeat Voldemort in linkffn(The House of Potter Rebuilt by DisobedienceWriter). It definitely had the adventurer's mindset that you're looking for. Don't let the title give you preconceived ideas. There are no Lord Potter/Peverell/Slytherin/Gryffindor shenanigans within it.

There's another that ymmv that's a crossover, it seems like a crossover, with the Forgotten realms linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries by Mr.Omega573). It produces an OP!Harry with the enemies scaled up with the OP-ness with adventure written across it.

You can also try linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make by joen1801) but its been dormant for three years now. Same premise with different world building.

**** I was in the OP!Harry phase when I stumbled upon that fic and some of those fics always had the Lord-of-many-Houses trope. It also took me by surprise that he was building the literal house instead of a Metaphorical one.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.

*** IIRC this fic is the prime example of lazy crossovers - it's basically just the MCU but Harry is also there. The stations of canon don't change, and some of the scenes are literally just a description of movie scenes. I don't think I finished it, though I don't remember where I stopped - somewhere after the Winter Soldier arc

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

It's not exactly like you asked. But In this story when Harry finds out about the prophecy he instantly understands that he's meant to die and decides he wants to live a little first and travels the world. In The process he unknowingly becoming a sort of hero. (He has an alias he travels under and like a glamour so no one can recognise him)

(“Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.”)
