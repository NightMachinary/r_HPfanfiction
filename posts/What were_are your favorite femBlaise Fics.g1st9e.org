Stepping into the wayback machine here... Before we knew that Blaise was a male, what were some of your favorite fics featuring fem!blaise?


** /Apprentice Potter/ by Draco664. I have a soft spot for that fic/series despite its age.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2114791][Ghost of a Memory]] by Phoenix Boy. The story is HPSS, but includes a lovely side of Draco/Blaise. Has one of my favorite tropes: Harry is pretending not to be Harry Potter.

** The original They Shook Hands series by Dethryl.

I really liked the character interactions and it was before I grew tired of Canon rehashes and bashing(though a lot of that had been reconnected in the fics).
