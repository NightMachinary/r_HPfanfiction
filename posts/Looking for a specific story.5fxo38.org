Alright!

It was a HP/Supernatural crossover (though it may not have been marked as such).

Harry is immortal, he "mastered death" he's helping the deans, Gabriel is there a good bit, he saves a half-human/half-demon. Oh, and the entire HP world went boom.

I'll add an edit with more info if I think of any.
