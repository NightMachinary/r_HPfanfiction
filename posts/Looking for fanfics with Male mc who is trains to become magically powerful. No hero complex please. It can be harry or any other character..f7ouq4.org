Fics should be decently long or still be active.


** Define hero complex? I know what it means, but no traces of it whatsoever? Or just not in an obnoxious manner?

** Hmm... this might fit then. He definitely makes a point of saving those he cares for, but doesn't run around trying to save the world or anything. Ongoing story, year 2 will begin March 8th and will cover all years. linkffn(13352687)

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
