I read a fanfic a while ago where Harry gets with Tonks, and later in the fic he has an accident in the room of time turners causing him to be transported to an alternate universe where his parents are alive and he has a little sister for a chapter. Can anybody point me in the direction of the fic I'm talking about as i want to reread it but can't seem to find it

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
