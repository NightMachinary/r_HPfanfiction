Doesn't have to be the main part of the story (can be though). It can be a minor part.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

No Weasley Bashing, no Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings


** Basilisk eyes on ao3 is Harry getting blinded by venom and the follow up from that, it's really great

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24597805/chapters/59417392][Kaleidoscopic Grangers]] is about a blind Harry getting adopted by Hermione's family. I'm not caught up on it currently but it's really good from what I remember
