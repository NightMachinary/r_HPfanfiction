I came up with a plot I couldn't get out of my head, started writing , and now it's 5k words... and I'm confused.

This is the first time since high school, and probably the first time ever of my own volition, that I've tried to write something fictional.

I started writing and found I couldn't stop until I reached a logical conclusion... its like it wrote itself and I was along for the ride. Weird, disconcerting, but therapeutic.

I've been an avid reader all my life, and lots of fanfiction in the last few years.

Anyways, I'm considering posting what I did to online, because why not... maybe it will get me to do it again sometime? I read mostly from ffnet since it has a reliable android app, but Ao3 seems to have a lot of followers.

What site do people prefer to post to?

What site do people prefer to read from?


** Platform 9 3/4...

Honest answer: why not both? For real - more places equals more readers.

** They both have their good points, they both have their bad points. Like others say, both is best! There are also other sites around you can post to as well, like Dark Lord Potter, SIYE, Sufficient Velocity, Spacebattles, Wattpad, etc.

Personally, I prefer AO3 to read from, for the UI and general feel of the site. Though I actually prefer the uploading system of FFNet - the 'upload a document, edit a document, then attach a document to a chapter in a story' thing is quite seamlessly ordered and that appeals to me, even if it is a little overly intricate a process. :)

*** Do sufficient velocity / spacebattles actually have any considerable amount of HP fanfiction? I've only ever used them for Worm, but I never thought to look for HP.

**** Depends on your definition of considerable, I suppose. I'd say no, but it is there. And hey, if not, maybe the Admin's'd let someone start. :D

*** Do you know of any decent apps for AO3 though? I can't find any that are as easy to use as ffnet.

I do a lot of reading from my ereader (Boox brand, android os).

**** I don't, I'm afraid. I'm not a big apps person. I download it all through Calibre & Fanficfare, then stick it on my Ipad through the Kindle app only. Means I have my fics and my novels and such all in one place.

** I like AO3 because it's easier to search on but ffnet is what people tend to use when they are linking fics so I would also say both

** I used to do both ffn and AO3, but I've decided to phase out my use of ffn because I don't like how they use ads to profit off my free writing. AO3 has no ads, and is easier to use in general.

** There's nothing stopping you from posting it at every site you want. Other than the annoyance at updating every single site every time, of course.

** I don't know if this is a real question or just an unnecessarily sly self-promotion.

Anyways, posting to at least both ffn and ao3 is what I'd recommend.
