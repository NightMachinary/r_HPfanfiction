#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** There are a few reading ones, including a really good one that I used to read but I think got either deleted or made private, but most get deleted bc copyright. Except now people correctly give credit and it's just annoying when they get deleted.

There was also one where Sirius, James, and Remus watched PoA. It was a one shot and I can't remember the name.
