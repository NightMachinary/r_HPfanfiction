** Pretty much 90% of the Harry-Daphne fic (Yes I'm a Slytherin but contrary to the totality of my house, I do not buy into the blood purity nonsense. But don't worry I am here now to support you and teach you the Slytherin mentality, 95% of the Slytherin are stupid blood purist who create a miracle everytime they remember to breath but Slytherin mentality is to be extremely cunning, like master politician at 11 years old cunning).

That being said, I would love to read a Struggling Slytherin fic. Like a fic where Theodore Nott slowly doubt his convinctions, like how could he believe Blood Purity when Crabbe and Goyle are hairless monkey, Mudblood Granger has perfect grades, and Half Blood Potter is by all account the most powerful student in the year, or even school. And how his friendship with, let's say Harry Potter cause troubles after the resurection.

*** There was an old fic on The Sugarquill like this written between OoTP and HBP that has Theodore Nott befriending a Mugggleborn and having to decide how to deal with the fact that a lot of his family are at least DE sympathizers. Obviously it is not really cannon and I can't remember if it just covers 5th and 6th year or if it goes into 7th, but I can try and find it if you are interested.

** linkffn(HarryPotter and Dumbledore's Army) has a squad of Slytherins assisting Harry with Blaise as it's leader, but he does not become a fourth member of the trio if that is what you're after.

** Of course, linkffn(3912184) and (unfinished) linkffn(4236594) --- yes, it is a Daphne Greengrass story, but very different from all others I read. She is as far from the Heiress Greeengrass as possible, a poor orphan growing up in a Squib foster home, and although she befriends the Trio, there is no that relationship.
