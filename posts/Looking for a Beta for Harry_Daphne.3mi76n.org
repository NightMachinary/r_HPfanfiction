** You can see if you want to swap beta services with anyone [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3m58ro/offerswap_critique_thread/][here]] too.

** I don't think I'm up to beta, but if you've already posted 3 chapters give me a link and I'll give some feedback.

**** "Lets see who will actually do it" is refereing to homework no? It should probably be after the following line explaining that.

"Though their pranks escalated every year" Fred and George just finished their second year, so you should change that.

McG starts grading exams after the term is over, but students get their results before they leave except OWL and NEWT.

Is Albus trying to confuse McG before dropping the PS stuff? Or is he just nuts? Either way its rambling, might want to cut it down.

"Ninety nine percent certain" feels out of place. Could just say 'Quite certain' or similar.

"It would do us no." incomplete sentence.

"22 kilograms (50 pounds)" feels out of place. Can describe heavy without numbers.

"ages of 55-63" again could do without the numbers. Or say 'around 60'

'Mcgonnagal'

"We did not draw blood from you Mr. Potter." and the following lines need rewritten.

The whole bit when he enters the robe shop is off. It's obviously a setup to give him time to talk, but you use way too many words to do it. Something simple like 'Stand here and the tape will get your measurements, don't move around' would read better.

Also a couple times you say 'as the muggles would say' or similar. Use the line, or don't I think 'as the muggles say' reads poorly. I'd just adapt the lines into wizard speak like JK does.

--------------

Just want to say that I enjoyed the chapter. I'll do the other two as well. Putting this edit in so you don't think I'm just harping.

***** "Um... the letter said that we could bring a familiar" It didn't. This is mostly personal preference but I think most people agree with me. Not every pet is a familiar, most owls are just owls and most cats and just cats.

"he put his books in the trunk and got in the car" Shouldn't Harrys books be in his trunk? And in England cars have boots not trunks.

"She looked no older than thirty-two" Too exacting. 'She looked young for a mother of an 11 year old' or something.

11 year olds flirting is not good "never had a girl complimented him before" Harry has probably never had any compliments before. Really don't need 11 year olds flirting and blushing. You seem american so remember first year is 6th grade. These are kids.

"Though I suppose the house of Malfoy could use a hand up to the forearm for a knock" I know this is a reference to the dark mark, but I don't understand the sentence.

I don't really get why Tracey is stuttering here, and the dialog at this part is awkward. It feels like an info dump.

****** "blue orbs looked straight back at him" Using 'orbs' to describe eyes is a mark of poorly written fanfiction. Ive literally never seen it anywhere else.

"Harry, promise us you'll keep talking to us no matter what house to might be sotrted into. You've been great company." Is this sarcasm because it feels like it should be, but isn't. The story has been largely telling instead of showing. You mentioned several times that Harry was being quiet, and we didn't really see a conversation at all.

"Blood rushed to his cheeks again before he nodded" Seriously, stop the 11 year old blushing stuff.

Get rid of the sorting song. Or if you don't, get rid of the citation, it isn't required.

'Nevil'

"asshole" is an americanism

"A certain greasy haired professor" Bad writing, just say his name.

Romeo and Juliet in the middle of the sorting, and a Slytherin pureblood knowing instantly where he heard the name from the muggleworld

"Harry looked at the headmaster with a raised eyebrow, 'Is he mad?' 11 year olds don't raise one eyebrow. This is a learned expression, not like smiling when happy.

"Tunic on his head" Turban you mean

** A few typos and inconsistent spellings that you should clear up. I don't have the time to beta full time, but this looks promising.

** I'm gonna go check it out right now. I love Harry/Daphne, my sentence structure isn't great but I can post any spelling or word choice suggestions in reviews. I also know a ton of good Harry/Daphne fics if you're interested. It's one of my favourite pairings.

**** After seeing your comment, I went and checked out the reviews for your fic. Surely it couldn't be that bad?

Oh no, it was. 11,292 WORDS IN ONE REVIEW! That's almost half the length of your fic! How does someone even write that much?
