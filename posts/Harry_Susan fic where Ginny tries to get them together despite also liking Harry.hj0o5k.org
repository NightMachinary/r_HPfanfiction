:END:
I remember Harry and Susan are having issues and Ginny talks to Harry about them. Then they get back together, and Ginny and Susan talk. Susan later says something along the lines of 'you have more leeway with Ginny than most other girls, don't abuse it'.


** The only fic I can think of that even comes close to this is linkffn(the forgotten contract).

Hope someone knows the exact one cause I love a good harry/susan fic and would love to read this one

***** It /has/ been years since I last read it, but I'm 90% certain that's not the fic. Thanks for trying, though!
