:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
MC = main character

Okay so I like fics with these these things (if it has one or two its good for me!)

- overpowered MC
- lots of world building
- MC gets thrown out and comes back and they are amazing etc etc
- politics savvy MC
- antisocial MC but it gets accepted because MC is famous/rich/untouchable in some other way (only if its in a funny way not drama stuff)
- basically any powertrip

stuff i'd rather not read: - M/M (don't have a problem with it but just don't identify with it) - more than one character genderbent (makes my head hurt if its more than one character, need to keep track of who is what gender etc) - suicide fics (if its mentioned about some side character its okay but if its the MC no thanks) - drama based fics - overly graphic torture - major character deaths - heartbreakers

I've recently read these fics: - linkffn(Origins by burnable) - linkffn(Back to the beginning by burnable) - linkffn(Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - the goblet by YoullneverCatchMeAliveSaidHe) - linkffn(Barefoot by Zaxaramas) - linkffn(The closer you look by Tony Samuels) - linkffn(Harry Potter, squatter by Enterprise1701-d) - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24850216]]) - linkffn(In the mind of a scientist by ZenoNoKyuubi) - linkffn(Madness at the gate by ZenoNoKyuubi) - linkffn(Harry Potter and the power of Paranoia by arekay) - linkffn(Prodigal Delinquent by Ethereal Euphoria) - linkffn(Harry Potter: Unspeakable by kb0) - linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip by ZebJeb)

I prefer FFN because of their in-app text to speech function but other sites are welcome too!


** Self Promotion if I may? It's based on the premise that Harry Potter is the Outer God Nyarlathotep from the Cthulhu Mythos.

*** i'll look into it!

edit: i'm afraid i'm not familiar enough with all the titles, forms, etc that you use to follow the story. if i might give some advice: perhaps add a bit of backstory about how this entity became harry potter to the beginning of your fanfic, that way people like me that don't really have that information can follow along :)

**** I'm planning to add it as a big reveal for when Hermione and Ron realize Harry isn't Harry. It's going to somthing like: a bit after Harry was born Nyarlathotep possessed him and absorbed his spirit, making Harry an avatar of his. And for the next thirteen years Nyarlathotep layed low in a recreation of Harry Potter until things got interesting. I haven't actually figured everything out yet.

#+begin_quote
  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)

#+begin_quote
  This is a short crossover of my original fanfic, Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe, and my latest, Origins. In it, Harry Black and his wives show up shortly after the Fae are introduced to New Atlantis and are offered sanctuary. I'm afraid it leans towards how awesome Harry Black and his people are. There will be only a few chapters.

  Harry's name comes out of the goblet and he's had enough, he's sick of pretending to be stupid and constantly fighting against the whole world. It's time to step up. This is a long and a slow build though, spanning most of the fourth year. There will be no over night changes, trauma recovery takes time, months. He's not going to wake up and start ass kicking the next day.
