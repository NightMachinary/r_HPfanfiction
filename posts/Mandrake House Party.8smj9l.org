If someone could write a one-shot fic about the wild greenhouse party the mandrakes threw in CoS, I would love you forever.


** Quick note: I'm too sleepy to be bothered about how much muggle knowledge Neville and Sprout have right now, but it sounded too fun to wait until tomorrow. Here goes:

Groggily, Neville opened his eyes to rustling, sparkling green. It seemed his head was inside a Scintillating Shrubbery. His ears were a bit numb, too. He was still wearing his earmuffs from last night!

Oh Merlin, what a night.

He sat up and looked around the remains of Greenhouse Three. Small groups of mandrakes were dotted about all over the place, snuggling together and snoring quietly. Someone had placed a blanket over him, it seemed. What could he remember?

There was the karaoke, which he'd been pushed into joining in with even though he couldn't hear the performances by the young plants. The disco ball which had been on the ceiling was now in pieces across the fountain. He vaguely remembered Phyllis, a particularly adventurous female mandrake, trying to swing from it with the help of some sentient Knotweed variant. The following game of football led by Greeny and the 'Drakes (the winners of the karaoke) was particularly amusing as the ball was taller than any of the players, bar Neville.

The indoor Filibuster Fireworks display was beautiful, if slightly harrowing as the entire box of Wet-Start fireworks had fallen into the pond. He winced as he saw the broken glass panes and the escape attempt of the Venomous Tentacula, who had forgotten (again) that it had the disadvantages of roots.

Poor little Bryony had slipped and fallen in the water at some point, and panicked before being fished out by Neville. The whole party had cheered, then with surprising strength picked up the boy on their shoulders and given him a lap of honour for being the hero of the night. Even though he couldn't hear the music, he joined in the celebratory dancing in abandon until he'd felt too exhausted to move.

A tap on his shoulder scared him out of his recollections.

A smiling Professor Sprout handed him a cup of coffee and patted him on the head, before starting on clearing up after the night's revelry.

** I have this mental image where the mandrake party is an adventuring party; a raging club-wielding barbarian mandrake, a swift rapier-wielding swashbuckling mandrake, a cleric-esque mandrake and a sorcerer mandrake, all battling against a giant devil's snare.
