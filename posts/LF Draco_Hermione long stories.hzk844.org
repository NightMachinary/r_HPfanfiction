I'm fairly new to this ship so i haven't ready any legendary Dramione fics. I like reading about Hogwarts and not post Hogwarts but i don't really care in this instance. Either AO3 or ff.net

** Lady of the lake was a dark fic that was actually wonderfully written if not a bit edgy to start. Over tkme it really settled into itself.

Ffnlink(lady of the lake by Columbrina)

Dancing with Draco was a cool short story premise that developed into a really AU fic in its sequel. But it was still very well done. School fic based around McGonagall making him teach her how to dance for the Yule Ball.

Ffnlink(dancing with Draco by diamonddaydream)

Waifs and Strays was an AMAZINGLY written fic with natural relationship progression. Draco ended up as Hermiones familar in an accidental animagus transformation situation and grows to love her from that view point. Ffnlink(Waifs and Strays by kyonomiko)

Mine is a WIP but is all written and just editing. People seem to like the world building and characterization. It has Hermione and Draco jetsrtting across the world and becoming friends while they actually take time to learn about each other. It's not flashy but it's natural feeling and healthy.

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time Hermione Granger literally ran into Draco Malfoy in a bookshop. His mother sees a connection between her son and the muggleborn that she can't ignore and determines to get to know the girl. An imagining of how things could have gone if Hermione had been taken under the wing of the Malfoy family.
