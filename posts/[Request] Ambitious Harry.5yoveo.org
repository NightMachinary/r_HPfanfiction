Could someone recommend a few fics with an ambitious Harry? Time travel fics are good fun for me, I've read a few of them. I'd prefer something that vaguely follows canon. Weasley bashing is a plus. Thanks so much!


** linkffn(Contractual Invalidation by R-dude) contains my favorite portrayal of a reasonably ambitious Harry.

** Vaguely follows canon? linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is what you want, since it only diverges a lot towards the end of the second year. No real Weasley bashing though.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Well, I would say that “Seventh Horcrux” fits because he does have an ambition from an early age and does strive to fulfil it even if it is not a grand ambition. I won't link it because everyone and their grandmother and her pet parrot know that story and we've had someone go stupid and recommend it in response to requests it couldn't possibly even hope to fit for free karma points (and obviously get downvoted). It does vaguely follow canon, though, so that's a plus.

“Harry the Hufflepuff” series does also have a Harry who has an ambition and is fairly rigorously working towards fulfilling it. This ambition is being able to be lazy forever, though, so again I won't link it because as with the above the story is recommended often enough that it's easy to get to and just as with the above you might or might not count that as actually fitting your request in spirit. As with the above, it does vaguely follow canon, though it is now only past year three (but each year is a stand-alone part and complete).

“The Difference One Man Can Make” (linkffn(11132113)) does have a Harry with some ambition, even if it later gets a bit outweighted by the need to do things rather than his want, but you do get to see him do something ambitious and the results are there. That said, it is a crossover with Game of Thrones and it is also a “guilty pleasure” kind of fic so though the plot is entertaining and stuff do be aware of that if you try to get into it.

And then there is “Business” (linkao3(1113588)), a one-shot by esama in which Harry takes his relatives' words to mind and does ambitiously try to be all that they made him out to be.

The last I have is “Modest, Too” (linkffn(5890484)), a story in which ... something happens. I really wanted to tell but eh, let's not spoil it, it's somewhat entertaining. That said, it is another “guilty pleasure” story, and it might or might not contain bashing (it's been a long time since I actually read it, but I think Molly and Albus got hit a bit) so if you cannot get through that you might want to skip it rather than start and then get annoyed.

linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai) unfortunately not finished, but really really well-written

linkffn(The Butterfly Effect by CaspianAlexander) on hiatus, but superbly written with a unique plot

linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectare) very unique plot, extra bonus of Severus Snape and Aurora Sinistra being badass Slytherins
