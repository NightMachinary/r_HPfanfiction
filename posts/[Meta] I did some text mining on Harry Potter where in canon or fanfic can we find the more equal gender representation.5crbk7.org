** Two things.

Firstly:

#+begin_quote
  Several explanations can be advanced on the subject:

  Canon books, movies and TV series are more often centered around male characters than female ones

  Even when there are canon female characters, canon male characters are deemed more interesting than female ones in terms of story development and character arcs

  Or it could be due to internalized misogyny: we would be taught since infancy that men are more of the hero-type than female
#+end_quote

I feel like you've missed the most obvious explanation, which is that most female fanfic writers are interested in romance fics, and when writing these, fanfic authors tend to focus on the characters they are attracted to themselves (also explaining the popularity of slash amongst females and femslash amongst males). So heterosexual women writing romance stories are going to focus on male characters (e.g. Snape, Malfoy).

Secondly:

I feel like the pronoun analysis is a weak way to measure any kind of gender representation.

Most obviously, because in any work written in third person, the vast majority of the pronouns used are going to refer to the protagonist and will simply reflect their gender. Natural variation in the frequency with which the protagonist is referred to by name vs pronoun seems likely to distort any results.

The other reason why pronoun analysis is a bit useless as a measure here is that of course frequency is not the same thing as importance. I'm sure a harem fic would have tons of female pronouns in it, but I would not exactly call that a prime example of female empowerment. Ultimately what matters most is how the female characters are depicted, not how many of them there are. A single fleshed out female character is worth a hundred walking stereotypes.

Edit:

Oh, and with regards to your conclusion, while Hermione is frequently shown to be a superior witch to Harry in Transfiguration and Charms, Harry is equally consistently shown to be the superior wizard when it comes to Defence Against the Dark Arts, the most directly applicable subject to most of the dangerous situations they find themselves in. I think it's a bit disingenuous to present it as if Harry is the leader due to courage and prophecy alone. He's also the one who generally is the best at navigating high pressure and perilous situations.

(Also, if you reread Philosopher's Stone you will be struck by how genuinely unlikeable Hermione was back then.)

It's not perfect, but it is informative and it's an easy metric to gather.

You missed this part:

"Again, I looked at the most-loved stories for each list: the first 50 for the Hermione-centric fics, the first 20 for the fem!Harry fics (this is a more minor genre), excluding crossovers, and compared them to canon."

In the following table, it looks like about 40% of them are still weighted toward masculine pronouns over feminine. Compare to general fics and it's something around 95% of them weighted toward masculine over feminine. In general fics, about a fifth have less than 10% female pronouns; in the fem!Harry/Hermione-centric fics, only one of them had such a skewed pronoun ratio.

Not sure how you missed it; it was a full third of the post.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Nothing like that is mentioned in /Philosopher's Stone/. In /Chamber of Secrets/, Hermione was sniping pixies out of the air with /Immobilus/ while Harry was trying to *catch* them like a Muggle. He's not shown to be better than her in the theoretical aspects -- Hermione identified that the monster was a basilisk, not Harry.

In /Prisoner of Azkaban/, in his first display of anything beyond mediocrity with a wand, he does learn the Patronus charm, though it takes him a full term to do it. In fifth year he manages to teach it to a number of other students -- they started on it after students started having stress breakdowns from studying for OWLs (maybe a little sooner), and almost everyone finished by the end of the chapter. OWL scores favor Harry over Hermione, but that works as an informed ability.

In short, Harry displays very little advanced knowledge of Defence, and none is recorded by the end of /Philosopher's Stone/.

You're free to think that Harry demonstrated unusual levels of ability during Quirrell's classes, or that he was studying and practising outside class and Hermione noticed that he was more skilled, but that's outside of canon.

**** I feel like you're confusing being a better student at DADA with being better at DAD. In canon Harry is better at DADA, and Hermione is a better student.

Harry having less knowledge than Hermione doesn't make him worse at DADA, in the same sense that knowing the physics of tennis doesn't make you the best tennis player. The first thing we see (and the only specific thing we see that I can recall) is Harry mastering the Patronus Charm in third year, which we are told is a spell most adult wizards can't do. Hermione on the other hand had a difficult time with it in fifth year, 2 years older than Harry.

I'm not saying it doesn't make sense for Hermione to struggle with the Patronus Charm at first, Harry did as well (though we can't compare their progress to each others as we only see Harry's). However I think that Harry mastering the spell so early and Hermione struggling with it is a way to show us that he is naturally better than Hermione at DADA, given that I can't think of any other SPECIFIC defense spell or technique that could show us aptitude in DADA.

EDIT: Just remembered Harry could (at least partiallt) resist the Imperius on his first try, iirc he's the only one in class.

*** Pronoun analysis is sure a crude measure but I wouldn't say that it is useless. It reflects the gender of the main protagonist sure, but as long as the main character interacts with a variety of other characters, this should be reflected in pronouns. A text with less than 15% of female pronouns is a text without any strong female agency. Furthermore, the impact of having a male as the main protagonist is not necessarily a problem in a comparatist perspective, when one looks at a book and at fics with quite often the same hero. And anyway, you can see in the last table that fics where the main protagonist is a woman (either Hermione or a genderbent Harry) do not exhibit a reverse imbalance in gendered pronouns of the same size as when Harry is the hero.

I agree with you that the frequency of male and female pronouns tells us nothing about their role, the qualities associated with them, etc. I'd like into the future to look at associations. I also started an analysis with the characters name, rather than the pronouns. It is more complicated obviously since some important characters share names (the Weasleys for example). However, the results are not so different than when using pronouns (I plan to post something about that on the blog in the following weeks, but this post was already far too long!).

I see your point about the power of attraction of male characters for female writers who are attracted to men but I am not convinced that it is the answer to the question "why slash?". Buffy fans do not really see the need for writing dudeslash. Plenty who love Snape and Draco as characters actually write Snamione or Dramione.

For the beginning of the conclusion, maybe that wasn't clear but I was paraphrasing the linked article because it is in French. I really like both Harry and Hermione, and Harry sure is a powerful wizard. But still, the fact that he is the Boy Who Lived (and later the prophecy) is crucial to him being the leader.

Anyway, thanks for your comment!

**** My main problem with what I read was that fanfiction is based off of a source. A source which you've already shown the ratios for. When writing a fanfiction it's almost always better to pull from the known cast list than to make an original character. So writers have a much larger pool of males to pull from than females.

I think that the initial source material is effecting the statistics you pulled from fanfiction a lot. As well as the protagonist effecting a vast majority of the pronouns you would have pulled(But you've already addressed that).

***** Yes, of course it's influencing them, that's why I chose to compare both and not just compute stats on fics. But authors choose which characters they expand on. As I said, the full cast is pretty long (around 170). I'm currently doing stats using character names, to see which characters are overrepresented and which are underrepresented in these 100 fics with respect to canon. Many of the results are not surprising: Theodore Nott or Fleur Delacour are more developed in ff, while Hagrid, Trelawney or Filch are relatively less mentioned in fics than in HP. However some surprised me a little: fics mentioned more Alice and Frank Longbottom, or Septima Vector. The numbers are still small, so I still have to check if it is driven by only one specific fic or not.

I already know that there a certain popular characters there are to expand on. Fluer and Nott being two of them. Also you'll see a much weirder expansion on Daphne Greengrass that if I remember correctly is only mentioned once in all 7 of the books but has a lot of stories starring her. You'll see Vector in a lot of stories where Harry takes his schooling more seriously and takes her class.

Context is going to show the real facts. But I believe each story really just depends on the author and the source material.

Also side note: A lot of people hate writing Hagrid because of his accent. Trelawney is fairly unpopular, even in fics that feature divination, she'll probably only get a few lines, usually mentioning that she gave the prophecy and not much else. And Filch plays almost no real role for anything besides the cannon story points.. I mean in a world of House Elves about the only meaningful thing he does is patrol at night and give students the stink eye. He's just not a compelling character and I've only read maybe one or two fics that do anything with him at all.

** I'm really confused by that author's metrics and emphasis on AO3. FF.net is vastly larger and far more popular than AO3. So a simple look at the most frequently used main characters can give you a pretty good idea about the so called female/male ratio:

Harry P: main character in 205k fics

Hermione G: 168k

Draco M: 159k

Severus S: 70.9k

Ginny W: 53.7k

Sirius B: 53.0k

Lily Evans P: 50.2k

James P: 48.8k

Remus L: 43.8k

Ron W: 43.7k

Voldemort: 16.1k, Tom Riddle Jr: 10.2k

Luna L: 13.2k

Almost all of Draco and Snape's popularity comes from female readers. If our [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5atpzk/hpfanfiction_survey_2016_survey_on_demographics/][recent survey]] is any guide, hardly any male readers like those guys.

The author wanted data from reasonably long stories (because short stories tend to be more skewed individually and they were only analysing a small number of stories). This was trivially easy with ffn. It took additional work with ao3. The author described that work. That's all.

** Taure already got to the juicy parts of criticism. I agree with him/her that your method isn't exactly fool-proof. And my first idea as to how it fails would be that since a big majority of characters in HP are male, and most fanfiction authors used pre-existing characters, the ratio from the original books won't be vastly different except for the extreme cases you've shown.

Furthermore you're beating a dead horse. Its widely known that Harry Potter is not in any way the pinnacle of feminist literature. If you get down to it, Harry Potter has a lot of problems. For example the infamous "good guys = handsome/pretty, bad guys = ugly or otherwise physically undesirable". Rowling also worked in a lot of her own experiences, and those were, of course, from the 70s and 80s when the feminist idea was on the rise, but beyond the civil rights issues definitely not widely accepted, or(, caution: overused word,) internalized by society.

#+begin_quote
  We have a distorted image of what equal gender representation is: people (especially men) tend to think that a population has a female/male composition of 50-50, even when the ratio is close to 20-80 or 30-70. (Is there a name for this effect?)
#+end_quote

Uhm... We think that because its very close to the truth. Worldwide the ratio men to women is almost 1:1. I have no idea where you get these numbers, or am I misunderstanding something here?

About the passage you cited, I probably explained myself badly. English is not my native language. I was referring to studies about the perceived gender equilibrium (this is called mixité or parité in French). When asked if there is an equal proportion of men in women around them (for example in the workplace), men tend to answer yes, even when the actual proportions are closer to 30-70 than 50-50. I do not know how such a phenomenon is called in English, and thus have difficulties finding the appropriate sources. Do you have an idea?

**** Ahh, yes, I know what you mean. I don't remember the name of the phenomenon, but I've learned about it.

What I can remember from the explanations is that women are just "more important" in the initial perception of men. I'm looting my piles of discarded lesson-notes trying to find it. Its a well known thing in marketing, advertisement and entertainment media, and I learned about it as a tool and area of caution. However, what it boils down to is that any man, if he doesn't perceive his environment as hostile, will focus much more on the female population of an area than he will on the male population.

Its one of many explanations and far too simple for what is most likely a complex process of perception and memorization. Its just what was taught to us so we may use it as a tool for whatever stories we'll tell to our audience.

#+begin_quote
  "I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.

  "Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- /be careful/!"

  Having no friends is her own fault, because of her supposed pretientiousness.[sic]

Ginny Weasley has some agency, at least in her backstory: she sneaked out of the house at night to ride her bothers' brooms.

Molly Weasley arguably shows agency in choosing to fight at the Battle of Hogwarts. I would generally not consider it particularly demonstrative of agency to to fulfil a role, but in this case the role is contrary to what the dominant forces in society approve of. It's like, being gay in 1940 doesn't show agency, but being out and proud and defiant about it does.

Dolores Umbridge shows some agency -- she acts primarily within her role, but she greatly exceeds her mandate.

A fair comparison between a recurring character and the freak of the week is likely impossible. You can compare with every Defence professor, but that's hardly fair -- the Defence professor will only have one book to make themselves known.

A fairer comparison would be with Professor Snape, who is mentioned over twice as often as Professor McGonagall, or Professor Flitwick, who is mentioned a fifth as often. High variance, low sample size. That's why you get a better overview when aggregating by gender instead of by character then gender.

Why not and what would you suggest instead?

#+begin_quote
  From pronoun ratios alone, we would expect less female agency simply because female characters are mentioned less.
#+end_quote

This is a thoroughly unconvincing circular argument that fails to consider the quality or magnitude of a character's actions.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

By whom? Don't presume to think for me. I disagree with the OP's premise.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You don't think she had a choice? Sure she did and if Lily had stepped aside, the series would have been drastically different.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Now you're trying to wheedle semantics. From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(philosophy][Wikipedia]]:

#+begin_quote
  agency is the capacity of an actor [...] to act in any given environment.
#+end_quote

I believe Hermione's actions affected change throughout the series, thus demonstrating agency.

#+begin_quote
  A fair comparison between a recurring character and the freak of the week is likely impossible. You can compare with every Defence professor, but *that's hardly fair* -- the Defence professor will only have one book to make themselves known.
#+end_quote

Yes, this was my point. The OP wanted to draw stark conclusions on the agency of an entire gender without paying enough attention to other considerations, such as their role in that particular book (e.g. McGonagall vs. Quirrell in PS). Why not Umbridge vs Lockhart then? That doesn't work IMO because of my next point:

#+begin_quote
  A fairer comparison would be with Professor Snape, who is mentioned over twice as often as Professor McGonagall
#+end_quote

No. Snape serves far more roles than McGonagall does, so naturally he would have more mentions. This obsession with placing everyone into a hierarchy is baffling.

#+begin_quote
  Pretty much every book? In the first classes, she gets her feather levitating first, and she turns her matchstick silver before anyone else. By the end of the series, Hermione is enchanting objects and Harry seems to know about ten spells in total.
#+end_quote

Yes, because Hermione is needed to drive the plot forward. Here's a snippet from a speech J K Rowling gave to a group of librarians:

#+begin_quote
  "I would like to apologise for you and any other librarians present here today and my get-out clause is always if they'd had a pleasant, helpful librarian, half my plots would be gone. 'Cause the answer invariably is in a book, but *Hermione* has to go and find it. If they'd had a good librarian, that would have been that problem solved."
#+end_quote

Seems clear to me that the author thought she had given Hermione some agency.

#+begin_quote
  By the end of the series, Hermione is enchanting objects and Harry seems to know about ten spells in total.
#+end_quote

He did pretty well on his Defence O.W.L. for only knowing a handful of spells. Remind me, was his mark better or worse than Hermione's on that particular exam? As a follow up, out of all of their subjects, which one do you think best codifies all of the spells necessary for surviving encounters with Death Eaters?

#+begin_quote
  As long as you're not riding brooms, Hermione's better at magic than Harry.
#+end_quote

Hermione has flaws. One of them is that she chokes under pressure. Remember the Devil's Snare underneath the school? Or how about silencing instead of stunning her opponent at the Ministry battle? Having a vast repertoire of spells at your disposal is fairly meaningless if you aren't able to use them effectively when it counts.

"Agency" in literary jargon is different from "agency" in philosophical jargon.

But it should have been bleeding obvious even without going into jargon. Is it equality if a story has a good gender mix of characters who do anything, but the only ones who make decisions, show independence, or have clear goals of their own are men?

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

She knew the spell, could cast it quickly and effectively in a combat situation, and defeated two opponents with it.

Then she silenced a Death Eater who was calling for backup. In context, it wasn't a bad move, though we can't be certain it was the best move without knowing more about magic than canon tells us.

I think you're mischaracterizing the point. People here, in arguing for the status quo, have been implying that quantity is unimportant, and /only/ quality matters. But in reality, /both/ matter.

If a book has only one female character, they only appear in one scene, but they're a paragon of agency and portrayed in a respectful manner, it's not doing a good job with representation.

If a book has as many female characters as male characters, but female characters are all in traditional roles and don't show any agency, it's not doing a good job with representation.

    [regarding pronoun counting] Not ideal.
  #+end_quote

  Why not and what would you suggest instead?
#+end_quote

Pronouns are used more often when they are unambiguous -- when one person is acting for an extended period. If a story has three main characters, one male and two female, each with equal narration devoted to them, the male character will be referred to with pronouns more often because it is unambiguous, while the female characters will be referred to by name more often. Conversely, if one character is portrayed alone a lot and others are mainly portrayed together, the one who is portrayed alone will use pronouns a lot more.

Addressing this hole takes a lot of work -- you have to identify every character's name, the alternate forms of those names, and the genders of each character. You might encounter ambiguous cases. The good part is that we expect the magnitude of this effect to be relatively small with a large work of fiction.

After that, tracking the amount of dialogue and narration by gender. Then sentiment analysis for each character, aggregated by gender.

Improving more than a little is /hard/. What OP did was straightforward -- I've done the exact same thing before. Implementing any of these would mean spending time in a university library searching through NLP journals and might yield a couple publications. It's better to have this much data today than to delay for probably a couple years (because this is an evenings and weekends type of deal -- I'm not getting paid to do this).

There's one simple improvement that might be worthwhile and quick to implement: compare subject and object mentions. This is a rough estimate of how often each gender acts and how often they are acted upon. This is not terribly difficult to track, except that in English, the possessive and accusative cases for the feminine pronoun are identical (the sentence "I worked with her" might be finished with "at Cal Tech" or "cousin" with a rather different effect; changing the gender means you'd have to swap "him" for "his"). You can produce a report that explicitly handles this ambiguity by specifying subject vs non-subject instead. This would be easier in Esperanto.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    From pronoun ratios alone, we would expect less female agency simply because female characters are mentioned less.

You're arguing that a character might be mentioned only a few times but be the key to the plot, I think. But we're talking about /representation/, which kind of requires the character to be, well, present.

  As we well know, fanfiction is dominated by stories about male characters, which can appear a bit paradoxical at first, since it is predominantly written by women.

  Several explanations can be advanced on the subject: (...)
#+end_quote

Manga, anime etc. (from now on shortened to m&a) are my field of expertise and allow me to quickly present some analogical situations that show true explanation for this matter.

In m&a there exist a genre called BL (boy's love), those are romances about homosexual males, created mainly by and for heterosexual females. There are also so called "cute girls doing cute things", which as you can guess are about females and are created mainly by males for males. Males over 30 years old are also secondary target of magical girl series, which as the name suggest are about females.

Similar situation apply to fanfiction. Taure's last survey confirmed what everybody already knew, slash is mainly read by females. So how do this work? Simple, most of people are heterosexual and are simply interested in opposite gender, and so in works that feature them. Of course character in those works are often warped to be more in line with creators' and readers' fantasies than reality. So the abundance of male characters in female-created works (and vice-versa) isn't exactly some hallmark of equal representation.

Having no friends is her own fault, because of her supposed pretientiousness.
#+end_quote

You've either have read the books long time ago, or misinterpret them heavily. She was annoying, and bossy and she was clearly meant to be annoying and bossy. Her getting more likeable isn't some part of JKR's evil, anti-female plot, it's character development.

But regretting that most fiction works do not have well-developed female characters is not the same as saying that books or fics or movies staring and almost all-male cast are not interesting, or that fics with female heros are /per se/ better. I enjoyed reading quite a few of the fics that ranked low in my list according to their female/male pronouns ratio, and a huge number of other ones that would not have performed better on this matter.

  Any plans to look into sentiment analysis?

Yes! But i'm pretty new to text mining, and I did not yet find a way to restrict sentiment analysis to specific parts of a text (for example text at a certain distance from a specific pronoun of a specific character name).

** It's pretty well accepted that the number and quality of female characters jumped in Order of the Phoenix. If you text mine canon, you'll probably find a significant increase in female pronouns starting there.

*** Yes I do! The female/male pronouns ratio jumped from 23% in GoF to 34% in OotF. But since it went back to around 25% in HBP and DH, I think that most of the jump can be attributed to Umbridge being the DADA teacher at the time.
