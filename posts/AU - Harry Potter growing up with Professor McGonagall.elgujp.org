I am looking for a relatively long and recommendable fanfiction where Harry grows up with Professor McGonagall instead of the Dursley family.

** There was a really fun one with him living in a cottage somewhere with Sirius, Remus, and then McGonagall moved in after Harry emotionally begged her to. She'd been teaching him something, the animagus thing I think, and they built up the relationship to that. I think it might've been Marauder's Plan, but that thing is too long for me to check.
