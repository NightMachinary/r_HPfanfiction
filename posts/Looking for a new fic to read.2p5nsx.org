** Dark, bittersweet, depressing, and other related terms are all kinda subjective, but hopefully I didn't completely fuck it up. Also a few of these are oneshots.

** First thing that popped to mind when you mentioned liking those 3 fics, as well as something "hopefully long, bittersweet/dark/depressing fic, with preferably no bashing" is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]].

That one has roughly the same angst/melodrama level as the three you mentioned, and is complete at just under 100K words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries][When A Veela Cries]] also seems to fit your categories pretty well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/The-Prisoner-s-Cipher][The Prisoner's Cipher]] also comes to mind, though it's nowhere near as long as any of the three fics you mentioned liking.

I strongly recommend Ella's (Deadwoodpecker's) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose]] series. Book one does bittersweet as well as it's been done; book two pushes it into dark and depressing land. She's updated her book three recently, which lends hope that her magnum opus will one day be completed. She's on my short list of favorite fanfiction writers.
