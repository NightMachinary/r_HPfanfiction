:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been looking so hard for this fic I know I've read it somewhere:

In which Harry has a bethrotal contract with Daphne and the Greengrasses contact the Dursleys and the two meet at an early age, Petunia also remembers something about Diagon Alley, Burbling Basilisk or something like that.

Does anybody know this fic? I don't remember the name, but I know I've read this somewhere.

Help is greatly appreciated, thanks.


** A quick search on ffn yielded that fic that could match your description: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11755378/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Greengrass-Connection]]) Sorry if it's not the right one. But if nobody here knows, you might have more luck asking on the [[/r/haphne]] sub, or on their Discord.

  What if it turns out in October, 1986, whilst Harry is living with the Dursleys, that Harry is betrothed to a witch less than a year older than him called Daphne Greengrass? Cross-posted from another site. Rated T. March 5, 2016: On hiatus after chapter 7 (Harry's birthday, 1987, part 1), for now, bar corrections. Next update time unknown.
