What ideas do you have that you want someone to write? What do you think would make a good story or part of the plot of a story?

EDIT: OP didn't deliver - here are my own ideas.

--------------

1) One one-shot per chapter, each chapter details the weekly lives of Department of Mysteries employees.

One idea I had it that a squib without knowledge of the magical world gives birth to a boy who is some abomination of magic.

I figured this idea would allow me to explore esoteric magics and invent some dastardly things of my own that I could terrify, shock, or outrage the reader with.

... and that's why they call them 'Unspeakables'.

--------------

2) Lily died that night, but James had left to visit Sirius only minutes before Voldemort arrived.

Long story short, James and Sirius, half-crazed with fury, track down Peter, who proclaims his guilt in some public place (Diagon Alley, I think) but they blew him to smithereens with few spells, but that incident didn't eclipse the story of the Boy-Who-Lived.

Harry is taken away and trained by James/Sirius/Remus (He is trained because James thought it was shifty that Dumbledore didn't share the whole prophecy.

--------------

Second scene I planned in my head just now:

"Come in, Harry." the headmaster called even as the door swung open to admit him.

"Hello, headmaster." he said evenly, his father had warned him of the old headmaster, that he was a finicky person, and quite ruthless (though his age and current stance did little to support that).

Harry walked forward and sat at the chair the headmaster conjured, though Harry supposed that was done to impress him, as there were a chair already available, though pushed against the wall - and he wondered whether that was done in a rushed state, as the chair legs had scraped across the floor. Dumbledore saw him notice

"You miss little, do you Harry?" said the headmaster, a little annoyed - but proud, too.

And he didn't - but he cursed Remus for training him to notice, as he took Harry's training so seriously he employed his own natural inclinations as a werewolf, and scolded him should he miss smelling a poison in his food or drink. But it worked, and Harry drank only from a hipflask his father and Sirius had fashioned, and woe unto those who tampered with it.

"Not really sir." he said politely, and they fell into silence. Harry tried not to squirm under the headmasters gaze, and played with his meager mind shields lest the headmaster try to catch information that way, though they were not his forte, but he could at least detect an intrusion.

"What does your father think of me, Harry?" said the headmaster after a short while, "It has been rather a while that I have even seen him."

"He's thought you senile since you told him I would be better protected at my aunt's hole... sir." replied Harry, who grimaced at even saying that the headmaster might be senile... to his face. He figured his dad and Sirius - and likely Remus would laugh at it later though.

"Senile?" replied the headmaster in amusement, "I certainly qualify..." he finished, and Harry laughed a little. Both thought this was a victory for them. For Harry the laugh had reduced the tension a little, and the headmaster was pleased at making him laugh, and smiled because of it.

"You only a hundred-fifty, sir." Harry said cheekily, and they laughed again.

"Yes... time is catching up to me, as it catches up to us all, and soon I may be caught finally - but this is a daunting topic to all, so I should ask you how you find your classes?"

"They are well sir," he replied, "And I am one of the better students, too." he added a little smugly.

"Yes, yes," the headmaster smiled, "I'd heard of your accomplishments - I suspect you have been training a while already, years perhaps?" he asked.

Harry nodded, "Since I was seven, sir - when you told dad more of the prophecy." He said, and felt a little pleased at the expression on the headmasters face at it.

"I wish he hadn't, but I digress, what's done is done - and were it any other way I would surely have told you within years myself."

Harry replied with a nod and a shrug.

"May I ask what they have taught you? I suspect Sirius' doing in your spellwork, you hold you wand as many seasoned Aurors do..."

Harry grimaced then and said, "You would have to talk to my father, or Sirius, sir. But Sirius would curse you more than talk with you, or likely even listen to you..." he said it almost apologetically, but not quite.

The headmaster nodded as though it were already known by him, but himself replied - in a near-whinge, "I take it he will wish to know the full prophecy in exchange?" to which he received a nod. "Very well, Harry. I wish you the best of luck in Ravenclaw - according to Filius you've more than earned your place there."

Harry nodded and stood, at the door the headmaster spoke again. "Oh - and Harry, please take little note of the rumours - they are curious children is all." explained the headmaster, "And it was pleasant talking with you, I hope you have a good night." he called.

Harry smiled and bid the headmaster goodnight too, then left.

--------------

This is as far as I got in a minute's thinking, but if I were to write this I would start here, then have the narrative and dialogue provide back story.


** Ah, such a glorious topic. I have a great many plot bunnies built up over the years... let's see if I can dredge some of them up. These vary from pure crack to sprawling serious AUs. Some of these stories I wrote beginnings to but I haven't tackled any of them seriously.

--------------

*One (crack)*

CoS AU. Harry has never seen or even heard of house elves before, so he's dangerously naive. Dobby comes along, claims to be a house elf and claims Harry is in danger. All he needs to do is follow Dobby and Dobby will get him to safety...

... it turns out Dobby is not a house elf at all, but an erkling:

#+begin_quote
  Erklings are elfish creatures, three feet tall on average (making them larger than gnomes) with pointed faces, which have a particular affinity for the taste of children. Their high pitch cackles are particularly entrancing to children, and they use this to lure them away from their guardians to eat them. These creatures also enjoy shooting darts at unsuspecting victims.
#+end_quote

Harry goes with Dobby and Dobby eats him.

--------------

*Two*

HP/LOTR. Post-DH, no epilogue. The goblins always were too greedy for their own good. Searching for the legendary metal mythril, they dig too deep, and awaken beneath Gringotts a nameless horror. A demon of the ancient world. Can Auror Captain Harry Potter contain this threat, or will modern magic fall to an ancient power?

--------------

*Three*

Pre-Hogwarts, Dresden Files crossover. Nine-year-old Harry Potter never gets any Christmas presents and he wants to know why. He decides to take matters into his own hands and crawls up the Dursleys' chimney to find himself in a winter wonderland. Kid!Harry and kid!Maeve going on an adventure together to find Santa Claus.

--------------

*Four (semi-crack)*

Poking fun at the "Ice Queen" thing by taking it entirely literally.

HBP divergence. When Scrimgeour comes to the Burrow at Christmas, he has a task for Harry: he must help the Ministry secure an alliance with the kingdom of Svalbard, one of the most powerful magical nations in the world. How? Rufus recommends starting with the King's daughter, the Ice Princess: Daphne Greengrass.

--------------

*Five*

Speaking of ice...

When Elsa's powers leave Anna injured in the prologue to Frozen, her parents decide there's only one thing for it: she has to go to Hogwarts.

An Elsa-centric exploration of Hogwarts in the 1780s. Focus on drama and politics (Elsa being a future queen, the first magical royal in centuries, albeit of a small kingdom).

--------------

*Six (semi-crack)*

Teen comedy. Post-OotP, summer fic. Don't tell the Muggles, they said. Don't let them see. But Dudley's friend Mandy has amazing tits, and impressing her suddenly feels very important to Harry. International Statute of What?

--------------

*Seven (crack)*

"If you love books so much, why don't you become one!" Ron really should think before he speaks, especially when he has a broken wand. CoS AU, book!Hermione/diary!Riddle.

--------------

*Eight*

For a while now I've wanted to see a HP story that deals with Harry and co. fighting against a curse. Not a "point and shoot" curse but one of the more arcane, mystical types of curses, like the DADA curse, or the curses on some of the books in the restricted section.

I see it as an in-canon mini-adventure that takes place within one of the books, between canon events. A long one shot or novella would work best. Like an episode of Buffy.

Not sure what the curse would be though.

--------------

*Nine*

The Room of Requirement was able to contain the Fiendfyre, but not stop it. For 19 years it has burned, the spell sustained by the nature of the room. For the Room of Requirement gives its occupant whatever it wants...

Next gen fic with a new villain: a sentient magical entity made of fiendfyre, born in the Room of Requirement.

--------------

*Ten*

A world in which the Statute of Secrecy never achieved the necessary popular support. Steampunky world were the Muggles are ruled by a small and mysterious group of wizards. They are a privileged, political class, walking the halls of Whitehall, Westminster and Buckingham Palace. All Muggles have heard of them, and their influence is pervasive... yet few have ever seen one. The British Empire still survives, and while the monarch has nominal control, a wizarding Regent really runs the show.

A world strongly influenced by Stroud's Bartimaeus Trilogy, but with HP magic and characters.

--------------

*Eleven*

AU HP fic where Hogwarts isn't a magical secondary school, it's a magical university. Formal magical education begins at 18, not 11. The wizarding world is much more incorporated with the Muggle one (everyone goes to Muggle school until 18, the Ministry of Magic really is a secret division of the Muggle government), but still a secret.

We don't join Harry at 11, we join him at 18. He's been with the Dursleys all that time and has been going to Muggle secondary school. He knows about his powers and has been experimenting with them but doesn't know about the wizarding world as such.

--------------

*Twelve*

GoF peggy sue (fic where Harry's consciousness goes back in time to his younger self). Unlike other peggy sue fics, this is one year only. Harry grabs the portkey to escape the graveyard at the end of GoF just as Voldemort's spell hits it. When he lands, he finds himself landing at the Burrow, arriving back from the Quidditch World Cup.

(Important plot point: remember that Harry doesn't know about Moody at this point, though he does know that Voldemort has a servant at Hogwarts. Harry will be prevented from Gary Stu victory by confiding in Moody mid way through the fic).

--------------

*Thirteen*

AU where Harry was left a squib by Voldemort's attack in 1981... except he is a metamorphmagus. That power survived the attack. The fic would have Harry going to Muggle high school and would model itself roughly around the story structure shown in Buffy. Remus Lupin would become Harry's mentor, taking a role at the school, and he would have a few Muggle friends too. Together they interact with the fringes of the magical world, the bits that the wizards in their arrogance ignore as inferior and not their concern: werewolves, vampires, hags, etc. Wizards are a distant presence in the fic, like the Watcher's Council in Buffy.

--------------

*Fourteen*

HP/Buffy fusion fic where HP characters are merged into the Buffy world. Hogwarts is the code name for the school where the children of Watchers are sent. Tom Riddle was a powerful warlock who tried to take over the Watcher's Council. Harry's parents were Watchers killed by him.

We join the fic in Harry's second year at Cambridge university, where he is studying Anglo-Saxon, Celtic and Norse, having been mentored under the magic expert Albus Dumbledore at school.

The plot is centred around an attempted resurrection of the necromancer Gellert Grindelwald, whose body was sent to Sunnydale to be protected by the Slayer. Unfortunately no one seems to have told her this... so Harry is sent by the Watcher's Council as part of a team under the Watcher Sirius Black to inform and assist Buffy.

*Fifteen*

HP fanfic inspired by Gossip Girl, focusing on a very different AU magical society centred in London. See [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10781800/2/False-Starts][here]].

*** Twelve sounds like a very interesting take on a time-travel fic - I don't think I've ever seen one with that short a jump back. I really like the fact that he'd have useful, but limited and incomplete information.

Nine really grabbed me. That's a great premise for a next-gen fic, and you could take it several different directions. The thought that the fire was burning the whole time is really evocative and powerful.

(Also, regarding the above ideas, it occurs to me that ideas 10&15 could be combined into a single fic, as could ideas 11&13.)

--------------

*Sixteen*

HP/Stargate fusion. Post DH, no epilogue. Everything from Stargate has been "magicised": the Goa'uld are immortal non-corporeal magical beings which possess people magically, the Stargate is a magical portal between worlds, no space ships. When the Stargate is discovered in 1928 by a British expedition the Ministry of Magic appropriate it and it goes to the Department of Mysteries. They figure out how to activate it in 2008.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter has been gaining a name for himself as a globe trotting adventurer and has attracted the Ministry's attention thanks to a mysterious armband he found in Egypt. They bring him in, determined to take the arm band off him, and they reach a deal... Harry will let them borrow it, if they let him in on their secret project.

And so it is that Auror Ron Weasley, Unspeakable Hermione Weasley and adventurer Harry Potter go through the Stargate for the first time, accompanied by various other wizards.

As well as the obvious, the story would also uncover bit by bit the back story for how the various characters ended up in these situations. (Harry and Fleur affair being a major divergence point which aborted the epilogue).

The team dynamics would be a fun part as well, as Ron would be in charge of the expedition, which would run up against Harry's natural leadership instincts.

--------------

*Seventeen*

Voldemort in the Dresden Files universe. Short Voldemort-centric "montage style" novella dipping in to Voldemort's life at various moments. The overall arc would be Voldemort slowly increasing his power, with the aim of gaining true immortality and his own demesne in the Nevernever. Finally he is in a universe where becoming a god is a real possibility. The downside: there's a load of beings even more powerful than he.

--------------

*Eighteen*

Post-DH epilogue compliant time travel story where it's a Voldemort sympathiser who goes back in time, not Harry. There's a break-in at the Department of Mysteries and Auror Harry goes it investigate under his invisibility cloak. He arrives just in time to see a mysterious wizard in the time room fiddling with an artefact. A magical backlash knocks Harry out.

When he wakes the world has changed. His scar tingles: Voldemort is alive. He quickly realises that he is living in a dystopian world where Voldemort was never defeated.

After some near-misses with the authorities, Harry finds the remnant Order, who are very suspicious of him. Harry learns that he was killed in his summer before sixth year, assassinated by a mysterious assailant. It becomes clear: the wizard in the Department of Mysteries went back in time and killed Harry.

Harry tries to persuade the Order to make one last effort: they have to get Harry into Voldemort's Ministry so he can break into the Department of Mysteries, go back in time and prevent his own assassination.

The Order is sceptical, as their spirit is broken. Everyone is different to how Harry remembers. Remus and Tonks, for example, cannot bear to look at each other: Tonks is their mole within Voldemort's ranks, impersonating Narcissa Malfoy, whom the Order assassinated years ago. Remus can't stand that she is sleeping with Lucius Malfoy as part of her cover.

But eventually the Order relents. They assault the Ministry and make it to the DoM at the cost of many lives. Harry uses the time machine, goes back in time and prevents his own assassination.

And is stuck in the past. The alternate dystopian timeline is now but a figment of Harry's memories. It has corrected itself out of existence.

Epilogue: Harry, still in the past, goes to meet Albus Dumbledore. He confesses everything. Dumbledore explains how it is that Harry survived the change in the timeline: Harry's blood in Voldemort's veins. Voldemort being alive once more meant Harry could not die. This combined with Harry being under his invisibility cloak at the time of the change resulted in Harry both surviving the change but also not being displaced by it.

Harry confesses he has no idea what to do now. He misses his kids.

Dumbledore asks him some probing questions. He was able to walk into an Acromantula nest at the age of 12 and survive? He was able to take a portkey out of the graveyard, though Voldemort would not have planned for the portkey to be two-way? He broke into the Department of Mysteries aged 15 without any trouble? He was able to evade Voldemort's Ministry for months at the age of 17?

Harry understands. Like his experience with time turners, this was always meant to be. His presence in the past was already factored into the future. Harry would protect his younger self, guiding him from the shadows, unaware that he ever existed. He would return to the future the long way around. He will see his children again, on the day that his younger self disappears into the past.

--------------

*Nineteen*

The perfect smutfic.

A series of “missing moments” focusing on Harry's interactions with the opposite sex. Characterisations will be as close to canon as possible, while obviously allowing for the mature tone of the fic.

Each chapter of the fic is a self-contained one-shot, existing in the shared universe of the fic as a whole. The fic is an AU so "missing moments" is not quite accurate, but the idea is that these moments do not disturb the main canon plotline.

The earlier chapters aren't sex. A smutfic is all about the build up, after all. Harry doesn't have full sex until chapter 7 of 10. Brief outline:

/GoF/

Chapter 1: Quidditch World Cup, Harry and Hermione end up having to get changed in the same room. No touching, nor anything romantic. Brief glimpses of underwear only. But Harry's curiosity is piqued.

Chapter 2: Pre-ball, but after Harry has asked Parvati out. Harry/Parvati make-out session.

Chapter 3: Hermione accompanies Harry to the Prefect's Bath to help him figure out his clue. Again, restraint and teasing the reader is the name of the game. Brief flashes of bubble-covered nipple and body parts brushing underwater to be the limit.

/OotP/

Chapter 4: Grimmauld Place, the night before Harry's trial, he can't sleep and stays up late with Hermione, chatting about stuff they've never really talked about before: the fact that she's a girl and he's a boy. Each is curious about stuff. Eventually they curl up on the couch to sleep. Harry gets an awkward handjob under the covers.

Chapter 5: End of term, post Ministry battle. Harry doing his Sirius moping but ends up attending an end of term gathering at the Three Broomsticks. Gets a drunken blowjob from Pansy in the bathroom.

/HBP/

Chapter 6: A hot day at the Burrow. Following Quidditch, people are splashing around in the pond to cool down. Harry and Fleur talk while the others are in the water, skirting around the fact that Fleur is not well-liked at the Burrow. Chat comes onto the topic of Sirius and Fleur decides to cheer Harry up and starts applying sun cream to herself. No nudity, but things definitely wobble in interesting ways. Harry then does her back.

Chapter 7: After Slughorn's Christmas party, a slightly drunk Harry and Luna have fumbling, awkward, but essentially fun first-time sex.

Chapter 8: Harry and Ginny, following the Quidditch party. Heavy petting and Ginny characterisation.

/DH/

Chapter 9: Camping, after Ron has gone. Harry and Hermione have comfort sex.

Chapter 10: After the battle of Hogwarts, Harry and Ginny have victory sex.

Also given the mantle of Santa Claus he could see them finding him or searching for him as part of a childhood adventure (of the Winter variety).

*** You have certainly the backlog of ideas (No, I'm not jealous at all at having so little myself - /see edit for my own ideas/).

*One* could be a brilliantly terrifying little one-shot, but it could also make do as a prologue to a hauntingly dark magical world, compared to Rowling's mystical and generally happy one.

*Two* deserves to be written, and if written well it would gain quite a following I wager - I would read it in an instant!

*Three* is cracky, though could be made less so if it were to be not a chimney he climbs up, rather some magical wormhole, you could play this into a series of one-shots of cross-overs by having the Department of Mysteries or something arrive shortly after Harry falls in, and have one of them be thankful that no one had fallen in /this time./

Boom! That would be a brilliant thing to read, for you could have Harry Potter universe characters meeting up in Dresden Files world... or something.

*Four* I would read this.

*Five* I would write this myself if I weren't delayed by a couple years worth of HP novels myself, best of luck with it though.

*Six* I feel I should write something mocking this, for Ministry obliviators turn up and take their memories away, then Harry goes to Azkaban, looking desolately through the bars of his cell, "I only thought she had nice tits..." */Fin/* :P

*Seven* Hehehehehe

*Eight* Oooh! This idea plays into the one I myself had, read my first plot idea for more info.

*Nine* This sounds horrifying... I love it! It could make for a fantastic horror or mystery, and there are far too few of those around.

*Ten* I find this a charming idea, I can see how it would work.

*Eleven* This is most interesting and quite a daunting in impact - imagine if Tom Riddle were to grow as he had for so long? Would what happens to him make the Statute of Secrecy be created?

*Twelve* Damnnn that's a good one.

*Thirteen* I would read this, it sounds like it could be immensely entertaining if pulled off right.

Shouting "Potter!" gets a confused look and a raised eyebrow from the Brat-That-Wont-Die in front of him... and a "Yes, Professor Snape?" from the one standing behind him. Snape then notices the one sitting on his desk is wearing Slytherin robes, but the one behind him is wearing Ravenclaw robes.

See Snape. See Snape's vein try to pop out of his forehead as he tries to sort out why there are now 4 Harry Potters running about the castle, one from each house.

*** Hmm... when Voldemort tried to attack Harry in 1981 something very weird happened. His horcruxes which he thought made him safe turned out to be his vulnerability... Harry's soul travels down the connection between Voldemort and his horcruxes, taking each of them over. There are now six Harry Potters walking around, all of them sharing a single soul. They've grown up separately and have developed different characteristics, but their soul connection binds them together, giving them a unity of purpose and spirit.

Though one could play with other ideas... Technically all of the Harry's except Gryfindor would have been around someone who could arrange for them to go regardless of letter.

To grow up accustomed to the 'universe' literally reshaping around you to conform to your every whim except for food 'other people' which is instead delivered by tiny beings that are all too happy to be of assistance.

Your only social interaction is with house elves and maybe the occasional portrait that got placed into storage. ... I suppose his 'brother' Ares Regulus Black would be able to relate to that last part... Maybe Riddle!Harry could too a bit, given that he's had 11 years of living with his stalker named Dobby.

*************** I think the idea of being raised in the RoR where the universe reshapes itself to your will is really interesting. And definitely result in someone with a very warped sense of reality. I'd see him as being kinda accident prone simply because he expects things to reform for him. Or extremely talented in silent/wandless casting since he has trained from childhood to focus on what he wants, and KNOWS it will become.

Could go 2 ways as I see:

1. How linked are the room and the castle. Could the castle provide everything the room has before, or more exactly, could the room create things for him anywhere in the castle. This could go interesting places if the castle is actually 'sentient' with the RoR being it's core, like some fics have done. Harry/Hogwarts pairing anyone? Possibly even the "sentience" of the castle was created BY the RoR specifically because Harry "required" a friend while growing up.

2. How much of magic is based on confidence and imagination? If successful magic is heavily based on that, with the words/wand just to assist... RoR Harry could be one of the most talented wizards around (silent AND wandless casting as a first year? Simply because he's never needed either before.)

Could be an interesting interaction with his brothers. Regulus sees houseleves as people, especially Kreacher who is nearly a parent to him. RoR Harry might see them in a similar light, at least as good friends. Riddle Harry is sick of his stalker and tends to hex houseleves on sight... A good point of contention for Reg and Riddle, other then "Bow to me!" "Nope, not bowing to myself."

He also struggles with motivational issues... His matchstick remains a needle because he can't figure out why he'd want a needle in the first place.

He asks the teacher, and is told that its training and building up to being able to do interesting things like turn his desk into a pig.

His response is to turn his desk into a pig, declares himself excused on account of bored, and that he'll be in the library reading. He then rides the pig out of the room. If asked to repeat the spell, he just looks at the person confusedly "... but I already did that, why would I want to again?"

Obviously the above lends more to a silly fic than a serious one. But seriously, /wanting/ something could be the driving force of his magic.

Then one night while walking home back from his crappy job and lamenting his life, this guy encounters a bunch of Dark wizards torturing Muggles, and they catch him and give him a taste of Cruciatus, or perhaps something more inventive.

  When they're about to finish him off, he asks his tormentor what time it is. The wizard chuckles and grants the poor Muggle his last wish. As the dude watches the attacker raise his wand to finish him off, his last thought is that he's just turned 30, and that he's going to die a virgin.

  And then he becomes a fucking wizard. Because that's how it works.

  The guy then slaughters them all, or, I dunno, makes them his underlings and tries to become a Dark Lord. I haven't really thought that far ahead since it's unlikely I'm ever going to write this.

- "It's probably a myth. I spent two weeks keeping Neville's toad on top of an egg, and I all I got for my trouble was a morbidly obese toad and a rotten egg."

- "You didn't know that Hagrid and Madame Maxine were half-giants? Just look at their teeth!"

He is one of seven people to have won the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize][Nobel Peace Prize]], the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom][Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Gold_Medal][Congressional Gold Medal]] and was also awarded the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Vibhushan][Padma Vibhushan]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India][India]]'s second highest civilian honor.

  Borlaug received his B.Sc. Biology 1937 and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy][Ph.D.]] in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_pathology][plant pathology]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics][genetics]] from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota][University of Minnesota]] in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position in Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield][yield]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytopathology][disease]]-resistant [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat][wheat]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(biology)][varieties]].

  During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan][Pakistan]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India][India]]. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security][food security]] in those nations. These collective increases in yield have been labeled the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution][Green Revolution]], and Borlaug is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation][starvation]]. He was awarded the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize][Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_peace][world peace]] through increasing food supply.

  Later in his life, he helped apply these methods of increasing food production to Asia and Africa.

That could make for a very good Slytherin!Ron fanfic premise: Ron feels overshadowed by his brothers and neglected in favour of his baby sister; per the mirror of Erised, he wants, more than anything, to be important, to be admired and respected, so the Hat puts him in Slytherin, and, suddenly, it's much harder to be known for being Harry Potter's best mate.

Frustrated by Draco's constant flaunting of his wealth and digs about Ron's family's poverty, Ron turns his efforts pursuit of wealth and influence, parlaying his vaunted talents for chess into networking, making connections, trading favours, negotiation, eventually brokering. His brothers, who were previously unreachable high-achievers, are now invaluable connections.

In short, he becomes his generation's Horace Slughorn (minus the Potions skill).

Skill is an own goal for someone like Hermione. For Slytherin!Ron, it's a means to an end, the end being living the good life, so he would expend no more time on a skill than is necessary to facilitate said good life.

** One of these days...

The Sorcerous Seven - an adaptation of the Seven Samurai/the Magnificent Seven

The story of the Seven Samurai is of a frightened populace unable to stand up for themselves to fight off those that are pulling a Viking on them. Rather than use the resources they have, they look for mercenaries to fix things for them, but don't really trust them and in fact intend to betray them when the threat is ended. As they have done before.

This fits well with a 'new Dark Lord' style of story. Harry, Dean and Seamus are the veterans of the earlier conflict who have nothing better to do than throw their lives away for gold- this really requires that many of their potential love interests had died in the previous war, and their status in society be less than honorable. If the world shunned Harry afterwards, it would probably be due to a Pureblood backlash- 'Riddle was a half-blood! etc.'

Whether the other four mercenaries are drawn from the existing characters or derived from 'Susan's nephew' or some idly mentioned firsties from their Sixth year, the real conflict is who could lure them back to deal with the situation and still turn on them later. Having it be Draco as Minister begging for their help makes a certain poetic fit.

For it to truly fit the model, the feared opponent should be completely foreign- worse than having the half-bloods and mudbloods back amongst them. For this, I'd recommend the goblins. Regular wizarding society is out of practice when it comes to goblin warfare. They'd want the heartless heroes of the last war to teach them how to fight this new/old threat.

Okay, so the lineup is-

- Harry the veteran (Kanbei the leader)
- Orla Quirke, Jr. the hero-worshipping wannabee (Katsushiro)
- Dean Thomas his shrewd buddy (Gorobei the archer/tactician)
- Seamus Finnegan (Heihachi the happy)
- Dennis Creevey (Shichiroji, Kanbei's lieutenant)
- Cormac McLaggan the blustering ass with the BIG wand (Kikuchiyo)
- Luna Lovegood (Kyuzo the stone-faced)\\

Act 1 - Draco realizes his huge mistake in trying to bluff the goblin clan. He sends Asteria and Daphne to lure Potter back to Britain in order to help. Blaise pointed out that everyone else who knew how to magically fight- not duel, but engage in lethal battle- had left Britain when he did.

Act 2 - The Greengrasses find Harry solving a tricky situation by giving up his wand and taking down a possessed/dark wizard using Gryffindor's blade. Also witnessing the fight are Dean and Orla. Everyone meets. Harry agrees, despite protests. They find Dennis at the transit station and he shucks his uniform and says 'So, where are we going?' They bump into McLaggan while looking for Seamus in Ireland.

Act 3 - They meet with Draco and a few advisors. Draco insists that they operate anonymously, so that his Ministry can take credit if they win and blame poor hiring choices if they lose but survive. Harry accedes.

He leads them to Luna, seeking guidance on how to win this fight. She tells them it is unwinnable. So, she'll come along and see if she's right. Retraining the Aurors, LEDs and militia to fight goblins takes time and stealth. When the first cadre gets rambunctious, they fight a sally force of goblins. While the cadre is decimated, the goblins weren't expecting any resistance at all. This will trigger the full invasion.

Act 4 - Luna sneaks into Gringott's to steal their plans. McLaggan tries something similar but gets his lieutenant killed. Orla falls in love with an amiable wizard who gets killed. The veterans console her by mentioning their own lost loves (Hermione; Ginny; the Patils; Susan Bones; Natalie McDonald)

Act 5 - using Luna's captured plans, they stage ambushes to handle each of the goblin armies that rise from the depths to invade. The battlegrounds are shopping malls, zoos, museums, low grade housing and King's Cross station; each commander handles their force as they will. In the end, the goblins sue for peace.

If you've seen the original, you should know who survives.

** I got this idea when I was listening to From Shadows by Jeff Williams and Casey Lee. Basically the song is about people who are subjugated and how the will rise up and change things. It got me thinking as to who in Harry Potter are subjugated? Answer: House Elfs (or muggle-borns but it isn't as funny this way). So this fic would basically be about Dobby or some other house elf (Maybe a SI reborn as a house elf or as Dobby) getting free and waging a revolt to make all house elfs free from human rule. I think it would be interesting to read and you could make it more or less complicated by adding other rules. Like maybe house elfs need a master to survive but to get around this house elfs started bonding with each other. Maybe house elfs don't want to be free. Stuff like that.

** My second idea is another long length story, this time taking place during the Deathly Hallows.

The story begins in Hogwarts. Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley are dealing with the aftermath of the kidnapping of Luna Lovegood. This event begins to divide Neville and Ginny. Both of them want to help the school and the students against the Death Eaters, but where Neville is more patient, and willing to suffer the Carrows until such a time where they can leave. Ginny, however, wishes to be more proactive, but she comes to realize that if she attacks the Carrows, the reprisals will be terrible - but she can't just do nothing, because the students are already suffering as it is. So Ginny comes to a compromise. She decides that she can't remain at Hogwarts restlessly, because she thinks that she'll bring the wrath of the Carrows down upon her fellow students. But since she's underage, she can't use magic outside the school, and she can't go home because Hogwarts attendance is mandatory. She tells Neville that she's going to lay low at an old friend's place, and leaves the school.

Some of the story deals with the repercussions of Ginny's disappearance. As time goes on, some begin to wonder where Ginny is, and whether she is okay, as she is rather quiet - but this could be nothing to worry about - after all, Ginny is extremely popular, and a lot of families had being dropping out of the school system over the past year. It is quite feasible that she has a friend that she's hiding out with. But the alternative that something is afoul is worrying, especially when she isn't communicating with anyone. Even Harry is aware of something going on, since Ginny is no longer on the Marauder's Map.

The other part of the story deals with what is happening to Ginny. Unfortunately for our young lady, her flight is over before it begins, for she runs into - who else? Lord Voldemort.

Now (as the story explains throughout the interactions between Voldemort and Ginny), Voldemort wasn't really interested in Ginny at the start of the school year. But as the year went on, news began to trickle back to Voldemort about Ginny, including her relationships with Tom Riddle and Harry Potter, and her involvement in Dumbledore's Army. But even still, Voldemort doesn't put much weight toward's Dumbledore's Army - they are a teenager's gang, and if a couple of Death Eaters can't deal with them, Voldemort can just replace them with a couple of Death Eaters who can.

As the story goes on, the reader will continue to learn about why Voldemort is spending so much time dealing with Ginny. Because he doesn't brute force what he wants, nor does he ransom Ginny out to lure Harry into danger. He seems quite sedentary with his dealings, and it's because he wants to have the feeling of power and fun with completely deconstructing Ginny. He knows that Ginny isn't important herself, but as Harry feared, begins to realize that is quiet important to those who are - even if he cannot understand what that means.

Meanwhile, the Death Eaters are wondering what Voldemort is up to, because although they are getting occasional instructions, they aren't seeing him anymore. But that's okay, it's all smooth sailing at the moment.

--------------

After the climax of Ginny's complete breakdown takes place, the story flashes back to show the important events to led up to the current situation.

Showing extreme pride in their sister for /not/ becoming a Prefect, Fred and George gift her a large supply of Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes goods. She lets these devices wait until the proper moment.

The proper moment is during the months of September, October, November and December 1997, during the Deathly Hallows - Ginny begins to prepare her plan - which involves using her brother's products rather creatively. During this period, she sets the trap. Unfortunately, as the reader and Voldemort knows, it's not going to spring because her plan ran out of luck as soon as she ran into the Dark Lord.

Now since this is alternative universe, Ginny has used a Love Potion in this universe, and Voldemort learns about this, so it makes Ginny quite useless, in his eyes, for luring Harry to save her. Ginny is completely broken and useless, to both Voldemort and her family and friends. She can be cast aside.

--------------

Tom Riddle cannot be more mistaken, and this is real climax of the story. Ginny's entire plan has gone off flawlessly. She has been using the Chamber of Secrets to enact a dual plan. On the one hand, she's used the pipes that the Basilisk used to place her WWW devices all through the school. Since she's still at Hogwarts, she can use her magic all she wishes - and Tom Riddle's visit to Hogwarts was not only not a surprise to Ginny, but something she had orchestrated herself. The little tidbits of information that the above age students that followed Voldemort and brought back news about Ginny and Harry were fed that information by Ginny to bring it back to Voldemort, and Ginny wanted Voldemort to come after her the whole time. With a clever mix of WWW devices and spellwork, she has imprisoned Voldemort in the Chamber of Secrets whilst pretending that Voldemort has her imprisoned.

--------------

To go off on a tangent, I am aware that the likelihood of Canon Ginny being able to trick Voldemort so completely seems far fetched, and that I have powered Ginny up somewhat, but I think that a story where the Chamber of Secrets is used as a tool against pure-blood supremacy and where Ginny and Voldemort meet again is an interesting angle to use. I am also writing under the assumption that Ginny suspects something about Horcruxes. She doesn't know what they are, and she doesn't know about soul pieces and such, but she has run into a diary who, for all intents and purposes, was Voldemort, so she thinks to herself - if he's done it with one diary, why can't he do it with two? She's aware of Legilimency and Occulmency - while she isn't nearly proficient with either one, she is, in my opinion, in canon, shown to be a quite proficient liar. She misdirects rather than mentally overpowers Voldemort - with the help of WWW's Patented Daydream Charms.

Now since she suspects that Voldemort should not be killed outright, because she thinks that if she kills his body, he'll simply become the mist and ghost he was after he attempt to kill Harry on that Halloween night, and the advantage she holds over him will be gone. But Voldemort is far too dangerous to be simply be allowed to live on unharmed. So Ginny attempts - and succeeds - to destroy Voldemort both physically and mentally. Voldemort is no longer a threat, using the both the D.A. and her prearranged trap, she drives the Carrows out of Hogwarts and for good measure, goes to rescue Luna from Malfoy Manor and happens to run into Harry, Ron and Hermione.

--------------

As you can probably guess, I really love Ginny. Unfortunately, this complete and total victory of hers dooms the love of her life, Harry, because, as they learn, Dumbledore says that Voldemort must be the one to kill Harry - but Voldemort is absolutely and completely useless. The story could end in abject tragedy, where Ginny's most brilliant accomplishment leads to the event that is the worst thing that can happen to her.

The other way the story could end is with a sequel hook, where Ginny and Harry team up to try and remove the Horcrux from Harry whilst being their awesome selves.

** 1.) Voldemort and Bellatrix had a child who was born shortly before the final battle. Nobody in the wizarding world wants anything to do with the child, but Harry, being familiar with Riddle's orphanage background feels driven to take the child in and hopefully break the chain of dark wizards. Fun times exploring Harry's conflicting emotions over adopting the child of his nemesis, his friends' reactions to him doing so, and eventually the feelings of the child, perhaps fearing that they too might turn evil due to their heritage.

2.) After years of political interference and the destruction of the school, it is decided by the faculty that that the educational curriculum at Hogwarts needs an overhaul. Lacking any specialists in the field, McGonagall calls in Hermione to re-build the muggle studies course.

3.) Wanting the houses to be more united in the future, McGonagall postpones the sorting until third year for all new students after the final battle.

** I've got two ideas, of which I can share the general gist of.

--------------

The first one interweaves elements from the Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire:

When Harry, Ron and Hermione learn about the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, the school is evacuated, and everyone is safe, including Ginny, who isn't taken into the Chamber.

With the school closed temporarily, there is division between the Board of Governors, the Ministry and Albus Dumbledore and the Hogwarts Professors as how best to deal with this. Lucius Malfoy is determined to get political mileage out of the situation, and the ministry wishes to reopen Hogwarts as soon as possible, despite the fact that Dumbledore suspects that simply getting roosters to crow through the corridors isn't enough to kill the Basilisk, as none of them know where the Chamber of Secrets is, and the Basilisk's lair could be protected from crowing.

Meanwhile, Harry and at some times, Hermione, is at the Burrow for the last few weeks of the school year. Harry and Ginny begin to form a closer friendship, and near the end of the book, Harry must reluctantly return to the Dursleys.

However, just as Harry returns to the Weasleys a couple of weeks later, Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban, but to the children, he doesn't seem to be much of a direct threat, and as September 1, 1993 approaches, everything seems tranquil...

--------------

Book 2 begins where Book 1 leaves off - merely a few hours after Harry goes to bed on August 31st, he awakens, thinking there's something afoot. He, of course, is proved right, as Ginny had snuck out to nick a ride on a broomstick. Unfortunately for young Ginevra, she just happens to run into Sirius Black, with tragic consequences.

Book 2 mainly deals with Harry and the Weasley's grief with Ginny's murder at the hands of Sirius, who perished in his own violence. This heartbreaking event fractures the Weasley family, with some of the opinion that Ginny's death can be attributed to the fact that Harry was with them, and Ginny was a victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time - an opinion that Harry has a hard time not sharing.

As this is happening, Dumbledore desperately tries to find out what Voldemort is up to. The Chamber remains closed, but Dumbledore knows that Voldemort is still out there, and as mounting pressure from the Board of Governors and the ministry to reopen the school continues. (I'm not exactly sure how Dumbledore returns. Perhaps he has the support of the Professors, who are unwilling to work unless Dumbledore returns as Headmaster. Gilderoy Lockhart leaves of his own volition, citing adventure calling to him.)

So Dumbledore brings in a DADA expert against Dark Creatures - Remus Lupin.

With Sirius dead, and Tom Riddle undiscovered, poor Hagrid remains in Azkaban - and he is witness to a mass breakout of Death Eaters. The second half of the book deals with Dumbledore trying to convince the ministry that a mass breakout of Death Eaters is not only dangerous, but far more dangerous than it implies alone. But, as usual, the ministry dillies and dallies and dithers.

But Albus Dumbledore is not without his allies. The survivors of the old Order of the Phoenix respond to his call to arms, joining up with new recruits. The retired and veteran Auror, Alastor Moody, begins to teach an additional elective class on defence and duelling.

If there can be a light in the darkness of Ginny's death, it comes in the form of Harry's new friendships. Feeling guilty about her death, he starts to drift away from the Weasleys - and begins to form new friendships all over Hogwarts - but as the year draws to a close, the grief and despair the Weasleys feel just gets stronger and stronger.

In the last weeks of school, everything comes to a head. Dumbledore is proved horrifically right as the Death Eaters return to action with a vengeance, launching simultaneous attacks on Hogwarts and the Ministry.

--------------

This is where I've gotten up to. After this, I'm not sure what happens. But here are some plot points.

- Ginny Weasley is actually Peter Pettigrew. Tom Riddle discovers him and enlists him into his service. Between Tom's control and Pettigrew's experience, he has the knowledge to pull this off.

- The real Ginny is taken into the Chamber of Secrets, and kept alive so Pettigrew can continue to be disguised.

- Voldemort hears about the Chamber being opened, and suspects that somehow, one of this Horcruxes is involved. He believes the Diary is the one.

- With Pettigrew's help, Voldemort and Tom Riddle begin to plan. With Voldemort getting stronger, and Riddle working from the inside, both Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter are targeted.

- As Voldemort gets stronger, the Dark Mark on the arms of his Death Eaters begins to get clearer. Bellatrix hails the return of her master - which leads Sirius Black to escape from Azkaban.

- I'm not sure what role Dobby will play.

- When Sirius arrives at the Burrow, he realizes who Ginny really is, but Pettigrew kills him before he can react. Pettigrew then fakes Ginny's death.

- Just as Voldemort and Riddle launch their attack on Hogwarts and the Ministry, Ginny, who had been kept in the Chamber of Secrets, gathers enough strength to revolt against Riddle's control.

- Riddle and Voldemort sneak Dementors into the Chamber of Secrets for the lols.
