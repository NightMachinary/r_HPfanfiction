In almost every single Harry x Daphne story, one of two things happen. Either, a) Harry becomes a super conservative Lord whatever and has Daphne tutor him as he comes into his inheritance and has a decent amount of Weasley bashing, or b) Daphne's totally a white sheep (a la Sirius) and needs Harry to help get her family away from Voldemort.

I would love to see a relationship similar to linkffn(11185533) where Daphne still is a rather conservative person after growing up in a pureblood-first household and Harry has similar political views to canon (which were shaped by his Muggle upbringing and friendships) and yet somehow they make a relationship work. A relationship that has its issues and its fights, but still works out in the end. I've read a lot of Harry x Daphne and I've rarely read anything like this.

** linkffn(9774121) its a verry very slow burn story\\
its a marriage contract story but harry and daphne are married for like a year before they become friends and then a couple. Daphne is also pretty unlikable at first but parts of her personality are explained later in the story. They both also enter the contract willingly, because they both gain something out of it.

  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year

** Duality is probably my favourite Harry/Daphne along with Unatoned. The author portrays slytherins very accurately i think ( manipulative, ambitious , duplicitous ) where its always a game within game and half truths.
