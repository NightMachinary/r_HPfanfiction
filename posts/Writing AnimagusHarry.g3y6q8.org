What do you think Harry's animagus form would be (magical or non-magical)? What are some of the common pitfalls of writing Harry as an animagus, and how would you avoid them?


** He should be a cockroach. But seriously.

All known animagus, except Minerva's, reflect the wizard somehow. Sirius is a dog, man's best friend. Stags are known as the king of the forest, James walk around like he''s royalty. He's arrogant but takes care of those under his wing. Peter is, well, a rat.

Harry's animagus form should reflect his character, whatever that may be in the fic you're writing. Canon Harry's whole thing is his desire to be normal, while fighting to do what's right. He isn't flashy enough for something like a phoenix animagus. If his greatest desire is getting freedom give him a bird form. If his greatest desire is protecting friends give him a wolf form.

I would love it were Harry to go through the whole process just to find out that his form is unusable for once.

** i always assume it'd be a black cat. that weird mix of apathetic and focused.

i suppose the biggest failing i see in fics is when the animagus form becomes more important than his human form. it'd be like reading the eragon books and half way through the second one she realises she can magically transform into a human. why bother being a dragon at all. might as well just write a creature inheritance story instead.

** Just give him a dragon! I always see people point at dragon as a bad trope for Harry's animagus, but I've also never seen a fic where he actually IS a dragon for his animagus, which isn't to say I've not seen fics where he isn't a dragon, just not as an animagus.

*** Agreed, mostly. Go big or go home.

I can see Harry be terribly embarrassed by the whole thing. It has limited practicality. His weakness is small spaces. Maybe he's upset because after flying as a dragon, brooms are just... meh.

On the other hand, he can always fall back on Plan D: turn into a dragon and kill everyone.

*** Harry Potter, Unexpected Animagus by DWDuck has Harry as a Dragon Animagus. Many of the others have forms as well. Luna is a VCR (Very Carnivorous Rabbit aka a Vabbit (think Monty Python)), Neville is a Ent, Hermione is a Kneasle, and Fred and George are Tibetan Monkeys. It's considered a WIP that's about 61K words I was going to say it's abandoned but the author just updated it this past march (last update was in 2016). I think it's a fun read.

  With the love of a good woman, Harry becomes more confident and learns to handle the embarrassment that comes from being a teenage boy as well as an unexpected animagus.  Set during the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Severe Ron bashing ahead.  Rated M for crude language, even cruder humour, and sexual situations

** I think it'd be interesting to see Harry's animagus form be a niffler. Yeah, it's kind of outside of the “norm” of Harry's animagus forms, but I think it would make for an interesting story wherein Harry causes his enemies to suffer by stealing their money/dark artifacts.

** I've always quite liked Harry having some type of snake as his form due to his parseltongue

*** That is a pretty cool idea, but the trouble is, the parseltongue comes from Voldemort and the soul piece in Harry, so it wouldn't make much sense, especially if Voldemort is then killed and the horcruxes destroyed. But if a Slytherin!Harry fic or one where he was descended from Salazar made this a thing, I would love it, especially being a Slytherin myself.

**** Not if you do it like it came from his black ancestry or something like that. There is never any proof the parseltongue came from Voldie. If you take cursed child as canon then it didnt come from him as Harry still has it

***** Ah, my bad, forgot about the pure blood ancestry for a second. Tbh it's more likely that the Black family had latent Parselmouths, considering the fact that the Cursed Child is worse fanfiction than most out there.

** A stag, like his patronus and dad.

I think many writers succumb to the temptation to make his animagus form some awesome overpowered thing, but in canon, even awesome people had ordinary animagus forms like a cat and dog.

** Animagi aren't magical creatures. It always bugs me when Harry becomes a shadow wolf or a phoenix or whatever. I do like animagus fics, but I think they should be pretty standard animals that allows him to hide, not stand out. And no, his animagus isn't black just bacause his hair is. I sincerely doubt James' stag was black. Sirius' dog is a different matter, because for some breeds black is a natural colour.

** While I don't have a preference to what animal, there are some tropes to avoid when writing an animagus fic. Some common forms that people give Harry are a Panther or Shadow panther, lion, wolf, pretty sure I have seen a Phoenix a few times, but I'm not saying that these are bad, just make sure to do it right. An animagus usually encompasses the character of the person, so using a form that represents certain characteristics would be good. A wolf is decent because all Harry wants is a family and wolves hunt in packs that are close enough to a family in the animal kingdom. A panther is cool, but represents power, strength and ferocity, none of which Harry is seen to be in canon. Lion is obvious because Gryffindor and Phoenixes are shown to be magical creatures and magical animagus forms are quite rare and special.

Some common mistakes are the process involved with becoming an animagus. A canon method does exist if you search around on Wizarding World but it is complicated, almost too much for some people so it is understandable to make it shorter and slightly easier. If you are making other people animagi, such as say Hermione, take the relationship Harry has with the character into account. For example, if in a Harmony fic, one could make Harry a lion and Hermione a lioness, which just so you know, is another heavily used trope in fanfiction.

Hope all of this helps, good luck
