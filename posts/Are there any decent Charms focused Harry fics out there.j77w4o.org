I've read fics about Harry being a Transfiguration genius, or a Potions Master, but are there any decent fics out there where Harry takes after Lily and gets really good at Charms? Or even just Flitwick being his mentor type fics?

Thank you muchly~


** In "Harry the Hufflepuff" lazy Harry dives into charms when he finds out there's a charm for everything: tie his shoes, make his bed, brush his teeth, do the dishes etc.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** yes. There definitely is one where he finds his mom's diaries. I think he might also become Flitwick'd apprentice? Or those might be two seperate fics. I'm sorry I'm in no state to go looking but I've definitely read one or more fics with this premise

** This recommendation comes with some major caveats, but linkffn(Black Luminary) definitely fits. That said, it's a little anime-y at times, /very/ purple all of the time, and hasn't been updated in over a year.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?
