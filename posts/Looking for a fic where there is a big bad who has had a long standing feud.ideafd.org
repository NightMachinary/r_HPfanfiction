:END:
I might be confusing details of different fics but there is a big bad who is semi immortal (maybe) or just the son of someone in a long line of enemy wizards.

I believe Flamel features heavily in this. The big Bad wants the philosophers stone maybe? Possibly Flamel made another because Harry had to use it on Hermione? Regardless when the big bad dies suddenly magic dies or becomes harder too
