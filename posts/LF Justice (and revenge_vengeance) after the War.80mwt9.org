Hey guys,

got another request:

Give me any fanfictions (note: No slash, please! Gen/Het is fine...even H/G, despite the fact that the pairing isn't my favourite!) that show the rebuilding of society after the war, especially if they deal with justice ("All deatheaters get the veil!" - just an example of course!) or vengeance/revenge (especially if justice is not happening because the purebloods stall it at every turn and bribe people etc. etc.)!

It's IMHO what was lacking in canon (would have prefered this over the crapilogue, especially since we don't know if justice did prevail or if anybody was given amnesty, even the people who toppled government and are therefore traitors (and should be killed IMHO)! Purebloods returning to be the wealthy elite would be kind of unfair, especially since their bigotry etc. lead to Voldemort's rise!

Bonus points: Backlash from the muggleborn and half-bloods (hell, maybe even a muggleborn or half-blood dark lord?)

So, signing off again - stage is yours and thanks for your recs :)


** This has been recommended a lot but on the off-chance that someone hasn't seen it: linkao3(6334630) aka The Sum of Their Parts.

Gen, rated M for violence and dark themes. Harry gets pissed off with how the society after the war hasn't really changed all that much and that some people got off easily and becomes a Dark Lord to change it (the logic being that the only people who ever get anything done are Dark Lords).

Not quite what you're looking for but some people definitely get what's been coming to them.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Its a major theme of my AU story "Divided and Entwined". Rebuilding a country ravaged by a civil war isn't easy when radicalised people want to continue the war/take revenge, people want to reform the country/preserve the status quo, and foreign powers start to meddle. And who gets to try the captured combatants? What laws apply? How do you deal with people you consider criminals if they won the war for you? What do you do if people want to go vigilante to hunt down remaining enemies?

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

**** Also you could look at his other work Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution. In which Harry and Hermione preside over a French Revolution style tale over and shove nearly every Death Eater through the Veil of Death. After a fair trial (complete with truth serum) of course.

***** I've read that :) - I liked both, even if Hermione is too in the limelight (Sorry, but for me Harry is the focal point of HP and taking that from him isn't my cup of tea, especially if you more or less make him sit this one out! (Note: Sent you a review about this problem!) Especially if you start an "us versus them" thing (Harry is a half-blood, so he'll be fine and not care that muggleborns are basically treated like Jews - I call bullshit! Harry has a problem standing up for himself, but not for others and his best friend (No, that's not Ron!) is muggleborn and his mother is/was one, too so nope: Harry would not sit that one out and let Dumbledore basically do nothing for a year! He would accept that if he's the one harmed, because Harry basically has no concept of being treated right and what's wrong, so he often accepts stuff that would have most of us up in arms! However Harry would never accept this if it puts his friends in harm's way!)

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

It did not. After all, Draco was free after using Unforgivables on civilians, breaking the Geneva convention, several counts of attempted murder, terrorism and a few minor offences. At most he got 7 years (in order for him to have an 11-year-old son), which is awfully little for his deeds. Yes, he was just a teenager, but considering that you can get 5 years for pirating a movie, 7 for that list is just too little.

*** Actually seven years is in line with sentences handed down to Nazis and Nazi collaborators in the few years after WW2. Even amongst the big names tried at Nuremberg the sentences were as low as just 10 years, and plenty of lesser functionaries tried elsewhere got far lower sentences.

Harsh "victor's justice" is no way to rehabilitate a large proportion of a society - remember what happened as a result of the Versailles settlement?

And the Geneva Conventions don't apply because Magical Britain isn't a signatory to them. That would be a contravention of the Statute Of Secrecy. The Conventions are in any case a hell of a mess when it comes to civil wars fought by irregular forces.

**** The Versailles treaty was so bad because when it was signed, Germany still controlled far more territory than we did before the outbreak of the war. The general population did not feel like they lost the war, hence the feeling Versailles was unjustified. Whereas Voldemort's defeat was absolute, much like Germany post WWII.

*** I agree...but I didn't want to hammer the point home because so many in the fandom (who like Draco - most likely because of the actor who played him) disagree and say that "he was coerced" (that's a mitigating factor, but it doesn't make him not guilty! It might reduce the sentence, but that's it!)
