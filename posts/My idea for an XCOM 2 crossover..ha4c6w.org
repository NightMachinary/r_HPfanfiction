I have an idea for one where the Commander is one of the main characters. The Order and the Death Eaters were once apart of XCOM during the invasion, and are reabsorbed during the story. The aliens have been redesigned to counter pretty much anything the Wizards or muggles throw at them, atleast during the invasion. The aliens just before the invasion erecetd a field around Earth that makes any spell cause the user to die immedietely. XCOM works on several counters to it, however it only works a limited number of times.

Why hasn't anything like this been written before? Also, what do you guys think?
