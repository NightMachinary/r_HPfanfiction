:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Seeing as last time I asked I did find what I wanted (thanks for that btw), can anyone find this fic where Daniel is somehow a wizard (no one knows how in universe either) and he gets mistaken for Harry Potter. Eventually he goes to hogwarts to meet with Dumbledore, this takes place after Order of the Phoenix I think.

  An attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is just a story. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP. Harry still has magic.
