This is a transcription of some notes I took while re-reading Prisoner of Azkaban a few months backs. It's for Chapters 1 to 3, and I thought I'd share. The is from a paperback, 2011 printing. It's a little long.

Chapter 1:

- Note: 12 year old Harry wanted to do his homework, thus did it in secret at night. pg 1, line 3.
- In History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot academics use the phrase "non-magic" in reference to muggles.
- The Dursley's locked away harry's spellbooks, wand, cauldron, broomstick, and he was not allowed to speak to neighbors
- Harry can pick locks non-magically.
- Harry got in trouble because Ron called and he didn't know how to use a telephone. What if Hermione had called instead? Also, where did the Weasley's get a working landline phone in 1993?
- Harry spent five weeks without seeing any friends.
- Harry is noted to be small and skinny for his age. At just shy of 13, 50th percentile is about five feet tall and about 100 pounds, but still appears to be 12. Therefore, 12 year old canon Harry could be 4'10 or 4'11 and 90 lbs.
- Harry is aware that he is very lucky to reach 13. He got his first ever birthday card at 13. His birthday gifts were a Pocket Sneakoscope (Ron), a Broom Servicing Kit (Hermione), and, of course, the Monster Book of Monsters.
- Hermione went to France and learned about the local witchcraft history. Where did she go? What did she learn? Hermione obviously has a passion for learning, and isn't just interested in school.

Chapter 2:

- Marge, who is the worst Dursley, kept Harry up in a tree past midnight.
- Petunia likely doesn't care for Marge, considering she hates animals.
- Marge insulted Lily, and Harry had to deal with accidental magic. Among the insults that she hurled during her visit : Called harry "mean, runty", implied he should have been put down like a dog, called him "weak, underbred". Said Lily had "bad blood" and insulted Petunia. Called Lilly "a bad egg", James "a wastrel", and Harry the result. "No account, good for nothing, lazy scrounger". Insults their supposed deaths, and calls Harry a liar.
- Harry runs away, is not kicked out.

Chapter 3:

- Makes it to Magnolia Crescent and genuinely believes he will be expelled.
- Something, likely Sirius, watching him when the Knight Bus Arrives, which he did in fact, call accidentally. He uses Neville's name.
- Buses, steam trains, and cars work around. Phones as well. What's the tech cutoff for magical interference?
- The IFW criticized Fudge for alerting the the muggle PM. Is Britain more liberal about Muggle/Wizard relations? What are the member nations of the IFW?
- Sirius' escape from appears to save him from expulsion, and allows him to spend two weeks in Diagon Alley.

Some prelim notes on Chapter 4:

- Harry enjoys people watching.
- Warlocks and Dwarves are implied to be separate groups from both wizards and and goblins. Explore?
- Some older gentleman were arguing about Transfiguration. What about?

Anyway, I hope this is useful for those of you who like For Want of a Nail/Minor Divergence leads to Big Change/Specific hopping off points for canon.

Don't the Weasleys live near a muggle village? And as this was the early 90s, telephone boxes could still have been a thing.

** Something I noticed about Chapter 19, way later in the book...there's not actually much proving Peter guilty in his first appearance; it's mainly Sirius and Lupin throwing accusations at him and poo-pooing his defense.

Even when Peter breaks and admits to being the Secret Keeper, he claims he was forced to betray them by Voldemort.

That, and when you take into account that he lived with the Weasleys for 13 years and in Harry's company for just under three of those, without so much as laying a hand on any of them, and that in that Shrieking Shack scene Sirius and Lupin are literally planning an act of premeditated murder against one of their oldest (ex-)friends...

Well, I can imagine a changed scene where Harry decides he believes Peter's allegations that he was only escaping from Sirius and was never the Secret Keeper.

I'd also note that while the concept of the Imperius Curse and the notion that the death of the Secret Keeper makes everyone they told Secret Keepers hadn't yet been introduced, Ron comments way back in Philosopher's Stone that the Malfoys claimed they had been bewitched by Voldemort, so that's a reason for Harry to potentially believe that Peter was actually bewitched.

** I love it, this kind of in-depth examination of the text is my kind of thing. Reading it after the fact that is, not actually doing the examination.

A few less than brief notes on your notes:

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 1: Note: 12 year old Harry wanted to do his homework, thus did it in secret at night. pg 1, line 3. In History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot academics use the phrase "non-magic" in reference to muggles.
#+end_quote

It's interesting that Harry is interested in homework here, but is often shown to be less interested at school. Because this is his only interaction with the magical world while at the Dursley home, it does make sense that he'd become very interested. In his situation, I would probably have read all the textbooks cover to cover.

#+begin_quote
  The Dursley's locked away harry's spellbooks, wand, cauldron, broomstick, and he was not allowed to speak to neighbors
#+end_quote

Vernon made up that lie about St. Brutus's school for criminals to tell Marge, is it likely that he would have spread it around the neighborhood to explain why Harry isn't around during the year? It is exactly the sort of thing Vernon would do, if he ever talked about Harry to his neighbors, but I doubt he ever talks about Harry if he can help it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry can pick locks non-magically.
#+end_quote

Fanon suggests Fred and George taught him how to do this, but I don't remember it ever being mentioned in the text. It's easier to believe that this is a skill Harry developed pre-Hogwarts, given Vernon's tendency to lock him in the cupboard for prolonged periods.

#+begin_quote
  Harry got in trouble because Ron called and he didn't know how to use a telephone. What if Hermione had called instead? Also, where did the Weasley's get a working landline phone in 1993?
#+end_quote

You forget that it's 1993, and therefor payphones still exist (if they ever existed in small villages in the English countryside, which I admit not being sure of). It's also possible he used a phone in some other public place. Harry thinks in the text that Hermione would have been able to do a better job than Ron, but how would she have managed to talk her way past Vernon to get Harry on the phone? It's not like Vernon is going to go "Well, one of the boy's friends is calling, I'll just let him chat for a while".

#+begin_quote
  Harry spent five weeks without seeing any friends.
#+end_quote

Longer, I believe. He spent three weeks at Diagon Alley, meaning that he went the entire summer until that point not seeing his friends.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is noted to be small and skinny for his age. At just shy of 13, 50th percentile is about five feet tall and about 100 pounds, but still appears to be 12. Therefore, 12 year old canon Harry could be 4'10 or 4'11 and 90 lbs.
#+end_quote

Fanon tells us that Harry's small size is the result of being regularly starved and abused. Canon tells us that he was never exactly starved, but wasn't allowed to eat as much as he would like. The glimpses of school-age James and Lily in the text don't make mention of their heights or weights, leaving us not knowing if Harry comes by his small stature honestly or if it is a result of his upbringing.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is aware that he is very lucky to reach 13. He got his first ever birthday card at 13. His birthday gifts were a Pocket Sneakoscope (Ron), a Broom Servicing Kit (Hermione), and, of course, the Monster Book of Monsters.
#+end_quote

Having survived multiple murder attempts and various death traps, I dare say. Regarindg presents, Hermione was catering to his major recreational activity (flying/Quidditch). Ron got a cool magical doohickey he knew Harry would get a kick out of and was within his limited budget. Hagrid got him a textbook he knew he would need, which might have been a clue as to his new teaching position. He probably thought Harry would enjoy reading it, but didn't know that nobody but him knew how to open the book.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione went to France and learned about the local witchcraft history. Where did she go? What did she learn? Hermione obviously has a passion for learning, and isn't just interested in school.
#+end_quote

It's been a long time since I read about medieval witchcraft, but a few bits stick out. France was one of the only places in Europe where witchcraft was an actual crime tried in actual courts, as opposed to being a religious thing, and those cases were fairly well documented at least as far back as the 13th century. Beheading was the most common capital punishment, but banishment and other non-execution punishments were used more often. Then 15th century, inquisition, witches, stakes, fire, yadda yadda.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 2: Marge, who is the worst Dursley, kept Harry up in a tree past midnight.
#+end_quote

Up in a tree being menaced by a vicious dog. Marge Dursley is probably the only person in this series without a single redeeming quality. Even Voldemort and Umbridge can at least have something nice said about them, kinda. I don't believe the text ever specifies what kind of dogs Marge raises, or Ripper's breed in particular, but I always imagined him as a English bulldog. I suppose people reading in modern context would think he's a pit bull of some variety or another.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia likely doesn't care for Marge, considering she hates animals.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say that Petunia hates animals, but she definitely hates anything that messes up her nice clean home, and Ripper definitely qualifies.

#+begin_quote
  Marge insulted Lily, and Harry had to deal with accidental magic. Among the insults that she hurled during her visit : Called harry "mean, runty", implied he should have been put down like a dog, called him "weak, underbred". Said Lily had "bad blood" and insulted Petunia. Called Lilly "a bad egg", James "a wastrel", and Harry the result. "No account, good for nothing, lazy scrounger". Insults their supposed deaths, and calls Harry a liar.
#+end_quote

I don;t think anybody would ever dream of condemning Harry for this one. Marge got what she had coming to her. Admittedly, Marge is going off what Vernon tells her about Harry's parents, but feels free to negatively embellish about these people she's never met who died years ago, badmouthing them in front of their son.

#+begin_quote
  Harry runs away, is not kicked out.
#+end_quote

Important to note, as being allowed house room is what maintains the protective magic. Fanon makes a great fuss over somebody having to say specific words to break this magic (Harry saying that the house isn't his home or Vernon/Petunia saying that he isn't welcome), but even when Vernon does try to kick him out in OotP, the spell doesn't fail as far as the reader is aware of, and when Dumbledore's howler arrives and Petunia convinces Vernon that Harry has to stay, nothing changes.

I'd say Hogwarts helped him quite a lot in that regard. Fandom usually forgets that Harry was only described as small in the first couple of books; when Harry was 15 he was within an inch of his father at the same age, and when he was 17 he had already caught up to him (and James was described as /tall/).

I have to admit that it bothers me quite a bit when people describe adult Harry as Daniel Radcliffe instead of, well, Harry.

  Chapter 3: Makes it to Magnolia Crescent and genuinely believes he will be expelled.
#+end_quote

Harry has good reason to believe this, given the events of the previous summer. Being 13, his planning, such as it is, for his immediate future is kinda terrible. And if he was going to be expelled, getting off the bus face to face with Fudge would have been the worst possible scenario for him.

#+begin_quote
  Something, likely Sirius, watching him when the Knight Bus Arrives, which he did in fact, call accidentally. He uses Neville's name.
#+end_quote

I think the text later states that the shadowy dog he saw was indeed Sirius watching him. Which raises the question of how Sirius knows where Harry lives, but presumably Hagrid told him where he was taking Harry when they met at the Potter home way back.

#+begin_quote
  Buses, steam trains, and cars work around. Phones as well. What's the tech cutoff for magical interference?
#+end_quote

It's made very clear that magic in and of itself does not cause technology to fail. Hermione says in one book that technology doesn't work in heavily magical areas, but this is never elaborated on. I always assumed that all technology used by wizards, from radios to trains to buses, is magical in nature, but this is by no means canon.

#+begin_quote
  The IFW criticized Fudge for alerting the the muggle PM. Is Britain more liberal about Muggle/Wizard relations? What are the member nations of the IFW?
#+end_quote

The ICW (International Confederation of Wizards) changed its name to IFW (International Federation of Wizards) for this book, and then back in the next with very little fanfare. I thought you had made a typo until I went back and doublechecked. It's the ICW in PS and GoF, but IFW here. I'm going to continue assuming their the same organization and that Rowling screwed up. An organization we know next to nothing about from the text, although it's been elaborated on in other sources. I think the issue here is less that Britain is liberal about Muggle/Wizard relations (HBP shows us how far that goes), and more that the ICW probably thinks Fudge is blowing things out of proportion. Sirius is a single mass-murderer, with no wand, no support network, and more than half crazy.

I think it's interesting to note that Sirius Black is considered one of the worst criminals in Azkaban because of his presumed act of mass murder, killing 13 people with a single curse. The deadly potential of most spells is never raised in canon (and lets not bring up fanfics trying to say that there's no such thing as dark magic because you can kill somebody with Wingradium Leviosa), so we have no measuring stick here. Is Sirius dangerous because he could kill 13 people with one spell, and that's difficult to do? Or is it because you'd have to be a murderous psycho to try and do it? Are there no major acts of mass murder in this world where every man, woman, and child over the age of 11, regardless of mental state or morals, is armed with a deadly weapon?

#+begin_quote
  Sirius' escape from appears to save him from expulsion, and allows him to spend two weeks in Diagon Alley.
#+end_quote

Interesting to consider here if Sirius hadn't escaped. Would Harry have been expelled for accidental magic? The ministry clearly doesn't differentiate between intentional and unintentional magic (or maybe they can, fanon suggests that Dobby somehow made his 'magical signature' match Harry's and thus triggered what we later learned is the Trace), but OotP shows that students facing expulsion are granted a trial, and Dumbledore probably could have gotten Harry off even if Fudge (or whoever runs these trials when Fudge isn't playing for political points) pushed for expulsion.

#+end_quote

In my opinion its not not the crime itself that was awful but the context. Sirius was responsible for the death of a man who he was considered by all to be a brother too. He was responsible for the death of the man's wife and Harry surviving was only a fluke. Then Sirius hunts down another very close friend and murders him in the middle of the day, not caring who was caught up in it. What does he do then, he breaks down laughing. He laughs that he just killed those closest to him. Fudge was supposedly one of the first on the scene and found him laughing amongst the destruction and corpses. That's terrifying. He fooled them all and that is worrying since in reinforced the idea that you couldn't trust anyone back then. It was also completely unexpected, it wasn't vengeance or a crime of passion he was apparently planning the deaths of his 'friends' for ages and when finally he kills them, he laughs.

Fudge later visits Azkaban and observes that the dementors didn't seem to affect Sirius that much. We know its because he was innocent but to Fudge the man felt no guilt nor remorse, no negative feelings for the dementors to drag around. A man immune to the worst creatures in the wizarding world. Then he escapes the inescapable. Nobody knows how but the man was seemingly close to a Dark Lord that terrified the nation for a decade. A man unaffected by dementors and laughs at the death of his friends.

Except, and I think a lot of people missed this bit, this isn't common knowledge. As far as the wizarding public knows, Sirius Black is in prison for murdering thirteen people, but the story that he betrayed the Potters is limited to only a few. Fudge gets his jollies telling it to Rosmerta later in this book, with the implication being that nobody knows about the Potters hiding under the Fidelius Charm or that their secret keeper betrayed their location.

#+begin_quote
  ‘You don't know the half of it, Rosmerta,' said Fudge gruffly. ‘The worst he did isn't widely known [...] Worse even than that, m'dear ...' Fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. ‘Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them [...] ‘And then, barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed --' ‘Black betrayed them?' breathed Madam Rosmerta. ‘He did indeed.'
#+end_quote

Unrelated to the above, but while fishing out that block of quotes I also found this bit I had long since forgotten about.

#+begin_quote
  But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled.
#+end_quote

Gee, funny how Fudge forgot all about that a year or so from here.
