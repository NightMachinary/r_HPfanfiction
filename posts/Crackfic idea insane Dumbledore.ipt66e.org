Albus Dumbledore defeated grindelwald the masses clamored for him to take leadership of wizarding britain. What most people didn't know what he was clinically insane so in a gambit to save britain the minister made up a bunch of official sounding titles and gave them to Dumbledore. The order of the phoenix was actually a group of carefully selected individuals placed there to keep him away from the war so he couldn't screw it up.


** Turns out that Grindelwald didn't even exist but was a figment of Dumbledore's imagination, who sometimes took over (kind of like Tyler Durden in Fight Club).
