I've been noticing a lot of sites in the past year or two have been going down. thequidditchpitch.org is gone, blacklupin.org, scarhead.net are also gone. harrypotterfanfiction.com is desperately looking for funding and favoritestracker.org is days away from closing as well. Not to mention the countless other sites that have been shut down.

I can't even describe how profoundly sad this makes me. To have all those stories lose forever is such a tragedy.

Is this the beginning of the end? In another 5 years, are the only sites that will still be around FanFiction.net and archiveofourown.org? What about 10 or 20 years from now?

I know a lot of stories were most likely posted to Ao3.org or FFN.net, but there must still be thousands that were lost. It's just like the purge on FFN.net, no real warning and all those stories just gone forever.


** It's hard to call something dying when it's still the most active community by sheer amount of stories that have been published in the last year. Also, there new movie coming out should revive the scene a bit, even it its just a resurgence of indy!Harry fics with obnoxious magical trunks.

I can understand why they wouldn't do a film, but it just sucks that only a very small percentage of fans can see the stage production.

The publishing of the script is to make it accessible for everyone, and I think it's a good indication that it will become more worldwide within time. I think it's important to remember that it's only part-written by Rowling, in collaboration with a very talented playwright, and she's said that it's been given that medium for a reason. For me, I assume that means there's lots of monologues, which will actually give us much richer content but just wouldn't work in a book or on screen. We just need to have some faith!

******* I don't mind the casting decision, seeing as it's a play, and plays have always had quite a bit of leeway in that regard. It's practically traditional.

I do take issue, however, with J.K. Rowling being all, "I never /said/ she was white!1!" because that majorly changes Hermione's character motivation and background. White!Hermione comes from a position of privilege: upper-middle class, two educated parents, of a race that has never been discriminated against in her home country in recent history. For Hermione to leave that position of privilege and suddenly become the victim of racial discrimination and slurs would come as a huge culture shock, because to Hermione, she and Draco or Ron look exactly alike. She can't see why she's being treated differently, and that adds poignancy to the whole issue of racism in HP (especially when being read by other privileged, white females) because it highlights how senseless racism really is. I feel like black!Hermione would be less surprised by sudden discrimination, although possibly confused as to why other racial minorities (like the Patils) were treated fine.

** I think what you're seeing now was a long time coming---most of the other archives just didn't have the critical mass to continue after the series ended, and the community concentrated around the sites where there was still a big audience---FF.net and AO3. Some of those older archives are going offline now, but most of them were already barren years ago. (There's no more than one non-spam post a /week/ on FictionAlley Park now, which is amazing to think about. It's an actual ghost town.)

I do find that pretty unfortunate, because different communities cultivated different ideas and tropes and styles, in the same way a site like DLP still does. (I looked through HPFF recently and I was stunned by how focused it was on basically magic-free chick-lit style romance stories, many of them next-gen. That's not my style /at all/, but it's cool to watch different groups of people cultivate different ideas about fanfiction without really coming into contact with each other.)

Having that kind of galapagos-syndrome differentiation is really interesting---it's fun to be able to say, "OK, this is an FF.Net story, and /this/ is classic Portkey." But a lot of that is probably going away, just because that's the way the whole internet is moving: Toward centralized platforms (like Reddit!) instead of walled-off forums. It's not ideal, but I'm just glad the community is still together.

(Granted, there /is/ still a little of this---I definitely get the impression there's a difference between an "AO3 story" and an "FF.net story.")

** Well, if you apply economics to this, it's simply that there's an oversupply of sites that cater specifically to one niche or the other. As supply of new material to those sites go down, traffic falls alongside it and, short of re-inventing itself to include a broader range of fics, there comes the day when traffic numbers fall so low that the site admins either don't see the point of keeping the site going or start losing money keeping it open.

The reason why is pretty simple-Harry Potter is one of /the/ dominant fictional series of any medium to come out of the first decade of the 21st century. It has readership numbers only rarely shared by anything other than religious books central to a religion's faiths.

Back when it came out, it was pretty much unique in that it:

- played a lot of folklore stereotypes straight rather than try and twist it ala vampire novels (Rice & Meyer are typical of the genre, unfortunately) & got away with it.

-Was a young adult novel that actually held mass appeal due to its implied complexity.

-Actually was very mature in how it treated its readership, giving enough to entice without being straight up patronising (this is hard to do, by the way-if I could put this into words, it would make a horrible pun).

-Had a writer that took the books seriously.

-Had an element of 'the real world's around the corner' to it that adds a sense of wonder to it.

But even back then, competition for who got the top spot was fierce and may still be in contention today when one considers that Pratchett's /Discworld/ series is literally /30 books long/ and features a massive open world to use as a sandbox-though good luck beating out Terry Pratchett in terms of quality. So long-run-wise, the jury's still out.

Now consider what has come out since Rowling finished the series and bowed out to recover from a literal decade's worth of binge writing. The /Deathly Hallows/ came out nine years ago. The new kids on the block are all competing for most influential work in the 2010-2020 area now. This... is a bloodbath lineup, more akin to trench warfare than the battle royale of the noughties brigade. For one thing, sci-fi books are making a /big/ comeback. It may not sound like much, but the last comeback included names like Vernor Vinge and Iain M. Banks to name but two. This one includes names like John Scalzi, Cory Doctorow and literally thousands of others.

Fun fact? Whilst amazingly popular, a lot of the decimalite contenders aren't even published. Some of the best content out there comes in the form of experimental blogs, fanfiction that got so out-of-setting it ended up its own story (on the negative side, fifty shades of shit anyone?), fricking CYOA quests (seriously, check it out), write-ups of RPG sessions (I heartily recommend looking up the Henderson campaign and the All Guardsmen Party, a write-up of a Dark Heresy campaign that seems haunted by Pterry's ghost, murphy and the crazy kind of 'what does this button do?'-style decision making).

And fanfiction is one of the areas where this contention shows heavily.

Based purely on quality fics spawned in the last twenty-four months, one of the strong contenders is /Worm/, which plays the consequences of the existence of people with superpowers absolutely straight-and does it better than any of the Big Comic Publishers ever could (looking at you X-Men). In a lot of ways, it's the spiritual successor to the graphic novel Watchmen and tries very hard not to pull any punches. During and after its two-year-long publication, /Worm/ spawned fanfics on Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity. Since early 2014, /hundreds/ of fics have been published there, each one either a jewel or rapidly heckled into being presentable at the least. Wildbow can be considered to be a strong contender for making the top 10 in the 2010-2020 fictional bracket purely because of the number of people his writing has and will inspire.

Now to the consequences.

Harry Potter's main storyline's publishing cycle's end is coming up to its ten-year anniversary in 2017 (hello epilogue), which makes what happens here kind of important. First, the run of fanfics is slowing down as more and more quality authors venture into new and interesting universes. This is a good thing as it will prompt an explosion in terms of creative interpretations of 'what could be' as well as 'what had been'. A lot of readers started their migration long ago anyway, so it makes sense that the writers will leave for new adventures too.

Remember that this has happened a lot over the years, but on a smaller scale-buffy, Evangelion, Sailor Moon, a lot of tv series (remember /heroes/?)-they all ended up exhibiting the same pattern-low number of fics during main story's publishing cycle, explosion of fics after story's end, gradual trickle-out of readers and writers. The smaller sites that cater to niches in the fandom are the first to die, which prompts the larger fan-specific sites to follow its readers/writers and go elsewhere, which lets them survive as a more generalistic fansite.

That doesn't mean that hp fanfiction will die out. If anything, the creativity and versatility an HP wizard brings to the table means that it will remain a crossover staple for decades to come.

Unless Rowling writes an HP continuation book series, which only David Eddings really had the balls to do. Then, all bets as to what shape the HP fanfic beast will take are off.

** Once FFN became what it is other fan bases sites sorta fell by the wayside.

Ranma used to have a wonderful aggregate that complied all the different fictions it could find. Then about 05-06 it stopped. FFN Basically did the same thing as most authors migrated over to it.

With the last book being in the rear view for a bit now there's a new generation discovering the books like (and I can't believe I'm saying this) their parents did.

And if they move into reading FF they're gonna find FFN first.

700k+ fics to read? PreHBP or PreOotP or PreDH? They wrote fiction before the series concluded? What is this wizardry?

Sure some will try and find other places but really why would they? We know why they should but will they?

*** I actually think that now that we have a new generation getting into the HP fandom, in a few years we may actually see a revival of all the character/ship/trope specific archives. Remember that back in the early days of HP, there were only a few big sites. FF.net was the go-to place (just like now), there wasn't really anything else apart from HP4GU (which was more for discussion forums). The specific archives started coming around circa '03-'05.

Now that we have some more refreshing of the HP series coming up in the next four years, we may see a repeat of this cycle.

** I think it's safe to say that the niche sites that hosted them, who never expanded their readership and fandoms will die out. And it's sad but entirely predictable. Sites like ffn and ao3 will be fine though

** Speaking as someone who got into HP fanfiction not a year ago, and who is currently writing a pretty long fic, I don't like to think so at all.

fanfiction.net has new updated stories every minute it seems, siye.co.uk needed funding a while back and received enough for the entire year (and then some) really quickly, and this sub is very active too. And then I've only mentioned three sites. Harry Potter fanfiction is still huge.

Back to my point of writing my own fic: it's disheartening to be so invested in it, and all the while there are people saying "yeah, it's old" and moving on from HP fanfic.

Looking at other forums on the internet that I was a part of and that sort of died, it almost always started with posts like these. "Are we dying?" Those were the most visited threads in the end by a large margin.

** It's consolidating. The smaller sites that didn't continue to draw new fans will fall away through a process of attrition. Those who are still fans will migrate to the bigger players. I'm sure after the new films and The Cursed Child there will be an up tick again.

*** Eh, I don't know about that. I think if you want to look for fics devoted to a specific ship or character or style of writing, it's better to have the archives seperate, plus having the "big one" (FFN), rather than just dumping them into one/two big archives. I honestly think the way of organizing things was much better back then.
