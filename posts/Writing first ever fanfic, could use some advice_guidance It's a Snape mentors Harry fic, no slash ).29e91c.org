Decided to write my own fanfic, even though my writing is pretty horrible. I think its something I will enjoy even if not that many people end up reading it.

However I could definitely use some advice, and if someone wants to beta for me that would be great! (i'm not that great at spelling). Any advice/feedback is appreciated. Even if its harsh, heh.

Heres the link to the story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493729/1/Occlumency-The-Hard-Way]]

Please let me know your opinions/criticisms!


** I can give you some pieces of advice from reading several Severitus fics:

Snape is a great under-developed character (in canon) take this to your advantage to create a past story, motives and reasons for his actions. However, take in mind that he is a very specific character, and something that happens in many Severitus fics is that he suddenly becomes understanding, loving, patient, calm and loses his classical cinism, wisdom, sarcasm and anger. Never forget his anger, and that he is a war-shaped character. Remember that Harry is also an imperfect character, with a long story of snape-hatred. Even with his "people-saving thing" he still despises Snape and distrusts him. Make sure that he doesn't suddenly loves Snape as a father because that simply does not fit Harry (in canon)

For more specific advice on what you have written and will write: FanFictions with incorrect punctuation are the worst. We don't mind much with spelling, but grammar is very important. Differentiate between "your" and "you're" as well as "to" and "too". Use quotation marks ("") Instead of the apostrophe (' ') for dialogue, it makes for a much better reading.

A personal interest I have in stories, and I'm sure many do, is that you explore magic in creative and interesting ways. Potions is a great area to explore due to Snape's character and Harry's supposedly lack of talent in the area. What is Occlumency? Make it interesting. Focusing on the "hurt/comfort/family" leads to a great angsty story in the way Rowling first wrote the book, but thriller and mystery, as well as new explorations of the fantasy genre will lead your fanfic to be more interesting to not only read, but also to write! Writting angst can be incredibly tedious, mix it up with some action and fantasy!

Another advice is to avoid describing the obvious. We've all read the books, so there is no need to write 800 words describing who harry potter is, or what hogwarts is, or a specific book scene like voldemort killing Harry's parents. (you haven't done it in your fic, but new writters tend to do this very often)

Otherwise, your fic is coming to a good start! And remember, this is supposed to be fun for you, so make it fun for yourself!

*** Oh wow! Thank you for the amazing feedback! I definetly see what you mean with alot of fictions writing Snape as some softy. I'm definitely not going for that. I want Snape to feel compassion for Harry but still try to 'fix' his dunderhead problem. In my story Snape will never become a Father but he will become a kind of strict guardian that Harry looks up to (and who lays down the law when Harry's in trouble).

The issue I found with writing Snape (atleast these two chapters) is that I have a hard time writing the sarcastic comments he uses alot. This is mainly because I keep trying to think up good ones that I havent seen used before.

Thank you for the grammar advice! I shall go back over my two chapters and try to edit any obvious problems. Grammar/Spelling has always been a issue for me as I cant really see the obvious faults in my writing. Hopefully I'll be able to find a nice beta who doesn't mind giving me a helping hand.

So far I don't feel that I am being overly descriptive. I personally also dislike fictions that are overly descriptive as they often feel slow and uninteresting.

Thank you for all your feedback it is extremely appreciated!

**** Well, sarcasm is hard to express in writing. Perhaps you could experiment with Snape, when not lecturing or when not being passionate about something, to have short dialogues. Think about the fifth movie and Snape and Umbridge's interactions.

Also, sometimes it works thinking about what remarks you would make when someone said something blatantly obvious. Another thing I've found that works is imagining as if Snape was slurring his words, dragging them out, and when angered having snappy short remarks. :)

** I don't find your writing horrible at all. I've read (or tried to read) some pretty badly written fics before, and your story doesn't even come close to any of those! I do see some grammar issues, but nothing that can't be fixed easily. Your word choice is sometimes different than how I might have written it, but that doesn't mean it's bad necessarily, just that you see the characters differently than I do. I like your story idea and would actually like to read more.

*** Thank you for your lovely feedback! I'm glad you found it enjoyable to read and I hope to be able to provide you with consistent new updates. When you say word choices could you give me an example?

Thank you very much for your feedback!

**** You're welcome! I know how hard it can be when you first start writing, and how scary it is to share your ideas with people, and just how important positive feedback and constructive criticism are. :)

Personally, I imagine Snape to say things that are (and certainly in canon he does) sarcastic, biting, and angry. For an example of word choice: Near the start of your story, Snape delivers the line "Well Mr. Potter it seems that you are very eager for my company tonight, you even arrived before the scheduled time, how very enduring." I'd think he snap out something more along the lines of, "No need to announce yourself, Potter. I can see you standing in my doorway like some useless gargoyle."

***** Ah, the sarcastic comments. Yeah I feel like I will have a problem with them. I'm not a very sarcastic person irl (and if anything its lame sarcasm like 'oh hey look, that pea is the size of your brain'). I might have to take ideas from other authors for abit before I get into the swing of making up my own sarcastic comments :D

****** Yeah when I first started writing (and occasionally I still find myself doing it) I borrowed ideas and phrases from other authors or used their writing for inspiration until I found my own voice. There are still things I have trouble with though. Like, I struggle with arguments/conflict, because I tend to avoid such things in real life. :P

** Decided to merge my 3 chapters into 1. To make it easier on the reader. I know that when I read fanfics I hate having to press next chapter constantly. As an author it's easier to write short 2k-ish chapters, but I kinda don't want to annoy my readers to the point that they leave me. How do you guys feel about chapter length? Sorter? Longer? With longer chapters (5K+) I can only really bring one out each day or so whilst with shorter chapters I can bring 2-3 per day out. Please let me know your opinions on the best course of action!

*** a chapter per day is already plenty. From what I've seen an author that manages to consistently do updates once per week is already considered fast.

If you are planning this fic to be long, as in range of 100k before you are done, or if you haven't actually planned it out yet and are going with the flow, than consider deciding on a schedule now that doesn't stretch you too much.

On another note - reconsider use of caps lock. Yelling, screaming, shouting - these verbs are sufficient to describe Dursley's speech. Using all capitals stretches into 'anvilicious' territory.

Note how all-capital speech is extremely rare in published literature, and when it is used it usually denotes very special cases (ie. Terry Pratchett's voice of Death) In literature it is usually reserved for god like beings and the implied "voice effect" is overwhelming sound that overrides all other sounds and even conscious thoughts.

Alternatively, the way you have it now, you are basically embarking on "training" your reader into reading all capital letters as synonym to shouting/yelling/screaming - besides the fact that this is going to be jarring for many readers like myself because it contradicts the norms as prescribed by editors for all published works it's also going to create a few problems in the scope of your writing:

1) You will need to always use capitals for any instance of the yelling in your story for your writing to retain a consistent style - which is very important; altering style mid book is very jarring to a reader and is a sure way to cause them to lose immersion when they encounter the change.

2) Shouting/screaming/yelling while often synonymous, in many situations aren't. There are shades of differences which you as a writer will likely need to properly describe the scene - you will still need to use the descriptors often and having both will make it seem to the reader like you are telling them the same thing twice in a row: "HARRY" she yelled. "WHAT" Harry screamed back.

3) All capital lines stand out. They break the reader's gaze off the lines they are reading and cause them shift attention. It's a natural reaction to having unusual text on the page that is unusual enough for the eye to notice without even focusing on it. That's really going to screw up many attempts at setting the mood and scene - you might be doing something like describing a spooky house, but the reader has already noticed an all-caps line 3 paragraphs down the page, and being human has probably glanced at it involuntarily and read part of it. Now 3 paragraphs of trying to set the mood are wasted because they already know, at the very least, that something is about to happen to cause someone to yell. Same thing with long dialogues - reader only reading beginning of a conversation, but they already know that it will soon involve screaming because there are all-caps down the page.

**** Oh wow thank you for your insightful comments! I hadn't actually thought about how my usage of caps lock could be damaging the reading experience. In almost every HP fanfic i've read anything involving uncle vernon shouting has mainly been capslock, but i can definitely see how it could be a jarring reading experience. And I definitely don't want Harry/Snape to use capslock when shouting. I will review the Uncle Vernon bit and make amendments, thank you for your input!

Personally I much prefer long fanfics over short ones. The plot that I have planned out so far doesn't lend itself to anything less then 100k words. I will hopefully be writing more plots after this one but the 1st main plot is really about Snape getting Harry healthy, teaching him occlumency and building a fledgling relationship with him. I can't see that being finished before 100k words.
