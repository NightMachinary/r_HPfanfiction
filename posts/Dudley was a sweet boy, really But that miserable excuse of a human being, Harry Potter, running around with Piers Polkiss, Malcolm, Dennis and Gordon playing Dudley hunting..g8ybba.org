Thank god he received his Hogwarts letter, finally we get to be rid of him!

In which Harry is a bully, all ready to storm Hogwarts.


** I don't see Vernon or Petunia allowing Harry to bully Dudley. Unless it's a complete AU where Harry ends up being a Squib, so he can't go to Hogwarts to learn magic.

Mhm... oh that's an idea.

****** Not to be rude, not meaning to be; but: Stricter? Right, because being raised in a cupboard under the stairs is only strict, and in no way abusive.

Also, I don't know about you, but if we're going with this AU, Vernon and Petunia would rather have Dudley continue the Harry Hunting, then the other way around, or as I said, if they were both magical, they'd likely ignore them, with how much they hated magic.

Even in an AU, it'd have to be really convincing to get Vernon or Petunia to care about Harry.

******* I never said they cared about harry, they just show the lack of care in a different way.

in this timeline the dursleys are strict on dudley and do not care about harry and his actions.

Hell you vernon could even think harrys bullying of duddly is toughing duddly up

*** I mean bullies are often built through parental neglect. It could very well be his form of vengeance against the Dursleys. It's not like Harry does not use the threat of magic to bully his relatives in canon.

**** The only real way that I could see Petunia or Vernon for that matter for letting Harry to bully Dudley, would be if either both of them were magical, or Harry was a Squib, and Dudley was magical.

Otherwise I don't see either one of them allowing Harry to bully Dudley. The only reason Dudley did it was because he was taught, or assumed it was okay, because his parents never stopped him. Otherwise I don't see them letting Harry bully their son, they just hated magic way too much to let it convincingly happen.

****** If they caught even a inkling of what Harry was doing, which I don't see them ignoring that, I just don't see it possible tbh.

Though maybe because the Dursley's were dreadful to Harry, even without all the fanon abuse.

******* Tom Riddle was a bully and could never be directly linked to his bullying. Maybe the ladies from the orphanage did not care as much about Tom's victims as the Dursleys cared about Dudley, but Harry could have exerted just as much violence without anyone ever being suspected.

** Interesting prompt. I don't see a way to continue it without making Dudley a wizard too. Otherwise the perspective would have to be from Bully!Harry perspective, which would be difficult to make an engaging character if he's such an asshole that he bullies his poor cousin and leads a gang of ruffians.

It would be super interesting though if Dudley turned out to be a wizard too. Spending the first 11 years of his life being bullied by his cousin, thinking that he was going to get a break when Harry heads to Hogwarts the same way canon Harry looked forward to Dudley going to Smeltings. Only to have that ripped away from him when he gets told he's a muggleborn and needs to go to Hogwarts with Harry.
