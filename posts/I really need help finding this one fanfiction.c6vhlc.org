:END:
Hey! So I read this one severus/harry fanfiction a couple years ago that I wanted to revisit, but I can't find it!

It was on [[https://fanfiction.net/][fanfiction.net]], and was sort of a one-shot. Essentially, Harry wants to have a relationship with Severus, but knows that he won't appeal to the man with his Gryffindor tendencies. So he goes to Draco, who reluctantly advises him how to draw out his more slytherin qualities to attract that man. He enters a relationship with Severus, but becomes miserable hiding his true self. At some point, he and Severus move in with each other, and Severus notices that Harry is becoming rather depressed (there's also something about Harry standing and looking at the house everyday before coming inside). Severus goes to Draco for help, and Draco essentially calls him an idiot, and tells him what Harry is doing to make Severus comfortable (he calls Harry a giant teddy bear at some point). In the end, Harry comes in from the rain, and finds hot chocolate and his favorite bathrobe laid out with some hot chocolate, and he follows a trail of petals to a hot bath.

This is all I recall from the fanfiction, hopefully someone can help me!
