With all of the discussion of 'ships and OneTruPairing(tm), I've not seen too many weddings in fanfics, except those that were an excuse for a power-up ritual. Anyone see different?


** Uh, to be honest, the only wedding scene I can remember from a fanfic is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3302452/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Story-by-Dad][Harry Potter and the Story By Dad]] which involves Harry and Hermione getting married (mixed muggle and wizard attendees) but half-way through they hear about an attack on Hogsmeade, and run off to stop it.

In a moment of utterly deranged yet beautifully 'fanfic' imagination, Harry turns into a dragon (did I mention he's a dragon animagus in this?) while Hermione rides on his back in her wedding dress, screaming like a banshee.

After thwarting the attack they return to the wedding looking a little disheveled. The next day a news report runs about some ghost banshee thing riding a dragon and barbequeing Death Eaters.

At least, that's how I remember it. It may be more or less awesome. It was a while ago.

*** At least that's memorable! I'm a little reticent to read a million words to find it...

  A post HBP book seven substitute started well before DH. It is a HHr book. Ron and Ginny stay likable. I try to stay with the canon as much as possible and will eventually explain all actions and abilities. Please read the intro for more details.
