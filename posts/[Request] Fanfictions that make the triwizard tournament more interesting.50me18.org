Any sort of fanfiction that improves the tournament - either through making Harry more powerful to have more interesting solutions, or that change the tasks to be bigger or better. A prime example of this kind of fanfiction is 'The Lie I lived'


** I really liked the way the TWT was done in the Temporal Beacon linkffn(6517567). It's a time loop story, and while the tournament is re-imagined, it also differs with the loops.

So multiple tourneys for the price of one!

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** *The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146), has done a good job in rewriting the TWT. Not only were the tasks redone, but spectators could also follow what was happening. The bad guys no longer went through the Moody-impersonating route which would be easily foiled by a few security questions from Dumbledore, but found a clever solution that even rendered the Marauder's Map ineffective.

** The one you've already read: The Lie I've Lived is what I would have recommended for this. I think it handles it really well, both in that the tasks themselves are more involved /and/ that there's references to other competitions going on between the schools outside said tasks.

That said... you don't read TLIL for the TWT, you read it for the most awesomely foul-mouthed sorting hat ever.
