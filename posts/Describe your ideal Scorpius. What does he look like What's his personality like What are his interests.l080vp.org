I haven't read a ton of next-gen fics, but I'm trying to get into Scorbus! Would love to hear what people who are a bit more familiar with him have to say about his characterization in fics :)


** With black hair and green eyes, like his biological father.

*** Also adopted from his maternal aunt because Draco and Astoria couldn't have any children.

** I write Scorpius quite a lot! Here's my head canon:

-He looks like Draco (blond, grey eyes)

-He's a Slytherin

-He plays Chaser (same as Albus)

-He's more easygoing than Draco, a good student, witty, likes teasing people and is really overdramatic

-He has a sweet tooth but is really bad at baking/cooking

-He's good at dueling

-His worst subject is Arithmancy

-He plays the pipe organ (Astoria made him learn)

... but I also love reading a shy Ravenclaw Scorpius, even though that's not how I personally imagine him!

** I'm not really into next gen fics, and I barely remember anything that happened in cursed child, but I imagine him as Basically a mini malfoy, but meeker and more timid

** My ideal Scorpius is one that doesn't exist because Draco gets killed in DH (Harry lies to Narcissa in the forest).

** In fics, he's generally portrayed as very soft, clever, nerdy and bookish, and sometimes anxious or needing approval from his dad and peers. He's contrasted a bit with Albus, who's always his best friend and almost always his love interest, because Albus is usually a little more reserved, sometimes sullen, and introverted. I tend to agree with those characterizations. Scorpius usually softens Draco up a bit too. Overall, he's a nice boy with geek tendencies.

** My ideal scorpius is that he doesn't exist. I don't really like malfoy and I think the next gen books read like some of the most cringey fanfics out there and thus shouldn't be allowed.

** Like his father and grandfather but toned down a bit. Still a pureblood supremacist who looks down on half bloods and muggleborns as lesser, but doesn't actively want them dead. Thinks they should stay quiet and in their place. Almost certainly Slytherin and plays Quidditch. Is polite to but not friendly with any of the trio's kids.
