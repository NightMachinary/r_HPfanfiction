I love those kind of fics where it talks about how and why magic works. If you've ever read moshpit's Echoes of Power, there's constant 'excerpts' from textbooks that talk about how magic exists in the world, how a wizard can channel it, etc, and that's what I really love, that analysing and breaking it down.

HPMOR did this pretty well too, but I will say... I didn't enjoy the story at all after the end. Felt like a cop out. Anyway.

The Arithmancer, and it's subsequent sequel, Lady Archimedes, have been amazing, and I've been following that one as it's currently being updated. I like the way there are 'experiments' and such that help you figure out what defines magic in that universe.

So yeah, it's those kind of fics that I've been really enjoying lately. If you've got any recommendations, please let me know! Thanks!


** linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar) This one has pretty awesome potions.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) talks a bit about animagi, duelling and healing. It's also generally a good story. linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Reasonable Explanation might also be along the lines of what you're looking for. Lastly, linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) has indepth Divination content and mentions rituals a few times.

None of them are 100% what you're after, but they're all decent stories in their own right and have parts of what you asked for.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr
