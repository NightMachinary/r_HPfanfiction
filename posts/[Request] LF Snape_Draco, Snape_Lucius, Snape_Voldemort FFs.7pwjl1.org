Will try out and read anything, regardless of kinks/warnings/rating, where either of these are the main pairing (please no threesomes). That said, I /would/ prefer fics where the main focus is not on smut and that are complete/still regularly updated. Thank you very much in advance!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/femmequixotic/pseuds/Femme/works?fandom_id=136512][femmequixotic]] has a bunch of Snape/Draco fic, and a Snape/Lucius or two.
