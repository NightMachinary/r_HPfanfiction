As the title says: what is the latest thing that made you sigh while dealing with fanfiction? It could be anything really, from seeing the author consistently spelling the hero 'Hrary', to discovering that your favorite regularly updating story suddenly leads to mpreg situations.

Hm... Mine? I was browsing ffnet, sorting by favorites, just in case I found something I had missed. Indeed, on the third page, I saw a fic I hadn't noticed before. The summary was short, succinct, and found myself getting excited at finally finding something interesting to read. I open it in a new tab, and guess what? I hadn't noticed the author's name: Robst. Instant cold shower :(

P.S. Sorry to the Harry Crow lovers, lol.


** Read through a decent Harry Potter /Fairy Tail crossover. All good fun, nothing to note really.

Then the author used "sweatdropped". As in, the sweat-drop you see in animes used as a verb.

/Lucy Heartfilia sweatdropped./

I don't even know what happens in the next paragraph... I just stopped reading immediatly. Theres a limit to what I find acceptable.

Also happened just recently: Weeaboo Japan worship with vomit-inducing uses of mediocre japanese and character descriptions worthy of true master-otakus.

The next time someone makes Hermione say "I'm just a cute little neko now NYAAAAAA Harry-sama!" imma fucking cut some bitches.

  As Avery rounded the corner behind him, Harry spun and dropped into a crouch, bringing his wand up beside his head to point at Avery.

  "Moooooooooon Gorgeoooooooooous Meditation!" Harry shouted as he thrust his wand forward. Wind whipped up around Harry and followed the beam of light out of his wand straight into Avery's chest.

**** Oh, but I can...

The sweat-drop is a visual expression of exasperation /confusion/ embarrassement. Its used in Anime, not because its such a great feature, but because its quickly drawn and much cheaper than to actually draw the emotion.

In novels its even worse. We have a lot of words to express those emotions and do not need to brutally butt-rape the english language like this to do so.

** One of my big disappointments is excessive telling instead of showing and I will leave a 100k story with 2000+ favorites in a heartbeat because of this. If *every* dialog tag ends in an -LY word, I will not finish the story.

Telling: "Fine. Don't believe me," Harry said angrily.

Showing: Harry surged to his feet, sending the chair clattering to the floor behind him. "Fine. Don't believe me."

Another disappointment is when the point of view changes between multiple characters in the middle of a scene. We're in Harry's head. Next line, we're in Ron's head, then Harry's, etc. It's like point of view ping pong. I hate it.

*** I think that's going far too far, and the example is borderline hammy. Harry surging to his feet, letting his chair clatter to the ground is far different from saying something angrily. Some things you can't show easily, and trying to makes it excessively wordy. Somethings are shown, not told, by using the right word. Red is a color. Saying something is red is not worse than calling it "the color of fresh blood". We can usually easily discern an angry voice, so using "angrily" is not a bad decision. It gets into "showing, not telling" territory when something not-obvious is told.

**** There is definitely a place for telling in a story. A story with 100% showing would be wordy. Also, telling is a good way to move uninteresting plot along quickly.

However, I don't feel this way when it comes to telling in dialogue. The above was just an example. Harry said angrily - what the heck does that even look like, sound like, and feel like? Did he slam his fists down on the table? Did spittle fly out of his mouth? Was his heart pumping with adrenaline? Did he knock over his chair? Were his hands shaking? I mean those details make the story a bit more immersive and interesting. Some adverbs in dialogue tags are okay and appropriate but nothing but adverbs is just too much for me. Of course, everyone's tolerance for these things vary.

***** Well, without any additional details, I assume he didn't hit the table, didn't spit, didn't knock over anything, didn't shake, just spoke in an angry voice. That's what it means to speak angrily. Nothing more, nothing less. Most people I know don't do any of those things you mention when they speak angrily.

Yes, there are scenes where more showing is needed. But the single line "he spoke angrily" doesn't qualify, not without a lot more context about the author's intention.

But again - sometimes, you really just want to call a red pot red, and an angry voice angry.

I have seen stories written almost entirely like: "Xyz," Ron said jealously. "Abc," Hermione said smartly. "Xyz," Malfoy said cockily. On and on. /Those/ are the stories I'm talking about. I'm not talking about dropping a story with a few uses of angrily or whatever scattered throughout.

I also encountered a story where 'Bellatrix Lestrange' was married to Voldemort, that killed any desire to read on. If she was married to him she'd either be a Riddle or a Black, not a Lestrange.

It's already a fact that he's the strongest and likely the smartest character in the series (not that he's perfect, he has his issues) so if you make him look weak, or stupid, or utterly incompetent then it just comes off as very strange. I think it's funnier to just make him crazy or senile or something.

Conversely, a really good Dumbledore is usually the sign of a really good fic.

** Linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard by Darth Marrs)

A HPxStar Wars fic. The first chapter really had me going. Some Empire general stumbles on earth, harvests it for slaves and then nukes it from orbit. Harry loses everything. He's a mining slave, it's gritty, there's a bit of technomancy. He's about to become the Punisher and wreak nonstop havoc and terror on the Empire.....and now it has turned into 'soul crystals', a Princess Leia with the personality of a potted plant. Unfortunately, when the author used the words "filled", "her", "with" and "seed" in the most recent chapter, it is not because Leia is in fact a potted plant. Oh, and technomancy apparently served it's purpose so it disappeared after the first few chapters.

But I dealt with that since it seems like Luke and Leia are actually quite liked by the community. (I find them both to be bland and uninteresting, but thats just me).

However, when the Punisher, as you called him, began to fluff it out with Leia... yea, big fat nope right there.

** The most recent disappointment was linkffn(The Lily Potter Foundation by theflyinfoote). I should have known going in, what with a Harry who's in love with Hermione even though she's with Ron and she's acting really 'weird' towards him. Although the weird felt pretty normal Hermione, steamrolling other people and dismissing their opinions fairly succinctly.

Still, when it became apparent that not only was Ron dosing her with potions, but she was also a virgin as well? Oh, and Ginny had potioned Harry to get his attention? That was enough for me.

I hate hate hate potioned Harry and Hermione. It's like, a girl - in this case Hermione - isn't good enough for Harry unless she's loved him for ever and never loved anyone else. She must always worship the ground he walks on and kowtow to him. And she is /of course/ a virgin, even if he's banged all the chicks.

I don't hate Harry/Hermione like a lot of people in this subreddit seem to. I can deal with ooc characters and Mary Sue (to an extent) Hermione. But give them some personality outside the relationship and let them be stupid teenagers. Let them make mistakes with love and be cruel to each other. Just give them some bloody agency.

** The more I read fanfiction the more little things annoy me. I've become very particular and peculiar about it.

The phrase "to boot" makes me close a lot of fics as it's usually in a fic when they're are circlejerking about how perfect someone or something is.

The phrase "arse over teakettle". What does that even mean? It is when people are trying to be British and just failing. After living here all my life I've never once heard anyone call a kettle, a teakettle, yet it's everywhere in HP fanfiction.

Another phrase that bothers me is "pot meet kettle" I've seen it so many times it feels like people just copy and paste character interactions.

My latest disappointment was when I was looking through fics on the adventure filter -draco, -hermione and came across something that I hadn't read before with 2000+ favourites. Three chapters in, shopping trip, inheritance, clothing descriptions,to boot, cmd+w.

So they simply insert Hermione instead of their OC and turn her into whatever they had intended: have a little apprehension at the beginning, point out that Hermione and [Canon Character] both have interests in reading and can talk about intelligent things (or talk about how Hermione never ever breaks rules and she's totally attracted to this bad boy that does even though it would never make sense in the long run), and it gives a pass at /literally whatever/ they wanted to accomplish in the fic.

*** That's weird - there's tons of "canon characters" that are basically just a name, and can be filled out however you want. I think that's more their take on Hermione, not a conscious decision to replace her with an OC.

** Honestly? The fact that /Straight Outta Compton/'s been out for a hot minute and there are no crossovers to speak of.

Bur in all seriousness, I've yearned for an inner-city HP story for quite some time. Written well, it might be an eye-opener for readers who might think that Hogwarts (sans magic, of course) is typical of a British school in the nineties.

You know what? Fuck it, this is getting done.

** I am a huge fan of Snape/Lily fan fictions, and sometimes it feels like I've read them all (even though I know that's probably impossible). I came across one I hadn't read before, and I was so excited! But it is soooooooo bad. It is just poorly written. For example: characters telling how they feel instead of showing, repetitive, illogical plot movement, out of character actions (I'm not even talking about canon, I mean, in the story, the characters behaviors seem like violent mood swings), incomprehensible rules that govern the universe... Overall just an unpleasant read. But I'm going to finish it, because, I have mental problems.

Oh, also, after every chapter, the author also explains why everything that happened in the chapter happened by way of an author's note. I mean, if you have to explain that kind of shit outside of your story, that means something is missing. Right??

** I'm starting to get a bit saddened when I see Luna in Gryffindor. Granted, I kind of like the time travel stuff so it feels more prevalent there. I don't mind characters in different houses if that is the premise of the story, such as Harry in Slytherin. It always seems like the same reason, too. Harry begs the Sorting Hat to put Luna there because she was bullied in the other timeline. More of a pet-peeve now more than anything, but let Luna be Luna, which means let her be in Ravenclaw.

*** I've met this senario twice, and I really like that exact thing. It gives alot of debth to Harry and it is a great showing of how he's becoming more mature, two things that is hard to show in a fanfiction. It shows that Harry is now willing to help those who he isn't extreamly close to, and willingness to ask others to help another, instead of micromanage everything like many fanfictions fall short by doing. And while using length on helping Luna out of Ravenclaw can be tireing to read, just doing a short phrase where Harry ask the Sorting Hat for help does the entire difference for Luna, and Luna doesn't have to be major for the plot. Just simply giving some minor help to a charector who would otherwice have been in a bad situation show humanity and decency.

So I disagree with you. If Harry has the choice of leaving Luna in ravenclaw to rot with the bitches where it is known she wont have it the best, or having her join somewhere else and maybe having a better experiency. Harry should always chose to help others.

** My biggest pet peeve is the overuse of exclamation points. It is so jarring and out of place in most conversations. I just read Prevailing Counterpoint (another author picked up matt/fake a smile's taking control/free life series) and they are everywhere.

Exclamation points are exactly as they are described, for EXCLAIMING LOUDLY. Lets look at the definition:

"cry out suddenly, especially in surprise, anger, or pain."

They aren't for indicating a slight influx in tone in a sentence. Half the characters seem like they are either shouting at each other or using this bouncy perky tone that doesn't fit the characters or situation. The story was actually half decent once I trained myself to ignore all of them.

And its not just this fic, this problem is rampant in fanfiction. I see it all the damn time and it's a great way to get me to nope right the fuck outta there. The only reason I continued with Prevailing Counterpoint is because I really wanted to see a conclusion (even though it ended up being a bit anticlimactic).
