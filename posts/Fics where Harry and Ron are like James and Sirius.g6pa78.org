In canon James and Sirius are described as efortleslly the brightest and most talented people of the year, and according to Lupin they're the best at anything they did. Are there any fics where Harry and Ron are like this? My boi Ron gets bashed on a lot, need to see a fic where he's reverse bashed


** linkffn(6452481)

Harry and Ron's 58 year old souls (rather than just memories) are thrown into their 14 year old bodies. Underage drinking, sexually inappropriate humour and no bashing. Complete.

The thing is, Harry and Ron being like James and Sirius isn't exactly possible. A big part of Ron's character, even in the last book, is his inability to deal with his insecurities. Of course, it often seems horribly exaggerated.

As for Harry, if he's anymore competent than he is in canon, he wouldn't try to use a Disarming Charm against Voldemort, and it simply isn't possible to be competent enough to beat a Dark Lord when you're 17 and Dark Lord is 70+.

*** I'm usually really uncomfortable with time travel to past body fics, since it usually involves fully grown men in a childs body making friends and dating literal children. Does this fic have that?

**** They don't get on with teenage chics immediately, but it's for a different reason. It's revealed in Chapter 1. There are no explicit romance scenes in the fic tho. Only a passing remark (or two) in the last chapter.

Romance and girls aren't really the main focus. It's mostly just Harry, Ron and humour.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

** Sekrit Projekt by Chilord sadly unfinished but well worth it.

It's not on the usual sites so no bot, but it can be found at [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]].

The premise of the fic is that in the summer after 3rd year Harry discovers the map has more of the marauders in it than he initially thought. Interacting with the map inspires him, and through him Ron, into living up to his father's legacy.

  A collection of related one-shots spanning Hogwarts, where Hermione never has her Halloween epiphany and so the trio never forms, leaving Harry & Ron to bro their way through Hogwarts, forced to learn for themselves what they need to know.

** Well, Ron's a hero in most of my stories, but if you don't mind a trio-focused story where they are top Curse-Breakers, you could give my story "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis" a try.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".
