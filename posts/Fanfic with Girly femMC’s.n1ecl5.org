It can be an Oc or SI or even fem!Harry I just want a confident Girly Mc like if Sharpay went to Hogwarts.


** Is Lavender girly enough for you?

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** Linkao3(What's Her Name In Hufflepuff) have some girly elements but your best bet is that lavender/tom fic.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship.
