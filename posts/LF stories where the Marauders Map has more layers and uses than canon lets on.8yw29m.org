Snape calls it dark magic. While I think it's just Snape pinning the blame on Harry as much as possible, I wonder if it was actually true and the map had much more than it let on. It doesn't have to be dark, although that would be cool.


** In my linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), I decided that the Map had a Deluminator-like function binding all four Marauders together, so that they could always find each other through it, even beyond the boundaries of Hogwarts. Cue Sirius Black trying to get it from the Twins when he figures out /they/ have it, and Pettigrew trying to steal it /first/.

It's only a secondary plot-point, mind.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

That's canon, actually, to an extent. The personalities-in-the-Map spend a while insulting Snape when he tries to open the Map. Mind that the extent of that is never seen --- could be they can only react to use of the Map, and can't be directly spoken to.

And there /is/ a fic somewhere where it /is/ a Horcrux. Wasn't very good though.

It has some parts like this, including one where Harry goes into the Map like Riddle's Diary.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** It could well be. After all, Riddle created his Diary as a teenager, and the Marauders were said to be brilliant, and were already somewhat older than Tom when they made the Map.

Besides, the Diary's ability to show memories is equivalent to that of a Pensieve (except /all/ the memories of Diarymort are accessible, and /he/ picks what he wants you to see). Pensieves are rare, but an established bit of magic; if Slughorn and Snape knew it then surely the Marauders could too.

******* As secondary characters, they sometimes are. However, every single time I stumble upon them as main characters, they're always copying Remus's homework, Lily's homework, failing even Transfiguration. But it's always Lily that is portrayed as the Magical savant with the Marauders as idiots, even when it's Harry-centric. Lily's always the genius when we literally know nothing about her from Canon. It'd be a nice twist to see Sirius and James as geniuses.

** I feel as though a potential alternate design for the Map would be a book a bit like a London A-Z with maps of different areas on each page. It might have, for instance, a map covering all of the Fourth floor, plus individual pages for specific rooms on that floor. Finding people could be simplified by an alphabetised list (Or you could magically sort it in whatever way is most convenient) at the back, like an index, with something denoting house and year or whether or not the person is a member of staff, or potential other things like that. It'd be a far more portable solution than a great big bit of parchment covering a huge castle.

edit: In the films it has a bit of a pop-up thing going on to possibly show multiple layers.
