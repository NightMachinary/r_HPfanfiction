I'm not actually sure if this flair is the right one, but I'm looking to be involved in a group writing project? Something almost like the Lone Traveler series except each chapter would be written by a different author? Or even if it's a more traditional plot line, I haven't had a co-writing experience yet and I would like to.


** That would be super cool and I could definitely see myself contributing to something like that... There only remain the issue of organizing it... and on that front... oh did you hear that? sorry, gotta go, bye!

ps: more seriously though, perhaps in a dedicated forum topic somewhere ? and/or someplace with a chat? idk...

*** Maybe start with a story only thread on space battles and when there are enough chapters transfer it to FFN and AO3.

** The HPfanfiction discord started planning something but it ended up falling apart before I could even release the first chapter.

**** We wanted something that anyone could write a chapter without having to follow a strict story line... So it was going to be about Harry, Dumbledore and Grindlewald on the run from the European ministries and all their crazy adventures together.
