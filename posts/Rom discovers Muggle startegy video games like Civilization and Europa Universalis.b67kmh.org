Ron's ability at chess is not to be underestimated , as he had to protect at least 4 pieces including the king. I just wonder how he would react after the war with the Muggle strategy videogame scene picking up and growing in popularity.


** This would make an excellent oneshot. Hermione being exasperated that her attempts to teach Ron 'muggle studies' turned into games. Ron complaining to Harry that muggles cursed a game so you could never quit playing. "Just one more turn, mate. It never ends." Ending with Ron discovering online gaming where he flagrantly violates the statue of secrecy. "You can't threaten to curse muggles Ron" "He was talking about mum!"

*** The cursed game is very real. It's always just one more turn

** "So it's like Chess?"

"Well, basically - "

"And it has over a thousand different pieces of which you can place hundreds at the same time?"

"Yes - "

"And the board has millions of squares over which the pieces can move all at once, each following their own rules?"

"Yeah, it can be a little difficult managing the different weapon systems. Especially micromanaging your Radar AA against SEAD can be a pain in the arse. Honestly, I suck at it," Harry admitted and rubbed his neck. He had picked up Wargame:AirLand Battle during the last Steam Sale, but the sheer complexity put him off again and again. Apparently, the same complexity had a very different effect on his best friend though, at least if the sudden gleam in his eyes was anything to go by.

"Mate, I understood less than half of what you just said, but tell me more."

.

/I don't see Ron being into Paradox games due to their heavy emphasis on history, but RTS are something right down his alley. And the Wargame series is as complex as it gets./

**** Civ probably since it is more of a sandbox. Maybe Stellaris if you want to go into Grand Strategy. But given his attitude towards Muggles (plain disinterest), I don't think he'd be into a history heavy game. Although perhaps CKII with the dynastic shenanigans ^{and^{the^{incest}}} ...

****** Stellaris is real time though. And a lot deeper when it comes to combat and unit creation/composition while the trend in Civ seems to go towards simplicity and accessibility.

Age of Empires (1/2/3)/Mythology might also be something for him.

******* Even so the games description calls it 4x

Stellaris is a 4X grand strategy video game developed and published by Paradox Interactive. 

I still think Darkest Dungeon and Fire Emblem would be up his alley

******** Mass Effect, The Division and The Witcher are all Action RPGs. And they are definitely not the same as each other.

********* Im not saying Civ and Stellaris are the same just in the same Genre. Just like how The Binding of Issac and Slay the Spire are both Roguelike games but they play differently

********** Theres definitely some overlap but I would say that stellaris leans a bit more towards grand strategy than civ does. They're similar, but very different takes on 4x games. I think stellaris is the first one to go really big that's real time and doesn't use a grid map, while civ is /the/ 4x game. Stellaris is much more open in what you can do.

** This is the crossover I need. HPxEU4 crossover when? Seriously though, I agree with most of the rest of the thread. Civ or any RTS games would probably be better for him. I'd read a story where Ron becomes a starcraft pro.
