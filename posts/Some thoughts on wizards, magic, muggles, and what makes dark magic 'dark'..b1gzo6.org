So here's a theory I've generally been holding for as much as I've been reading/writing fanfiction.

1. Wizards are physically superior to muggles (their bodies can handle more stress/damage).

2. Wizards possess a magical aura than guards them like an immune system, lessening various harmful magical effects and generally bolstering the organism.

So, first of all, wizards (and their kids especially) are pretty nonchalant about a lot of things that would absolutely terrify people like you and me. For example, there's potions classes, where /boiling/ cauldrons explode with some frequency, spewing noxious fumes and chemicals into the air. Students are regularly hit. Hexes and Curses are common. During year one, a detention into the forbidden forest (you know, the one with the man-eating spiders, among other things) was deemed acceptable. Quidditch... oh, don't get me started on Quidditch. No safety net, bludgers that would (seemingly) be deadly, students whizzing around at break-neck speeds with barely any protection...

You'd think deaths would number in the dozens.

And yet, death is a rare occurrence.

Which brings me to my points.

A) Wizard bodies are physically superior. Whether it's because of magic or some biological discrepancy, I don't know, but take, for example, a bludger hit at high speeds. For a muggle, it could easily be deadly. But a wizard will take the hit with significantly less consequences. Instead of their neck snapping, they'll maybe get a bruise. Which would explain the systematic recklessness.

B) And regarding recklessness: with all the hostile magic around them, you'd think wizards would be more careful. But no. Things like magical duels or a teacher removing a student's bones usually yield some administrative repercussions, maybe a detention or two, but no one really seems to be /truly/ worried. It's like a ‘boys will be boys' attitude spanning an entire society. Which leads me to think that /wizards are naturally resistant to magic./ Many spells and curses don't /actually/ harm them; well, they do, but in a manageable way because their innate magical aura (or magical immune system, call it what you want) keeps them safe, repelling to some degree the harmful magical effects that would cripple a muggle.

C) This, in turn, leads me to muggles, and part of the reason why pureblood supremacy is a thing. If muggles not only lack this magical immunity (meaning a regular toe-curling charm would hit them 10 times harder), but are actually physically inferior, then purebloods touting their “supremacy” would actually have a point; from a biological sense, they are, in fact, the superior species (unless you govern biological success as biological fitness, i.e., reproduction; but that's a separate argument).

D) Finally, I want to touch upon dark magic. If wizards posses a magical immunity, then I posit that what makes magic dark is the ability to /bypass/ this natural barrier. For example, there was a recent post how very, very few wizards could successfully repel the imperious. This could help explain why. Or think about Avada Kedavra: logically, there would seem to be so many cruel and painful ways to murder someone, but only Avada Kedavra is singled out as 'unforgivable'. And my argument is that if you actually tried to slice a wizard up, in many cases, it wouldn't work or would work poorly. The magic could be repelled (up to a limit). But Avada Kedavra would always work. And so the Ministries of the World, terrified that wizards would discover more ways to bypass this magical immunity, classified those three spells as ‘unforgivable' (and others as 'dark') to prohibit their study.

Just some thoughts how magic could work in the fandom. Per canon, it might not fit perfectly, but I think it could explain some things, and it's generally how I've been thinking about magic, wizard, and muggles when reading fanfics.


** From an evolutionary point of view, you can tell which variant of a species is better adapted, because that's the one that becomes most common. If a mutation confers an evolutionary advantage, it spreads throughout the population. If it's been around for a while but it's still rare, that means it's a disadvantage.

Magical ability has been around for a while and it's rare. Therefore it's a disadvantage, like other cool but inconvenient mutations such as albinism.

*** You're misinterpreting evolution, it's not an intelligent process. Generally positive traits replicate because they lead to longer lives and thus more children, but an otherwise positive trait could fade away if it didn't lead to more children. Magicals are shown to have split off from nonmagical society and we know from history that high birth rates are generally more common in developing societies, so it's not at all surprising that there are fewer births in a post-scarcity magical society.

**** What about my comment implied that it's an intelligent process? It's just a process. There's no plan behind it.

In evolutionary terms, a trait is positive of it leads to more and healthier offspring. That's all a positive trait is. Plenty of traits like albinism might seem “positive” to people's personal preferences because white hair looks cool or whatever, but it's negative in evolutionary terms because of the disadvantage of skin that's extra susceptible to cancer, etc. From looking at the population, and noting that muggles far outnumber wizards, it's clear that, whatever the mechanism is, magical ability is not a positive trait in evolutionary terms. It seems cool but conveys no evolutionary advantage, and might be an actual disadvantage.

There might be fewer wizards simply because they've had effective birth control for longer. There are plenty of non-evolutionary reasons birth control is good, but it's not an advantageous trait in evolutionary terms.

***** Your use of the term “better adapted” suggested the popular misconception of evolution improving a species. It's less clear now that I read it again, so my apologies for that. In the context of this discussion, though, my point is that “evolutionary advantage” is actually irrelevant to the OP; a lack of reproductive success is not necessarily linked to physical traits like resilience. It looks like OP might have edited their post to clarify as well.

*** I love this viewpoint. You're right, of course. From an evolutionary standpoint, it seems to convey a disadvantage. But at the same time, on an individual level a being with magical capabilities would seem to have such higher chances of propagation.

So, why is this the case? What's the inhibiting factor?

My theory is -- muggles are. Wizard population numbers were always kept in check by larger number of muggles. Now, Rowling obviously disagrees, but I think it's naive to think witch-hunts had no effect on the overall population. This, in turn, enforced the Statute of Secrecy -- a need to hide for self-protection -- which became ingrained on a subconscious level. How do you a hide a subset of a population within a larger population?

/By making it small. So small no one would notice it./

So, wizards were never allowed to succeed which led to self-regulated population control.

**** That's one possibility, but there are others. The simplest explanation to me is that magical ability confers an actual disadvantage. Accidental magic might kill magical toddlers or their families more often than it saves them. The ability to withstand adversity with minor injuries seems to be correlated with a tendency to take even greater risks, disproportionate to the degree of safety that magic provides. And wizards seem to kill each other more often than muggles do, at least in the books.

Could very well be the case. I would counter that there's little evidence of such child deaths in canon, but at this point I've already strayed well beyond the written material myself, so it's speculation on both our parts.

I think both our versions point to the high possibility of magical populations becoming eventually unsustainable, however.

Which kinda sucks.

My theory is that the most dangerous magical creature is a human toddler. That's why Molly was the only person who had the ability to take down Bellatrix, because of the lighting reflexes she developed raising seven kids.

***** Better option: Magic instantly grants it's user a middle-class level of living, meaning there's less need to have kids and to have a bigger family.

It's a recorded statistic that as populations become wealthier and more educated, they also stop making as many kids.

** A bludger broke Harry's arm in second year, which kind of makes point A moot.

Wizards are superior to non magicals because of magic and their medicine. They are also pretty immune to colds and flus and such but have their own illnesses to deal with. So point B is a wash.

Magicals and non magicals have interbreed before. According to Ron, if they didn't, wizards would die out. Every pureblood has non magicals somewhere down the line.

Point D with unforgivables it's because they can't be blocked or repealed very well.

My argument is that Harry breaking his arm /is/ the less harmful consequence of the bludger hit. So if it was some muggle kid instead, the damage would be much worse. I understand it's kinda iffy from canon perspective, but wizards just do too many dangerous things, and I'm trying to justify that.

Edit: Think about it this way. If you have a son/daughter, would you allow them to play Quidditch? Would you permit your child to fly hundreds of feet high at bewildering speeds with virtually no protection and no overwatch? Because that's what children at Hogwarts do. There is no safety net over the Quidditch field, no slowing charm, nothing. For us, it would be the most extreme sport. If you fall, you fall. During PoA, when Harry tumbled off his broom in a storm only one wizard -- Dumbledore, the /most experienced and powerful wizard in the world/ -- intervened. The rest stood by and watched. Granted, many were horrified by the Dementors, but it's also indicative of the fact that it's /not customary/ to intervene. Which begs the question - why? Why would adult witches and wizards be ok with a kid flying around with no protection and then falling into the ground? And the answer is: because it's not a real danger to them. Their bodies can take it; there are no fatalities from Quidditch at Hogwarts. But to us -- as muggles -- it would be deadly. That's plain physics. Body at 40 MPH into the ground? Splat. RIP. F.

So the only logical conclusion (it seems to me) is that wizards are sturdier than muggles.

In point B, I'm arguing that witches and wizards possess an innate magical resistance to /magic/. I'm not sure how muggles apply here.

It's a very interesting point about interbreeding, and I think I have to expand a bit on my thoughts regarding pureblood supremacy. So, from my position, a witch or wizard would be superior to a muggle; therefore, a pureblood claiming to be superior would just be stating a fact, albeit an arrogant one. However, the 'mudblood' aspect and the discriminatory behavior towards muggleborns would just be societal in nature and have no basis in reality, as, muggleborn or pureblood, they all share the same physicality.

As for D, I'm arguing dark magic bypasses a natural resistance barrier, which explains why it's more difficult to block/repeal.

** I think the recklessness comes not just from any durability, but also from the reversibility- like Harry's broken arm in CoS. Pomfrey could have healed a break within /moments/- not the months (+ surgery) it would take a muggle. But even beyond that- she regrew all the bones overnight. It was uncomfortable, but a muggle equivalent would be... well it'd be a prosthesis, multiple surgeries, years of rehab and pain.

Likewise for Potions class. All the burns and negative effects of botched potions get reversed with a quick trip to the infirmary, no lasting damage. Snape keeps things from getting too out of hand, but it's treated more like kids rough housing on the playground, getting some scrapes and bruises, rather than kids messing around in a chemistry lab or workshop, where you could get life altering injuries.

** On Point *A* and *B*: Harry's arm was broken by a bludger(Year 2), and later knocked unconscious by another one(Year 6, IIRC); Malfoy broke Harry's nose when, IIRC, he kicked him in the face(Year 6); Malfoy himself was badly injured by an angry hippogriff when he provoked it(Year 3); Hermione accidentally injured Ron when she tried to cut ropes he'd been bound with using /Diffindo/(Year 7). This, to me, would tend to go against the idea of wizards being in any way naturally superior to Muggles in the sense of resistance to injury, whether its source is magical or not.

On Point *C*: Pureblood supremacy is a thing in the Potter-verse for basically the same reason white supremacism is a thing IRL. It's simply an application of the concept of a "Master Race" - a specific group of people who believe in the inherent superiority of their own heritage over those of others or mixed heritage. There's no evidence that so-called pure-bloods are in any appreciable way superior, magically or physically, to their mixed-blood or Muggle-born fellows.

*** The fact that we can only name two instances where a bludger injured a person enough to warrant medical attention could be seen as "the exception that proves the rule." Hogwarts plays ~10 quidditch matches a year, with potentially awful beaters (the Weasley twins were exceptionally good beaters in canon, right?). You'd expect AT LEAST 5 bludger hits per game, since games ranged from ~15 minutes (the very short game in PS after the jinxed broom) to several hours. Even if only one of those is direct enough to break a bone, that's potentially one student hospitalized per game, if only overnight while Pomfrey heals them. We don't see evidence of this in canon, right?

And we do have instances in Quidditch where people do survive worse than bludgers: the Wronski Feint. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/WALES_VERSUS_GERMANY][This Pottermore (eh, I know, but it's a baseline) article]] describes a Wronski Feint in the 2014 Quidditch World Cup where the injured player hit the ground at 60 mph and broke all of his bones but is expected to make a full recovery. [[https://gizmodo.com/how-likely-you-are-to-get-killed-by-a-car-depending-on-1778993900][The likelihood of surviving a car crash at 60 mph is estimated at 5% or less]]. And Aidan Lynch walked off the field after a Wronski Feint with presumably just a concussion, right?

** For me, Wizard are not really physically superior to Muggles, in the sense that they can't run longer or carry heavier weight. But, magic gives them a longer and healthier life, partly thanks to their vastly superior medecines, and partly because even after childhood, magic can still protect them in case of dangerous accident.

As for Dark Magic. I considere "normal" spell like the "Difindo" as a tool, and a Dark Spell like "Sectusempra" as a weapon. Depending of the user imagination, you can find a lot of uses for any spells, but these spells would still have a primary usage, for what they have been created, and you would twist their use to do the rest.

So even if in case of need, you can use the Diffindo to hurt an opponent, it would be like using your table knife to cut someone, the using the Sectusempra for something else than combat would be like cuting your food with a sword.

And for the difficulty of healing Dark Magic, I think that since MAgic is about intent, and these spells' intent was to hurt, there is some magical residues inside the injury stopping all healing tentative.\\
PS : It makes me wonder if the option of amputing the hurt member and growing it back from the new injury would make it possible to bypass the magical scarring.
