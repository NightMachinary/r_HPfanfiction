Hi there. I recently read a story (it wasn't finished unfortunately) where Harry found a piece of waste ground near Privet Drive and used it to grow food, then he started earning money doing jobs for the neighbours. I'd be interested to read any other stories where Harry is able to become some kind of entrepreneur to help himself out like that, even in a small way. Not looking for slash fics. Thanks for any suggestions.


** Could you provide a link to that story, please?

  What if instead of locking Harry in his cupboard whenever they didn't want to look at him, the Dursley's had locked him out of the house instead? Maybe this. Self-Sufficient, Independent!Harry.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's destiny has taken a sharp turn from what was intended. At age seven, he figures out that he can make things happen at will, like magic. He uses this ability to counter his bullying cousin, Dudley, and form a gang of his own. Harry's gang is composed entirely of female members -- except of course for Harry himself. They band together to protect themselves from the Dursley gang, and form a life-long friendship that is almost like a family. When he received his Hogwarts letter, Harry James Potter is a strong, confident young man. A young man who takes his duty to protect his girls very seriously. Lucky for him, one of his girls has a cousin visiting at the time he receives his letter, and that cousin just happens to be a fifth year witch. This fic is taken over from szordara and his fic Harry Potter and the Harem of Honeys with his permission!
