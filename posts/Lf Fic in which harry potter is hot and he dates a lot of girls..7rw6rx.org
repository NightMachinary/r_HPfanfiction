My title pretty much sums up what I want Other requirements:1) No dumbles and weasely bashing 2)No love potion shit 3)No polygamy 4)harry ends up with one girl at last


** What's "lots of girls"? I've gotten complaints about Harry being a manwhore since he's dating the third girl in three years in my current story. Otherwise fits your request (no Weasley/Dumbledore bashing, no love potions, no polygamy, and will end up with one girl at the end).

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's world is flipped upside down when he is unexpectedly visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare species of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of Harry's problems when he discovers just how drastically his life is about to change. How will our young hero deal with an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive?! Join Harry on an epic tale of love, lust, and innocence, as he battles against much more than just dark wizards and learns just how strong bonds can be.

** To clarify, you mean he doesn't date all of them simultaneously, but rather ends each relationship before moving on to the next?
