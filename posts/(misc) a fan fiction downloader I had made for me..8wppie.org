Hello.

I'm completely blind. I was talking to a guy called Frederik and he asked me how he could help blind people. I told him about fanfiction.net and how I enjoyed fan fiction.

He said it was completely find to give the link to who ever I'd like so here it is: [[https://github.com/woafu/FanfictionDownloader]]

No, you don't have to be blind to use this program.

It can only make plain text files for now, (it's easier to read with a screen reader) but if you add requests, he should get to them when he has time.

It's a very simple program, you download it, put it where you want the file/folder to appear, find the fanfiction.net link you want to download, open the program, paste the link and press enter.


** Wow. This is amazing, thank you for sharing!

I don't think you need any special software, normal screenreaders for blind people should be able to read any of those webs, and most ereaders this days come with TTS.

Also, fanfiction.net has an android app with download support and TTS.

*** Thanks. I use a screen reader called NVDA on my laptop. The reason I have the fan fiction downloader is so that I can download fan fiction for reading when the internet is down or I feel like reading offline.
