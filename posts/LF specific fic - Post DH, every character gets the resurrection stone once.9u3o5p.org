Hello everyone,

I am looking for a specific fic I read a while ago, but can't seem to find.

Here's what I remember:

- post Deathly Hallows
- The story had multiple fairly short chaptercs, like a collection of one-shots with the same premise
- The premise was that most characters got to have the resurrection stone once and than gave it to someone else.
- I think Percy chose to talk to Penelope, and she had had a miscarriage at some point.

Thanks in advance!


** This sounds amazing. Hopefully someone knows & shares it!

** Oh man, I recall reading a similar fic, but I can't seem to dig it up either. Is this the fic where while sitting in his bedroom, George (predictably) brings back Fred and wants him to stick around, but Fred gets sadder and sadder and implores George to let him go and to go live his life to the fullest -- or something along those lines? I also think it had a rather succinct/vague summary and ~8-9 chapters, but I'm not 100% sure.

** I am sure I read this a really long time ago so it does exist somewhere.

** This is a story with a pretty similar idea. I'll look for the specific one soon, but this is a pretty good read.
