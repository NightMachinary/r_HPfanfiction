It has Neville being the enemy in the Wizengamot defending pureblood tradition against Harry and Hermione.

If this is familiar to anyone I would appreciate the help.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
