** I can't tell if you're just complaining or actually want a solution to this - I can't comment on the former, but I can provide a couple possible solutions to the latter.

If you want to filter out things, you can do it with the Reddit Enhancement Suite.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/30apcr/is_there_a_way_to_filter_out_posts_on_all_of/]]

I know on search engines if you type any search terms you want excluding with a dash before (eg. "-haphne") then it'll remove those results, but I don't know if that works on reddit.
