Examples of what I mean.

Harry and Ron are in their dormitory talking about Quidditch. On the other side of the room Dean is telling Seamus about his progress tracking down the cabal of assassins that murdered his uncle while Seamus is looking forward to an upcoming bank heist he is helping his father plan.

Hermione is in Ancient Runes and is quietly taking notes . On the other side of the room Padma Patil receives a message on a hi-tech communicator and rushes off to change into her superhero persona Birdgirl in order to save London from a supervillain. Michael Corner is also in the room taking notes to help him on his next tomb raiding excursion.

Justin FF's family is funding space hotels and Justin himself is training to become an astronaut. Susan Bones alternates between supporting him and dealing with the fact she is possessed by a different spirit every Thursday.

Vincent Crabbe is actually a renowned masked wrestler who has been challenged by an unethical newcomer while Tracey Davies is a plucky reporter for the school paper who always finds herself in danger and having to be saved by one of her classmates

And so on and so forth

I think it could be a fun fic

** Tbh I would read a whole fic of just Padma Patil as Birdgirl in the background secretly influencing all the canon events, using her Ravenclaw qualities & some cracky bird-based magics to nudge everything just into place.

****** It's not a real fic. It is just the acronym of everything that Rabbitshade said.
