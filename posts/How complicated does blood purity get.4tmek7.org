In thinking about it today I've decided a discussion is best. How complicated does blood purity get?

For example, we know the Weasleys are pure blooded, Hermione is a muggle born, and Dean is a half blood, but what about Harry? I've always imagined him pureblood, his parents were both magical.

Is it as simple as magical+magical= pureblood, magical+muggle= halfblood, muggle+muggle= muggleborn? If not, when does it end. Will a halfblood and a pureblood make a 3/4 blood? Or, is halfblood just applied to anyone who has any direct lineage to a muggle or muggle born witch/wizard?

EDIT: The general consensus appears to be that it generally goes by grandparents BUT that opinion on the fact would change from magical person to magical person. Blood purists would be extremely specific, and muggleborns/witches & wizards who don't care probably wouldn't ever bother to sit down and figure it out. Thanks everyone!


** Blood purity appears to go by grandparents, not parents, since Harry is considered to to be a half-blood, despite having two magical parents. His mother had two muggle parents, and father had two magical parents, so his grandparents make him a half-blood.

*** I agree. I'm pretty sure I've read somewhere that Rowling based it on the Nuremberg's laws. The term for a half-blood in Nazi Germany is a 'Mischling', but there are two categories. Mischling of the first degree had two Jewish grandparents, Mischling of the second degree had only one. If you had three or four Jewish grandparents, you were a Jew. Having none, you were a "pureblood German"

Basically, I think that as long as you have one Muggle grandparent, you would still be a Half-blood. James, Albus and Rose are purebloods, Huge and Rose aren't

**** There are definite and I'm pretty sure deliberate parallels with the Nuremberg Laws, but I didn't realize the originals were that complex. There would need to be some differences. First, there is no equivalent of "muggle-born" under the Nuremberg Laws. Second, if we carry the chart over exactly, then a witch or wizard with one magical parent and one magical grandparent would still be considered a muggle-born.

I've seen arguments that only witches and wizards with no muggle /or muggle-born/ grandparents are purebloods, since elite purebloods consider muggles and "mudbloods" to be basically the same, but I don't think I buy it. That's closer to the One Drop Rule, and while the Malfoys might hold with it, I suspect most wizards don't.

**** Pretty much. And for those who want more, there's the status as one of the “sacred twenty-eight” for those twenty-eight families who (as far as they remember) never had anything but pure-blooded people. Although it's just more of bigots being bigots.

That said, any individual person is of course free to have their own definition. But, you know, at the same time the other person is (sorta) free to hex them if they are being too obnoxious.

** I think it's just a matter of perspective. For some "purebloods," half-bloods are people with slightly more muggle blood than they themselves have. A muggleborn great-great-great-great-great-grandmother might disqualify you in the eyes of Mrs. Black, but most people would probably consider you to be close enough to pureblood.

For example, Harry's children have three grandparents from old pureblood families (James, Molly, Arthur) and one muggleborn grandparent (Lily). Some people would say that's enough to consider them pureblood. Others would consider them to be half-bloods, but might consider a hypothetical child of Lily and Scorpius Malfoy to a pureblood. Others would say the entire family line was ruined by Lily Evans.

Names matter as much if not more than actual lineage, since it's not like people show up at Hogwarts with their grandparent's blood status written on their foreheads. If you know the Abbotts are a well-known wizarding family and you meet someone named Hannah Abbott, you're going to assume she's pureblood. But for all you know, she could have a muggleborn/muggle mother. On the other hand, someone like Tom Riddle might be initially assumed to be a muggleborn simply because no one recognized his muggle father's surname, even if his mother was a Gaunt.

** The children of muggleborn also count as halfbloods. When the change from halfblooded line to pureblooded line occurs, I do not know. Its probably at the same time as your estate becomes interesting for the elite to do business with.

For all we know, it could just be that you need to be properly distanced from the muggle world to be considered pureblooded, hence why only the children of the halfblood may be considered pureblood.

It could also be the case that once a muggleborn or muggle joins the line, the entire line will stay halfblooded forever (or until the generation with the "dirty blood" is no longer remembered).

There is a lot blank space here, ready to be filled. It can be easy by making it dependent on the grandparents and nothing else, or it can be difficult and be entirely dependent on social and cultural mannerisms, rituals and habits.

The definition of "purity" is completely up to the racist to decide, making it almost impossible to stop its use as a belief.

*** This. I also feel it depends on perspective. For example, Harry's kids. Most of polite society would consider them Purebloods of the Potter & Weasley lines. But some of the more bigoted Purebloods would probably still consider them tainted by the blood of their muggle born grandmother.

** I reckon it would depend on the character answering your question.

For extreme blood purists, like Blacks or Malfoys, tapistry-keeping families with certified pedigree would be true purebloods generally worthy of being fraternised and married with. Poor purebloods, halfbloods, and the like would be acceptable contacts if it was made obvious that they knew their place and were “sufficiently assimilated” (generally demonstrated through their knowledge of traditions and “wizarding culture“). Mudbloods would be ostracised or ignored. Political and magical power a person or family currently wielded would also affect to a certain degree their hight on the totem pole. Aside from that, politicking would also decide how “pure” someone's blood got when they married into a pureblood family or out of it.

For half-bloods who in some manner depend on blood purists, all the above would be nominally true as well, though they wouldn't have the same fanaticism about it (e.g. hidden relations and business with halfbloods and muggleborns).

For half-bloods who try to live on their own --- and “purebloods” who just don't give a shit (e.g. Weasleys) --- blood purists' stance would matter if for some reason they needed to be aware about it (e.g. they held governmental positions that necessitated frequent contacts with blood purists). Otherwise they would be just peripherally aware about it and act on their own discretion.

For muggleborns --- and representatives of other categories that have burned their bridges with pureblood agenda (S. Black, the Tonks, etc) --- the whole blood purity business would generally stink of social stratification ripe with “human right” abuse potential.

For low-tier dark lord minions, anything their lord said would generally be accepted as truth without thinking much about it.

For higher-tiers and the inner circle, some double-thinking might've been necessary.

** I always saw it as more of a political thing than most of the commenters here do. Especially since as far as we know, there is not an actual difference between magical and non-magical blood. It's more of a metaphor for your family's status. I imagine if your family was around when blood purity became a recognized concept (as it's a pretty baseless theory that has been proven in the series to have no impact on magical ability), your family would be considered a pureblood family. Everyone after that would be considered a newcomer and wouldn't have the same social status as the existing families.

** As others have said, its based upon generations. So a pure blood marriage would be 2 magicals without the corruption of a muggle born or muggle in their blood going back a certain number of generations. This is part of why purebloods are a much smaller number and suffer from inbreeding. The reality of finding a mostly or completely non related pureblood to marry as a pureblood yourself is tough.

Half blood is likely a little more relaxed as muggle blood or muggle born blood can be introduced at any time and it does not affect the bloodline as long as one of them is magical back a certain number of generations on one side or the other.

However its important to realize that these are political definitions when it comes to "qualifying" as a particular type of blood.

For example... Harry is not actually a half blood (both his parents are magicals so hes pure blooded), but based upon the potter history, and the fact that Lily was muggleborn, hes still going to be considered a half blood in the magical world.

However he married Ginny (a pureblood), and his dad was not muggle born, so given a few generations if their children did not marry outside of established purebloods, the potter line would become purebloods as well.

** One way to measure it: in your idealized family tree, how many generations do you have to go back on average to get to a muggleborn? (Idealized family tree because it assumes no overlap among mages -- your mother and father aren't sixth cousins or anything.) So N-- Tonks is a child of Andromeda Black, with an average of (we'll say) 12 generations, and Ted Tonks, with an average of 0 generations; so N-- Tonks gets a score of 7.

This is not the system in use because N-- Tonks is considered to have garbage status, whereas someone who was seven generations removed from muggleborns would be acceptable to high society.

Another metric is the minimum number of generations instead of the average. N-- Tonks would have the same status as, oh, a child of Hermione Granger and Seamus Finnegan. That also doesn't seem quite right.

Still another way to look at it is: assume that magical ability is a dominant single-gene trait. Assume that muggleborns are all heterozygous. What is the probability that you are homozygous? That is what your purity is based on. Every time you produce a squib, that knocks you back to mudblood rank, though -- bearing a squib is shameful, but not quite /that/ shameful.

I think the actual system is far less formal, far harder to specify. (Though it could be amusing for Nott or Zabini to keep a running tally of everyone in Slytherin, both their lineage points and the points they get from actions.) It's got aspects of all three formal measures that I suggested, plus the notion of blood traitors who lose status because of their actions.

** I made [[http://imgur.com/7xsifxt][this]] a while ago when I asked myself this question (after seeing [[/u/rimasshai]] picture I feel a little dirty.)

We know Harry and Voldemort were 'halfbloods' (figures 18 for Harry, 9 for LV). Hermione is a muggleborn (figure 1), and Draco a pureblood (figure 21). I think most would agree that having 5 or 6 magical parents/grandparents would make you a pureblood, 3 or 4 a half blood and 0 a muggleborn. But what about those with 1 or 2? While figure 16 is more likely to be a halfblood, what would you call figure 2? With only one magical grandparent I wouldn't call them a halfblood. But are they a muggleborn? What about figure 6 (the magical child of two squibs)? Is that a halfblood or a pureblood? Also, what is the difference between a squib and a muggle? If figure 7's child was not magical, would that be a muggle or a squib? What about a non magical child in figure 16?

Eventually I just gave up and decided that it was a cultural thing rather then an actual definition.

** I always looked at it as you were a pure blood if you had no muggles anywhere in the gleaming tree

If a half blood has children with a pureblood they would still be half Blood as as they have muggle blood. If their children then had children with pureblood a I would still class them as half bloods
