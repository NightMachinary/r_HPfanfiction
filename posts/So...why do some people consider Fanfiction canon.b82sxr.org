So While I was looking for new fics to read I stumbled upon a review for a story where someone says "In Faery Heroes it is proven that Dumbledore set up the Potters to be murdered by Tom." and i'm just thinking...what mental gymnastics do you have to put yourself through to think that and why are you taking something a fanfiction author wrote as gospel?


** It's confirmation bias. For example: the person who wrote that review you mentioned has it in their head that Dumbledore wanted to get the Potters killed, therefore any story that uses that idea as a plot point will resonate with them, regardless of whether or not it's actually congruent to canon.

** I think fandom, especially the fanfiction-writing portion of it, has always had a sort of push-pull relationship with canon. There's a quote about it that I can't find right now, but basically it argued that people are most likely to write fic when they liked the source material, but were also left wanting by it in some way, so the root of "fanon can do this better" has always been there. More recently, I think the mainstream-ization of fandom, and the increased availability of writers on social media, has really encouraged the development of an extreme "death of the author" mentality, where fans feel like they have just as much ownership of the material as its creator. And for HP in particular, because it's an older fandom I think a lot of people have forgotten various parts of the books, plus there's definitely an aspect of "fuck JKR" these days.

However, as someone who adamantly doesn't subscribe to "death of the author" and enjoys canon-compliant fic, I find this trend supremely irritating.

#+end_quote

Because sometimes the author herself said it was gospel, as in the case of The Cursed Child.

But in your example, if they're taking plot points or ideas from other authors to use in their own stories, or headcanons, that's called /fanon/, not canon. Canon is The Cursed Child. Fanon is the existence of Ancient and Noble lordships or Dan and Emma Granger. Some people do it because they find it more interesting than canon, or fills in a gap that canon left blank, like how the Trace works or what Hermione's parents' names are. It's not official, even if it shows up many of the most popular and well-read fanfics, and has entered mass-consciousness.

​

#+begin_quote
  In the early 1930s, a ‘Pure-Blood Directory' was published anonymously in Britain, which listed the twenty-eight truly pure-blood families, as judged by the unknown authority who had written the book***, with ‘the aim of helping such families maintain the purity of their bloodlines'. The so-called ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight' comprised the families of:

  Abbott

  Avery

  Black

  Bulstrode

  Burke

  Carrow

  Crouch

  Fawley

  Flint

  Gaunt

  Greengrass

  Lestrange

  Longbottom

  Macmillan

  Malfoy

  Nott

  Ollivander

  Parkinson

  Prewett

  Rosier

  Rowle

  Selwyn

  Shacklebolt

  Shafiq

  Slughorn

  Travers

  Weasley

  Yaxley

  A minority of these families publicly deplored their inclusion on the list, declaring that their ancestors certainly included Muggles, a fact of which they were not ashamed. Most vocally indignant was the numerous Weasley family, which, in spite of its connections with almost every old wizarding family in Britain, was proud of its ancestral ties to many interesting Muggles. Their protests earned these families the opprobrium of advocates of the pure-blood doctrine, and the epithet ‘blood traitor'. Meanwhile, a larger number of families were protesting that they were not on the pure-blood list.

So Draco would most likely deny that the malfoys have anything to do with lordships and would deny that any Malfoy ever would kneel before some muggle king or queen.

*** Agree with pretty much everything, except maybe the Trace bit. Because while we still don't know some details (like how the Trace is put on the Wizard, or even where on him), we know pretty well how it works.

The Trace act like a magic detector around a wizard, depending on where the spell is detected, actions will be taken or not. Of course, while Dumbledore said this in book 6 (with Dumbledore explaining how Tom Riddle framed his uncle for the murder of his familly), it doesn't explain some things:\\
-For example in book 2, Dobby using a spell in Privet Drive is enough to frame Harry, yet in Book 5, both Tonk and Mad Eye used spell there and didn't trigger any alert.

So yeah we may have a bad explanation for the Trace but still an explanation.

** I've had one person argue their opinion of Dumbledore by quoting fanfiction. It was really weird, I'd never seen it before. But luckily that was only once - but I do sometimes see people take a milder stance essentially saying that since so many fanfic authors have X interpretation of Dumbledore, then that interpretation /must/ be right, because it's /unthinkable/ to think so many authors got it wrong (which in itself is a disservice to the authors, because authors can write whatever they want, it doesn't mean they think that's how canon /is/. Even in my most canon-compliant fics, I don't actually imagine that that's how it /actually/ happened, I just enjoy thinking it did for a short while).

So, yeah, I don't think it's good logic, but I also understand how it happens. We trust the authors and/or other fans' opinions and therefore adopt their viewpoints without doing our own research. I'd like to blame fans, but I can't really. It takes a lot of time and effort to do the research onesself, and we can't all be experts at everything. However, what you're talking about is a step further, that a fan thinks a fanfiction "proved" something about canon. I think it is likely that this fan already disliked Dumbledore and because they have not been formally taught the various ways of interpreting a text, they feel that because the fanfic seems to make sense in the moment they found confusing in the original books, then it must be answering this question. Instead of using the books themselves, I think they simply trust the author of the fanfic. Perhaps the fanfic was cleverly written and made the reader feel like they'd been brought in on a secret?

An adjacent question is - why do some fans continue to think the most important pieces of the plot were left out of the books? I feel like it's very common for fans to ramble away with these elaborate theories. But the books are complete. Regardless of what happened with canon years after (the play, Pottermore, the movies, etc), the original seven books were a story unit and are, for purposes of interpreting it and its characters, complete. What's the deal with thinking plot-altering twists are still left hidden fourteen layers beneath the surface? Dumbledore being /so/ malicious as to plan Harry's parents' death not only contradicts Dumbledore's viewpoint on prophecies and his direct dialogue about the event, but it also changes the entire context of his relationship with Harry and thus the backbone of the story itself. It makes no sense for an author to leave out such an earth-shattering theme-and-plot-significant revelation.

Now, if one /wants/ to interpret the books that way and they are comfortable that the support is flimsy, that's their call. I do that all the time with songs when I misunderstand the lyrics - I tend to prefer my version, but I never think it's secretly the more canonical version just because I identify more with it.

** There is canon -- things in the official continuity, originating with the author(s) themselves (in this case JKR). Everything written in the official HP books, alongside everything that the author says that they consider part of the universe, is canon. It's supposed to be the golden standard, the "master reality", with fanfiction taking it and playing around with.

Then there is fanon -- which, technically speaking, is everything else, but is generally considered to mean common concepts in fanfics that /doesn't/ originate from official sources. A simple example is Tempus, a fanon spell to display current time of day. This spell didn't originate in canon by JKR, but is such a common spell in fanfics that it has become part of general fanon.

Some things become so prevalent in fanfics that people may end up mistakenly believing it to be part of canon, when it isn't (for example, the terms "Malfoy Manor", or "wards" to refer to protective enchantments). This is almost always a mistake -- people who intentionally consider things from fanfics as /canon/ are being silly. The examples I gave above (Malfoy Manor and wards) are so common in fanfics that /not/ using them when referring to the Malfoy estate or protective enchantments, might confuse people to the point that you probably should use them anyway when applicable, but they /aren't canon terms/. There are a few (very few) exceptions -- something that originated in fanon might end up acknowledged by the authors and end up part of canon. For example, the term Marauders to represent Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs (Remus, Peter, Sirius, James), originated in fanon (inspired from the "Marauders Map"). JKR later on used the term herself to refer to the group, effectively making it canon.

** Part of it, I think, is that certain tropes get repeated so often in fanfiction that you start to forget what canon is and believe they're true. A lot of it is mostly harmless, but the worst is definitely when Dumbledore gets involved. I've definitely had reviewers talking about Dumbledore sealing the Potters' will and/or being Harry's "magical guardian" and/or knowing from the start that Harry "must" die, all as if they are canon. And these also happen to be the most common tropes in Dumbledore-bashing fics, so if you read them enough without having a good grip on canon, you might lose track.

Dumbledore almost certainly /wasn't/ expecting the final battle to happen at Hogwarts, but it makes the most sense in that context.

Meanwhile, we have Dumbledore's line in Book 6: "Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort split his soul." That implies that a horcrux was only a theory of his until he saw the diary, and presumably only one of several possible ways to cheat death. At the very least, he never considered multiple horcruxes until that point.
