I'm looking for a fanfiction, preferably post-hogwarts, where Hermione travels alone in time. Depressed or with PTSD, and more accurate that just sad or only affecting her a bit.


** Sin & Vice on ffn is the closest I can think of. Dumbledore sends Hermione back multiple times so she can train to be a healer for the Order.
