Memories change, details are forgotten. So pensieves are enchanted not to show what you remember, but what actually happened. Some consider these enchantments to be the pinnacle of divination. It would take a master of both memory charms and anti-scrying spells to make a believable fake memory.

Edit: This is less of a prompt and more of ‚Äòmy new head canon that I came up with after thinking about why memories are viewed in third-person' that I wanted to share and would like to see integrated into a story.


** A weird thing is that pensieves show more than you actually saw. I mean, Harry can see the back of Dumbledore's head from a Dumbledore memory.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I had that subverted in one story - the inventors claimed that, but were proven wrong later when no Divination spells could be found on it.

*** I checked the wiki before posting this and it said nothing about divination, but if she said that in an interview or tweet or something that's cool.

**** I think it was in an interview I don't remember which one but pencives don't really have to do with divination per se it's different. Edited for spelling.
