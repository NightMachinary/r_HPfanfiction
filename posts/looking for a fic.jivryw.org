:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
i remember this one fic i read forever ago it was a Harry stays at Hermiones house fic but she has this little sister who was absolutely adorable. the only other details i can remember is that Harry and Hermione started dating. they had a pool(swimming) room. the little sister was rather smart. and it was a relatively short story, less that 20 chapters if i remember right

any help would be greatly appreciated
