** Too linear, not creative, choices don't matter....

I could go on a long rant about how disappointed I was in the overall quality but I'll spare you. The short answer is no, I will not.

** I'd probably read a fic about Jacob and the Vaults but the other characters wouldn't fit in too much since they were all in Tonks year and graduated before the golden trio started.

** Looking at the trailer, they've clearly just gamified the Movie universe. For instance, they use [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/1/1c/Filius_Flitwick_battle.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/317?cb=20121103080247][wrong]] version of [[https://images.ctfassets.net/bxd3o8b291gf/ShsuS7mzmw62IskMKQE0k/ef3f471a769b18a19406ef4d5ebd5e4d/FiliusFlitwick_WB_F1_FlitwickStugglingToCarryBooks_Promo_080615_Port.jpg?w=455&h=455&fit=thumb&f=top&q=85][Professor Flitwick]].

For those who don't know, Flitwick didn't have a role in the 3rd film but they still offered Warwick Davis a cameo role as the conductor. Then because the films were a beurcractic cluterfuck, they simply used the Conductor make up for Phillius for the next film.

So no. I don't like the films and I don't think the people at Warner Bros. will treat the IP with any respect and I think even JK doesn't really about the Harry era of Hogwarts anymore if Cursed Child is anything to go by.

*** I wouldn't say it's a "wrong" version. Yes, there was a bit of confusion and /PoA/'s Conductor wasn't meant to be Flitwick; but as I recall, from the next movie onwards, it wasn't a "bureaucratic clusterfuck", it was just that the director decided they actually liked the Conductor's look better for Flitwick than the one they'd come up with for the first two films. It was a retcon, not a mistake. And at the end of the day it doesn't actually contradict the book --- indeed, Rowling said that she thought the first two movies' version of Flitwick looked too "supernatural" and, while too young, the Conductor is arguably closer to her original intent of what Flitwick should look like.

*** I always assumed Flitwick ran the choir club for fun. It doesn't seem out of character for him.
