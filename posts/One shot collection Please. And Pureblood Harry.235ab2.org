** Are you referring to this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7231737/1/Chancing-Chaos][Chancing Chaos]]?

A few of the more popular writers have one-shot collections. Although most of the one-shots are independent of each other.

Rorschach's Blot's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/1/Odd-Ideas][Odd Ideas]]

Nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4746187/1/What-a-Bunch-of-Nonjon][What a Bunch of Nonjon]]

Mad Mad Reviewer's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7284194/1/The-Terrible-Ideas-Bin][Terrible Ideas Bin]]

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/1/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Adventures in Child Care and Other One Shots]]

I would also recommend the [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]] By Jeconais.

**** Not specifically. Now having looked more closely at the Chancing Chaos, I think the Matryoshka Vignettes are the closest to what the OP is looking for. It also has two one-shots with some of the best Luna I've read.

Otherwise, I like a fair number of Rorschacht Blot's Odd Ideas. HP raised by Moody. HP in Africa. Of course, his stuff is mostly crack, so if you don't like that ...

Mad Mad Reviewer's "Monsterous" is probably my favorite Creature!Harry. Unfortunately, the story isn't actually complete.

** Not a one shot, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8121773/1/Of-Power-and-Prestige][Of Power and Prestige]] is a piece by the same author, co-written by another, as Chancing Chaos. Features a FemHarry/LV pairing, and is most definitely a pureblood fic. I really enjoyed it. It gave a pretty big Pride and Prejudice vibe off.
