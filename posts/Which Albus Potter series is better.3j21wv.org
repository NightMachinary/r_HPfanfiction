** Wow, this is crazy, I'm actually the author of that second series XD

Just discovered this subreddit a week or so ago, did not expect to see myself show up!

Anyway, I've never read NoahPhantom's series, though I have a few readers that I've kept in contact with who have told me that it's terrific.

As for mine, well, of course I enjoy what I write, but I will be the first to admit that the first book is very weak. It was written while I was in High School and back when I didn't think that I would be making an entire series. From what I've gathered from my readers, however, books 3-7 are worth the price of the admission =D

Welcome to next-gen reading!

**** Well I never want to alter the content, because the books do have continuity to them, but in terms of technical edits, the timing just hasn't been right. I went on a huge hiatus between 6 and 7 while I was dealing with college, and am actually on the cusp of graduating now, so if anything, it would have to be after then. One thing though, is that years ago the first 6 got converted to ebooks and passed around on torrent sites, which I'm obviously fine with, but I don't want different versions floating around and confusing people until I get the chance to sort everything out properly.

The first three actually did have a handful of minor edits done to them (grammatically) a few years back, but it was nothing extensive.

** Mm, I've read part of the first. There's some enjoyable tidbits in it (the author has a knack for naming things. There's a broom called a "Soundsplitter" which is just a lovely name), but the overall plot and characters are poorly done. It gets very over the top, and doesn't really deliver on closing up plot threads. Characterization is all over the place, and a large cast is introduced without much development. It also had very, very poorly done romance. I wouldn't recommend it.

The second series I intended to start, but never got around to it. I've heard better things about that one, though.

*** How far into the first did you get?

I personally enjoyed it. It does get better as you continue.

**** I got about midway through book five and quit. I actually thought it got worse, enjoyment wise. There's a lot of plot threads I'm sure were revisited in due time, but the reveals were never very satisfying in the individual books. I do think there was a lot of potential, but a lot of the times how it was written was overly focused on this main plot with the individual book plots as a side note.

I am also much more of a character driven reader than a plot driven one, which may have something to do with it. Particularly the characterization of female characters bothered me (with the "everyone has a crush on Al" thing going on for a while), so I wasn't attached enough to continue.

I'm glad you enjoyed it, though. Different strokes for different folks and all.

** I think a better question might be which one is less worse.

I've read through all of the first and attempted to struggle my way through the second.

Noahphantom's suffers heavily relying on OCs, new parts of the setting, etc. This in itself wouldn't be much of a problem if those new additions didn't mostly suck. There's the double-wand wielding, for instance. The new cast is underdeveloped and largely interchangeable for large parts of the story. The escalation is batshit, too. It starts off rather light, with Albus' biggest problem being if he gets sorted into Slytherin or not, but then quickly spirals into world-saving, attacks on military bases, etc. The twist in the sixth book is rather bullshit, too. I mean, that came out of nowhere and it relied again on the OC.

The second, meanwhile, could have a much better plot or characterization or whatever. I wouldn't know; I've never managed to get past the first chapter, which is very sloppily written. For instance, the author doesn't seem to have the basics of punctuation down with regards to speech. There's also overuse of ..., IIRC.

**** I really hope you are still writing/taking writing classes/working on your craft! You have a real way with characters and story-telling. I was really impressed that you didn't fall into the trap of the kids are mini-mes, or the kids are perfect in every regard, and that you gave them all their own voices. Seriously impressive, particularly given your age. The technical side of your writing does needs some finishing though (and seriously, that's the easiest part!)

***** Thank you so much! And yes, I definitely am still doing all of the above, though it's in a more limited scope. I had never actually taken a writing class before at the time that the series was finished (aside from normal English classes) but now that I'm in my last year of school and most of the classes for my major are out of the way, I'm allocating my electives towards writing classes with workshops, prompts, etc. I'm hoping that once I leave school and fall into a more regular pattern of living, I'll be able to get to work on some original stuff in my free time (I'm actually roughly two books into an original fantasy trilogy now, though it's on hiatus due to school).

Thanks again for reading, and the encouragement =D

** I've read the first 6 books of the first one, I'd really recommend it if you want a complex plot that slowly wraps up perfectly towards the end. Of course I'm only 6 books in but already pieces are starting to fall into place and if you think about it enough you can work out some theories for how it's going to go.
