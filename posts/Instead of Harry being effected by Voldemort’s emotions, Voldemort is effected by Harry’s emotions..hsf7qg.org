Between all the soul splitting and resurrection rituals Voldemort's emotions are severely dampened. Suddenly he feels more joy in one moment than he's felt in the last few decades. Harry discovered the treacle tart being served for dessert that evening.


** I can picture it now. Harry's getting spicy with Ginny and Voldemort's just sitting in a meeting wondering when he became attracted to Mulciber.

** I might justwrite a crack fic.

Harry having his temper tantrum at the beginning of ootp causes Voldemort to rage against a random death eater in the exact same way. After beeing dismissed, Lucius Malfoy comments to Snape that their Lord seemed even more unhinged than usual.

After his plot to get the prophesy from the ministry failed and his return is exposed, pettigrew finds Voldemort throwing things in his office and screaming. "I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!" Wormtail slowly backs out if the office, turns around and walks away muttering about "crazy dark lords taking things too far".

After Snape gets a strange sense of déjà vu when "the Potter brat" throws a tantrum, he finally takes teaching Oclumency seriously. Because clearly, the boy is being influenced by the dark lord.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

** Nothing in my folders go quite in that direction enough for my satisfaction, but that sounds fantastic.

Let's give this man crushing despair with a side dish of survivor's guilt.

He just wants to punch Draco Malfoy in the face. He doesn't want to crucio him. He just wants to straight up clock him in the jaw.

He feels compassion for the first time in his life and gets violently ill.

He gets the full dose of adrenaline and joy from a successful quidditch match and the cognitive dissonance between that and the similar feelings he gets from cruelty makes him pass out.

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

** I've read a few stories similar to this, although most of them are more in the line of "Harry fantasizing about his female classmates or having actual sex causes Voldemort pain."

The only one I can come up with offhand that's anything like this (other than The Connection Reversed, which has already been mentioned) is linkffn(The Fair by The Blind Dragon).

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.
