I recall Harry being intimidated the day before because he knows there's no stopping the wild hunt once you join it or /you/ become the hunted. It happened in the forbidden forest and they were hunting the spiders. The way I remember it Dumbledore didn't think much of old magic and that it didn't exist/the myths weren't real. Meanwhile, Minerva McGonagall and some other students were awake in the castle at night and she specifically knew what the howls were and was scared. Early the next morning she was outside waiting for Harry after the hunt and he was exhausted.

I've looked for this story on my own multiple times but I've never been able to find it again.

*** This one didn't seem to be it, unfortunately. Though I did notice where I could've mentally confused the two for each other so it's calling into question how accurate the things I'm remembering are. The comment about "Once you join the hunt you can't stop or you become the hunted" didn't show up this Quoth story (Nor the one where Minerva was waiting outside the next day to great him) so I think it's from the one I'm looking for, but... the part about them hunting spiders could absolutely be something I'm misremembering from this Quoth story.

In the one I'm looking for I do clearly remember Minerva being awake and listening to the howling in the fanfic while looking out a window to the forest. The perspective being first person and occurring as events happened not in a retelling afterwords. That and his comment about the hunt might be the only thing I have to go on :(

  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU

** Was that the one where Harry was part-Fae and queen Maeve wanted to make him a part of her court?

*** You might be thinking of linkffn(Grimm: A Fairy's Tale by Krahae), which does have Harry join a hunt but doesn't match the rest of OP's description. Good story though

  Pre-Hogwarts. The stuff of legends, myth and majesty were the realm of the Fey long before wizards named him Boy Who Lived. Maeve of the Unseelie Court has decided to take one of wizarding kind's myths, to shape as her own. Vastly AU.
