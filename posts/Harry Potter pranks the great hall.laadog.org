:END:
So a while ago I read a fanfic where Harry went on an amazing prancing spree. And I can't seem to find it again. One of the pranks was him and I believe some other people taking the tables and lowering them like Japanese styled sitting. On their knees. They also hand a banner or a sign above the head table that says something of the lines of people too old to bend their knees.
