Disclaimer: Sturgeon's Law is heavily in effect for this post. I'm well aware of the 5 (more like 1) percent of fics that avoid this. I wanna rant about the other 95%, goddamnit.

The Stations of the Canon. You know, that thing in fanfics where all the major events from the books (and most of the minor ones too) play out with the exact same results all the time every time. For a better explanation, see [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][warning: TVTropes]].

I'm so, so tired of it. I can stomach it in canon-compliant fics but even fics that are wildly AU still fall victim to it. It's like nothing the characters do even matters, because absolutely nothing can be allowed to change since that would require the author to actually flesh out the plot. I get it, none of us are professional writers (or at least none of us are writing fanfic professionally) and it can be comforting to have a ready-made plot to play with but jfc, what are the odds that the Triwizard Tournament for instance is going to play out the exact same way with the exact same narrative beats in every goddamn universe?

Especially when otherwise changed and/or competent characters suddenly revert or hold on to the Idiot Ball for dear life so that a canon event or narrative beat can be squeezed in. The absolute /worst/ of these are fics that cover OotP (and therefore Umbridge). She invariably stays on as a professor for months or even the full school year, even in fics where Harry is the superpowered omnipresent Potter-Black-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Merlin-Gryffindor-God-of-the-Goblins with influence over 99% of +Magical Britain+ Planet Earth. You'd think he'd get rid of her once she pulls the Blood Quill crap or /stop her from being hired in the first place/, but noooo. Or how the self-insert OC will be content to use their super duper magic powers to prank the whole school or some shit, but will blithely allow plot-relevant things to get at least as bad as they were in canon before stepping up to do anything.

I don't know, man, I don't even know the point of this rant anymore. All I'm saying is, let canon go. Or rather let the canon plot go. Things don't have to happen the same way, even if you're staying with the spirit, setting and characterization of the books. Just, branch out a little. You don't need to hit every single narrative beat. Harry doesn't have to meet Draco or Ron before Hogwarts. Hermione doesn't have to go in the particular bathroom that the troll is going to end up in, or even if she does she doesn't have to be there by dinnertime. Hagrid doesn't have to be their sole, loose-lipped source of info. Quirrell doesn't have to be calmly waiting for Harry in front of the Mirror. Ron doesn't have to break his wand in the Whomping Willow car crash. Ginny doesn't have to be the one who gets the diary. Whoever gets the diary doesn't have to attack Mrs Norris first, or even at all. Hermione doesn't have to pull a cat hair, or target Millicent. There are an abundance of ghosts to petrify, not just Nearly Headless Nick. Harry doesn't have to write in Riddle's diary, or ask it the same questions. And on and on and on and /on/.

I like nothing more than a fic that keeps me on my toes, even (and especially) when it's a canon-compliant fic. But so many fics just have me like "/filler filler filler/ oh obviously that was going to happen right then /filler filler/ this is practically lifted straight from the books /filler filler filler filler/ GASP! Sirius just fell through the Veil? No shit". Though like my username indicates I might just be way more fascinated with the butterfly effect than most.

/rant


** Willing to take the butterfly effect into account is something few writers do because it /multiplies/ the amount of work required for worldbuilding and planning.

For people that write fanfiction for fun, perhaps that's not very appealing. They just want to write; not spend half their time worldbuilding and planning.

It's a shame, because I absolutely love fics that manage to abandon the Stations of Canon, and go after their own thing. linkffn(Emperor; Wit of the Raven) - things like that (but those /start/ very AU).

*** I think you overestimate the amount of worldbuilding needed. I'd say it's far more work trying to conform to canon (especially if you have to look at secondary material like Pottermore and interviews) than creating your own.

**** It takes much less creative effort to look something up on Pottermore or in the books (usually accompanied by copying the entire related passage and tweaking it a little if at all) than it does to come up with consistent worldbuilding that you'll have to justify to your readers. By extension, it's easier to get away with flimsy excuses or none at all for your worldbuilding choices if your plot is hitting all the same beats as canon, because [most] readers do show up to read /Harry Potter/ after all. It ultimately doesn't matter if your world makes no sense at all, the same things are going to happen anyway.

***** Reading this reminded me that when I first started reading ffn, I wanted Canon compliant stories, with either missing moments types or 8th year fics. But over the course of a year of heavy reading, I've transitioned to hating fics that force the stations of Canon, and preferring fics that mostly ignore Canon events.

Its probably since there are only so many rewrites of the same plot you can read, when the only difference is who harry/hermione are kissing and whether the weasleys/Dumbledore are evil

** Yes, this is the single most frustrating thing that I've encountered in the fanfic genre. I know that the authors don't owe anyone anything --- especially when the stories they write are both free and at least partially meant as a means for self-improvement.

And still, I can't even begin to describe how annoying and frustrating what you're ranting about is without using some really mean and derogatory language aimed at such writers.

It especially pisses me off when an author explains their badly designed plot structure by things like “destiny”, “fixed events in time”, or any other similar flavours of bullshit.

** This is part of the reason why all my fics are either wildly AU, or take place post-Hogwarts, or are both. That way I don't feel as constrained by canon and can do (almost) whatever I want.

I think canon rehash is a problem that comes with the nature of writing FF in general: you're taking someone else's world, characters, and plots, and absorbing them into your own. Even if you write a very good fic, it's unlikely that you're becoming a better storyteller, because you're using another person's ideas. And when you're doing that, it's naturally difficult to make an original plot while still satisfying the "pillars" of canon that your readers want: a cohesive world that stays true to canon, all your characters to stay in-character, etc. That's pretty hard to do; I'd say it might even be harder than just going off and creating your own universe and doing your own thing, because now you have to both be original (plotwise) and copy the author (by staying within canon rules, and keeping characters true to their canon selves).

Most fanfic writers aren't that skilled, so they end up employing what I like to call the "Telltale Effect", after Telltale Games' method of storytelling: no matter what little changes they make to the plot or world, it always leads to the same endpoint, which, in broad strokes is what JK gave to us in canon. They do this because it's easy, and it's rewarding: you put in very little work (like have Harry embarrass a professor in class by showing his über-knowledge, when he would just sit and wait for the period to end, like a normal person, in canon), and then a bunch of readers emotionally fellate you for "making Harry a badass" and everyone ignores the fact that everything that happened in canon has happened in this fic.

If it's a diversion used by Quirrel, one that almost got three students killed, what would Dumbledore do in response to avoid more students getting hurt or killed? Especially after Snape fingers the main suspect? How can Voldemort escape notice in the investigation that should follow?

The canon plot is full of such holes.

In one story I had the troll incident - though only as a flashback. But it wasn't done by Quirrel. And it was just about the last canon "plot point" that wasn't derailed.

** I'll bet this bothers you because of how often you've read such stories, over and over, yeah?

Well, not everyone has read as much or for as long as you. Right this minute, there are bunches of people starting fanfiction - as readers or writers - who are in the same place you were a few years ago. Is it somehow "wrong" that they go through the same process you did?

Of course not. That would be silly. Your tastes have evolved and matured; their's have not. That doesn't make your preferences better or their preferences worse.

Some readers will always prefer stories that adhere more closely to canon because it's more familiar to them. They aren't too adventurous. So what?

As for writers, well fanfiction is rather analogous to having training wheels for creative fiction writing. Someone else has done all the hard work of creating characters, backstory, worlds, etc. A new writer can change as little or as much as they want - whatever they feel comfortable with - and thereby get practice in writing without it being quite as hard.

Hey, that's great! I know it helped me. My first story was the first fiction I'd written in decades. It was short, and I didn't change much (not much happened, so not much to change). I did some things wrong and some things right, but I just re-read it and I think it's pretty darn good. The sequel changed more, got different things right and wrong, and is better. The next sequel is even better... and changes more things while keeping others. To reference your rant, there's still a trial, but it goes differently; Umbridge still gets into school, but not as Defense professor and her attempt to use a blood quill... doesn't go quite as planned.

For some people, like you, I might be keeping too much. For others, maybe I'm changing too much. The fact that my main character is a female Harry is a change that some /hate/ - they're more put off by Harry being Jasmine than you likely are by the presence of Umbridge. Neither group is "right" - what's "right" is that I had the freedom to change what I felt comfortable with as I developed my ability to write fiction.

Prefering fanfiction that diverges more rather than less from canon isn't bad. But it's not superior.

****** I'll confirm that those are mine. I also have two HP/Avengers crossovers (a series, I'm early in working on a third) and I've written (yet to publish) an HP crossover with the 1960s Batman TV show. And they're all FemHarry.

I'm pointing that out because it relates to the topic here in an interesting way. A lot of people really seem to dislike changing Harry's gender. "Why bother? What does it accomplish?" they ask. Fair questions. But then again, it's just as fair to ask that about any change.

Why change anything? To create a different story. Because the writer thinks that the differences will be interesting and hopes that others will as well.

Personally, I don't think there are nearly enough strong, leading female characters. Even Hermione tends to be a "support" character, doing research while Harry (and sometimes Ron) are "out there," acting, doing, etc. So I think that the gender change is interesting - one with a lot of potentially interesting consequences, even if some are small. There is also the fact that there are few truly new HP plots, but changing Harry's gender is a big enough change that even an "old" idea has a bit of new life in it (if done well, naturally).

Why do so many writers re-use the "stations of canon"? Why re-use anything? Not many send Harry to an original magical school, and I'll admit that I usually skip those - I prefer the familiarity of Hogwarts. So it's easy to understand if others also prefer the familiarity of other elements of canon.

Clearly, some really, /really/ prefer the familiarity of a male Harry, to the point where a female Harry almost seems offensive to them. I'll admit that I sometimes wonder what lies behind such extreme reactions, but I can't exactly object to someone (writer or reader) preferring something familiar. We all do.

But we all also focus on different things for what we want as "familiar." Preferring the familiarity of Hogwarts isn't better or worse than preferring the familiarity of some major canon events, or something else.

I find it very interesting that we have a person here complaining about a lack of sufficient divergence from canon, but I've seen complaints here about too much divergence from canon as well. How many times have people complained "there is no magical core in canon!" And that's just one example.

Stories are better when they engage our imaginations and make us care about the characters. A story that rehashes a lot of canon won't likely do that for me, but it might for someone else who has read less fanfiction. If so, then it's not a bad story... it's just not one that I much enjoy.

But if your Harry is a Jasmine and yet everything happens the same way it did in the universe where Harry was a Harry then yes, that is objectively bad writing. Sure, it's something we overlook because it's fanfiction, but it's /still/ objectively bad writing (along with writing a story with no conflict whatsoever, unsatisfying MacGuffins, deus/diabolos ex machinas, setting and forgetting Chekhov's guns, and other failings of plot).

**** Except your post wasn't a complaint about /everything/ being the same; rather, it's about all the major events being the same - the "Stations of Canon."

A person who changes absolutely nothing, not even dialogue, isn't actually writing that much themselves. It's less creative and original, and I wouldn't likely bother reading very far in such a story. However, I'm sure that a person with less experience writing (I have written a tremendous amount of nonfiction) might need a lot more in the way of training wheels. So while I might not think much of such a story, I can easily understand the need to start out that way.

And that's not even what I had in mind with my pervious post - I was simply referring to someone who hits the main "stations of canon" - troll in the bathroom, blood quills, etc. These are the events that shift the canon plot into one direction or another. Creating such big events isn't easy for new writers. Creating a new plotline that takes new major events into account is harder. So, I hae quite a lot of tolerance for writers who feel a need to depend on them when learning how to write. And I can understand some readers preferring their familiarity.

The fact that you've grown past reading such stories is great. Good for you. Others haven't, and I won't look down on them.

And as a relatively new writer (for fiction), I definitely won't look down on someone who still depends on such crutches or training wheels. Maybe you don't, but others do. The fact that they are trying is great, and I wish them the best of luck.

And yet that is what many fanfiction authors do. They may throw in a new scene, or add a new interaction, or a (/shudder/) shopping trip to Diagon Alley, but when they reach a Station it's practically a guarantee that the characters involved will say and do the same thing no matter what has been changed about the story.

And not all training wheels are made equal. Not all training wheels are helpful in learning a skill, and some actively hinder it. This is one such.

I mean, it's probably fine if you just want to write fanfiction and fanfiction only, but if you claim to be using it to grow as a[n original] writer then explicitly engaging in plot fails is not a crutch so much as it is a stumbling block.

It's called "shifting the goalposts." It's unhelpful to change the nature of your complaint to something more easily defensible as soon as the original, less defensible complaint is challenged. If you find yourself unable to properly defend the original complaint, it's better to say so then modify your position.

Since I'm sure you aren't doing that deliberately, I'll just ignore the modified complaint and stick to the original.

#+begin_quote
  And yet that is what many fanfiction authors do.
#+end_quote

Oh? And don't you mean 95%, since, you know, that was what your original complaint was?

While I'm sure it's done by some, I haven't seen it being done by as many as you complain about. Surely it couldn't be the case that other people's preferences upset you so much that you're magnifying the issue.

#+begin_quote
  And not all training wheels are made equal.
#+end_quote

True. And is the problem as great as you make it? I, personally, haven't spent any time studying the issue to determine if those new writers who do this turn out to learn less and write more poorly over time - in other words, fail to improve. You have, right? I mean, you're not just pulling this claim out of your nether regions? I mean you have /evidence/, and not just a vague guess based on your own sense of outrage that others aren't writing things that you want to read?

Somehow, I doubt it.

I get it, you aren't entertained by a story that sticks more rather than less to "stations of canon."

Others seem to be. So what?

Lots of things don't entertain me, but I don't complain about that. I don't complain that others spend their time creating things that they like instead of things that I like, so I'm honestly confused about why you would.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, it's probably fine if you just want to write fanfiction and fanfiction only
#+end_quote

I'll bet there are quite a few people like that. Doesn't change the fact that sticking more rather than less closely to "stages of canon" may help them focus on and improve other aspects of their writing, regardless of whether they go on to anything else. And if they enjoy what they are writing, what does it matter if you aren't entertained by it?

Your rant is all about you - what you like, what you can stomach, etc. If actually does matter to you whether others are growing and improving as writers, spend more time helping them by showing them how they can move past canon. I'm sure some will appreciate it.

And if it's simply a matter of you not liking what others are writing, go write your own. That's what I did, and I'm better off for it.

#+end_quote

I did. The first time. That was when you shifted the goalposts to complain about something more extreme. First you complain about repeating major canon plot points, then you shift to "everything happens the same way it did."

#+begin_quote
  That is literally what The Stations of the Canon trope is
#+end_quote

No, actually, it's not. Funny how you imply that I didn't follow your link and read the article when, in reality, the article says something a little different from your complaint.

There are two major differences that I'll highlight. First, the article doesn't say anything about "the characters involved will say and do the same thing no matter what has been changed about the story." The article is only about hitting the "iconic moments" that a fandom is familiar with. This is actually what I focused on in my first comment, pointing out the appeal of familiarity and how using canon structure may help an inexperienced writer.

Second, the article is quite explicit that a fic which has this trope is /not/ automatically a bad one, as you are trying to say.

Explicit.

I'll quote: "These events tend to be quite fixed, and thus they can, when done poorly, come across as merely crossing over The Stations Of The Canon, rather than an actual plot, which is where this trope gets its name." The phrase "when done poorly" means that it can be done... not poorly. It can at least be mediocre. Perhaps even well! Wow.

Even better: "Fanfiction stories can play this trope reasonably straight and still be good stories."

Huh, "good stories."

So I think I understand what your position is. I can even see where it diverges from the article you linked to for alleged support. And I disagree quite strongly with your blanket condemnation of such fics. When I gave reasons for my disagreement, you didn't engage them directly; instead, you altered your complaint to something more extreme that was easier to defend and which my critiques didn't really address anymore.

Shifting the Goalposts.

Which is why I dismiss the later and more extreme complaint about writers who change nothing, not even dialogue, and instead focus on the original complaint about hitting the main, iconic plot events over and over. You know, the trope you linked to.

I can understand getting bored with stories that use it. I can understand regarding them as being less creative than stories that don't. What I don't accept is your blanket condemnation and implicit attitude that you're somehow superior to all those who don't reject them.

Because I can also understand why some, readers and writers, are attracted to the familiarity of those iconic moments - and that such people are not in any fashion inferior to you because of it. I can also recognize that different people have different ideas about what is an "acceptable" divergence from canon - and that others aren't inferior to you because of that difference.

Reusing the same old troll scene isn't inherently better or worse than reusing the same old Hogwarts or same old gender.

#+begin_quote
  I just pulled the fact using bad techniques in while learning a skill
#+end_quote

Except that you failed to establish that we're talking about an inherently bad technique. You claimed it is, linked to an article that actually /disagrees/ with you, then used the claim that the technique leads to deficiencies as evidence that it's a bad technique.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, let's just skip the part of my post that mentions parts of canon that can be skipped, and my comments in this very thread about alternates to canon.
#+end_quote

Oh, I'm not skipping it. You may not have noticed, but you utterly failed to offer your suggestions to any of the people who are committing the horrible sins you are complaining about. Telling someone on Reddit who vaguely or even completely agrees with you about how other, unidentified writers could improve their unidentified stories does not, in any remote sense of the words, qualify as "helping them by showing them how they can move past canon."

If you cared about helping them, you'd be directing helpful, constructive comments directly to them. Instead you wrote a self-serving rant about how your desires aren't being fulfilled by others who are writing what they enjoy and are comfortable with. The former would be great, but I don't find myself to be very sympathetic with the latter.

To sum up: contrary to the complaints made here, Stations of the Canon does not automatically cause a story to be bad. Ergo, writing such a story doesn't automatically make someone inferior, and liking such a story doesn't automatically make someone inferior. There's no evidence that it creates bad habits or causes a person to become deficient as a writer, but the presence of a pre-built plot structure might help a person getting started with writing. At the very least, it might help them write something they like, even if they never write another thing. Finally, it represents a set of familiar elements that are just a few of many, many familiar elements from canon, and everyone has different preferences when it comes to what familiar elements they're willing to see changed.

Brilliant. Stories that have the goblins instantly supply Harry with lore-breaking plot devices, unimaginable wealth, or respect he hasn't earned are truly awful.

That being said, I think your rant is best suited to cover long pieces that attempt to change a single facet of a character or relationship. Some of the best stories don't do this and are instead merely missing moments in alternate universes (e.g. linkffn(Screams Part One by cloneserpents)). But this probably falls under your disclaimer of the 1% of fics that avoid this problem.

** Yes. This is one of the things I hate most about fanfiction.

I think that the insistence by so many authors to keep themselves anchored to the canon ideas are why I'm getting progressively more fucked off with fanfiction as a whole. Day in, day out, I feel like I'm reading the same exact stuff, I'm sick of it. I feel like if I tried reading /canon/ I would get sick of it.

At this point, if I'm reading a fic and it happens to feature a magic school as a prominent location, I back out of it, even if it's a universally acclaimed fic like Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. I legitimately can't make myself interested in it.

As a result, it's been near enough a year since I've taken a fic to completion. I might as well just move to another fandom.

For example, if Harry was smart enough to get Sirius exonerated by year 3, then he should also be able to use Marauder's Map more effectively and work out Crouch Jr's deception. Or if a real smart Harry faced off Umbridge, he would either manipulate her to his advantage and/or eliminate her when she stepped over the line.

#+end_quote

But he has to meet Hermione, of course? ;-) But seriously why shouldn't Draco meet Harry before Hogwarts? In canon Draco is actively seeking out Harry in the Hogwarts Express. The only way to avoid this is by having an AU where Draco is dead or Harry isn't someone famous or famous enough to warrant a visit from Draco.

I personally want changes that makes sense in AUs, I certainly don't want changes for the sake of having changes. So I think Stations of the Canon has its place in AUs. More so in AUs where you're focusing on plot irrelevant characters such as Slytherin!Ron stories but in those stories "The Stations of Canon" are happening in the background, which is totally fine IMO.

#+end_quote

Happening in the background is fine, but it's the fics where they don't /and/ they're almost word-for-word exactly what happens in canon.

And a story with Slytherin!Ron should alter the Stations. He wouldn't be there to help with the troll, if he isn't friends with Harry then that's going to have /huge/ effects on the canon story, and POA would be different. (Everyone's going to wonder why the hell Sirius is breaking into Slytherin instead of Gryffindor, the whole Hallowe'en scene would go different because Slytherin doesn't even have a portrait, and without someone like Neville writing down passwords then Sirius is going to have an even harder time getting into their common room.)

Admittedly, I do kind of agree with the your point about meeting Draco pre-Hogwarts. I get what OP and other people are complaining about, but I do think there are some things that are going to remain the same even in AUs, unless a character has specific reason not to do something or to do it different. Draco will probably always seek out Harry on the train and he'll probably always be in Madam Malkins if Harry goes to Diagon Alley on his birthday. (But in AU's why not have Harry go there on a different day, and their interactions will be different, which can affect later events, and if Draco learns who Harry is then he might decide not to seek him out on the train later.) The troll has come up a lot as something that makes eyes roll, but it's one of the things I think would always happen because (unless your fic is Quirrell-centric and you're writing him more intelligently or otherwise OOC to canon) there's no reason he /wouldn't/ let it into the castle--though I do agree that what happens once it's inside can change, and if it doesn't then we don't need to hear about it except in passing.
