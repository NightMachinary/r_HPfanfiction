After a rather /intense/ - and slightly firewhiskey-fueled - "discussion" with Albus a few weeks into the new school-year, Lucius accepts a bet... On his honor as a pureblood, he will - to the very best of his ability - try to train a mudblood so that she is undistinguishable from a proper young pureblood witch. Lucius is sure it's impossible, but by Salazar, he'll do his best!

Albus got just the girl - a muggleborn born very early in the school-year, giving Malfoy almost a year. Either she was introduced to the magical world a few days before by McGonagall, or Malfoy will be her first contact. And yes, of course it's Hermione! ;-)

Lucius manage to strike a deal with Hermione and her parents, so she will spend much time at Malfoy Manor.

- Hermione is eager to learn, love to read, and quick to learn new spell
- Powerfull
- Had practiced some control over her abilities before learning she was a witch?
- Befriends Draco (& friends) (... eventually) (esp. Slytherin-girls)
- Lessons from Narcissa - posture, being demure, &c
- Help with hair and other beauty-spells
- Wizarding and Pureblood culture and the reason why things are done the way they are (eg. courting and marriage-contracts)
- Celebrating traditional festivals the traditional way

What will happen on the train, at sorting, and at Hogwarts?


** Idk This seems really... weird. Like “send the Native American child to a White family so she can learn to be White.”

*** The undertones are classist, not racist. As the title pointed out, he's borrowing the basic concept of the musical My Fair Lady (the movie is worth watching, but be warned it's three hours long). If the writer hits all the same beats as the original, it's also sexist as hell.

**** I think what I said is equally valid. My analogy references removing one's heritage and teaching them the “proper” way.

***** That entirely depends on two points: 1st, do the different classes count as different cultures? and 2nd, are people not only taught how to behave like another class, but also taught to forget how their original class behaved? Unless both questions can be answered with "yes", it's not the same as trying to stamp out native culture in state-run boarding schools.

****** Yeah I would say that muggleborns and purebloods have entirely different cultures in this scenario.

Also, “try to train a mudblood so that she is indistinguishable from a proper young pure blood witch.”

That's just straight fucking awful. You can't tell me that it isn't.

Anyways, I was just trying to say I was getting some seriously creepy vibes from this prompt. Like, let's go send the Muggleborn to live with the person who used to torture muggles for fun and does so AGAIN at the Quidditch World Cup. That definitely won't end with her learning about how her heritage is shit and her family is shit.

Being a “proper pureblood” is synonymous with segregation based upon heritage in the eyes of Death Eaters. There is a reason that people like the Weasleys, who basically just believe muggles are people too, are considered blood traitors.

******* I think you're reading way to much into this, this isn't "what if this happened in the world of Harry Potter" as much as it is "what if Pygmalion (My Fair Lady) happened with Harry Potter characters". I mean, the prompt starts with Malfoy and Dumbledore having drinks together, their characterisations have been warped to fit the plot.

******** Being completely honest, I was just saying I got some creepy vibes from it. I didn't really mean anything by it at the time.

Then I kind of got sucked into defending my viewpoint and we got here. Lmao.

I agree that the characterizations have to be warped and I probably read too much into it.

*** I disagree - Hermione /is/ actually magical... the magical world /is/ her world! It would be more like white children growing up among natives, before being "rescued" and expected to act all white.

Besides, the main theme is the whole muggleborns not respecting wizarding culture and tradition - wanting to change and replace it with muggle ones (eg. Yule => Christmas... esp. regarding the Church historical attitudes towards witches), without trying to learn about the wizarding tradition, nor trying to understand why they may have emerged and that there may be good reasons (eg. magic and magical enforced oaths interfering). And of cources Purebloods reaction to Muggleborns because of the disruption their ignorance cause.

Muggleborns basically got the attitude Europeeans had when colonizing - we are modern and enlightened; so our culture, our ideas, our way of doing things /must/ be better than whatever these savages are doing... no need to find out if there's a reason behind what they do, because we know best!

**** Actually, muggleborns are the immigrants in Harry Potter, and the pureblood bigots stand for the right-wing racists who don't want the "foreigners" around. And as much as the ourblood fanboys like to claim it, there really isn't much of a pureblood culture in the books that would be considered different from England. Quidditch and robes, that's it, basically. You've got stronger differences between different countries in Europe.
