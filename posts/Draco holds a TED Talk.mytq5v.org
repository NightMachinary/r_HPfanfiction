I'm currently procrastinating watching TED Talks on YouTube, and I got the idea for a Fic where a reformed Draco holds a TED Talk about his time as a Death Eater.


** ...gonna have to ask for the expansion of the acronym since I doubt that it's Triple Expresso Deluxe.

Edit - And now I have a mental image of Coffee being the bane of Dark Magic due to an ancient spell cast by Pope Clement VIII who declared Coffee to be a Holy Drink.

** You know, this is one of the better prompt ideas and so long as you have him properly remorseful, would actually be something I read.

I'm thinking it would be in the same vein as what Lewinsky did.

*** 'When I was a young boy, I was raised in a family that had very toxic and backwards beliefs, my father was a death eater and my mother while not officially one shared similar beliefs, growing up I worshipped my father and my beliefs mirrored my fathers, I went to school and acted like the son of a death eater should, I scorned and looked down on people for their blood. In my second year, the chamber of secrets was opened and I proudly proclaimed about how the 'mudbloods where next'

this behaviour of mine continued on for several years, until one day Lord voldemort recruited me as a death eater with a mission to assassinate albus dumbledore.

Now I will not deny how proud and important I felt for receiving such a mission.

but as that year went on, I started to buckle under the pressure of not only the mission but the concept of killing someone.

I Failed that mission, Dumbledore died anyway.

Voldemort then made our families home as his head quarters It should have been a great honour for me and my family.

but instead we where mocked in our own house by someone we had sworn to serve.

During the time he ruled from our house, I saw him constantly torturing his own followers. My fellow death eaters, The parents of my school friends

Muggleborns where being chased and tormented across the country. It was everything that the younger me would have dreamt about

and Yet I felt hollow and empty inside, I was terrifed daily that one day the man whose I swore allegiance too would torture me for some small mistake.

The War ended and thanks to Harry potter, I imagined to avoid prison time in Azkaban, instead serving time locked at home.

I still held onto my childhood beliefs for a few more years. though I was less militant about my beliefs, they where still deeply ingrained in me.

while being in my childhood home was better then Azkaban I still felt trapped in that place, constantly seeing images from the time voldemort lived there

Luckily The Auror who was assigned to check in on me weekly was a former classmate of mine Ronald weasley, Yes I know to some of the younger audience the fact the Funny man at the Joke Job was once one of the ministries top aurors might be surprising.

During one of my check ups I mentioned my feelings of frustrations and how I despised him.

Weasley chuckled and mentions if I feel so trapped, I could try the ministries new program and spend some time in the muggle world.

It was a program headed by Hermione weasley, well hermione granger at the time.

It was designed to guide adult wizards into the muggle world and let them explore it.

I still hate a large hatred for muggles and those of muggle blood.

but I was so desperate to leave my house that I joined the program.

Auror weasley made a great effort to get me into said program, even giving up some of his weekends to escort me during said program.

The program was only on a monthly basis, a 1 day trip to the muggle world every month.

one the first trip I hated it. on the second I also hated it.

But as time went on I slowly started to enjoy parts of the muggle world. and over time my hatred of muggles and muggleborns disapeared.

It should be noted that it took allot of effort on my behalf to make them disappear.

Hate is hard to Dispel after all.

But it is possible to move on from such things, with the right support. I was lucky Auror weasley disliked me since school, but he was dedicated to His job and actually wanted to see me do well.

so he helped me on the straight and Narrow.

he gave me the opportunity to improve and helped guide me to the better path.

after my house sentence ended, I still visited the muggle world. and kind of just drifted, I spent some years as a dark artifacts expert for the ministry but I was unsatsified.

and then one night at a bar, I overheard a muggle born, dennis greevy talking about how muggleborns kinda just get dropped into hogwarts.

So I decided to set up this program. Designed to help the young muggleborn witchs and wizards, and their parents adjust to the wizarding World, This program, will help you with Pre-hogwarts knowledge Help you and guide you through wizarding law. assign a wizard or witch to serve as a magical mentor during your time at hogwarts.

and most importantly to help set you up after hogwarts
