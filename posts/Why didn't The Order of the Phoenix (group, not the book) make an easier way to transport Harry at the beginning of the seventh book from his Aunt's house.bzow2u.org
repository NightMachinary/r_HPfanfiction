They could have done something like have Harry take a taxi to the Burrow or a Portkey. Doing everything with the Polyjuice Potion seemed kind of unnecessary and if they hadn't done that, then Madeye's death could have been avoided.

** because, in canon, they're all incompetent. up until the 7th book they function more as Dumbledore's cult than an actual resistance group, and more of the "resistance" comes from literal children who weren't allowed to join than from the actual members.

not to mention: none of the adult members are Muggle-born (the vast majority are pureblooded or implied to be) and over the course of the series we don't often see wizards using Muggle tools. they simply don't think to do so, and prejudice/misinformation makes it so that the only ones who do are Arthur Weasley types who fetishize Muggle culture and find it "fascinating" but wouldn't actually think to use a taxi, if they know what those are at all.

plus, the closest thing the magical world has to a taxi is the Knight Bus, which could have had informants on it (Stan Shunpike is strongly implied to be innocent, but nothing was said about whoever replaced him.)

Portkeys, it's been established, can be tampered with; it's also implied near the beginning of GoF that the Ministry keeps tabs on their creation and use, and that Portkey creation is at least somewhat regulated.

personal thought: JKR needed a way to kill off Moody. he has been established as a master strategist, if paranoid; the war would have gone quite differently and possibly ended earlier if he'd survived that battle. hell, it would've been over by HBP if Moody knew about the Horcruxes. JKR needed to keep to her pre-established formula of all the final battles taking place near the end of the school year; maybe she wrote all the camping bits before writing the beginning of DH, and later realized that Moody wouldn't have allowed that. i don't know, i'm not in her head, but i think lazy writing is ultimately to blame.

***** If they were in a hurry/panic, then they had fucked up royally. They knew this was coming days beforehand, so they should have had everything planned out and even practiced. This is especially true since members of Order of the Phoenix were both former and current Aurors.

** The "Stupidity of the Seven Potters" happened because of lazy writing (I will never call it a battle). Remember, JKR doesn't have characters, she has plot devices who behave like characters as long as they don't divert away from the plot.

The head of the DMLE has gone over to the Death Eaters, Moody says, but for some reason they still care about not breaking laws. Sure whatever. The Ministry has blocked apparition, and made Floo and portkeys illegal there.

The best solution would've been to take Harry to a new safe house, unknown to Snape, right at the end of the 6th book. There was no reason for him to return to the Dursleys in the first place.

Another way would've been for sneaking Harry out with the Dursleys with Harry under the invisibility cloak. And for one Order member to immediately apparate Harry side-along once they were out of the anti-apparition wards, right to the edge of the wards of the safe house and go straight in. Minimum risk. That's what Mundungus did right before Moody died and it's what the rest of the Order should've done.

The casualties should've been much higher but our heroes survive only due to plot armor. Hagrid on a motorbike is a huge target and it's absurd that he and Harry didn't get hit immediately when ambushed. Harry was also stuck in a sidecar and unable to properly defend himself.

*** They just had to use a bloody House Elf. Dobby pop Harry out, and if anyone ask, they could honestly say they did'nt use apparition, portkey or floo.

There were tons of better plans, but as you said Rowling needed a fight so plot device.

Not really. Fudge was indignant over it being made illegally. Also, they /do/ use Portkeys in the plan. They all take them to the Burrow, so someone clearly /is/ able to create them.

/“Now see here, Dumbledore!” said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. “You haven't got authorization for that Portkey! You can't do things like that right in front of the Minister of Magic, you --- you ---”/

Page 818, OotP

#+begin_quote
  Why didn't they take a taxi? Because that's stupid in terms of combat manoeuvrability.
#+end_quote

Yet they took the Dursleys in a car. Why not sneak Harry in there under his Invisibility Cloak and have him Apparate or Portkey elsewhere? Why not have Harry walk somewhere under his cloak and Apparate/Portkey literally just a step outside the "protected" zone?

--------------

The plan's whole premise feels pretty off. Harry wishes to escape from Death Eaters, who are also in the Ministry... so they need to follow the Ministry's rules...? It doesn't make much sense. If it's truly been infiltrated, then who cares if they Apparate/Portkey out of there?

And if it hasn't, then they can just tell the Ministry there were Death Eaters there and that Harry's life depended on getting him out of there as soon as possible. Harry does, after all, use underage magic while the plan is unfolding.

The thing is, JKR could've had the exact same thing happen if only she set the right circumstances down. Rather than have it be their first plan, have them try others --- better ones --- and then have to resort to the shitty broom plan when all else fails. It still wouldn't be perfect, but it'd be a lot better than what we got.

**** I think the answer is because she wanted an action set piece as soon as possible. One of the problems with fanfiction is that the authors spend too much time on what would logically happen and not enough on narrative structure. That's one of the reasons decent fanfic is so much longer than anything that would be published. This post is about fridge logic. Most people don't notice while the story is happening, and only a few notice it in hindsight. The simple truth is that this is a story, not real life. People do things differently in stories than in real life because it makes the story better. That's why fix fics and time travel stories are boring unless the author comes up with another source of tension or turns it into a comedy.

*** The best solution would've been to side-along apparate Harry under the invisibility cloak as soon as they're out of the ward boundaries to the edge of the Burrow's wards. Mundungus was able to apparate to escape and there's absolutely no reason why the others couldn't do the same instead of carrying on using brooms. You wouldn't need seven Potters if you use an invisibility cloak since it would give you enough time to apparate away.

  people who can track the Trace
#+end_quote

Okay, this is bullshit. The Trace isn't an active tracker. They can't track Harry using this and they don't or Harry would've given away his position when he first used a spell to defend himself. /That did not happen./

#+begin_quote
  A portkey is a controlled spell. The only person we actively see making a portkey is Dumbledore, and eve then the Minister is shocked st it. For all we know, Dumbledore only managed it because of the Elder Wand (though that is unlikely). Basically, there is no one in the Order who can make an untraceable portkey.
#+end_quote

The Order had made portkeys from seven different safe houses to the Burrow. They could still easily make or acquire safe portkeys, just that it was illegal to place one at the Dursleys. And for some reason the Order cared about not breaking laws even though the head of the DMLE has been subverted.

#+begin_quote
  Why didn't they take a taxi? Because that's stupid in terms of combat manoeuvrability.
#+end_quote

So they stuck Harry in the sidecar of a motorbike and had a half-giant drive it. Very small target. Harry was so manoeuverable that he couldn't properly stick his wand out to defend himself.

#+begin_quote
  Harry who took the polyjuice. That's still stupid. The moment the death eaters arrive, they won't see Harry but know he's there (they can track him remember)
#+end_quote

No, they can't. We've covered this already.

#+begin_quote
  So what happened when there were seven Harry's? The Death Eaters got confused, and focused their attention on the ones being protected by Mad Eye and Kingsley and all the other fighters. Basically diverting attention away from the real Harry
#+end_quote

What happened was that the Death Eaters picked up the idiot ball too. Voldemort wanted to kill Harry himself. All the other Death Eaters would've to concentrate on his protectors so the only one who should've been confused would be Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  The problem happened when our noble hero refused to keep his head down and chose to attack. And the fact that Voldemort himself showed up. It was the priori incantatum that alerted Voldemort to the real Harry.
#+end_quote

Did you even read the book? Harry and Hagrid would've died to the Death Eaters if Harry hadn't defended himself. And it was his use of the disarming charm against Shunpike which gave him away, not priori incantatum.

#+begin_quote
  The plan of the seven potters was strategically sound
#+end_quote

No, it was all characters holding the idiot ball because JKR wanted to place a check against 'action scene and character death' in her list of plot events.

#+begin_quote
  The author wants to remind you that this is war now, and people get killed
#+end_quote

Yes. JKR doesn't have characters, she has plot devices who behave like characters as long as it doesn't divert from the plot.

*** On another point,

Remus berates Harry for choosing to use the disarming charm. He tells Harry that the Death Eaters consider it his signature spell, and more to the point, Harry should have to casting to kill. Harry fires back that the Death Eater, Span Turnpike I believe, was innocent and imperioused. Whether this is true or not we don't know.

** I think the Death Eaters were watching the house pretty closely. Any taxi would probably be attacked as soon as it left the house. The Polyjuice Potion solution wasn't ideal, but it wasn't the worst idea... it meant that the Death Eaters had to split up to follow all seven Harrys, instead of making one big mass attack on one target.

When it comes to Portkeys... your guess is as good as mine. My guess is that Portkeys aren't actually that easy to make. I know Dumbledore created one just by waving his wand, but that was DUMBLEDORE.
