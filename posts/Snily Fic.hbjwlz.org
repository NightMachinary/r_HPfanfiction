Hello! Was wondering if anyone had any GOOD Snily recommendations that happened after the first Wizarding War. An AU where James died and Lily didn't and get a Severus get together? Preferably a slow burn romance. Thank you!

EDIT: For reference here, my original favorite was on Wattpad and called When Sparks Fly or something along those lines but it and the user have been deleted :/

EDIT 2: THE USE WAS SEVEROUSDOWNEY! It just came to me. If anyone archived that story or knows them somehow which is probably a slim chance please let me know. I want to get my hands on that story again.


** Limkffn(Puzzle) might be what you want?

** I haven't come across any that take place after the war, nor ones in which James dies.

But I recommend "A Dealer, not a Death Eater" on AO3, and "Ananke" on FFN.

Edit: neither of these are slow-burn, either. So basically they meet none of your criteria ðŸ˜… But they're still good!
