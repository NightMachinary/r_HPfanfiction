I read this maybe a couple years ago - I remember that Harry gets his own office in the Ministry, and people are brought in to be questioned by him on whether or not they're a death eater or support LV or similar.

I think it was fairly short. I've tried Googling and looking on FF.net but I'm having no luck. If anyone can find it or recognizes from this description, that would be great.

My recollection is that Shacklebolt is called in there at one point, and I think Mr. Weasley comments that he doesn't envy anyone in that room who sympathizes with LV or something.


** Oh, i think i remember this one. Harry's a hatchetman in the story? I think it's a oneshot in someone's folder of oneshots. Rorschat's blot or ruskbyte I think?

*** Yes, thanks! I thought it was called Dirty Harry, but that only brought up some really weird Slytherin harem fic. It was Chap 24 of Rorschach's Blot's one shot library, Special Investigator Harry Potter aka Dirty.
