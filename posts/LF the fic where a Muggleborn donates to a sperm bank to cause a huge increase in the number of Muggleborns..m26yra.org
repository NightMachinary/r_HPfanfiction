  The problem: muggleborns face terrible discrimination, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things are only getting worse. The solution: Find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them, even if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way!
