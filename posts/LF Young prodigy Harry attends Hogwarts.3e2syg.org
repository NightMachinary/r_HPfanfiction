I haven't been able to find fic where Harry goes to Hogwarts as student at younger age (let's say 6 or 7 years old), not just visiting or taking Horcrux/Sword of Gryffindor and leaving.

Be it time travel, possession, acquired memories, resurrection, brilliant mind, fate having fun or some Harry-Master-of-Death-thing, basically *anything* goes as long as he is younger than 11, attends Hogwarts as student and is exceptionally skilled at magic for his age (with exceptionally skilled being anything between 4th-5th year average student to God making Snape lose all his greasy hair with a single flick of finger).

Eleven year old Harry joining upper classes will be appreciated too, in case there are actually no fics matching my description. Thanks!


** This doesn't match your description, but it's similar and really well written, maybe you'd be interested? Harry is raised at Hogwarts by house-elves and teachers, and though not allowed to get a wand or officially study magic before he turns 11, he does sit in on classes and reads a lot and by the time he does start at Hogwarts he's able to perform some really advanced spells, teaching himself to apparate (illegally) within his first year, and figures a lot of stuff out much faster than he did in the books. He also becomes very friendly with the older students, particularly Fred and George Weasley. I know it's not exactly what you're looking for but might be worth a shot?

*** This sounds interesting, but the title is too generic for the bot. Do you have a link, or know the author's name?

#+begin_quote
  Following Voldemort's downfall attempting to kill Harry, the Hogwarts professors appeal to the Ministry of Magic to allow the young boy to live and grow up at Hogwarts, away from the world's dangers. He grows up unlike any other child in the Wizarding world, meeting years of students before he is allowed a wand. Now, he will meet his fellow classmates to finally learn magic.

** It probably exists somewhere, though sadly I don't know any fics where he's at Hogwarts as a prodigy whilst under the age of 11.

Those parameters aside, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi]] does fit the parameters of an eleven year old prodigy Harry joining the upper classes. Except that he transfers to Durmstrang to accomplish that.

*** Ah, I wondered whether to put this fic as an example, but decided to stick with Hogwarts.

It's great story and sadly I've read it few times (due to slow updates I usually reread it once it get's an update), but thanks for trying.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
