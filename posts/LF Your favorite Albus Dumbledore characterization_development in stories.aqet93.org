Albus seems to be rather under written; he's either written as a manipulator, as some other such things.

He's not perfect, has made mistakes, and should have handled certain things differently. But any time I see a story that has Manipulative/Evil Dumbledore; it just makes me want to roll my eyes and skip the story.

He's a difficult character to write well, he's complicated in all of the best (and worse) ways.

But, what are some of your favorite Albus Dumbledore characterization/development/interaction?

Rather Albus Dumbledore is the main character, or the side character doesn't matter to me.

Would rather it be completed, but if not as long as the characterization/development/interaction is good enough; I'll allow if it's not completed.

If Dumbledore isn't the main character and say Harry or someone is:

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No Weasley bashing

No Harem Harry

No super powerful or super smart Harry. Smarter or more powerful than he was in canon is fine, but make it believable.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash

Anything else goes


** Haunted and hunted series by obsidianpen if you can find a copy has one of my favourite Dumbledores

Author eldritcher on ao3 has quite a few fics with very compelling and nuanced Dumbledore interpretations that are also very forgiving

** The best two Dumbledore's for me are from linkffn(Imprisioned Realm; Eclipse of the Sky)

In both, they are similar to what canonDumbledore is like, however due to some circunstances, he's a lot more utilitarian and ruthless. He's still somewhat manipulative (as he actually is in canon, he fucking guided Harry to suicide with a slimmer of hope that it wouldnt be, which, to be honest, I 100% agree, the needs of the many outwheigh the needs of the one, in several scenarios) however is good and actually is trying his best, but he's just one old, albeit very very powerful, wizard that has the responsabilities of winning the war on his shoulders. Dumbledore is by far my second favourite character in the HPverse, because of all of the possibles paths that you could take him.

One of the fics isn't complete, but seeing as the author(bless his soul) updates at least twice a month, and its over 900k words, I'd assume its ok with you.

Oh, just remembered another one that's really fucking good and has a lot of Dumbledore in it. linkffn(Realignment)

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5641464/1/Forgive-an-Old-Man][Forgive an Old Man]] linkffn(5641464) - a really nice Harry-Dumbledore interaction post-OotP

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/278272][Wonderful Tragic Mysterious]] linkao3(278272) - time travel where Luna meets Dumbledore, shortly after Ariana died

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10799454][Dulce et decorum est]] linkao3(10799454) - very short but /excellent/ characterization

If you're okay with Fantastic Beasts fics, then:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8629234][nobody else but me]] linkao3(8629234) - Dumbledore trying (and failing) to move past Grindelwald

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10994679][The Hog's Head Salon]] linkao3(10994679) - the premise is slightly silly, but the characterization of both Albus and Aberforth is spot-on

And if you'll forgive the self-promotion, I think my fic, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14678448][at once more wonderful and more terrible]] linkao3(14678448) meets your request.
