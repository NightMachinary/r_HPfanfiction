Basically what the tile says. I know there are a ton of Dramione office romances, but these are the details I remember:

1. Draco and Hermione both work for the Ministry after the war. She's good at her job, but won't play politics and so gets all the work handed to her. Draco does play politics and is in the old boys club.
2. Hermione is married to Ron, but there's some unresolved tension. Draco eventually gets Ron a job (on the sly) in the ministry.
3. Draco and Hermione go to lots of museums/french restaurants/etc.
4. They eventually have an affair and Hermione and Ron get divorced
5. Hermione end us as the headmaster of Hogwarts and Draco is setting up to run as minister
6. It's pretty long and very much a slow burn.

It was one of my comfort reads a few years ago and somehow lost the bookmark. Any and all suggestions would be super appreciated.
