Any good Harry Potter/star wars crossover


** No. I haven't found a single one. I think I've wanted one in the past, but found none of the concepts satisfying. I also wanted Worm/SW and Worm/HP, but pretty much everything in that regard is terrible.

There are some one-shots for Worm/SW and Worm/HP that are fun to read though. The first chapter of one story by PencilMonkey is wonderful.

** I'm not sure of the name but it's description is about an immortal wizard(Harry) protecting his people from monsters from the stars. It's basically Harry leads a resistance against the empire after Earth gets attacked with some good world building.
