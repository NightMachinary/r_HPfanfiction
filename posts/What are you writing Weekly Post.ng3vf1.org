** Still writing the next chapter in my crack fic.

Here's another snippet:

“Harry, this is a really bad idea,” Hermione said from Chrissy's back seat.

“Why? We're just gonna drive across the continental United States.” I was once again in the James Dean variant of my Harry avatar.

“Do you even have a driver's license?” I nodded and handed her a card. The paper was yellowed with age.

“Harry, this expired in nineteen thirty-four!” Hermione shouted.

“So?” I said.

“What if we get pulled over!”

“The Bulls, Nah, don't worry about them.”

“Why?”

“Fenric would take care of ‘em; he's the Grand Master of the Knights of the Crawling Chaos.”

“So you're the one behind that group of thugs! I knew it!” I could tell Hastur was rolling his eyes.

“Stop being so hard on Fenric; I was the one who put him up to it,” I said, and a shocked silence followed, only being broken by Hastur turning a page in my grimoire.

** After recently completing my latest story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13852502/1/In-Bad-Faith][In Bad Faith]] (a Harry/Fem!Draco short novel), I have moved on to my next project.

The only issue is it seems I can't quite decide what that next project is.

In theory, I'm working on an original story based on one of my HP/DC crossovers. However, when I sit down to write I often find myself opening up a different doc to 'get my head in the game'. The last few times I've done this, it resulted in writing 3-4k words at a go, which is pretty unusual for me.

Another time when I sat down to write I did 2k words for /another/ story.

So depending on my mood, I might be writing:

1. My Original Story.
2. Empyrean Echoes (Working Title) - A HP/Warhammer 40k crossover with a side of Harry/Fleur.
3. Requiem of the Lost (Working Title) - A HP/Warhammer Fantasy crossover with an archaeologist Harry pulling a bit of an Odysseus in the world of Warhammer.
4. The Shadow of Angmar - My HP/LotR story.

This has resulted in me making much less headway on any one of the projects than I was hoping. On the other hand, I'm having fun, and the fact that I'm still working to the 'write stories to completion before posting' plan means I'm not increasing my number of commitments.

** Hi guys! I posted the ending for the second entry of my short story series (always maximum novella length, usually shorter) this week. After arriving in Vienna in the previous chapter, Harry, Sirius-Padfoot, and Remus go to Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria to solve a mystery that has endured for 50 years. A tricky place/context to set a fic, but I hope I was able to treat it with the respect it deserves, and highlighted some of the real atrocities that occured in this terrible place in real life. My series has taken quite an emotional turn (is there anythig better than making a reader cry?), and this episode explores raw magic and the concept of redemption, among other things.

On AO3 I am posting it as a series linkao3(27401833):

A Grim Tale of Grandmas, Schnitzels, and Ghosts - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31214912/chapters/77151347][Chapter 1]] C[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/31214912/chapters/77530286#workskin][hapter 2]]

Previous entry in the series

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27401833][A Grim Tale of Brothers, Pumpkins, and Giants]]

On FFNet the series continues as one work linkffn(13739888):

  Set a few weeks after Sirius' adventure with Dumbledore and, more importantly, his newly awakened grim consciousness. It is decided that Harry should travel to Vienna with Remus and his godfather to seek the advice of an old and wise wizard. Harry is delighted at the fun-filled holiday with his newly acquired leftover Marauders, but it soon emerges the Austrians could use the help of a grim with some of their own wounds almost sixty years in the making. Is there a difference between muggle and magical ghosts or souls? What does it mean when wayward souls cannot move on and escape death for too long? Can we speak to those who have passed on, or are they too busy experiencing the next great adventure? Is having a family the same thing as having relatives, and can we choose? Why are wizards incapable of understanding the basic concept of two pedals and a steering wheel? What is it like to be on holiday when you're Harry Potter?

** Working on chapter two of year five of my female Harry, guardian Snape series. It's interesting watching them grow and it's a continual learning phrase for Snape as he tries to figure out how to parent a growing and maturing teenager. It makes me feel a bit more empathy to my own adoptive parents (who I love, but I can also promise that I was a difficult teenager).

Here's the first fic in the series for anyone who might be interested (crossposted on AO3 and ffn):

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** Probably won't ever publish it but here's a snippet of a 3k word fic start I wrote out earlier. For reference it's AU without Vold's return and Harry is in 7th year. And the answer is yes.

“Come on, Luna. Tell him.”

“What's up?” Harry said in his usual smooth voice.

“Harry! I got 10 points for Ravenclaw in potions.”

Harry seemed deeply confused.

“And he said ‘Well done' to me on my potions work!”

Now his eyes were as wide as Luna's.

“Weird right?” Ron added.

“You're all blowing this way out of proportion.” Ginny said working on her stew again.

“Ginny, I hate to agree with Ron, but he's right. This is Professor Snape, he doesn't give points to Ravenclaw, doesn't say ‘Well done', he drags an aura of gloom and doom wherever he goes.” Hermione said.

“This is coming from Hermione, Gin. She actually likes the professors here.” Harry said.

“He's not always gloomy, he smiles.” Ginny said.

Ron stood up shaking the whole table. “Wot? Ginny, Snape does not smile. The man must be physically incapable of it.”

“He does, did just today.”

“I didn't see it.” Luna said.

“You wouldn't, he did when I was leaving class.”

Hermione sat there with the most scandalized look on her face, as if she'd witnessed some perversion of nature.

“Snape fancies you!” Ron said. Harry burst out laughing.

“Oh haha, very funny.”

“Do you have a better explanation?” he asked the table.

“Maybe he got a new potions book or whatever, maybe he met someone.”

“Yeah he did, he met you!”

Now Hermione was losing her composure.

“Oh you're insufferable sometimes. I'm going.”

“Don't go into any dark hallways!” Ron cried after her, sitting back down.

“Do you really think Snape fancies Ginny?” said Harry, who was recovering holding his sides.

“God, I hope so.” Hermione said, still laughing hysterically.

It's moving faster than I thought and I'm going as I write and leaving the plot to chance. It's actually changed a lot since I started writing, but I have held true to its roots and it reflects those in later chapters. I enjoy the Harry/Voldemort dynamic even though I like writing LV more.

** I'm setting up a fic to write with favorite elements from all the fanfiction I've read, and some of my own. Main character is a WAY overpowered OC (eventually), so if that's not your cup of tea, don't criticize please. Main character died in her first universe, was reborn in the marvel universe with gamer abilities. She tries not to alter the timeline, then save everyone when endgame comes along, but tony beats her to the gauntlet for the final snap. She picks up the stones again, but in snapping, destabilizes the boundaries between worlds and is sent to the wizarding world, ending up back in a 9-year old's body. She has to survive on the streets, learns she's in the wizarding world, goes to hogwarts in the same year as the boy-who-lived, tries not to draw attention to herself but draws the attention of quirinius quirrel, who tries to mold her to someone who could join Voldemort. First year is mostly learning new spells and the rules of magic in the RoR. She steals the stone before anyone else gets a chance to, replacing it with a fake. Making an alliance with fawkes to bring it to the flamels, she thought she remained unnoticed until a certain couple wind up on platform 9 3/4, planning to adopt her. Summer is spent learning alchemy and arithmancy from Nicolas and sorcery from Perenelle. Upon arriving back at hogwarts, finally decides to look into quest sorting hat gave her in first year: find the rooms of the founders. Already found RoR, seeks out CoS- already looted by Voldemort. Spends a lot of time searching for Gryffindor and Hufflepuff rooms. Gryffindor's is a dueling arena, with the preserved memories of the four founders, Morgana Le Fay, Merlin, Circe, and Arthur Pendragon. The first four are able to appear because of their innate ties to the castle, and the later four because of their innate ties to magic itself. Members of the arena teach her: war magic + the path of the warlock (Gryffindor), swordfighting and ‘muggle dueling' (Pendragon), potions and transfiguration (ravenclaw), charms and elemental casting (hufflepuff), curses, hexes, jinxes, and advanced dueling magic (slytherin), runic and primal casting (le fay), ancient magic and wards (Merlin), necromancy, mind arts, and illusions (Circe). She balances undergoing trials to find and learn from Gryffindor's room with making sure not to draw suspicions once the chamber is open. Hufflepuff's room is found too (contains massive charms compendium and practice on elemental magic and crafting spells). Lets Potter kill basilisk to keep plot close to original, move is going to be made in 4th year. 3rd year is finding the wardstones of hogwarts, practicing wand less and wordless magic, and working on restoring relations with other races. 3rd year includes horcrux hunting and attempted destroyal without destroying the host (so Harry doesn't die), brewing veritaserum, prank war with the twins, becoming an animagus, learning how to cast a patronus, set up for the ‘big reveal', capture pettigrew at the end of the year, learn spell crafting and new languages. Make acquaintance of goblins, werewolves, acromantulas, giant tribes, centaurs, house elves, and vampires. Free gellert Grindelwald (secretly), and get him to teach blood magic, rituals, and dueling. Learn enchanting from Perenelle over the summer. 4th year- the big one. Start of the feast- bind crouch, Accio polyjuice, free moody from trunk, use previously set up wards to reverse dark mark and capture death eaters, incite madam bones over to arrest them, display destroyed horcruxes, destroy Harry's soul piece, and reveal Peter pettigrew. Teachers break through previously made ward circle and bring her up to dumbledore's office, albus and heads of houses are bickering while the presences in her head debate (members of the arena can't manifest outside the room, but they can remain in her head, more on that later). Flamels barge in and show why they are powerful alchemists- they are super mad. Reina reveals she's from alternate dimension, and after a long talk, they agree to let her stay at hogwarts. She's put into the triwizard cup instead of Cedric and Harry (more later), and tasks are changed. #1- face off against dark wizard, #2- like canon, but in the forbidden forest, #3- classic maze. Reina uses incredibly taxing magic to allow members of the arena to use their corporeal memory forms and join them at the Yule ball (brings Gryffindor to the ball), and also invites gellert to come and say hi to an old friend. Slytherin finally discourages the rumor he hates muggles. First task involves fighting dark wizards (voldemort- fleur, herpo the foul- Krum, and Grindelwald (reina, last fight)). Reina had invited gellert to watch the first task, warning him not to interfere, but knew he would be unable to restrain himself when she saw what the task was (found out in the tent when she figured out who she's fighting right before task.) indeed, Grindelwald blasts his fake projection and jumps into the arena to duel her instead, looking every bit as young as he did in FBaWtFT, both using non-lethal spells and awesome magic. End of 4th year, targeted by dark wizards who fear her as a threat to them, gellert dies while the arena members, Reina, gellert, dumbledore, and the flamels fight off the dark wizards. Remaining ones she murders, then she uses the stones to bring him back to life- and is pulled into the Star Wars universe. During time in Harry Potter she also learns about the make up of magic- how to weave and unravel spells, and how to change their state of matter- from energy to solid to liquid to gas. Pretty neat stuff. So this is just a collection of my favorite characters and ideas, as well as some original stuff, that I'd love to put in a story. Gonna start it this summer, continue it for as long as possible. Starts in Marvel universe before years 1-4 of HP, then moved to Star Wars, Percy Jackson, hunger games, dnd, Mistborn, and others. Very long term project of mine. If anyone likes any ideas feel free to use them in ur own fanfic, but let me know, cause I would love to read it ;)

/It all started when Carly, twin sister of the famous Harry Potter, received a letter from a gigantic man stating that she and her brother will attend a magic school for witches and wizards called Hogwarts, their parents apparently attended this school. As Carly adjusted in the magical school, she became a magical prodigy. In her very first year, things have gone unusual, even for wizarding standards.

Carly teams up with her new trustworthy friends, Ophelia and Victoria, to catch this spy to protect Harry, no matter what it takes, like getting killed, or worse, expelled./

/But was Harry really the target victim?/

So yeah that's it. I usually publish a chapter every other Saturday and Sunday +but I can't promise that, cuz I'm lazy.+ Enjoy my horrid fic!

ps: I encourage and allow constructive criticism and feedback since I'm a new fic writer. Thank you for your time!

** *The Secret War*

by njcov

Lucius tasks Draco with a special mission: "You will seduce the Granger girl. I don't care how you do it, I don't care how long it takes. Tell her you renounce your family, tell her you want no part in the Dark Lord's plan...tell her you need her help. You will make her love you Draco. You will win her trust, and then she will lead us to Potter.”

*Chapters 19/22 posted.*

** 2 main Long fics ATM, both drastically different in tone, the 2nd much darker than the other since it's a Death Eater fic:

1) Never Alone: Werewolf Norah Jameson is ordered by Greyback to infiltrate the Order to avenge the death of a comrade, but along the way, Norah develops a friendship with Nymphadora Tonks and fellow wolf, Remus Lupin, and falls for her new partner, Ollie Brennan in the process, but will her new friendships be enough to cause her to defy her master? OC/OC Pairing & Remadora, AU.

2) A Second Glance: After her husband, Antonin Dolohov gets killed in the Battle of Hogwarts by Remus Lupin, Death Eater Elena Dolohov nee' Black decides to seek revenge and takes her cousin, Nymphadora Tonks, with her as a hostage, leaving Kingsley and Remus to track them down. Their personalities clash, and neither seems really keen on spending time with the other, but eventually, they must learn to put their differences aside when they meet a small group of Elena's fellow Death Eaters with sinister intentions. A long fic with OC & Antonin's relationship told thru flashbacks.

** my muse is really fickle so i flit between projects a lot (including writing some original fiction and poetry) but i'm currently trying to write the rest of what was supposed to be just a oneshot written for a taylor swift challenge :P

*/your name sounds better when it's whispered low/* ([[https://fanfictalk.com/archive/viewstory.php?sid=3855][+link]]) - it's a narcissa black/gideon prewett story that i think will end up being 4 chapters long, and 2 are currently posted. the pairing is...something that happened accidentally in a story about narcissa i previously started (they're all part of a series) but then i ended up liking the idea of their tragedy and drama romance potential that i fell in love with the pairing and had to write them properly. it's been slow going but oh well writing is hard haha

  A mysterious cosmic organisation, the wizarding underworld and an old friend from the past --- even sans--Dark Lord, Harry has his hands full, not that he truly minds. Post Hogwarts AU. Light-hearted sugar-and-crack fic --- plenty of fluff!

** I just finished one-shot with the idea that came up during shower, the idea is really lacking originality since is pandemic and all but I enjoyed it writing, even though I wasn't really satisfied with the finished product because I really wanted to develop relationships even further, but I wasn't sure how interesting is it to have only dialogue with no action., I'm still sharing it here.

Harry / Fleur and it doesn't really have happy ending, fair warning

** Still working on my "A Wizard in the Family. Isn't it wonderful?" fanfiction. It's basically: "Dudley is a wizard - neither the adult Dursleys nor Dudley get a different personality because of that."

I'm now at the end of the second year and will hopefully finish it this week. I'll start posting when the third year is either done or almost done because I hate when series are discontinued and don't want do that so I wait until I am at least half way through it before starting.

** I am writing a dark, scratch that, /very dark/ Harry oneshot. I am pretty sure it is very much unlike the norm and I myself am getting sick of what horrible shit I am writing but man...Harry has a heart but it has been broken too many times and Sirius's death and certain events afterwards just snap something horrible inside him. He stops /caring/.

He will pay back whatever he got in spades.
