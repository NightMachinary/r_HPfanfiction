So many stories feature the trope of chosen mate (e.g. a Veela and soulmates, but other types as well). In vast majority of them the target (usually Harry) never even bothers resisting. It's all merryho and fluff as he happily falls in "love" with whoever chose him (usually Draco). If there is any drama it is usually at best superficial.

Personally I cannot stand this trope. To me it signifies complete lack of agency, no choice, no freedom. It is no better than sanctioned rape or arranged marriage. Often forced, worse -expected by society/law and everyone around him. He must marry/bond and be a happy little submissive doll for whoever "chose" him.

I'd like an inversion of that trope. Story where protagonist does not fall in love, does not succumb to Stockholm Syndrome, does not give in to pressure and expectations. A story where he successfully rejects the mating and comes away free. Free to live, love and choose whoever he wishes. His own man so to speak.

Please no mpreg/bashing/huge age difference fics.


** *Hermione:* Oh, that? Yes, it happens to me about twice a year. Have you tried the Undetectable Sterilisation Curse? I've found that it both stops them from bothering me and stops them from exuding whatever magic is supposed to make them irresistibly attractive to me. Win-win.

*Harry:* "Win-win"? Isn't that for when both people benefit? It doesn't sound like...

*Hermione:* Of course it's win-win! I don't have to deal with them, and they don't have to deal with what I would do to them for /successfully/ forcing me into a relationship.

**** Yeah I thought you would like it. This sort of thing frustrates me too. Based on GOF anyone could enter anyone else to any sort of contract, marriage servitude, etc.

I am surprised that given how easily one's name could be exploited; they don't treat names like they are treated in The Dresden Files. That would be an interesting idea.

***** I sometimes wonder about the goblet of fire and if there really is an unbreakable contract that somehow compels someone to compete. What would have happened had Harry refused? Wish the canon had been more clear on this. Would he loose his magic? His life? Maybe cursed somehow to be forever a coward or smth? Or did the contract literally compel him to compete and he had no choice whatsoever?

***** I think the best one I've read is linkffn(8490518), had a really interesting premise and one of the fanfics that I really hope is continued, even if it is in some distant aeon. I think the author was going to make it so that they were in a relationship eventually, but if they didn't actually end up in a relationship... Well it'd be a really interesting idea for a story, anyways. Lot's of intricacies one'd need to work around, especially if either of them is in a relationship with someone else.

The other is linkffn(8895981) which is a bit more comedic, and only a short thing. Has a really interesting twist on the matter.

From what I remember Draco just declared them veela mates and he decided 'yeah, no' and left for the island at the end.

** Preach it, brother (or sister)! The most fundamental theme of whole HP universe is in my opinion is “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, ...” Also, that we all (even Harry confronting the prophecy or Draco Malfoy on the top of the Astronomy Tower) can always choose the right way.

It is no wonder that the biggest attack in most fanfiction is exactly against this message. The most fundamental part of all soul-bond stories (which irritates me tremendously) is exactly this rule of fate (or whatever entity stands behind the scenes; of course, the other part is smut, but that's other matter) and rejection of free will.

I think that was what in the end broke back of otherwise the best one among them linkffn(8490518) ... the author would have to deal with these hard questions of deciding in the situation without choices, and he gave up on it. Just my suspicion without any evidence. On the romance side, I still hold that this story should be finished by somebody from India (or wherever where the arranged marriages are still a thing), but it still doesn't change anything on contemplating their decision in that situation.
