Or at least not a doe. I came across this story that explores how weird it is that it's a doe.

** I don't think Lily's patronus is a deer because she's in love with James. It's a doe because that's her nature and it's supposed to show us that they are a great match. I doubt Harry's patronus is a stag because he is in love with his father. It's probably because they are very similar. Snape's patronus being the same as Lily's makes sense, the patronus of Tonks changed as well to reflect her feelings for Remus. Also, fun fact, doe and stag don't really belong together, they are different species. Red deer are hinds and stags, some big ones like moose are bulls and cows, and all others are bucks and does.

*** I just looked it up and a stag is a male deer and a doe is a female deer. Perhaps the word choice has more to do with being literary, like GoT House Baratheon's heraldry is a stag, not a buck, because stag seems to fit the "world" better.

** If Snape's Patronus is a doe because he is secretly in love with James does that mean Harry's is a stag because he secretly has a MASSIVE Oedipus complex. Does he chug one out to pictures of his mum from time to time? These are the questions we need Rowling to answer on twitter.

  So Snape's Patronus is a doe because he's in love with Lily, whose Patronus is a doe because she's in love with James, whose Patronus is a stag... Er, wait a moment, what was that again?

** I believe that a patronus changing to match another's isn't a sign of love, necessarily. I think it's a sign of obsession.

Patronuses reflect your personality based on cultural archetypes. Therefore, a person whose patronus has changed to match someone else's has begun to define themselves by the object of their obsession. Snape obsessed over Lily, and Tonks with Remus. It's been covered in depth elsewhere why the latter's relationship was unhealthy af so I won't go on a deep dive here, but suffice to say, definitely had some obsessive traits.

*** Per Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  The form of a Patronus may change during the course of a witch or wizard's life. Instances have been known of the form of the Patronus transforming due to bereavement, falling in love or profound shifts in a person's character. Thus Nymphadora Tonks's Patronus changes from a jack rabbit to a wolf (not a werewolf) when she falls in love with Remus Lupin.
#+end_quote

While Snape was obsessed, his was a sign of bereavement and Tonks was a sign of being in love.

**** I mean, that was also written by the same person who signed off on Cursed Child, so her grasp on her own universe's rules is dubious at best.

** The fact that Snape is basically a Nazi does not mean that he's incapable of feeling love or grief or an other, similarly profound emotion towards Lily or her memory, okay?

​

And besides, maybe his Patronus is naturally a doe independent of Lily In fact, maybe Lily's Patronus matches his, not the other way around :P

** I've seen several SS postwar fics where the Patronus is a result of his vow to protect Harry, and once the war is over it reverts to something else.
