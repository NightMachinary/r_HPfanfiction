** Seventh Horcrux

A Black Comedy

Prince of the Dark Kingdom

Emperor

Harry Potter and the Other Path

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived

Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool

The Thief of Hogwarts

Grow Young with Me

Contractual Invalidation

I'd probably change my mind on a few of these if I heard arguments for other fics, but this is a quick list of favorites trying to hit a few different categories.

  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.

  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging-- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there-- especially when you've got three mischievous children and a handful of students who can't seem to do more than ogle at you.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** It's more of a favourite list, as I haven't read all that many fics and it's based on my personal opinion, but these are the fics that come to mind.

Sum of Their Parts: The friendship Harry has with Ron, Hermione and the DA is my favourite aspect. I was not really a fan of the premise but it's well executed. It's not high on my favourites, there are parts I take issue with (Kingsley and McGonagall), still I feel it's in the top ten of the 'best' fics.

Stages of Hope: I consider this fic to be very unusual, some of the changes in the other dimension are considerable strange. It is however very sweet and although I do have some minor issues with it, it rates high on my favourites and in turn my 'best list'.

Seventh Horcrux: I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at a written piece of work. There are just so many quotable moments and it easily comes in second for my all time favourite, and deserves a place on the 'best' list.

Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince: I was a little bit disappointed in the lack of both Ginny-centric fics and differing POVs on the HP books, this of course satisfies both of these desires. It feels exactly like a companion piece to the Half Blood Prince, and rates high in my favourites of all time.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]]: It feels very much like a sequel to Harry Potter, if perhaps a little darker at times. I enjoyed the thought the author put into the magic, the characters and the plot. The main 'enemy' isn't just a re-skin of the Death Eaters, which was nice, I also loved the overarching mystery. It's definitely one of my favourites.

#+begin_quote
  A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot.
#+end_quote

Harry Potter and the Natural 20: My all time favourite and sadly incomplete. It has a lot of heart and humour in addition to an entertaining plot. I particularly liked the Muggle sections.

Cauterize: Although there is something about [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4008738/1/Red-Ink-Remains][Red Ink Remains]] that touched me more, Cauterize captures the same feelings and is understandable more popular.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][Professor C. Binns: A Personal History]]: It manages to be very sweet for a fic focused on such an unusual character. It's also one of my favourites.

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book: Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record. This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small. Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf. Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.
#+end_quote

Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time: It captured the 'feeling' of the Harry Potter series, I also loved the way the Potter-Weasley families interracted.

Not From Others: I read (most of) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness][Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness]] and was ultimately disappointed. Not From Others was a nice alternative, it felt pretty much what I imagined the events of Hogwarts in DH to be. It's also manages to capture Ginny's character and is high on my favourite list.

** I'll go with five. I've limited myself to one per author or I'd just fill it up with TheEndless7, Starfox5 and White Squirrel stuff.

- Vox Corporis - maybe too fluffy and the ending drags on, but a great Harmony story.
- Patron - incredibly inventive plot, superb fight scenes and great characters,
- Vitam Paramus - a story the author admits has no plot, but which kept me gripped from start to finish. And beyond. Probably the best character piece in hpff,
- Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past - perennially unfinished story but the quality of writing is almost unmatched ,
- The Accidental Animagus - generally great. Picked over other White Squirrel stories because it starts good and stays good; The Arithmancer (for example) takes a bit long to get going.

Five that are almost good enough : * Quoth the Raven, Nevermore, * What we're Fighting For, * Harry Potter and the Champions Champion, * The Lie I've Lived, * A Different Halloween

Yes, that last one is a robst story. I like it because it's what robst does well - ie, the good guys win everything - but it doesn't pretend to be anything else. Voldemort is neutralised right at the start and after that we just get a look at what could have been.

This has actually been quite instructive: the amount of stuff on my favourites list that really needs removing is higher than I'd like to admit.

** 1. Cursed Child\\
2. Fantastic Beasts (more sequels coming!!!)\\
3. My Immortal (tied with Harry Crow and HPMOR tbh)\\
4. 19 years later (one shot)\\
5. @JK_Rowling (kinda hops around a bit, but funny and not abandoned!)

Seriously though, my top five I really couldn't put in any particular order:

1. A Black Comedy\\
1. Cauterize\\
1. Dementor's Stigma\\
1. Browncoat, Green Eyes\\
1. Stages of Hope

Next five are fics that while I may not have found interesting, for the fandom as a whole they are excellent:

6. Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool\\
7. The Brave New World\\
8. Psychic Serpent series\\
9. Saving Connor series\\
10. Shoebox Project

Honestly there are just so many authors who have done amazing things with this fandom that to pick any 10 as the best does a great disservice to any person reading said list because it automatically implies the rest aren't worth reading. There are dozens of influential authors that created and destroyed ideas and cliches and bent the HP world in ways previously unimaginable, all while taking the time and energy to have decent spelling and grammar. And there are almost as many on ffnet and ao3 today as have been lost to server corruption and dried up donations.

You'd almost have to pick a top ten by month started/finished every month going back to 2003 at the minimum, and there'd still be an argument to be made. If you as a reader take the time and effort to explore the history of the fandom, largely by reading through those smaller sites and reading through the current top authors' favorites, you can see for yourself just how the fandom had grown and matured from 2003-2013. Sure for every author writing with their heart there were a dozen who didn't know how to or didn't bother to use reasonable writing technique, but even through those you can follow as the ideas and cliches changed over time.

*** While I do agree that Fantastic Beasts is a great work of fiction and definitely my favorite fanfiction from the last year, 19 years later isn't that great - it's not only the pairings, but also the names of the children.

Cursed Child is horrible, and even worse than the already bad "My Immortal". Seriously, full of tropes, and not well-executed. The name starts with "Harry Potter and", but Harry is nothing but an incompetent asshole in the story.

@JK_Rowling has some good ideas, but sometimes it's outright annoying in the middle, and the author sometimes really fails to do their research (For example: PewDiePie - while I'm no fan of the YouTuber, accusing him of being a nazi is an insult to the victims of real nazis.)

** Seeing as I haven't branched much outside of Dramione fanfics, my list is not representative of the entire fandom, and not very long (though technically 9 stories), but they're ones I'd recommend to fans of a good-quality, plot-driven romance.

This World or Any Other series (Clean, Marked, Youth) linkffn(Clean by olivieblake; Marked by olivieblake; Youth by olivieblake)

- Compellingly-written "timeless" romance between Hermione and Draco (can't explain for spoilers) in the first two stories with a very intriguing pre-quel delving into the Snape/Lily/James dynamic

To Begin Again linkffn(To Begin Again by RZZMG)

- OoTP looses the war and Hermione and Draco lead a group of rebels with the remaining members and a few new ones to take down Lord Mort once and for all. Wish it were complete, is still slowly being updated.

The Dangerverse linkffn(Living with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow; Living without Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow; Dealing with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow; Facing Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow; Surpassing Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow)

- Hermione is raised by her older sister, Danger, after their parents are killed. Danger, who also happens to babysit Harry for the Dursleys runs into Lupin while babysitting. The series deals follows the four of them as the add more to their growing "pack". Very enchanting, exciting, funny series
