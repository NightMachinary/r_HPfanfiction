So I left this story pretty much abandoned for a good 5ish years before I decided to start writing it again.

Premise is that after the triwizard tournament Hecate decides that Harry Potter should have a guard on him and sends some demigods to keep watch at hogwarts.

Please let me know what you think!

** It's pretty good. I suggest having Percy as a bail-out card like in trials of Apollo. Also, there's a sentence error: =Every Ollivander wand has a core of magical two Ollivanders wand is the same, just as no two magical substances are quite the same=

*** I haven't read trials of apollo. Could you elaborate on what you mean as a bail out?

Also, whoops. That's embarrassing, I read over those chapters like twice before I updated them. XD I'll have to edit it when I gain access to a computer. I've just got my phone right now.

**** When the protagonists encounter an impassable problem that isn't the main antagonist, someone comes and helps. He can't help with Voldemort

***** Ah! Okay, that makes sense. Hmmm... that might work. Though I have concerns about bringing him in because of his physical similarity to Harry, and the somewhat shared name with Percy Weasley. Might get a bit confusing.

Hmmm, I could try Annabeth or Piper...
