** Ayyy I'm currently co-writing a fic with an angry/emotional/volatile Harry! Our genre is canon-divergent angst, with some tragedy/horror, and Harry is most certainly a mess & can't deal.

If you're interested, our fic is on ffnet & ao3: linkao3(A Lamb Before the Slaughter)

#+begin_quote
  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
