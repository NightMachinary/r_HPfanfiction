** "Uh, Professor? I might have made a deal with the devil to help get us rid of Voldemort. Not *the* Devil, but, uh, one of his sisters. And she might be my girlfriend. Except, less a girlfriend and more a fiance. Uh, yeah. Help?"

"Oh honey-buns, we're going to have so much fun when we have our honeymoon on the abyssal plains! All the screaming of damned souls to welcome our new life of matrimony under big brother Samael!"

Harry gave her a strange look, and she chuckled. "I can't exactly say "under Father" now, can I?" She snapped her fingers. "Oh! We might see some old Death Eaters in the Pit of Boiling Felix Felicis! Ain't that something?"

*** "Uh, dear?" That still sounded strange coming from his mouth.

"Yes?" She turned and batted her eyelashes at him. And her two eyelids.

"Please stop setting Malfoy's bum on fire. It was funny at first, but the smell of burning ferret is getting a bit much."

She blinked. "Oh. Should I just flay him alive instead?"

She raised her hand, pointed a finger... and dropped it when Harry hurriedly smooched her.

Malfoy lived another day. Except he was on fire.

** Harry cleared his throat, squared his shoulders. And entered dumbledors office.

"Ah harry, my boy, how are you?" Dumbledors ever present friendliness met harry as soon as he walked in.

Harry cleared his throat a second time.

"Oh you know, exams, incompetent dark arts teacher, voldemort wanting to kill me, accidentally summoned a great old one. So, you know. The usual"

Dumbledor laughed.

"I suppose you mean cthuhlu? He has a unique sense of humor i must say"

Not for the first time, harry wondered if dumbledor had finally gone off the edge.

** /This is bad, but I really like the prompt so... Also I'm not sure why when I saw "a being far more powerful" I thought of Merlin, but whatever./

The forest trembled with incredible force. From the ground beneath an old, mangled English Oak rose a robed figure, bathed in blinding white light.

"'lo, it is I, Merlinus, King of Sorcerers, God of the Natural Magicks, returnéd from Everlasting Sleep to rain down upon ye vengeance most terrible."

With a wave of his hand he cleared a large path through the trees, violently ripping their roots from the ground, and began to walk away from his accursed tomb toward the world he would soon conquer.

"Kneel before me," he spoke to the universe at large, "for I am your new-"

He stopped. Ahead of him in the path stood an old man, clothed in robes of deepest purple, foolishly blocking him from his destiny.

"Hello," said the man, giving a little wave.

The Great and Terrible Merlin intensified his ambient glow, looking more intimidating than ever. He laughed heartily. "You fool of a man. Ye dare impede me?"

"Oh, don't mind me. I'm just watching," the man said, looking like someone who'd wandered into a museum accidentally and figured he ought to take a look at things while he was there.

"I shall conquer this world, fool, with the might of my magicks!" Merlin bellowed, raising his arms and making the entire forest rise with them.

The old man nodded. "Not a bad plan. Bit unoriginal. If I may..." he raised a wand he'd been holding and slowly, quietly, a few of the trees around them began to re-root themselves.

Merlin deflated like a sad rubber ball. "You, too, have affinity with the magicks?"

"I do," said the man, smiling.

"Tell me, old fool, does the preposterous and bedeviled school my contemporaries began still exist?"

"It does."

Merlin sidled up to the old man, his glowing aura all but extinguished. "Tell me what ye know of Slytherin. Does he live?"

The man smiled. "No. Not for a thousand years. I understand you were in Slytherin's house when Hogwarts first began?"

Merlin raged and the forest raged with him. "I certainly was not! That bastard Slytherin dares to insult the name of Merlinus, King of the Natural Magicks, God Among the Trees. I hath never attended Hogwarts nor have I for a moment thought to consort with serpents and their ilk."

"Noted," the man said. He began walking down the path out of the forest and Merlin walked beside him.

"That son of a whore, Slytherin," Merlin continued. "Always hated him."

They walked on, the man smiling pleasantly while Merlin raged about Slytherin, the trees falling back into place in their wake.

** A couple recs here.

Harry Potter and the Elder Sect is a Bewitched crossover... and the only thing you need to know about it is that Sam could kick Dumbledore's ass by wiggling her nose. It's a comedy.

Grimdark is not a comedy. Well, mostly. Harry was banished to a hell dimension, and they eventually summon him back. Only... it's been longer for him, and in the meantime he's become a warlord type person in hell. I'm pretty sure my description makes it sound like trash, but I assure you its good lol.
