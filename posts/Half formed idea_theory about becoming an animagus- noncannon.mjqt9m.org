This idea came into being while wondering how every animagus ends up with a form that is actually useful.

At some point the prospective animagus must meditate on what they want/need from their animal form, likely after drinking the potion . This includes size(possibly) and the intent they have for using the form. Like James and Sirius needed forms big enough to manage a werewolf, Peter needed a form small enough to get to the Whomping Willow and Skeeter needed a form to eavesdrop on people.

The potion and meditation work with their magic to effectively scan through all of the different animals that the prospective animagus knows about. The forms are filtered out so only those that fit the requirements (James would have had house cats and ferrets filtered out). Once animals that fit the size requirement, the potion works through both intent and personality to find a suitable form. Let's say James was more likely to try and avoid an unnecessary fight while Sirius was more apt to charge head on, James gets the stag and Sirius gets the grim/big dog.

After discovering their animal form the transfiguration comes into play. They need to know as much as they can about their form so they can visualize themselves turning into that animal then /will/ themselves into that change.


** Can someone write a fic about this? Or recommend one?
