I recently read linkffn(The Lonely Letters) and now I'm looking for other romance fics that give me the same feeling. Basically just any fic (regardless of pairing) that has/focuses on a mushy/happy romance with no emotionally traumatizing events surrounding the couple. For example, I read linkffn(Hope and Healing by gomez36000), but the abuse that harry and fleur go through made the fic much less enjoyable than it could have been for me.

I'm not saying that any conflict is bad, just please avoid stuff like super emotionally abusive dursleys.

Anyways, thanks for any recs possible, I just really feel like happy/sappy romance fics right now!

** linkao3(A Much Needed Holiday)

It's a nice, harmless Harry/Fleur AU fic. Pretty much exactly what you asked for.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/485218][Storm in a Teacup]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7678270][Cake]] are cute oneshots with no explicit content.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5277644][A Convenient Impracticality]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1439476/chapters/3046141][An Issue of Consequence]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1157217][Matchmaker, Matchmaker]] are longer fics that have some smut but they're not the focus of the story so you can definitely just skip past the scenes.

  For reasons he'd rather not think about, Draco is obsessed with Potter's hair. This cannot end well.

  Somehow Harry ends up agreeing to a fake relationship with his ex-nemesis-turned-friendly-acquaintance-with-benefits, except for some reason it involves an awful lot of actual dating and, sadly, not much sex. Confused? Harry is too, but when has anything with Draco Malfoy ever been as straightforward as it seems?

  Draco has woken up in an alternate universe. Or he has woken up utterly insane. Nothing else can possibly explain why Harry Potter suddenly seems to think he's Draco's boyfriend.
