** I started to read Witches of Salem just now, and immediately closed it when one of them called it Teleportation rather than Apparition. Also, wth is "Senior Year"? I'm assuming they are spending 7th year at Salem, but the Americanism is jarring, and I'm American!

**** I'm sure if I wrote a long form fanfiction I would put in a lot of subtle Americanisms that would bother british readers, but getting, and more specifically having Hermione get, common words and phrases wrong just shatters my reading experience.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor by closerserpents) is pretty much the go-to for something of this nature.

** Some of the more interesting kink can be found on Ficwad.

[[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun]] by Vanir- Harry discovers that he was bred by Lily to integrate half the humanoid magical creatures into his makeup, which leads to him bedding all sorts of girls primarily from Norse mythology, but kicking off with Gabrielle Delacour. It's ridiculously over the top and yet sometimes weirdly grounded- Harry takes some time off before going to meet with Jormungandr to participate in a bicycle marathon. Either you'll like it or you won't.

Then there's [[http://ficwad.com/story/105633][A Different Way of Looking At Things]] by radiofishlip which explores BDSM with magic added in, as written by someone quite informed about the real BDSM lifestyle... or at least I assume, since it tracks with what I've read elsewhere about it.

**** Yeah, Ficwad is having a malfunction where it's marking everything as queued for deletion. A number of authors have tried contacting them about it. No idea why, so get 'em while you can.

** I'm a big fan of linkffn(Safe Word is Devil's Snare)! It's a Neville/Hermione fic with a BDSM relationship, might fit what you're looking for (though - there's a whole lot of kinks, so it also might not).

  When there's a significant drop in the magical population, stressed Unspeakable Hermione Granger finds the answer. The Wizengamot threatens a Marriage Law unless a temporary Procreation Bill can make them see reason. Fortunately for Hermione, her chosen spouse knows how to work out all of her tension. --- Rated M for language and sexual scenes (Neville/Hermione) *Art by Simona Polle*
