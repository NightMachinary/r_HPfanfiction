*** The whole Dumbledore bashing genre is ridiculous to me. Especially the ones where he's stealing from Harry.

Like the dude quite literally saved the whole world a while back. These same fics usually have a shitton of people gifting Harry their Wizengamot seats and life savings over saving /one country/. Following that logic, Dumbledore must have received a bloody /fortune/.

And even if not, he's held three extremely prestigious positions for /decades/ while having free housing, food and healthcare at Hogwarts, so he should be stupidly wealthy from that alone. Like imagine receiving two salaries of a high-ranking politician plus a ridiculously tenured headmaster salary /in the world's best learning facility/ for /decades/, without having to pay any living costs nor housing taxes, while living the relatively modest life that Dumbledore lives. He could literally buy a new rainbow robe, a bag of lemon drops and a bunch of hookers every single day and still end up in the positive after his monthly paychecks come in.

There is literally /no reason whatsoever/ for him to steal from Harry. The only thing Harry has which Dumbledore can't acquire otherwise is the Cloak Hallow, and even then it's something Dumbledore /gave/ to Harry after holding it for ten years. And very much likely something that he could get back for whatever amount of time he wanted if he just asked Harry for it.

God, now I wish to make a thread for poking holes in bashing fics. Shame it would be downvoted to shit before it can be seen.

Also, the 'funding the Order' thing seriously baffles me at times. It's a small group with around 20(if that) members, which are willing vigilantes, that does small time information gathering, sits in a corridor at the DoM for a whole year and sometimes has dinner at Sirius's house. What is there to fund?

On a related note, it feels like every single fic that has the Weasleys stealing ludicrous amounts of money still has them living in the collapsing shithole that is the Burrow and using hand-me-downs. Where does the money even go, towards Arthur's plug collection?!

On to the Weasleys... I always pictured them as being bad with money. Yeah, they are good at stretching what they have, but as soon as they get excess money? Oh, let's go buy some muggle stuff.

**** Well, he had expenditures, quite a lot actually. He was running his own paramilitary group and even though some of the expanses a regular war has do not apply in a magical world (ammunition for example), the most basic is still the people fighting for him. And assuming that Dumbledore isn't a heartless bastard, he will pay for medical treatments and the like if people get wounded fighting for him.

And perhaps more importantly, payments to the next of kin since the Order had a horrible death toll. It would be the decent thing to do, ensue that no family will be forced to beg in the streets because a member died for him. And 50 or more of such payments each month add up to quite a bit.

Granted, that does not mean that he's stealing from Harry, but he certainly needs some money for the Order.

From what I got from the NHS website for veterans, they don't deal with military injuries, those go to a special hospital paid for by the Ministry of Defense. The NHS coordinates and might pay for follow-ups if you are dismissed, but as far as I understood things, they don't deal with the Military stuff directly, the MoD does.

Which would mean that if you are caught in a Death Eater attack, you get coverage (obviously). But if you go off on your own to pursue military stuff like hunting death eaters, that's on your own. Just like deliberately self-harming isn't covered (outside of mental illness).

Aside from the members of the OotP who are Aurors, or otherwise in the DMLE, they are civilians so just turning up at the hospital will get them treatment. Even if they keep turning up with horrific injuries and are evasive about how they got them. Only issue they might run into is drug-seeking behaviour stuff (assuming that's a thing in the magical world).

****** With the Electoral college system you can. States are allowed to allocate their electoral votes however they please. Which can cause a "split vote" where part of the states population votes for one candidate, the other votes for another candidate getting even amounts of votes because of a third candidate which splits the electoral college votes. It's happened before, the most famous being the election of Woodrow Wilson, since the Republicans didn't want Roosevelt to run he ran under a third party, split the republican votes and caused Wilson to win.

A good example of this today would be if say Bernie Sanders ran under a third party, California being a very predominantly blue state would be split on who to vote for, so Trump could in this scenario win California because he got more votes than either Biden or Bernie.

In the 2016 election Hillary won 8 million votes compared to Trumps 4 million in California this caused her to get the electoral college votes for California. If a third candidate ran that caused California to vote differently, what could happen is Hillary could have gotten 4 million votes, the third candidate could have gotten another 4 Million and Trump would have a chance to win California because of it. that's what i mean by Split the vote.

******* You are living in the assumption that a party member is entitled to the total state worth of an electoral count. The candidate gets the number of electoral votes based on representatives signing in for them based on percentage of popular votes. If enough people choose the other options a rep can choose, at their whim, to "split the vote."

A case from the 2016 election is the 1 electoral vote in Washington State for Native American activist Faith Spotted Eagle.

Now, if you can't rally what is supposed to be your support base and they choose another candidate. You didn't get the vote. Tough.

The two political parties have spent a long time absorbing marginalized groups and so if anyone that actually supports the marginalized platform shows up votes will diverge from the two party monoliths.

Splitting the vote is used as tool to blame shift the failure of a political party that constantly doesn't deliver on promises at best and profits on voter exploitation at worse.

There was this oneshot rec'd around here recently which was a really good take on why Hagrid couldn't get a wand after CoS - that he wasn't expelled for /opening the Chamber/ (which they couldn't prove) but for raising Aragog in a school (which he readily admitted to, of course) and how Dumbles and Dippett only kept him out of Azkaban by pulling in a ton of favors.

It was this great conversation sometimes in 6th year with Harry and Dumbles, and it was all perfectly in-character and canon-feeling, until it went right off the rails at the end with this bit about "what it meant to be a Light Lord" and I was just like Ôº¢Ôº≤ÔºµÔº®

That's what sets me off more than anything else, I think: when a fic /seems/ like it's going to be perfectly normal and reasonable, then springs some meme bullshit out of nowhere in chapter fucking 40. The worst offender by far IME is the "trust vault"/"Potters were twice as rich as the Malfoys and have properties in 13 countries", which comes out of nowhere in unrelated "what-if" stories and adds NOTHING to them. There's no reason to even have it unless the author somehow thinks it's canon.

***** "Light Lord" is so thematically wrong for the setting, too. The HP canon is absolutely suffused with the idea that /power corrupts/ - you see it with Dumbles and Grindelwald, with the Ministry, and literally with the Horcruxes. It's what the whole narrative of the Hallows is about. The whole idea of being a "Lord" is antithetical to being a good person, in the HP setting: a "Light" person in the Potterverse is someone who /gives up/ power and prestige when it's offered.

It's fanfic, of course, you can write something with completely different themes than canon has if you want. But if you write about "Light Lord" bollocks in a fic that purports to be otherwise canon-compliant, I get the impression you haven't read the same books that I did.

******* I always assumed that the cottage at Godric's Hollow was where they planned to live. I'm sure James' parents had a larger home, but for a 20 year old couple, a mansion doesn't sound right. Also, we know that they were part of the Order, so either they didn't work at all, or had day jobs. If there was no war, I'd assume they had day jobs (again, they're young, they don't want to be stuck at home), but with the prophecy, they couldn't.

And there are differences between the Malfoys and the Potters. For one, we know that the Malfoys live off their fortune and Lucius whispers things in the Ministers ear, and James Potter doesn't seem the type to sit at home. Neither does Lily for that matter.

Look, I'm not saying they weren't rich, I'm saying there was nothing remarkable about them as people. There are many, many rich people in the world. I'm saying there was nothing special about Lily, James and Harry, and their names, which aren't anything special either, are indicative of that FOR ME. I think they were privileged people, who, fine, had an easier life than most money wise, but there wasn't anything that made them special other than the prophecy.

TL;DR- the prophecy wasn't about Lily, James and Harry because they were special. They were special because the prophecy was about them.

EDIT: Also, according to Pottermore, the Potters didn't make any money off of skele grow.

"Historians credit Linfred as the originator of a number of remedies that evolved into potions still used to this day, including Skele-gro and Pepperup Potion"

So Linfred inspired skele grow and pepper up potion, but they only patented and made money off of sleekeasy. Still a big fortune, but only one potion.

Also, Fleamont sold the company when he retired, so if Lily and James wanted to grow the family fortune to pass on to Harry, they would have had to work. Living off of it both went against what generations before them had done to grow it and also would have exhausted the vault.

b) the Prophecy- they couldn't leave the house.

The Wizarding World wouldn't have the housekeeper problem- they have house elves and magic.

"God Damn You" for example is a curse in the truest sense of the word - you are calling the wrath of God onto their person, and saying they deserve to be damned for all eternity for what they've done.

** I have one that tends to happen in more Romance stories. Usually to recognise that Harry has grown up a bit, and used a lot by adult characters

‚ÄúThe boy, no, young man‚Äù.

It doesn't flow very well, and it's a bit cringy.

The other one is a very specific example that annoyed me so much that I forgot the name of the fic.

‚ÄúBack to topic...‚Äù.

This annoyed me so much because every time the Harry of the story was having a conversation with someone, and the conversation would deviate into a slight tangent, but still important to the subject at hand, he would say this as if he'd and other characters actually, had actually gone off topic. Anything that was anything not completely, the precise information that needed to be spoken about at that minute was book ended by ‚ÄúBack to topic‚Äù

E.g.

‚ÄúVoldemort created seven horcruxes‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat are horcruxes Harry?‚Äù ‚ÄúHorcuxes are dark magic, whereby, a Witch or Wizard can conceal a part of their soul, which will be protected should they die. Voldemort created seven:- Slytherin's Locket, Hufflepuff's Cup, The Diadem of Ravenclaw, The Ring of Peverell, Tom Riddle's Diary, Nagini the snake, and something else we don't know. Back to Topic‚Äù.

It's so jarring, especially when used in an on-topic conversation.

Edit: Also any shitty and cringy nickname for Voldemort and the Death Eaters. I believe it's kinda disrespectful to the victims and those who suffered under them the first time. It also sort of ignores the point of ‚ÄúFear of the name only increases fear of the thing itself‚Äù.

** So I'm curious, where the in dumbledores ass did Hadrian as a name for harry come from? And while we are on that all the political fics that make an 11-year-old some master politician and speechmaker who can curb stomp the government into doing whatever he wants.

Any of the stupid nicknames, worst ones for me being hermy, mione, or dumbles.

Making the entire wizarding world in on it when they bash Dumbledore to make him a thief and/ or a secret serial killer. Weasleys stealing from Harry or being paid off to be his friend.

All the inheritance bullshit that makes Gringotts the most powerful secret organization that can ruin anyone purely because Harry was polite to them.

the worst one for me though is when you have these children racking up more titles and last names than the medieval royals of europe

*** I think people thought that ‚ÄúThe dark lord Harry Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor‚Äù wasn't snobbish enough, so they changed it to ‚ÄúThe dark lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor‚Äù Basically they wanted their dark and evil version of Harry to fit in with the likes of ‚ÄúDraco‚Äù and ‚ÄúPansy‚Äù and ‚ÄúLucius‚Äù and ‚ÄúSeverus‚Äù, and of course Harry is much too boring of a name and not nearly pompous enough to belong to this all powerful, somehow suddenly pureblood Harry Potter.

Harry canonically has more of an aversion to Slytherin than Ron - Ron's only concern about being placed there is wondering how his parents would react to him breaking the Weasley all-Gryffindor streak, and there's no indication that they would have cared too much.

*** I'm actually fine with "Harold" being used if he /has/ to have a longer/'official' name purely for paperwork. It's probably the least-used name in that capacity.

Hadrian as a name pretty much means "please punch me in the face". No sane parent, even in the Wizarding World, would name their kid that - and it doesn't even shorten to "Harry" all that well.

Harrison is patronymic, as in "Son of Harry". If Harrison is an acceptable name for someone with social standing, then that ironically means "Harry" would be just as acceptable. I think too many authors don't realize that.

Of course, around 60% of the time the name is changed at all (the 40% is fem!Harry), the accompanying Lord Potter wankfest will piss me off regardless, but for that infinitesimal amount of fanfics that change the 'official' name of a male Harry without devolving into said wankfest, by all means use Harold as his paperwork-name.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
