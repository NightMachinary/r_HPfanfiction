Whether Dumbledore is just incompetent, senile, or had a sinister plan for Harry I want them all.


** Linkffn(the harem war) is a . . .classic of the genre. Oh, spoilers, the sex stops half way through for some reason.

  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi

** linkffn(Prophecy Smophecy) is completely ridiculous. In it, Dumbledore is an evil maniac who actually tried to kill Harry on countless occasions. It doesn't help that it's incredibly badly written.

  Starts at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. As Harry stands over the dead body of Voldemort he realizes something. Bad Dumbledore. One shot.
