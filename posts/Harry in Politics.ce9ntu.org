So I haven't been on Reddit in ages. I actually kinda forgot about it *Blush* but I'm getting back into Harry Potter fanfiction after some time away & so I'm Really hoping that you guys won't let me down

​

I'd like to start out with my favorite Trope:

​

Some Good old fashioned Harry Centric, *Political fics.* You know, the Cliched, Harry is/Becomes Lord of his House (s) and wheels and Deals with the Wizengamot, IWC, other Houses etc...

​

Now I prefer Slash, but as long as the story is good, I'll take it.

​

Now a Great Example is

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

** I know quite a few really good fics where Hermione goes into politics while Harry does his dream job as an auror. Would you like these too or is it strictly Harry centric?

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
