For those who don't know, in which case I would tell you to read the story and its prequel, I am talking about how the British Ministry and the Good GuysTM (Harry, Dumbledore, etc.) are in exile in France and the war with Voldemort and his allies went on a continental scale with a more Cold War aspect than your regular war and Greyback expanding his army of werewolves and terrorising Europe. I am personally digging the now more common international politics as well as seeing Voldemort ruling wizarding Britain openly and not through a Vichy-style puppet government like in canon and just seeing and getting more info about the other wizarding countries. But what do you guys think of it? I'm honestly curious as to what the fandom think about the premise and its execution by White Squirrel.


** I have already (many many chapters ago) wrote [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][a review]], which included my comments on this story, and so far I stand behind it.

On top of that I have two comments:

1. Bloody length of the story. JKR complained that HPOotP was rushed to the publisher and it needed more editing, which made it according to her too long. That's 38 chapters. 38 times 7 is 266 chapters for the whole series as the longest case scenario (the shortest scenario, seven times HPPS is 119 chapters, and we are already over). Animagus saga currently stands at 147 chapters, and it feels more like the basic setup of the story than coming to its conclusion, so we may get to that worst-case scenario eventually. In terms of the war, it feels like we are at the Battle of Smolensk (that's June 1941) or at the Coral Sea (May 1942). The Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Midway are far ahead of us in the dim future, and nobody can even dream about Berlin or Hiroshima (not that we should dream about that). To close the story down, there will be either some horrible case of the Harry Potter /ex machina/, throwing the Ring to the Mount Doom and swiping away in one move all the armies of the Dark Lord including the mighty Tower of the Barad-dûr. Or we should expect another hundred chapters of this boring Goblin rebellion, and $DEITY have mercy on our souls! The author threatens us with another thirty chapters, but I don't feel like he can make it is in so few without the story being incredibly rushed.

2. Complete loss of the human element in the story. It is a very similar problem to linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5). Not that there would be not enough action: battle after battle runs over the pages, in this case, all of them lost, in other all of them won, but there are no humans in the story, and it is as fun to read as the history textbook about the Thirty-Years War (or the mentioned Goblin rebellion) or minutes of business meetings (which it effectively is). Lost are the stories about Harry Potter catching a mouse, the last one which had at least some personal element was The Boxing Day with the confused Muggle friends finding themselves at Hogwarts, but that was sixteen chapters ago (whole Philosopher's Stone, the book which made JKR famous, was seventeen chapters). When was the last time somebody said something personal or whimsical? What is Luna doing? Hermione? Did she kiss Neville or not yet (I honestly forgot)? We don't know and I am losing hope we will ever learn because we have to read another long and boring chapter where some impersonal armies fight with other impersonal armies somewhere who knows where (even if it is in my Prague, where I live; thank you, after linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities) and [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=130160][Hiding in Plain Sight by GinevrasChampion]] only the third case, where the author noticed that there are other cities in Europe than Paris). And I don't even care which one is which and which one loses.

That's not even a boring historical topic and you can easily turn it into a good drinking game. Or you can get a power metal band to tell you the story.

**** I know that, I am a Czech living in Prague, the War started here in the Prague Castle, but it is horribly difficult to tell the story, so that all students don't fall asleep. Otherwise you get a long list of armies marching there and back and fighting battle there and there, and ... snoring is the only reply you get. On the other hand, I always wondered why any European in their clear mind would be at least interested in the western films, when American history is so plain and boring comparing to our own. We don't have to artificially create heroes from cowboys, when actual heroic stories with knights on white horses saving maidens in distress actually happened all around us. However, that's my other pet-peeve.

In the same manner, I believe the goblin rebellions could be interesting story as well, but ... Professor Binns.

It's all about how you tell the story. Sabaton gets people interested because their music is catchy and people want to know what they were singing about. Paradox games teach you a lot of history through events, decisions and the player looking up those things on Wikipedia afterwards. Same goes for World of Tanks/Warships and War Thunder. You just want to read up on some obscure vehicle and ten clicks later you are reading about the technical workings of radar or how the sterling engine was developed.

But just listing stuff gets boring. If you name the battles, commanders and so on, no one will listen. But if you, for example, preface the Swedish intervention with the fate of Magdeburg, skim over minor skirmishes and describe the valiant end of Gustav Adolph of Sweden, that gets people invested. Sadly, not only Binns suffers from this canon. Astronomy could be a very interesting subject, as could transfiguration or potions. Yet the teachers fail to get the students invested.

****** Well, I am not that bloodthirsty to enjoy the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Magdeburg][Sack of Magdeburg]], but I am certain many people would enjoy it. I prefer for myself story of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Amos_Comenius][Jan Amos Komenský]]; it is a very sad story of a pilgrim going through the continent which fell to madness, desperately trying to find a place of peace of hope for himself and for his nation, and in the losing everything, his wife, his family, his work, his home. Not very happy story, but with a bit transcendental but good ending: his work is known today, his beloved Unitas for which he wrote [[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:The_Last_Will_and_Testament_of_the_Dying_Mother_The_Unity_of_Brethern][its Testament]] was renewed, he was finally honoured in the end of his life. But yes, you have to pick smaller stories, and make them personal.

**** I agree - the one historical text I've read on the Thirty-Years War was fascinating and a great read. Then again, it was an actual history book - and not a textbook for pre-university students, which would probably be a much more boring experience.

*** I'd like to point out that "number of chapters" is not a great indicator of the length of a story - number of words would indicate that better. Depending on an author's style, chapters can be longer or shorter. GoF has 37 chapters, but isn't too long - 1 extra chapter is not why OOTP felt long.

If we go by # of words, the Accidental Animagus has ~700k, and the sequel is at ~180k - putting it at 880k total, and roughly on par with HP books 3-7 (920k words). 7 times the length of OOTP would be 1.8 million words, for comparison's sake.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I'm disappointed in the direction the story is going. At the beginning of that year, the good guys had 4 Dumbledore level grand wizards, plus a Ministry fully on their side. And yet, they were as passive as hell. In a way, they were even less competent than those dumbed down plot device adult good guys in canon. Bad guys, despite numerical inferiority and no superiority in raw magical power, are having all the initiative and launching one successful ops after another.

It's just pathetic.

*** Although I completely respect your opinion, your logic seems flawed. How exactly does the Light Side have numerical and raw magical power superiority? They do have Dumbledore, Grayson, Old Coyote, and Madame Fan, but the Dark Side has Voldemort, La Pantera, Jugashvilli, and that African dark wizard who I don't remember how to write his name (I think his first name is Kinani, but I'm not sure if that's how you write it).

Madame Fan is a Seer out of her prime by a large margin and did scried and searched for clues and such, but Jugashvilli was able to stop her and Trelawney and Cho because he was a Master and in his prime and I would imagine it's relatively easier to hide things you know from an old lady who could die at any moment and two inexperienced seers who don't know where and what to look for exactly.

Then you have Kinani who attacked Hogwarts with a Durmstrang fleet and helped by unknown spies who were spread throughout the four houses. Durmstrang is also a school that specialises its teaching in dark magic and duelling so the students are already better than your average Hogwarts student who is either to young and inexperienced to fight or doesn't properly know because of the shitty teachers they had in DADA since they begun schooling. The teachers have different degrees of fighting abilities and are only ten with Madam Pomfrey considering one is a ghost, the other was at the Ministry being a double-agent and the last one is busy fighting Kinani with the Headmaster. Kinani fought Grayson and Dumbledore, but the latter had to go because he had to help the students and Hogwarts just couldn't pull of a DE Battle of Hogwarts.

On the other side of the country, you have a supportive but still corrupted Ministry who is made out of mostly untrained in combat employees and must rely on a largely understaffed Law Enforcement Department. They also had to fight almost every Death Eaters with Voldemort and La Pantera and an army of werewolves when the Ministry only had Old Coyote to support them and he was late to the fight. So, no, the bad guys didn't have numerical inferiority or even raw power inferiority.

The Ministry also was being undermined by its own corruption so that's why they couldn't really arm themselves for the war and Dumbledore and his team were very productive on their side of things. Madame Fan, Trelawney and Cho were basically taking all the time they had to divine, Grayson taught useful defence at Hogwarts, Old Coyote I'll admit I don't remember, and Dumbledore and Harry and the Order were doing the Horcruxes thing and immediately acting upon what the seers found when they could, so you can't really call them unproductive and passive.

But thank you nonetheless for your answer.
