I'm looking for decent alternate universe stories where sirius has been proven innocent. I've read both Innocent and One World and have really enjoyed the changes it brings to the story. Definitely no slash and I'd like something of decent length or that's still being updated.

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.
#+end_quote

Well, Sirius wasn't proven innocent in here. More like cleared of all charges due to a loophole in the law and the Black family's meddling.

#+begin_quote
  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to 'As Black As Night'. One night can change a life. One night can change the world. One night can change everything. Forever. But as long as the stars are in the heavens, the House of Black can weather any hell. Rated M.

Would you also like some time-travel stories (Harry goes back in time to his first year at Hogwarts and arranges for Pettigrew to be caught)? I know a few good ones.

The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** This doesn't exactly fit your request, but it's kind of like it. There's the 'Danger' series by whydoyouneedyoknow. There are 4 completed parts and the final one is still in progress. The first part of the series is called Living With Danger. It's definitely AU and it's a very long series. The only thing is that Sirius gets broken out of Azkaban in the beginning of the first story, but he isn't proven innocent until towards the end of the first one. It's pretty good and I definitely recommend it. You can find it on ff.net, I would link, but I'm on mobile.
