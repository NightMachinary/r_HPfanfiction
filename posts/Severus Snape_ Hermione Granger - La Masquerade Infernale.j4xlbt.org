Hello everyone!

I am looking for a SS/HG fanfiction called La Masquerade Infernale! It was written by Emerald Sparrow. I even have the summary here:

/Severus Snape reluctantly attends a masquerade ball, and lays eyes on a mysterious witch in a bronze mask who entices him entirely. However, there may be much more to her than he realized./

I used to find it on [[https://fanfiction.net/][Fanfiction.net]] or AO3, but I think it might have been deleted. I was wondering if someone maybe had a copy of it. It is one of my favourite fanfictions.\\
Please let me know if you have it :)
