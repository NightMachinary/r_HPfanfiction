*** I don't think he joined the Order in "Wind Shear". In fact, he jumped all the way back to 1970, before Marauders even entered Hogwarts.

Later, he had serious disagreements with Dumbledore and McGonagall, but didn't stop him from turning Bellatrix and dissing Voldemort. As a consequence of his presence, Marauders never formed and the pairings became quite jumbled. [[/spoiler][I believe James got together with Narcissa and Sirius with Lily]]

**** Its more like Bellatrix threw herself at him cause she had the hots for him after witnessing his powerful Magics and his fighting capabilities.

He has a major fallout with McGonagall who is a right bitch at that point, but is on even grounds with Dumbledore. They dont like each other but they dont dislike each other openly either.

The pairing is as you say.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
