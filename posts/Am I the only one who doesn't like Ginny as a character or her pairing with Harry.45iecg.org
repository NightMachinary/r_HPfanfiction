** Strange. I've always gotten the vibe that most fans hate Ginny.

I don't mind Ginny; I've actually grown more appreciative of her over the years. I never read HP for romance so Im indifferent to most pairings, but I'd still rather her than some blank slate OC (or Draco or Snape).

That said, I do think that Ginny's character in the books had /so much more potential/ than what we saw. Riddle's possession of her in CoS is chilling and traumatic and laid the groundwork for, imo, what could've been fascinating character development. I only wish we'd gotten to see it.

** Personally the only issue I have and ever will have with Ginny is that she is underdeveloped in canon. In fanfic as long as the author does enough to develop her beyond being Ron's sister who is feisty, likes Quiddich, was possessed by Riddle's diary, and has had a crush on Harry since she was a kid I am completely fine with her. However, depicting her as the one who was meant to be with Harry, while leaving her as she is in canon doesn't really make sense to me.

I think this is almost as divisive as the question of Snape's legacy. I didn't like the second half of the series, so I hope that any dislike I'd harbour for Ginny would come from /that/ instead of the myriad half-truths that make up her role in fanon. My dislike for Ginny comes from the fact that she /has/ a personality, but she's a very boring Mary-Sue. This:

#+begin_quote
  Even Rowling admitted to regretting not pairing Hermione and Harry together.
#+end_quote

is just frankly not true. JKR said in an interview that Ron and Hermione might need some marriage counselling because of their 'fundamental incompatibility.' In regards to Harry, Jo only said that he and Hermione shared a few things when Ron was absent, not that they were perfectly suited to be in twoo wuv forever. Don't get me wrong, I /really/ like the trope of the brave hero ending up with the brainy but abrasive sidekick. But canon didn't go that way and given Jo's inability to write a coherent romance subplot I'm glad it didn't.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny as a character was essentially just a plot device for COS, with nothing else to offer beyond that.
#+end_quote

In that book, sure. In OotP, though, she left with Harry and the others to fight wizards in the Ministry who had /decades/ of experience using lethal Dark magic and a complete lack of empathy. She wasn't a wallflower and - despite her overwhelming Mary-Sue-ness in HBP - you have to give her that.

*** Agree with all of this! There's no way Harry and Hermione would've ended up together, based on my recollection of the books. He was never physically attracted to her (describing her as bushy haired, large-toothed, shrill or bossy voiced), he lied to her (about homework, triwizard tasks, practicing occlumency), she wasn't able to handle his moods (she was always on tenterhooks or tearful when he was angry), and he /hated/ bickering, whereas Hermione was a naturally argumentative person. From the very beginning of the series, Harry and Hermione are platonic friends and nothing more; I'd even go as far to say that /Ron/ was the middle-man in their friendship a lot of the time - both seemed to have more fun when Ron was around (whether in pairs or all three of them) than they did when Ron wasn't.

Note: No, being worried about somebody doesn't give you license to pry and go behind a person's back etc.))

Still, if they both matured, I could easily see them together (they share a background and they complement each other, his "leadership" and her drive to learn, her morals and his laid back attitude, his willingness to break the rules if necessary and her adherence to the rules (and to adults...I never understand why Hermione never gets it that Harry has a hard time trusting adults after being stuck at the Dursleys...I mean didn't she notice the neglect? If so then she's pretty blind (I mean Harry didn't advertise it, but it's plain to see IMHO if you are close to him...hell, the taped glasses and oversized hand-downs are a dead give away!))

** I like her from books 1 - 4. 5 and up, not so much.

I just feel she had so much more potential, and she was just thrown in our face especially in the 6th book. And she goes from being this super shy girl to massively popular/brave/gorgeous/smart/loyal/perfect...with no on-screen development.

Hard to like her when we're told she's all of the above instead of shown it. Especially compared to the other characters who we see grows and change for better or worse on screen.

She's perfect because she was created to be Harry's ultimate girl. She's not interesting on her own to me whatsoever.

I too would have wanted Harry/Hermione or Hermione/Viktor. I'm not pleased with 95% of canon pairings anyway.

This misrepresents what makes Mary-Sues a hallmark of amateur writing. The /lack of fallout/ from her more undesirable character traits is what makes her a boring character. In 'An Excess of Phlegm,' Ginny calls Fleur "worse than Umbridge," "full of herself," and "A cow," but is only slightly reprimanded by Molly for saying "Phlegm." Throughout the chapter, we see Fleur only as a young woman in love with excellent manners. Ginny is objectively /awful/, but suffers no meaningful repercussions for her poor behaviour.

**** Definitely! It's bizarre to see Ginny be so rude and Harry laughing along with it, when he hates the Dursleys, Dudley in particular, Draco, etc. for doing the same things. Also, he liked Fleur as a person so that whole scene just seemed weird to me. Ginny is a strong and motivated character, sure, but her rudeness, abrasiveness and downright demandingness (not a real word, I know) to be involved and included just rubbed me the wrong way.

EDIT: Also the whole "IT WAS HER THE WHOLE TIME" thing was just awfully executed. Her temper is just awful, and she reacts horribly to things, but it's played off as her Achilles Heel, she comes off as "funny" through the expense of others, and is just someone with qualities Harry used to stand up against but all of a sudden was ok. "Phlegm", pretending to vomit into her cereal because of Fleur, flouncing around in imitation, just.... no.

I agree about the Mary Sue-factor. It's not that she's portrayed as perfect, in this instance, but rather there are no consequences for her being mean or awful to people.

I think the reason for this is because JKR already knew that Harry and Ginny would end up together. It would be a lot harder to convince the reader that they belong together if Harry saw her awful personality traits as being anything other than interesting or humorous. Just because Harry's thinks something doesn't make it right.

I agree and wish we could have seen a lot more of this. JKR really painted herself into a corner with the last book. She needed the reader to understand that Harry & Co felt alone in the wilderness. That meant no regular updates on Hogwarts beyond what the Marauder's Map could show. This had the unintended consequence of making the reader think that nothing important was happening away from Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Sometimes I wonder if the original series would have been a lot better if it had employed a shifting POV. Including Ginny's POV in CoS and Ron's in GoF wouldcut down on the amount of bashing those characters receive.

For a moment I thought you were writing about Hermione. She's the one who does downright evil shit and runs off scot free...

Anyway, given that Ginny didn't disfigure somebody permanently, you are really reaching with your calls for "meaningful repercussions". She is unkind to Fleur because she thinks Fleur is bad news (and is hardly alone in that assumption) and is shown wrong in the end when Fleur proves her loyalty. And this is discounting the fact that Fleur had been an arrogant snob since her introduction in book 4 and made no move on her part to win the Weasleys' acceptance either.

Hermione would have done well in Slytherin.

Everyone is justified in their own mind, but that's hardly an excuse. The ends hardly justify the means. Harry wanted Hermione to be safe too, perhaps he should have obliviated her and sent her packing to Australia? Because that would have been nice and dandy.

And the Marietta thing wasn't for safety, it was for revenge. The jinx kicked in only after Umbridge had heard everything she wanted to hear.

Ginny is one of the major characters of the Harry Potter series. She is included by JKR in the "Big Seven", along with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna and Draco. She may not be as "there" as Harry, Ron and Hermione, but she is still important, and to argue that she is no more important than say, Romilda Vane, is just not true.

The "fiction" that needs to be dispelled is that whatever lovely scenes one might make up in their head about what's going on off-screen is somehow "canon." It's plausible that Ginny does all sorts of things in Hogwarts while the horcrux hunt is happening. What those might be, we don't know - and they don't seem to matter much because we aren't shown them having any substantive impact either on the hunt or in the final battle.

The very fact that none of that is shown or even related in any fashion is quite solid evidence that, whatever it might be, it isn't very important.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Now? Your statement only makes sense if I ever suggested that anyone be removed, which I didn't. My actual statement, which you so obviously sidestepped, is that we /could/ remove her and, after CoS, not much would change. Her effect on what we actually see is minimal at best.

If that were an error on my part, you'd be able to cite several important contributions from her that were critical to at least the plot development if not also Harry's character development. She did that obviously in CoS. One could argue that perhaps this is also true of the epilogue, since being the mother of Harry's children is important, but it's hard to see how that couldn't have been done by almost anyone else while having little to no impact on what we see happening in the epilogue. In CoS, in contrast, Ginny being someone Harry knew, being the sister of his best friend, and being Arthur's daughter were all important to the overall plot, so anyone getting the diary else would have changed some important things.

And this of course is the second issue - it's not just a question of whether her character does something "important," but whether it needs to be done /by her/. As an example, there's a big difference between Neville killing Nagini and Seamus killing Nagini, so that's a case of Neville not only doing something important, but that it's important that /he/ do it. Seamus could have been absent from the final battle without having much impact on the plot or overall story, but the same wouldn't be true for Neville.

How much such things can we say about Ginny after CoS? One that comes to mind is that she can ease Harry's fear of being possessed more easily than others. It's important that he be calmed, and it's important that she step in to say something, given her experiences. One might even be able to argue that it's important for her, as well, since this is perhaps her first opportunity to use those bad experiences for something positive.

I frankly can't think of anything else, and that one scene doesn't count for much. To continue with the comparison above, what would have changed if Ginny really had been forced to stay in the Room of Requirement during the final battle? Would the battle have gone any differently? Would we be disappointed in not seeing her complete some journey, like we would with Neville's absence? Would there be a lack of symmetry in the story, again like Neville's absence would cause? No, I don't see her being locked up safe for the battle as have much impact.

And that's in large part because so little happens with her in the previous books - which was my whole point. Very little is done /with/ Ginny, which means that Ginny has little to do. That's hardly surprising, an author can't fully develop every character, and Ginny was always going to fall somewhat short compared to others given the fact that she's a year behind. It's quite possible that any attempt to really flesh her out more and give her more critical things to do would have slowed down the pace of the books too much, making for an objectively worse story overall.

So I'm not trying to criticize JKR here. I'm just saying that I don't find Ginny to be "wonderful" and that, from the standpoint of what we actually see happening, she isn't very important for most of the series. The only way for her to become important is for fanfic writers to fill in all the gaps (and there are huge gaps where she's concerned) with their own ideas of what she might have been doing. That's what makes the HP series such fertile ground for fanfiction - so many gaps for others to take advantage of.

  what she supposedly does in DH
#+end_quote

Supposedly? It is canon that Ginny broke in with Luna and Neville into Snape's office to try and steal Gryffindor's sword in order to try (somehow) to give it to Harry and co. It is canon that she, Neville and Luna were going out at night and posting graffiti "Dumbledore's Army, still recruiting". It's also canon that they were the main targets by the Death Eaters there.

From there, there's quite a bit to infer. If JKR wrote every single action that Ginny undertook in the books, they would be hundreds of pages long. What she could have done is change viewpoints each time, I think that would have endeared Ginny to more readers.

And I would argue rather that yes, it actually was important for the sake of the plot that Ginny did not stay in the Room of Requirement, not only because she was one of the leaders of Dumbledore's Army, but also relating back to her dark experiences with Voldemort in CoS. It was the battle that would end it all, do you seriously think that that does not complete Ginny's character arc?

So I do think that JKR could have improved Ginny's characterization in the books, I agree with you. But there is more than enough for the reader to determine her role in the plot as well as the elements of her character.

You said that Ginny could be removed entirely, which is true for Romilda. I didn't say you were talking about Romilda, I was addressing your statement that Ginny is not an important character and does very little. Overall, she is a major part in the plot - just not as important as the Trio or Snape.

#+begin_quote
  Supposedly?
#+end_quote

Yes, because we hear very little about it and what we do hear doesn't have a substantive impact on things. As far as I can tell, nothing actually changes because of what they did.

Of course, it's not /implausible/ that things could have changed because of their actions, but that's the realm of fanfiction, not canon. For example, it's plausible to imagine that such actions gave other students more confidence and inspired them. It didn't have to, but it might have. Regardless, we're not /shown/ that it did, so such statements can't be used in an argument defending the proposition that she performed important actions.

#+begin_quote
  It was the battle that would end it all, do you seriously think that that does not complete Ginny's character arc?
#+end_quote

You can imagine that something changed about her, but we /see/ no evidence of it. We don't /see/ a different Ginny rising up, dispelling doubts about her, finding her confidence, proving herself to her parents, or whatever. All you've got is speculation for fanfiction. Again.

Contrast that with Neville - the timid boy of the first book stands up against Voldemort, pulls the sword out of the hat (showing that he's a true Gryffindor, in contrast with his fears in the first book), and strikes down the snake. The second boy of prophecy is the one who makes Voldemort mortal, and thus in a way kinda sorta comes close to fulfilling the prophecy himself. If you squint really hard. It had to be him who did it.

You can't point to a single thing Ginny did in the final battle that was similarly important either to the plot as a whole or to her own character because she was never developed enough as much as a character before the battle. Her relative absence for so much of the story in the first six books means that her presence at the end of the seventh doesn't make much of a difference.

In theory, it could have been different. Given her experience in CoS, it's not implausible that /some/ sort of confrontation between her and Voldemort or Malfoy could have been shown, and done in a way that really revealed how she's grown. That might have hurt pacing, but I'm just throwing this out there as an example of what we /don't/ have - an example of what would cause my own position to collapse, at least mostly.

#+begin_quote
  You said that Ginny could be removed entirely...
#+end_quote

Which is not the same as saying that she /should/ be, which is what your words suggested I said.

#+begin_quote
  ...which is true for Romilda
#+end_quote

Yes and No.

What Romilda did needed to be done by someone, but could have been done by anyone (more or less). Much of what is attributed to Ginny falls in the same category, but not everything. Unfortunately, there is very little of the latter. Anyone could have done most of what we actually see and hear about her doing without substantively affecting the story.

That's why her characterization is so lacking. Seamus could have been helping steal the sword. Susan could have helped with graffiti. What would have changed about the story in those cases? Nothing. We'd have fewer examples of Ginny being brave, but unlike Neville her bravery was never really in question, so this wouldn't impact her characterization much.

#+begin_quote
  But there is more than enough for the reader to determine her role in the plot as well as the elements of her character
#+end_quote

Funnily enough, I never said that she had no role in the plot or no elements of a character. What I have instead said is that I find her character to be "meh," that after CoS we don't see her doing a great many things, that most of what we do see isn't very important to the progression of the plot, and that most of what we see could plausibly be done by others without it having a major impact on things.

#+begin_quote
  If JKR wrote every single action that Ginny undertook in the books, they would be hundreds of pages long
#+end_quote

You mean, they weren't already? Have you seen Order of the Phoenix recently? :)

But seriously, I know what you mean and you're right... and that's an essential part of my point. There's all sorts of things that Ginny /might/ have been doing and we're not seeing it. We only see a little, not much of which is /critical/ and even less of which is critical that /she/ do. All of that is tied together. It would be hard to write a story where a character appears so little, but is still doing critical things that only they can do (outside of cases like the President or a king, naturally).

You can speculate all day about all kinds of things that she might have been doing - things that are important and which only she can do. Go for it! Others have, and they've created fanfictions in which her character isn't "meh" anymore.

With that out of the way, I /half/ agree with you. I wish Ginny had more presence in the books and more development. I thought her pairing with Harry was a little out of place, as she's not brought up much at all. Because she's Ron's little sister, you'd think there would be more scenes in the earlier books where she had conversations with him. Maybe it could have shown her getting over her embarrassment and learning to talk to him over the summer after second year, and after that they actually have conversations every once in a while. Maybe she expresses irritation at how Harry, Ron, and Hermione only half include her (like many younger siblings do). The fact that she had a huge crush on him in the first two books was a little annoying, but I don't mind it much. Harry and Luna is an interesting pairing, but I haven't been able to see many fanfics with them together (like I said, I'm new). All in all, I feel that there are fanfics that hold the Harry/Ginny pairing well, but in the books it's not done very well.

I'll spare you the effort. Rowling never said that. She said that Ron and Hermione would have problems. She also implied that Harry and Hermione aren't suited (and it's pretty obvious from reading the books).

Is Ginny boring? Not really. I don't particularly like her, but she is certainly less boring than stuck-up Hermione, who Harry never actually enjoyed the company of, and frequently ruined his fun. Hermione lovers have no right to talk about boring personalities.

In the same vein you can say that Hermione was a plot device to help Harry and provide exposition (a thing that Rowling admitted to using her for).

Ginny is a wasted potential as far as I'm concerned. She could have been so much more, but Rowling just didn't bother with her. I don't hate her for playing a small part, and I don't understand why people use this argument to bash her - many important characters played a small part.

*** The comparison between Ginny and Lily is really reaching, IMO. They both have red hair - and I don't even think it's the same shade. Different eye color. Different interests. (Lily sounded like the studious type while Ginny was a jock.) Different attitude. (Lily would have been scolding Ginny for hexing Smith or slamming into him on the quidditch pitch. Ginny would have hexed James for bothering a friend of hers.) Different taste in men too. (Because Harry looks like his father but does not act like him.) One comes from a large, boisterous, wizarding family. One comes from a small muggle family that birthed Petunia.

**** Exactly. Just for more clarification, Lily's hair is dark red (I'd assume aurburn), while Ginny has Weasley hair (ginger). I'm not sure about Lily being studious/rule-abiding though, I feel like that's a fanon thing. For example, Lily did magic outside of Hogwarts, she didn't care when Snape told her the Marauders went sneaking out at night (while someone like Percy or Hermione would not approve of that, Lily was all like 'why do you even care?'), and in SWM, she pulled her wand on James and Sirius, rather than threatening to dock points or call a teacher.

Also - side note - was Lily even a prefect? I know Hagrid says Lily and James were 'head boy and girl in their day!' but we know James wasn't a prefect (OotP), and some people have suggested that perhaps Hagrid meant 'head' as in 'alpha' or 'popular' or 'top of their class', since the capitalisation is 'head boy and girl' not 'Head Boy and Girl' (the way Percy's title is in PoA). And, again, Lily didn't threaten detention or docking points in SWM, which makes me wonder if she was even a prefect at the time. But I'm just rambling.

I don't know about rule-abiding. It's true that she doesn't seem like Hermione. Slughorn even thought she was cheeky, something Hermione wouldn't dream of being with her professors. However, she still has more regard for the rules than Ginny. In SWM, all she does is pull out her wand. With Ginny, that situation would have devolved quickly because she would have hexed first and talked later.

I definitely think she was Head Girl though. I don't think using 'head girl' to refer to popularity, leadership, or skill is how Hagrid talks.

Although I don't like canon ginny, and find most fanfiction portrayals of her wind up completely neglecting how utterly nuts she's probably going to be from having riddle in her head.

Assuming he doesn't leave debris behind, she's going to have all kinds of trust issues and constant worry about anything that thinks, even stuff normal wizards just accept mindlessly- like portraits! Additionally, she could very well try to be everything Riddle wasn't, and drive herself nuts in the process.

If he does, at best she'll have some bits of his personality mixed into hers, which could even help her, but certainly couldn't do that much for her self image.

Worst-case scenario is high overlap, with ginny almost being a good twin of riddle, quite possibly with unnatural talent for magic at her age and all kinds of nasty skills and knowledge left over from having the memories of a seventeen-year-old murderer stuck in her head at age eleven, along with, if you cared to think about it, gender identity issues mixed in.
