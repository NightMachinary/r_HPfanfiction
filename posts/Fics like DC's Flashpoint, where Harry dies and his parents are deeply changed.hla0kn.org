Could follow one or both of them, or even others. No Harry older brothers/sisters if possible.


** If it were Flashpoint, James would be The Father Who Lived and Lily would be Voldemort.

*** Precisely. Not necessarily Voldemort for Lily since he would still exist, but some dramatic change. Or you could even have Voldemort parish permanently in killing Harry, and Lily become the new dark lord.
