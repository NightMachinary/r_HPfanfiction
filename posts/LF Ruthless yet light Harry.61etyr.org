I'm looking for some fics where Harry is kind of like fanfiction Dumbledore, in that he does anything for the final goal of saving the world. He tortures, he kills, whatever he needs to do to save the world.


** It has been a while, but I am pretty sure the second half of linkffn(4985330) has what you are looking for and is complete. Just a heads up, the ending left me broken for the rest of the day.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

** So a 'See the forest not the tree' guy. Hmm, come to think of it, usually all those fics are where Harry does it for himself and his friends/family, not the world.

** I think linkffn(ruthless by angelastarcat) and linkffn(the art of self fashioning) might count. In the latter, his goal doesn't start out as wanting to save the world but it kind of ends up that way.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.

** linkffn(Brutal Harry) is a little bit preachy but I was able to enjoy it anyway. If I remember correctly the author's other work is much more opinionated and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but those wishing for an entertaining lecture in some form of Mormonism.

  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.
