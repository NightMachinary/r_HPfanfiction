I have a guilty pleasure that I would like either recs for or help refining my searches for because I'm not sure if they have a better tag or genre to search for. Any help is appreciated.

Fics where there has been some sort of manipulation of memories. Things like: not proper spouse, or parent, or even which side of the war a person was on. These generally all have manipulative Dumbledore in common, but not all of them are “good dark side, bad light side” stories. Most of them also involve goblins and inheritance tests and assertive Harry. (Which are all things I can search for but I can't always find the memory part) Part of my issue might be because I am terrible at trying to explain this lol

Here are some examples of the stories I've read (and remembered to save) that started this journey

And finally this one, which is more potion related, children hidden

Thanks again!

I'd check out tags like: memory loss, mind manipulation

  “Blood of the friend, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your ally.”\\
  Voldemort is resurrected. It doesn't go exactly like in the books. This is what happens when I read a bunch of 'good Voldemort, evil Dumbledore' stories, and then try to imagine what it would actually be like for Severus Snape in such a universe during the thirteen years spent alone at Dumbledore's side. Here's a hint: Voldemort is not easily getting his spy out of Dumbledore's clutches. And saving Harry Potter may be a bit of a trial as well.

** I don't have any recs, but if you do a sub search (there's a reddit search bar in the top right - on pc, anyway) and limit to this sub, you can search memory-related terms like "Amnesia", "Memory Manipulation", "Obliviate", "Memory Wipe", "Memory Charm", "Legilimency", "Occlumency", "Mind Magics", "Mindscape", and so on to find any posts made previously here.

Also, if you've got names of fics that do the thing you want, you can look up "Fics like Name of Fic" to find similar ones. There are a couple of websites that do things like that - FicRecs has some (Link below) and another I can't remember the name of.

Oh, also, if you want to find something on a particular site, you can put a phrase or certain word search in speech marks "eg" and type site:name.whatever (eg. site:reddit.com) and google will search that site for any instances of the phrase you look for. So, your search might be:

Harry Potter fanfiction "Obliviate" site:archiveofourown.org

There's probably more tips and tricks around, but I don't know 'em. :)
