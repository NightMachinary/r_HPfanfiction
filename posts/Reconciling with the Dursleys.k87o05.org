Hi All,

I'm very new to the world of HP fanfic, but would love to find anything focused on Harry's relationship with the Dursleys. If there are any fics involving his reconciling with them, or otherwise coming to terms with what they did to him I'd love a pointer to them. Anything featuring them in a less cartoonishly evil light would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for any notions :) Longer fics are appreciated, but not required.


** There aren't a lot that redeem Petunia and Vernon because seriously, they're genuine shit. /The Ghost of Privet Drive/ linkao3(21500365) does, but I can't honestly recommend it since I got bored and stopped reading.

Petunia leaves Vernon for his child abuse in /An Unexpected Party/ linkao3(14406414) and /the family evans/ linkao3(3073562), less "Petunia redemption" and more "Petunia never sinned".

Dudley is redeemed by having a magical child and vowing to do better than his parents did, in /Sins of the Mother/ linkao3(13374759) and /Dudley's Memories/ linkao3(601542) and the Mischief Managed series linkao3(315101).

He becomes a better person on his own in /Cousin Harry/ linkao3(6706702) and /A Hero/ linkffn(4172226).

/Of a Linear Circle/ is much too long to recommend, since the Dursleys are very minor characters, but if you skip ahead to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18094721/chapters/54199486][part VIII chapter 33]] Dudley gets some excellent character development and even Petunia gets a little redemption. Just a little.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

** In linkffn(/13161688) Petunia starts treating Harry better when he's a small child and it makes quite the difference.

If you're fine with good Dursleys, there are:

linkffn(13308768) both Petunia and Vernon are mostly good.

linkffn(11956922) I don't quite remember this one, but it's in my Good Petunia folder.

There's also linkffn(4670484) A very entertaining one-shot.

And both linkffn(13575326) and linkffn(13137899) are nice stories.

  At age seven, Harry wants to control his "freakishness". A book in the library calls to him. He finds that he needs to get stronger in order to control what is probably magic that causes all those unexplained events near him. That brings some unexpected changes to his life.

  If Vernon and Petunia were so concerned about their image why did they treat Harry the way they did?

  Dudley Dursley reluctantly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he discovers some wonderful wizarding adult beverages and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons for drinking heavily at Harry Potter's wedding. In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world and change his life forever.
