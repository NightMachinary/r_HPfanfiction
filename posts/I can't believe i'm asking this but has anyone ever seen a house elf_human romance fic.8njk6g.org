*** How about the Wizard/Witch doesn't know there partner is a house elf, because it's disguising itself as human, and things just spiral from there. It would be difficult, but I think if it's successfully done it could be great.

**** It's not the premise that's troubling me; I have a very good idea of what the general premise and plot would be. What I fear is that I couldn't actually flesh out the relationship in a way that wouldn't be tropily sickly-sweet and boring.

** I'm getting really weird ideas reading this thread.

For one there is what you mentioned down in the comments - the introduction of a half-human half-houseelve character. I'm imagining a sweet girl with somewhat too large eyes, elvish ears but otherwise adorable (growing into pretty) physique. I imagine her coming from a difficult home. Her mother (human) is batshit crazy, but at least tries to love her. She comes to Hogwarts because she's told thats where her father lives and with that information the elf managed to get an acceptance letter for his daughter out of the headmaster / his Master.

She is insanely powerful. She had houseelve magic, but far less of the psychological shackles her elvish heritage would suggest. Now its only a matter of training for her to control this magic and who better to help her than Mr. Trouble himself aka. Harry Potter?

The other story I have in mind is an elf that falls in love with her Master and through some twisted loopholing in orders, she eventually gets to the point where she's "allowed" to transfigure herself into a human woman and seduce her Master. But fuck me if I know how to write something like that without it being super creepy. The summary alone was... yeah.

  "Yeh're too small, Dobby," he explained. "I'd rip yeh open."

  "Dobby stretches, sir!" the house elf said breathlessly. "Please, sir, Dobby wants you to!"
