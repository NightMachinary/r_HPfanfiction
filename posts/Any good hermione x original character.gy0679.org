I've read a lot of different pairings and now I'm curious if there are any good ones centered on her and an original character (preferably male but female is ok). As always, thanks for the help!


** If you know Naruto, Kyuubi gets reincarnated as female Harry and ends up with Hermione in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/692052][this series]].

  When Naruto died at the hands of a civilian during his academy days, so did the Kyuubi no Kitsune. Now here the Kyuubi was, reincarnated, and bouncing around in an eleven year old girl's body, while half the wizarding world treated her like the second coming of Merlin (whoever that was)... and the rest didn't know what to make of her...[HP/Naruto fic utilising dubious canon elements. You have been warned!]
