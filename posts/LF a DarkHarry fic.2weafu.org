I don't remember the specifics, but I think it was post-Voldemort and Harry goes to Hogwarts but he's darker than anyone suspects. He sleeps with Lavender and manipulates Ginny into sex but obliviates her when she wants to tell her parents that they're dating. Thanks for any help!

  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included. Darkish themes, no slash, no pairings, some lemons mixed in.
