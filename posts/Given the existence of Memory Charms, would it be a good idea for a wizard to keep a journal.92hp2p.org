** Storing your memories in a Pensieve like Dumbledore does. Can't Obliviate you if your memories are all in a bowl.

Otherwise, it'd need to be Mad Eye Moody level of Paranoia to do it. Ginny/anyone connected to Ginny would be too traumatised by Riddle's diary to keep one.

** Okay, there are several problems with this idea:

1. Your moving the goalposts. If everyone writes a journal, you just destroy the journal too because you know they have one. Standard MO of a successful criminal is to eliminate evidence. And if this is common you know to look for it.
2. You can just torture them for the journal, then use a memory charm. All you really did was add pain.
3. The sensations humans experience in their lives cannot be truly conveyed in mere words. While adept authors can paint a vivid picture, very few people in the world can do such a thing. It wouldn't serve as anything more than the minutes from a club meeting would.
4. Realistically, and this is important, most people are lazy and/or get tired of certain activities unless they enjoy them. Or they are have the reason shoved in their faces. This is why only a few people willingly write records/journals/diaries of their lives: they get bored with it and have no serious incentive.
5. Unless being mind-wiped was a serious concern, which it doesn't seem to be for wizards, there isn't enough incentive for most people to spend 15+ minutes every day to record how Joe in accounting invited you to his Arbor Day celebration.

*** I should have specified. I didn't mean for every wizard to have one, but for the more adventuring type, such as Harry or Newt. I was also picturing a journal that only the owner could open. These kinds of things already exist in canon, so why not?

A lot of fics have Dumbledore keep something of a journal. That's kind of what prompted the question. :P
