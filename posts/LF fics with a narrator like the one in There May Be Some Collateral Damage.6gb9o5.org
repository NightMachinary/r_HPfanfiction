[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443/chapters/11562568][This]] is the fic I'm referring to.


** Pretty sure that's the third person limited perspective. A lot of fics will be that perspective or third person omniscient.

**** You'd need a character that has Ichigo's personality to carry the same tone, and I don't know that anyone in canon has that kind of personality.

However, a Peggy Sue Harry could have it, if he was a veteran of war like Ichigo is.
