:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Salazar is Harry, I think it's on both Ao3 and FanFiction.Net. Salazar sends the potters off out of the country and two house elves take their places. Something goes wrong on the night and Salazar loses all memories, regaining them when he gets his hogwarts letter. Godric comes in 2nd year and Godric, Salazar and Blaise Zabini are all friends. Merlin is there and rescues Sirius from Azkaban and at one point Salazar, Godric and Zabini redecorate the slytherin comm to have their rooms underneath. Godric has a Phoenix and when he first arrives he decides that he will prank Salazar by calling himself Gordy Riffin - an anagram of Godric Gryffindor. Any help finding the fic is appreciated!

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
