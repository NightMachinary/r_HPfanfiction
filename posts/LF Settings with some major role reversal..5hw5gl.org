A muggleborn Dark Lord trying to exterminate the wizarding community?

House-elves that own wizards?

Werewolves that are revered by magicals?

Mermaids maintain a Statute of Secrecy against a combined muggle/wizard/magical creature culture?

The Triwizard Tournament goes to Beauxbatons or Durmstrang?

Ron Weasley is the socially-awkward genius while Hermione is the muggle culture expert with an inferiority complex?

Dolores Umbridge tries to spread the truth about Voldemort but is attacked by dementors?

Basically, yeah, does anyone know any fics where some staple of the series is turned on its head?

Hermione would be a great candidate, and you don't even have to change canon that much. If magical Britain still kept doing things the old way after Voldemort's fall, we could expect Hermione, Harry, (and many in the DA) to go off the deep end.

In my plot, they would leave magical Britain, head to the US, learn science and technology in the Muggle world, and quickly found out how easy it was to make big money there. They created the harmless sounding Otter Investments, with memory charms, legilimency, veritaserum, and imperius curse being its key competitive advantages. They mostly stayed away from controlling key government and military figures as these people were generally protected or under surveillance by their respective Ministries of Magic. However, the slow-moving wizarding world was no longer capable of keeping track of the rapidly changing tech industry, and it was exactly here where the big money of the future would be made.

The primary business of Otter Investments was to identify promising young Muggle entrepreneurs and 'persuade' them to give them equity stakes and stock options at no cost. They would then assist their new 'partners' in gaining lucrative deals, obtaining sensitive information, and receiving favorable court/government rulings.

When the tech boom reached its manic phase in early 2000, essentially worthless startups would be valued in billions of dollars at IPOs. They made their first billion during that time, which greatly wetted their appetitive and boosted their ambitions. They were able to significantly scale up their operations.

Meanwhile in magical Britain, things were getting worse. Ruling elites and old families strengthened their hold on power and reinforced the social castes. Muggleborns were now completely excluded from lucrative jobs, and many left. Otter Investments, however, was able to exploit this situation and recruit more loyal wizards and witches.

During the 2008/2009 global financial crisis, they were able to take advantage of the collapse in asset prices and the subsequent QE (quantitative easing). They gained their first foothold in major financial institutions, which opened up a side route into the political circle. But as a side effect, MACUSA was tipped off, finally became suspicious of their operations, and began to investigate.

To counter this threat, the company decided to form its own private army. Fortunately, the wars in Middle East and the chaos in magical Britain offered significant influx of reliable new recruits, both Muggle and Magical. Many former Muggle military bases, often sold at bargain prices by their governments, would offer excellent hideouts and training grounds.

Meanwhile, MACUSA was becoming a major threat. Skirmishes happened common place after 2012. The Otter Investments, now a global hybrid Muggle/Magical Organization with hundred thousands of employees/followers and trillions in assets, saw various Ministries of Magic as the key threat to its goal of global domination. It began implementing plans that would use Muggles as a proxy to destroy magical governments and old magical establishments, while using the company as a refuge for surviving Magicals. With magical competitions gone, Otter Investments would be then in a very advantaged position to take control of most major Muggle governments.

One key milestone was achieved in 2016 when a certain weak-minded billionaire US presidential candidate was brought under control. Significant voter manipulations resulted in his victory that surprised both pundits and the MACUSA. Once in office, the new POTUS worked immediately on plans destroying the magical establishment.

After two years of careful planning and observation, the first blow was struck on the Quidditch World Cup in August 2018, where 20% of world's magical population was congregated in a single spot. Detonation of a single fission device, blamed on ISIS terrorists, allowed various Muggle governments to declare martial law and mobilize its forces. Ministries and key wizarding locations were then struck simultaneously, and intelligence provided by Otter Investments allowed them to target selected individuals. The magical world as we knew it, ceased to exist.

**** Yes, the attack on World Cup was inspired by that fic.

However, I don't think that going genocidal was really a good plan in this case. A limited strike to wipe out MACUSA and a few other Ministries, including the British one, seemed more reasonable.

** There was a fic where the Tournament was in Durmstrang and Harry's name still came out of the Cup. The story was abandoned as soon he and Hermione got to to Durmstrang.

Don't remember the story but might have been Forging the Sword.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][It's Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]]

The fic takes a lot of common tropes and reverses them (Lockhart and Pettigrew are competent, Wearwolves are not good guys at all, House Elves are way more powerful than wizards, Dumbledore hates "the Greater Good" (Scrimgeor is the one who supports that philosophy), Ron's character is fleshed out and developed surprisingly well, etc.)

A fair warning - this is one of my favorite fics, but it's pretty meh until the end of Year 1, and straight up horrible for the first 10 chapters. It gets extremely good when Harry fights Quirrel at the end of the 1st book (and the 2nd book is fantastic), but you've been warned.

References to Unbreakable Vows? They're littered here and there, but they're not a huge part of the story. The Draco thing is really the only big "unbreakable vows" part.

They do mention secrecy oaths, but those function differently and are basically the author's invention.
