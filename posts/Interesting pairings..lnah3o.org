In looking for some fics with more unusual pairings. For the purpose of this, I'm looking for people paired with Harry that aren't:

- Hermione
- Ginny
- Daphne
- Fleur
- Draco
- Tom Riddle
- Luna
- Severus Snape
- Tonks

Thanks!

Edit: Added Luna to the list. Edit edit: added Snape and Tonks to the list


** Might as well add Tonks, Susan Bones and Snape to that list.

Midnight Blues (Harry/Hannah Abbott) - linkffn(9121877), pretty good post-war fic, goes beyond just Hogwarts/Magical Britain, although the H/Hr and "Muggles good, Wizarding World bad" vibes got a bit too strong later.

Hallowed (Harry/Lisa Turpin) - linkffn(7469856), one of the best smart!Harry fics and has a fresh take on the Triwizard Tournament without going through the stations of canon. No bashing.

*** Agreed with Tonks and Snape, I've edited to add them. I haven't read many Susan/Harry fics so I'd be okay with those

#+begin_quote
  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.

** Gideon Prewett. linkao3(The Second String)

This story is an adventure story more than a romance so you wont find any smut or anything remotely fluffy.

That being said, Harry is goddam adorable in this. He's all brave and strong and stubborn and then Gid walks in and he just grins like a big goofy moron and can't think straight and it's absolutely adorable.

*** I will have to second this one. Excellent fic with the inclusion of minor characters that are incredibly fleshed-out.The romance comes in, I think, halfway through the fic, but still dedicates a chunk to it. Might make you cry through. I certainly did, lol

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** linkao3(Lord of Darkness)

It's a harem fic so you'll see Harry paired with many of the above, but there's also a lot of Harry x Hedwig (human form)

lots of nsfw content ofc

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.

  It occurred to Harry that Theo Nott was something of a rarity; a prince among fakes, or a fake among princes. He was definitely also a liar, though Harry didn't know what kind. He figured he was about to find out. Nottpott, modern university AU. COMPLETE.
