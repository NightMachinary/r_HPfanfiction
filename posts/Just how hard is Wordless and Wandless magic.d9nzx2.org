Fanon has, quite honestly, broken any clear picture I have for how difficult it's supposed to be for any reasonably talented witch/wizard to cast Wordless or Wandless spells. Just how difficult is it? Does it take more mental visualization, a deep understanding of how the spell works? Is it all about the measure of power/talent the wizard/witch has?

My mind keeps going back to that brief but marvelous scene where a nameless wizard in the Leaky Cauldron is reading /A Brief History of Time/ while wandlessly stirring his tea or coffee. Is he muttering the spell to maintain the stirring or is he reading the book to himself while wordlessly-wandlessly stirring the tea/coffee?

These are strange, frivolous questions that keep me up at night tbh.


** There are only a couple instances that I can remember in the book ignoring accidental magic.

The first is when Harry casts the lumos spell without touching his wand in the fifth book when he drops it while fighting Dementors.

We have a few cases of Dumbledore waving his hands to redecorate the castle for things such as the House Cup, but he could have been hiding a wand or triggering some special magic of the castle.

The other cases are from Voldemort as a child where he displayed a methodical control over his magic as a child.

*** And that Harry's /Lumos/ could be some kind of weird case of accidental magic or something ... he was in the super-stressful situation in danger of his life, and I don't think it was ever said he was able to make his wand glove wandlessly in normal situation.

**** It's actually kinda fascinating if extrapolated from. You can only do magic if the wand is nearby, and the spell will still source from the wand tip.

It's still an example of casting magic kindasorta without a wand.

** Just for the sake of completeness ... that wizard in the Leaky Cauldron doesn't have to be doing wandless/wordless magic. I can imagine charm (started with a wand and words) “Conjur invisible stirring rod driven by a finger” and then you just make it moving with your finger. Just saying.

*** Well he's spinning a spoon. So unless you want to say he conjured and invisible stirring rod to stir the spoon with and make it look like he's stirring the spoon wandlessly... I doubt the writers/director thought about it that much.

**** Oh sorry, there is a spoon ... I haven't actually seen the films in a long time (the last time I have seen it with my kids, I was so angry with how badly Hermione and Ron was characterized, I don't have much need to see it again). Anyway, what I meant, is that there are many other ways how to achieve the same image with magic, not necessarily wandless/wordless magic.

** In all likelyhood, it's probably not all that hard /for a wizard that applies themselves./ However, as discussed in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/d9dsnu/would_you_call_canon_harry_potter_a_good_student/][thread from a little earlier today]], it's likely that there's a significant portion of magicals on the low side of magical proficiency. As was pointed out there, most Ministry Officials can't cast a shield charm.

Of the people in the top 50% or perhaps the top 25%, I could see wandless magic being an attainable, if challenging, goal - perhaps like running a marathon, but academically instead of physically. There's not really a point to running that far in this day and age (or working that hard when you have a wand), but you could certainly do it if you tried and practiced for long enough.

** So the difficulty of wordless/wandless magic fluctuates in canon. For example, accidental magic is by definition wandless - much of that is accidental, as the name implies, but Lily on the swing is one where it seems fairly intentional. However there, the only example of someone with good control of it is Tom Riddle.

Harry uses wandless magic a few times - in the 2nd chapter of Prisoners of Azkaban he makes Marge's glass explode (seemingly another accidental magic event), and in the first chapter of OOTP he lights up his wand despite not holding it.

There are also hints at non-wand magic, like Dumbledore's artifacts - eg, in the very first chapter he doesn't use a wand to make the lights go out. Lily's protective spell/love protection is implied wandless to me. Quirrel/Voldemort is implied to be using wandless magic at the end of book 1 - he wraps Harry up in ropes by 'snapping his fingers'. And, of course, there's the post-series explanation that African wizards often don't use wands.

There's plenty of little examples to pick here and there of that type of magic, I would say. But the movies certainly expanded upon it greatly.

For wordless magic, that gets expanded upon in book 6 I think, when the students start being expected to use it.

#+end_quote

I don't think she cast any spells. My interpretation was always that the situation itself served as a sort of a magical contract Voldemort unwittingly created when he offered Lily a chance to step aside, and the love protection was the direct result of her willingly sacrificing her life for Harry.

**** Yeah, both sacrifices and Voldemort's curse are like Gryffindor's sword: they required an act rather than incantation or duress.

**** Yeah, it's very vague. Perhaps 'protective magic' is more appropriate - but whatever it was, it doesn't seem to have involved wand magic.

It is vague enough that it's easy to re-flavor/reinterpret as desired for fanfics.

** I don't think there is really anything in the original seven books that discuss how wandless magic (excepting Potions, Astronomy, Potions, probably Divination) works, so I can't say.

As for wordless magic? I subscribe to the belief that magic isn't easy. Therefore, I would assume anything taught during NEWT level courses isn't easy.

*** Harry does it in OOTP when Dudley makes him drop his wand. I believe both Quirrell and Snape do it in PS as well. Voldemort and Lily technically do it as well when they're children. They just don't use an incantation.
