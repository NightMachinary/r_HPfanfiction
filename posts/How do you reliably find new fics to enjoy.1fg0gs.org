I often find myself on Fanfiction.net looking through the favorite tabs of authors I've already enjoyed because it tends to result in new fandoms i haven't read yet as well as generally quality stories. How do other redditors hunt down their next fic?


** I go through all of the threads on this sub asking for good fics.

** Hunting through favorites is my go-to fic fix! For the long term, I think it's important to be an active part of a community and see what's happening firsthand, especially ones that have writers that are still contributing new content. I used to fandom-hop all the time simply because I'd go through everything I was interested in in a matter of months and then I'd be bored. But when I started writing for HP, I also stopped lurking, and I met other authors on forums, and from their discussions, I got a feel of authors I liked, whose tastes I liked, who I might have never noticed from a story summary. You see new writers come in too, and you can tell when they're going to write amazing things, but with the glut of this fandom, they might never get noticed because few review anymore (and in this late era of HP fandom, review numbers are more an indication of age rather than quality).

Peek in a promising story whenever you can, and if it's a good one, promote the hell out of it. Start the chain. One of the best feelings is when I see other people recommend fics that I've recommended here previously.

*** This! If I read something I like, I check the author's other stories, then I check the author's favourites. Chances are they'll have something similar to their own style (which made me like their story in the first place) or something I'll enjoy in that list.

*Edit: Another thing I do is look for recs on google. Various results for that one, but I do find some. Not all ff is on ffNet, so that way I can find works that are on other websites as well.

** Some time ago I generated list of 2500 top completed fics by favs from fanfiction.net. Good for ensuring that somebody checked all popular stories, extremely useful if somebody is able to use Excel/Calc for data filtering. - [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/10tgby/list_of_2500_top_completed_fics_by_favs_from/]] ([[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2HXY90ZbOX6Rkw0YjlsYWx0clk/edit][xls file on google docs, sorry for misleading file name - it contains list of 2500 stories]])

** I use FLAG to convert and download FF for reading on my Kindle. They also have a [[https://www.flagfic.com/rec][recommended]] section where I have used as an additional source for new stories.
