  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

***** They get trained by Moody and Dumbledore. Though I don't exactly know what you consider "dumb and naive" - they are spying on Aurors to feed information to the Resistance from early on.

** I thought linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness) did that pretty well.

If you're okay with OC's (very solidly written), Slide has a 4 fic series about 4 slytherin's starting from OoTP. One of the fics takes place during the war, and it's fantastic. A solid & realistic take

  Smarter Voldemort launches his conquest of Britain immediately after his resurrection. Smarter Harry, Sirius, and co. are the only ones who can stop him. Unconventional tactics. Begins after Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts.
