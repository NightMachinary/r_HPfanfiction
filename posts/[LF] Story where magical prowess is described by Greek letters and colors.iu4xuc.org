** Never heard of this one but I'll help look

Edit: can't seem to find anything when searching with any of the basic colors and "alpha", but I have seen a number of poorly written magical core indexes, and a decent number of "Harry is linked to the Greek pantheon" fics.

** Did it have weasley and dumbledore bashing? If so, It might be King of Magic, by Radiant Arabian Nights. It has soul mates and weasley love potions

*** I should've read the summary before I opened the fic because holy smokes I've never seen a "multi-title" or "multi-wives" story this over-the-top.

So those Gringotts inheritance tests? Yeah, all of them have been too short. All of them. You should look at this fic just because this one is /so long./ I just don't even have the words to describe it. I just kept scrolling and scrolling... and scrolling and the inheritance test results didn't end.

And then, finally, at the end of the inheritance test (how long did it take to write that???) Harry learns he has slaves (yikes), and that he must marry 33 random underage girls (but he might need to find a few more, but a few more wives isn't actually a few because by the end he has 52 wives by the end (He also has 36 familiars).

Honestly, way to go for the author. Her profile says she likes these kinds of stories, so that's wonderful. The dedication it must have taken to write out all of that blows me away. I'm far too lazy to write an inheritance test result even if I wanted to, so kudos for that.

Linking so other people can see this piece of wonder: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12418957/1/King-of-Magic]]
