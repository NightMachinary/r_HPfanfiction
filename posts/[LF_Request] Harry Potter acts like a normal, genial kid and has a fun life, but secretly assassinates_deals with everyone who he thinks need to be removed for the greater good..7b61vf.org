This is something of a personal impulse of mine that I wonder if anyone's ever put to paper. Every time I read about how Fudge denies the return of Voldemort, for example, or summarily executes Crouch, or imprisons Hagrid with absolutely no evidence, I start contemplating how I would use magic to murder him.

I don't mean some emotional, flying off the rails, epic verbal smackdown into calling an pure-blood honor-duel type murder, although that works too sometimes. I mean, just secretly eliminate him by any means available to make the world a better place. And be back for breakfast like nothing happened. Literally nobody would suspect the boy who lived, ever, and considering I want my protagonist to have at least two separate brain-cells he would never even whisper a word of it. At least not until he's married 50 years later and he reminisces about what might have happened had that silly minister stayed in power with his loving spouse.

I feel like this would be such a pleasure to read. Has anyone ever written something like this?

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned

** linkffn(path of decision) This has a Slythernin Harry, but he's generally well liked and not an asshole. He is of course a sociopath and has very little qualms about killing people. He doesn't kill many during most of the story, and it's not like he's a godLike Harry, he's far better than the average schoolchild, but he's not mowing down minions in diagon alley.

The one issue is that it's a crossover with The Sandman. You don't need to read that to get this fic, I didn't, but there's some backstory that I suppose would lend itself to understanding some stuff that goes on.

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Warning: This story is weird and not for everyone.
