****** Ok so I went and had a look and I think I've narrowed it down to two. The issue with the Mass Effect crossovers is that they often stick too tightly to the ME 'stations of canon', which can make them much too similar to each other. But there are a few good ones, and the sameyness isn't as much of an issue if you don't do what I did and binge on all of them in a week >_> if I have remembered them correctly:

linkffn(Getting too old for this by ManMadeOfLasers) is cracky but fun

I can't remember if linkffn(The Green Eyed Spectre) is one of the more serious ones, but I think it is? It's hard to tell from a quick skim.

******* I can, at least personally, recommend Harry Potter: Geth linkffn(10784770)

It does stick /noticeably/ to mass effect's canon at times, especially during the ME2 arc, which isn't always for the best. It is countered by many scenes or stories going differently because Harry is there to use his trademark tools: Magic, snark, common sense and a hive minded species of AI.

Snarky, confident Harry is probably my favourite part of this fic.

It has a wonderful 'let's fix this' feeling and does a decent job of handwaving the least interesting parts of the games.

For drawbacks; Harry is pretty OP, between magic and the Geth. A few 'lawsuit' and 'dealing with the press' moments felt a little overzealous.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and eventual sexy shenanigans, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

*** Quite unfortunately on both counts it looks like they're abandoned fics. Kathryn hasn't updated in over a year and Tsu Doh Nimh is well on the way to having not updated for a year as well.

Which is a real shame as both of these are definitely in my list of favorite HP/Star Wars crossovers. Really sad that they're most likely abandoned.

** The Harry Potter in The Rose Paradox by bayushi that can be found on Harry Potter Fanfic Archive, Archive of Our Own and Fanfiction.net but since the writer is also an artist, they drew some images, that are amazing, that can be viewed only on Archive of Our Own that gives a look at how the characters look.

This Harry Potter goes through the veil and ends up in an alternate universe with a female potter with totally different events but there are also some same stuff. Even the universe this Harry comes from isn't a copy paste of the original books.

It starts off near the end of Order of the Phoenix. This Harry Potter is my favorite since he comes from a universe where he lost so much but finds even more in the new AU and he's still a true Gryffindor. He's funny/compassionate/badass/understanding/protective/loving/humble/good. He's not evil/dark/grey/bitter/sarcastic/arrogant. The girls in the story help him recover what he lost and more. Harry doesn't bash anyone either. Like, you have no idea how difficult it is to find a story where bashing isn't a thing. People are good/evil/normal in the story but there isn't any bashing.

  "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

** I like HP crossovers with the RWBY series. RWBY is one of the series with the closest forms of magic in their "auras", and "semblance." Plus add in some badass fighting style and I think its great.

*** I absolutely love this crossover. Sadly, there aren't many good fics like that, or that are even finished.

** Did you mean */The Lone Traveler/*?

This series of fics have a lot of good stories. Even if you are like me and didn't watch all the tv series mentioned, and skipped a few of the fics.
