It never really made sense to me why Aragog doesn't speak with Hagrids accent considering it was Hagrid who raised him.

Also I just thought this scene would be pretty funny.

  "Wha' is it?" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.

  "Is it Hagrid?" said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  "Kill 'em," clicked Aragog fretfully. "I was sleepin ......"
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  "Hagrid has never sent men inter hollow before," he said slowly.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  "In trouble?" said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. "But why has he sent yeh?"
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  "But tha' was years ago," said Aragog fretfully. "Years an' years ago. I remember it well. That's why they made him leave the school. They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free."
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  "I!" said Aragog, clicking angrily. " I was not born in the castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave me ter hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was on'y a boy, but he cared fer me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid is me good friend, an' a good man. When i was discovered, an' blamed fer the death o' a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in the forest ever since, where hagrid still visits me. He even found me a wife, mosag, an' yeh see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid's goodness......”
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  "Never," croaked the old spider. "It would have bin me instinct, but out o' respect fer Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body o' the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part o' the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark an' the quiet......”
#+end_quote

....

#+begin_quote
  "The thing tha' lives in the castle," said Aragog, " is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do i remember how I pleaded with hagrid ter lemme go, when I sensed the beast moving abou' the school"
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  "We do not speak o' it!" said Aragog fiercely. "We do not name it! I never even told Hagrid the name o' tha' dread creature, though he asked me, many times."
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  "Go?" said Aragog slowly. "I think not ......
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  "Me sons an' daughters do not harm Hagrid, on me command. But I cannot deny 'em fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly inter our midst. Good-bye, friend o' Hagrid."

** plot twist: Hagrid's rock cakes are an acromantula delicacy that Aragog taught him how to make. Ron has an all new reason to fear spiders.

**** That isn't what I asked, but I'll bite. And learning the Patronus at 13 isn't possible either?

Harry is literally the guy dumb enough to try a spell he's read without knowing what it does. He would also attempt a spell he knew he allegedly "wasn't ready for" if he knew it was a last resort.

This is year 2, so Harry /could/ have read it during summer vacation in one of his charms books.

***** He's also the guy uninterested in magic enough that he didn't learn the spell to bring anything to you until his fourth year. I think that would probably be the very first spell I'd try to learn and master.

****** Accio is a very hard spell to learn it requires lots of studying before you can even start to practice it, in Goblet of Fire they had to read more than 3 books just for the preparation of the class where they learn the spell and Harry had to study a lot more of the theory before he managed it.

***** Harry didn't learn the patronus charm by randomly trying it after hearing the incantation, he learned it through study and practice like any other spell.

And we have no reason to assume that it is even in the charms book for second years considering that we dont see anyone below fifth year ever use the spell.

***** Incendio isn't even mentioned by name until Goblet of Fire when Molly Weasley used it, so no it's not mentioned to be in the Standard Book of Spells grade 1, outside of video games which in general tend to have younger students learn more advanced spells.
