** I'll read recommendations or favourites of authors I like. If something on this subreddit catches my eye I'll read it as well.

In terms of searching, I tend to change the settings to English, Any Rating and then 40K. If there's any genre/character/world I feel like reading I'll set that too, but sometimes I'll add that too. Sometimes I use the search function and type in a few keywords if there's a certain trope I'm looking for, and then narrow it down by category / word count / language.

I usually aim for over 20K or over 40K for the word count, just because I find a lot of authors start strong but then lose interest after a couple of chapters. I also mentally divide the word count by the chapter numbers to see if the chapters are a decent length or if they're too short. I'd rather too long than too short because I find authors with very short chapters tend to not be very good. There's exceptions to this obviously, but as a general rule I find they're plotless and just turning out crap to get a chapter out. 2K to 6K per chapter is the sweet point for me, although sometimes I'll bend.

I judge by the summaries. If the wording is awkward or there's SPAG I'll skip because that just tells me the rest of the story will be just the same.

It's a lot of trial and error. I haven't figured out AO3 yet since I hate the walls of tagging that crop up.

*** Although too many tags in AO3 is annoying, I love the fact I can search by them. Things like 'muggle magic war', or 'time travel' or 'smart harry' are very helpful in finding something I want to read. I also love AO3 for letting me load the whole thing at once. There is also some awesome illustrated stories on AO3.

***** The character lists and pairing is so much cleaner in AO3. FFN did (kind of) make a way to find gen fics, by making a box for 'pairing' as opposed to just the character list. But authors didn't go back and change their fics, new stories are rarely marked right, and as the list is limited to 4 characters, it doesn't always work if they are marked right.

** Often times this can be done by using the Time Range: Updated Within function in the FFN filter menu. Just check it at the end of every month and you can usually pick up a few to keep track of. It lowers the pool you have to look through drastically, though you won't find any finished fics in there. There's also looking through the favorite authors of your favorite authors. If they can write well, they often read and favorite other well written fics.

** Well, I don't think there's a foolproof method, but mine is to filter by length and my preferred characters, and then skim the summaries. If it's poorly written, makes no sense, is basically just stating a clich√©d trope of that fandom, or is nonexistent, then it's a pass. Then, since it is possible to write fantastic summaries and not so fantastic stories, I read the first two chapters (or just one if it's insanely long). If it hasn't impressed me by then, I move on.

I also rely heavily on recommendations from people who have proved to have similar tastes to mine, though, and institute the two-chapter rule with those as well. Neither way is perfect, but I'm happy with the number of fics I turn up, and I don't usually end up reading much crap.

** Well, this subreddit is pretty good for it, although I found all of my favourites through the TvTropes page which while great, it is very much outdated and not so easy to navigat.Not to mention that none of the comments are neutral, they're just people's opinions on the story which may or may not alin with your own.

So this subreddit's pretty cool. Nothing people will recomend to you here it' "crap", it just may not be to your liking.

The rating system is terrible lol. Every fic has either four-and-a-half or five stars. Even the ones riddled with typos and basic problems. How on earth does someone differentiate between good and bad fics this way?

***** That's a shame, so far I've found it a good indicator. I've definitely seen fics with ratings as low as 2 stars, and when I made a mistake in one of my chapters several people gave me a low rating. It's not the only way to differentiate, but it's good at a glance.

** There's some good advice here already, I'd definitely take it. Personally, I can usually tell if a fic is going to suck just by reading the title or summary. There's just a "feel" you're looking for, you know? Collect some 'red flags' and use them liberally. It'll make sorting through long archives go faster. My red flags look something like:

- A summary asks a question that has an obvious answer
- The story name is a title of a bad rock song that was briefly popular back in like 2004
- The summary has errors
- Someone calls Hermione "'Mione"
- WIPs
- AUs that take place outside of the wizarding world
- Completely unbelievable premises, like Harry going into hiding in the muggle world by becoming a celebrity footballer
- If the archive has tags like AO3, really weird tag combos that you can't even begin to reconcile. Like /"Snape POV, HBP compliant, pre DH, Comedy, Romance, Humor"/.
- Any character smoking a cigarette or wearing a leather jacket
- Snape listening to some fucking ridiculous, obviously-projected 'favorite band' of the author's like Death Cab For Cutie or Counting Crows or whatever.

I mean, I could go on all night. But you tend to get a feel for when something is going to be just absolutely terrible and not worth your time.

*** Lol too funny. I was rolling with the "bad rock song that was briefly popular back in like 2004". I personally though don't have a problem with "'Mione" but I do cringe at "Hermy". Also, I don't feel it would be entirely OOC for Snape to smoke, or possibly any other character whose origins we might not be well known (say Dean Thomas).

**** I don't have a problem with 'Mione, but usually it's all Harry/Ron/Ginny ever call her, and it gets annoying real fast. It's one of those invasive fanons. And it makes me wary because, what other annoying fanons have invaded the fic? I don't stick around to find out. And I don't necessarily have an issue with a character like Snape smoking (I can recall one great fic where he does), but it's one of those things where... if the author feels it necessary to put it in there, they might not be writing the kind of story I'm interested in. You know, turning Snape or Draco into more muggily-idenitifable 'bad boys', that kind of thing. Not my jam.

** I use favorites list of authors I like (or bookmarks on AO3), go through AO3 tags (filtering by completed works), and look through Communities on fanfiction.net. Sometimes if I want to read something specific, I search for Completed fics over 20K words, English, and sort by Favorites, Kudos, or Reviews.

But mostly I look at the favorites list of good authors.

** I look through the favorites list of authors I like and the favorites of people who leave reviews on stories I particularly enjoy. I sort by length (I tend not to read anything under at least 40,000 words) and then pick things based on well written summaries. Sometimes I'll search a keyword or a pairing I'm in the mood for, and I'll "spot check" which means picking a random chapter or two and skimming a paragraph to make sure it's reasonably well written.

I search by number of Favorites, more favorites than reviews generally means good stories, but not always.

Once I find a story I like, it's usually look up other works by the same author, or what that author likes.

** I'll give FFN a search every few months. I set the filters to >5k, Complete, Rating: M (or all, depending on my mood), English, and Harry P. as the main character. Since search for pairingless fics is a huge pain in the ass, I'll rotate the second character filter for my usual pairings (Fleur, Tonks, Luna, Daphne, Gabrielle, Tracey, OC) and then chop it down from there.

Sometimes I'll look for WIPs, but usually just read the first chapter or two and then bookmark it and not read it until it's completed. I don't like having to reread the same few chapters to a story over and over whenever a new chapter is posted, or the huge disappointment when a good story is abandoned.

Most times I don't find anything new to read and reread my favorites instead.

** I narrow the parameters as tightly as possible. Most "Romance" stories are tossed out immediately. Then I decide to pick the characters I want to read about. For example, Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley. Their years before the DA are filled with possibilities--a really good one that was recently taken down was /Faith and Understanding./

Or you go into the search bar and look for a simple phrase--Battle of Hogwarts, Quibbler, Order, DA, and then narrow the characters that way.

You still have to filter out the bad, but this is much easier than searching through 700,000 stories.

** One thing I frequently do is read the first page of reviews. If there are a lot of grammatical issues or totally unexplained plot pieces, a lot of times people will leave a constructive (or flame) point which also alerts me to the quality.
