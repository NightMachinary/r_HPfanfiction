I can't even logout on ffn it just keeps saying "Error 503, alert the admins if this persists"


** They posted this on their Twitter an hour ago:

Service for web/app will be impacted while we fix networking issues. Down time expected to be ~15 minutes.

** Yeah, error 503 just means the server is down or not able to respond to you for some reason. The reason is most likely basically what eqwe said.

** On PS/4 I get the error in desktop mode. Mobile mode works but is unreadable for me on the PS/4.
