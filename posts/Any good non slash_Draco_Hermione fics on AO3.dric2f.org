So far I'm really disappointed seeing that Ao3 is literally just a place for slash fics. Are there any good stories that aren't slash?

I haven't found any good Harry/Daphne fics on Ao3 yet so if someone knows any that aren't posted to ffnet as well, that'd be appreciated. I'm fine with longer action fics as well. Just anything worth reading with some plot.


** linkao3(4913998) is the first in a fantastic Slytherin Harry series that follows the first three books, and it remains my favorite of the Slytherin Harry genre.

linkao3(13760487) is a story where Harry gets adopted by a muggle couple that has great characterizations of Harry, Sirius, and Remus in particular.

linkao3(12985506) is a sweet Pansy/Ron story where they get locked in a manner over Christmas together. Very fluff.

link ao3(12424344; 13912332; 15687453) are three story by the same author that are both excellent. Grey Space is an AU where Hogwarts doesn't start until fourteen, so Harry goes to Stonewall High. In Sleeper, Harry enters another world when he dreams-- one that seems just slightly...off. Proof is a post-war story in which Harry and company attempt to fix the Wizengamot, featuring Harry trying to bake (and, largely, failing).

linkao3(431269) is a post-war one-shot featuring Blaise Zabini learning about football, muggle culture, and what happened to muggleborns during the war.

link ao3(17475989) follows Harry Potter's life with his new guardian- Albus Dumbledore.

BONUS FIC:

linkao3(3652266) is slash, but it's not a major facet of the story-- and its shaping up to be one of the most enjoyable, and, I suspect, tragic stories I've read.

  Pansy Parkinson is an expert in magical houses, and she has been sent to investigate Harrison Estate; a real trickster of a mansion that has been causing its previous owners no small amount of strife. A job like this could be dangerous, so Pansy requests help from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Unfortunately, the Auror they send over is none other than Ron Weasley. More unfortunately, the house then decided to lock them both in...

  The Founders have spent the last fifty years separated and drifting, but with Voldemort rising, they're headed back to Hogwarts once more. Between a wary Golden Trio, Umbridge, and Voldemort's shadowy plans, there's little time to deal with their own problems, even though Godric knows it's tearing the four of them apart---maybe even irreparably.
