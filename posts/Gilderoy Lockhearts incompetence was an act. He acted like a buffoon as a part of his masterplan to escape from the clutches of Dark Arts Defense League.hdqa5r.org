Gilderoy Lockheart was tired. He was tired of all the fame, all tbe publicity and all of the game of pretend he was forced to play. He wanted to retire.

Problem was, those old prudes in Dark Arts Defense League would not ever allow him to walk away. He needed to do something, something drastic enough that they would willingly give up their best mercenary. What better way than discrediting himself?

Problem was his fans. He did not even know he had so many! No matter how idiotic he acted or how disgustingly bad he made himself in magic to be, There was always dozens of them ready to jum on him. So when he realised those two young griffindors were eavsdroping, It was like an opurtunity in a silverplatter. He "revealed" all his evil plans before casting an obliviate that was luckily fake since it backfired.

Regardless, even that played into his plans as it allowed him to enjoy a room in St Mungos where he did not need to pay to stay and had free food. All in all, life was good for Gilderoy, Even if he was essentially trapped in a madhouse. At least he did not need to risk his life for the pockets of some old prudes anymore.


** I read one recently where it was all an act. He was part of some America Spy ring send to infiltrate hogwarts for some reason.
