* Harry equal to Tom
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: harry-equal-to-tom
  :END:
The prophesy says that Harry is Tom's equal, I'm looking for fanfictions where that's more apparent.

Give me your Tom Riddliest Harry fanfictions. Things I would sort of expect to see in such a fic:

- Pre-Hogwarts

Tom had figured out magic enough to be able to reliably perform various things. Harry should have something similar, not the same vicious abilities, but something. He does absurd amounts of garden work right? There's no way he hasn't run into a snake at least once and talked to it.

The Dursleys. In the orphanage, Tom rose to the top of the children's pecking order. I want Harry to do /something/ to improve his living conditions. That could mean reporting the Dursleys and being put into child care himself, however there's no way that Dumbledore would miss Harry leaving the home. I'd rather the fic not have an evil Dumbledore; he's not just going to obliviate everyone and put Harry back in the cupboard.

Harry could stay with the Dursleys, but I would expect him to handle Dudley and his friends, and possibly to have gotten himself out of the cupboard and into the second room. Maybe with blackmail.

- Hogwarts

The hat says Harry is cunning and ambitious? Lets see it.

Tom would have cried tears of joy if he found himself in Harry's position. Vault full of gold, instant legendary reputation as the Boy-Who-Lived.

Tom was a no-name orphan who had nothing and he managed to charm the entire school, bigoted pureblood included. He was a prodigy that performed what I assume to be an absurdly advanced soul splitting ritual entirely on his own before he graduated. He also basically put together his own cult - made up of people who should hold him in contempt for being a half blood.

Harry started from a far better position, I want to see him do at least as well, just not as evil.

Now that Harry knows about the wizarding world and his place in it, the only reason he should stay with the Dursleys is if he wants to - which he might, if the Dursleys just pretend he doesn't exist while he's home.

If he doesn't want to and Dumbledore says he has to? Who cares, fuck off old man. By now TomRiddle!Harry has probably befriended Susan and could easily talk to Amelia Bones about his home situation. If he hasn't, still, how hard would it be for the Boy-Who-Lived who also owns an owl and an invisibility cloak to talk to someone about it?

If Harry is forced into the Tri-Wizard tournament, I expect him to /own it/.

Draco Malfoy? Harry isn't putting up with this irritation. He either wins Draco over or decisively scares him off.

Severus Snape? They don't need to be buddy-buddy, but Harry improves this situation somehow. Earns his respect, gets some good blackmail, something.

Umbridge? Carving shit into his hand? I don't think so. That's the biggest mistake she'll ever make.

Don't get me wrong, this Harry is likely to be more morally gray than canon, but I want him to definitely be a good guy overall.

Any recommendations?

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

** Don't know of any, sorry, but point of order: the Hat did not say that Harry is cunning or ambitious, beyond saying that he had a thirst to prove himself. It didn't say that he belonged in Slytherin, merely that he would have done well there and it would have helped him be great.

** Woah that's a lot of criteria...I'm not sure if this helps but you could always search on the internet "Harry Potter calls child services on dursleys fanfic." Lots of fanfics pop up. This is usually the method I use to find the specific fanfics I want to read.

** I would also like to see a Harry that is more obviously equal to Tom, but I do recall there is one [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1217-pottercast-anelli.html][interview]] that implies the Sorting Hat was confused by the fragment in Harry's scar.

Given that I'd change your criteria to reduce the Slytherin traits. I think that Harry, like Riddle, and like his own mother for that matter, should have shown more conscious control over his magic, and much more skill in school. I, however, would lean heavily towards good Harry and less towards gray Harry, so I think he'd have avoided and worked around the Dursleys instead of directly harming or blackmailing them. I think he'd have been more effective in confronting Malfoy though, and more proactive about Snape and Umbridge. This would work really well with an AU in which Snape is out for himself and not actually supporting either side, but that isn't a requirement.

It wasn't just fragment of Voldemort soul, Harry wanted to prove himself in new world which mean ambition, he sometimes cheated, was breaking school rules, was cunning(but that was little shown) and had leadership skills adding horcrux to that is big combination features of slytherin, his griffindor side was just overshadown by his slytherin side during sorting and that was the reason Sorting Hat wanted him to be in slytherin the most.

**** Sure Harry breaks school rules, but so do the Weasley twins, so too do the Mauraders. He shows some cunning, as does Dumbledore (who was a Gryffindor). He has leadership skills; Godric Gryffindor was the first Headmaster, surely he had leadership skills as well. If you do not like that example, you can see leadership skills in the way Oliver handles the Quidditch team. Oliver is not the same caliber leader Harry becomes, but leadership is not a Slytherin trait, ambition is. Having ambition and cunning does not equate to having leadership skills. You could have great ambition and cunning, but no ability to motivate or inspire people.

I agree that Harry was concerned about failure, and that this desire to prove himself is a form of ambition. But contrast Harry with Draco. Both act rashly more often than not, in that sense despite both Draco and Snape's many many taunts, Draco could be just as "Gryffindorish" as Harry. Both boys have a huge thirst to prove themselves. If anything, Harry's is greater since Draco thinks he should not have to prove himself, his birth means he already has. Both boys are occasionally cunning (the vanishing cabinet plot is actually a decent idea for example), but frequently their plans are poorly thought out and fall through.

The key difference is that when push comes to shove, when virtue really gets tested, Draco acts in fear and terror in an attempt at self preservation, whereas Harry acts with fortitude and self sacrifice. Draco's ambition is all there is to him. Harry has bravery.

Most people have a mix of houses to their personality. Few people are pure Gryffindors or pure Slytherins. Harry is no exception; I'm not arguing that he has no cunning, ambition(Slytherin); loyalty, thirst for justice (Hufflepuff); or curiosity (Ravenclaw). I'm simply asserting that the evidence implies that without the soul fragment Slytherin would not have been strongly considered for Harry.

Honestly I'm sometimes surprised that Harry was not sorted into Hufflepuff. His loyalty to his friends is frequently the cause of his bravery after-all.
