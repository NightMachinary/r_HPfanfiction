Hidy howdy ho all. Loong time fanfic writer, emerged from the depths of tween fangirl writing to whatever I am today.

Totally upfront: promoting my own fic, exploring Harry as transgender woman in an AU Post-DH world:

#+begin_quote
  Post-DH. Amidst the war trial against Draco Malfoy, Harry admits to himself what he can't ignore any longer: that he isn't male. Can the Wizarding World accept a transgender person, even if they are the Boy Who Lived?
#+end_quote

Writing this fic and discussing its plot and rules with a friend got us talking about gender and sexuality in the Wizarding world. (Disclaimer: I'm a queer cis female author). Difference of the rainbow persuasion is just ignored in HP (along with a lot of minorities!) How do you think the Wizarding world would handle a transgender witch or wizard? Are there any magical precedents? (In British/Celtic mythology, I can't find zip). Is there a reason Dumbledore wasn't out - is the Wizarding world too conservative? Because of its small size, is heterosexuality and its procreation a must?

SO MANY QUESTIONS, JK.

Any fics you know deal with these ideas?


** This is an a la carte topic: canon made little mention of sexuality, even neglecting to specify the nature of Albus' relationship with Gellert, but the attack press and scandal-mongers never suggested anything about Dumbledore having too 'close' a relationship to Harry. No taunting about Crabbe and Goyle being polyjuiced into firstie witches while acting lookout for Draco was even mentioned. About the only thing they seem bothered by was the lack of consent involved with Aberforth and his goats. On the far edge of morality we have Hagrid breeding a reptile and mammal together to create a Lovercraftian horror that, despite being direct evidence of illegal breeding, was proudly included in the Tournament maze.

There are many fics that talk about sexuality, usually as a precursor to angst or sex or both. Fanfiction exists for us to explore the issues, but canon basically shrugs.

I had a few things to say about it in linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path), if you're curious... and brave.

Consent? They're bothered by the "inappropriateness" of the charms -- and we never do find out what those charms were. My personal headcanon is that those goats now breathe fire. Which in a wooden village is kind of inappropriate.

Thinking on the idea of metamorphmagi, and of polyjuice potions, I wonder if magically switching genders is seen as a normal, yet temporary thing, but any actual permanent changes are just unheard of.

That being said, with Polyjuice allowing temporary gender switching, there has to be an unlimited amount of magic and shenanigans for use in the bedroom.

** Personally I think Dumbledore WAS "out" (those outfits, c'mon)- but any kind of sexuality is not really appropriate to discuss with students under your care. And Harry didn't have any kind of links to Wizarding families besides the Weasleys so he wouldn't have heard any wizarding gossip at all. And anyway DD hasn't been with anyone in ages so there's no real gossip anyway.

** Considering they have metamorphmagi, who can change their bodies completely (yes, they can walk all over the rainbow if they so desire), I don't think one's gender identification is /that much/ of an issue for them. And with Dumbledore, it may very well be that it was a case of single-target sexuality for Gellert only (assuming the thing between them was actually sexual in nature) which means there would not be much of a chance for him to be “found out” (heck, even the rumour about him being in love with the guy might be scandalous not because of the homosexuality but because they were enemies).

So really, I don't there would be quite that much of a problem if Harry were trans-whatever (not meaning to insult here, I just acknowledge that there is more than one word that begins with “trans-” that people can, and will, use). That is, in general; on the other hand we have the whole “Boy-Who-Lived” thing which means that some people might accept that Harry Potter is a girl but no accept that the “Boy-Who-Lived” is and doing some weird mental dance with this equation, and people like Snape with their issues and penchant for not listening to others.

That being said, “male” refers to one's sex, not gender. So your summary kind of is wrong there, unless it's a “Harry got magically changed into a girl but is a man mentally” story in which case the term “isn't male” would be accurate.

*** Interesting points! Like I said in an earlier reply, I wonder though if magical/temporary gender change is accepted, but permanent change is just an unknown or taboo in the Wizarding World. The community JK presents does seem sort of conservative and not as up to speed as the muggle world.

Mmm, I see your point there, thanks. The story is about Harry being transgender and transitioning into a woman. It is more focused on the emotional transition rather than the standard stereotypical clothes! makeup! feminine things! that we see atm (although some of that is lightly included).

*** Just an FYI if your not sure which label to use but are sure that it falls under the transgender umbrella you can just use the term 'Trans*' rather than trans-whatever.

Edit: One more nitpick.

In general our society uses the term gender and sex interchangeably because for 99.7% of the population one is the other. Having Harry come to the realization he isn't male isn't wrong, so much as an awkward choice of wording. What's more important is the implications behind the words. "I'm not male" is strictly false but in the given context couldn't be more true.

**** Honestly, as far as the latter nitpick goes ... well, I won't say that you are wrong or anything, but strictly speaking it was not really necessary. Because in this case Harry would be male, but a girl, so whatever the general populace's assumptions are, “not male” isn't really the case. Regardless of the intent of the person thinking it or their wishes. Because “male” and “female” are terms used in biology, not in studies on society.

And thanks for the comment about adding the asterisk; I generally add “-whatever” or “-ish” or things like that to words when it's not an exact match and I don't know what to add exactly, so I went with this route here too, but I shall remember from now on. Though I generally try to avoid using asterisks on this site because they are used for formatting.

** I can't help you with British history, but the "priests" (probable trans folk in history always seem to be assumed crossdressers, so who knows) of Freyr wore women's clothes and makeup, spoke softly, and walked with a feminine gait. In the middle east and central Asia, you have the transsexual priestesses of Cybele, Ishtar, and Ashteroth. Among some of the circumpolar peoples, particularly in Siberia, transgender behavior is seen as a clear sign of a very powerful shaman. There was also a cult of Scythian priestesses who reportedly produced a "female poison" (estrogen) from the urine of pregnant mares that could turn a man into a woman.

**** Well, there was a very heavy Norse influence before and during the time Hogwarts was founded, but the feminine priests (Im convinced that they were priestesses, but theres no proof they werent just ritualistic crossdressers) of Freyr were only known to be at Uppsala, so far as I'm aware. So... yeah. On the other hand, wherever transgender individuals or behavior are seen in antiquity, they're almost always connected to the spiritual, magical, and divine, so you wouldnt be stretching the truth to far by borrowing from other places and using them in Britain. Of course, none of these positive associations survived Christianity which was firmly entrenched in Britain well before the 8th century.

**** The Norse bit is a little... harsh on theses points. While it is true that there were practitioners of seidr (loosely translates to "sorcery") and that there are strong indications that they were also reviled, to an extent, for doing so. The practice of seidr was considered ergi ("unmanly") for two reasons, lots of it was tied in with feminine sexuality and sorcery was considered feminine in itself on account of being guileful, secretive and non confrontational. Basically a dagger in the back of an enemy rather than a challenge to ritual combat. Contemporary sources also seem to suggest that practitioners were more feared than respected due to the harm they could cause if affronted.

This is all a bit contrary though, as Odin himself was a practitioner of seidr (in fact, Loki taunts him about it in one of the sagas, basically the Norse way of calling him a pussy or a fag)

It's also about a lot more - that's just one strand of quite a few plot threads being woven together. Veela culture is fleshed out. Magical ritual holiday ceremonies (like Beltane, Yule, Imbolc) play important roles. The appropriateness of using violence and especially the intent to cause harm is debated. And more!
