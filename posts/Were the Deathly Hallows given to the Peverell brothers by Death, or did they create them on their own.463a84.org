It seems there are 2 main views on this topic.

1) While the story may be embellished it is mostly true, and Death (or something like Death) gave the three brothers the items.

2) The Peverell brothers were accomplished wizards who created these amazing artifacts, and "The Tale of the Three Brothers" is a just a story that was spread regarding these legendary items.

Lets have some good discussion with thought out reasons as to why its one or the other!

I like to think it was Death that gave them the items, mostly since this is the wizarding world we are talking about. Myths here will have much more truth in them than we may think. The following are some thoughts on why Death gave these items, and how various "plot holes" can be filled using these ideas.

"But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers..." (TTotTB). I see Death here as acting truly cunning, like a djinn. Granting gifts (wishes) in such a way that satisfies the request, but not the intent /of/ the request.

1) Elder Wand: "...a wand more powerful than any in existence...that must always win /duels/ for its /owner/...worthy of a wizard /who had conquered Death/!" (TTotTB).

Plot hole: Dumbledore beat Grindelwald while the latter had the Elder Wand.

There are so many possible loopholes in this request. "Must always win /duels/", so if Dumbledore didn't formally challenge Grindelwald to a duel, or if their fight was during a battle of many wizards, it still holds true. "For its /owner/", perhaps the only true owner was the eldest peverell brother, so once he was murdered and the wand stolen, no other wizard was ever the owner, and while it was still a powerful wand it didn't guarantee wins for anyone anymore. "Worthy of a wizard /who had conquered Death/", surviving a river crossing that most die doing probably isn't conquering Death (though it might be defying Death), so perhaps the only one who would be guaranteed wins, the true "owner" of the wand, would be one who was immortal (like Flamel and the Philosopher's Stone, or Voldemort with his horcruxes), or the one who had united all the hallows (Harry, eventually).

2) The Resurrection Stone: "...asked for the power to /recall others from Death/." (TTotTB)

Plot hole: There are none that I'm aware of.

We already know the trickery of Death in this case, he gave the power to recall the dead in spirit form for a limited time, not true resurrection like the second brother intended. A clear case of Death cunningly avoiding the intent of the request.

3) Cloak of Invisibility: "The youngest brother...did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from /that place/ without being /followed/ by Death." (TTotTB)

Plot hole: Dumbledore AND Moody can see through the cloak.

Here is where its a bit more muddled. Later we see the line, "But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him." (TTotTB) To paraphrase the end, when the third brother took off the cloak he greeted Death as an old friend and departed this life. If Death can't find the youngest brother, why can Dumbledore and Moody find Harry?

Obviously while the cloak allowed the brother to leave without being followed, the youngest brother somehow also prevented death from finding him later. There are 2 options i see. First, Death was cunning and the cloak lost its power over Death (and over clever wizards) after the third brother left /that place/, but since the third brother was "the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers" (TTotTB), he took other precautions to ensure Death didn't find him later like his brothers. To add to his ruse, the brother made a show of taking off his cloak when he was ready to die, in order to add to the mystery of his heirloom cloak. Second, Death was unable to work around the restrictions of the request to his advantage, due to Death's powers. There was no item other than Death's own cloak that would enable someone to leave a place "without being /followed/ by Death." So "Death, most /unwillingly/, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility." (TTotTB). In this case we still need to consider how Dumbledore and Moody were able to circumvent what Death could not. This is my idea: Magic has evolved in the years since the Peverell brothers lived, and Death was never a wizard to begin with. Dumbledore and Moody found spells to see through Invisibility Cloaks that Death has no access to, or perhaps they used some sort of tracking charm on Harry that the cloak couldn't hide.

So that is what I think would fit Canon. Poke holes in my theory, agree, disagree, etc. -- I'd love to hear what others think!


** The tale is just that, a tale.

The artefacts were probably created by the three brothers themselves. Though there's nothing in the text to support this, it's what I believe/think most likely. The tale also exaggerate their powers, if anything, the resurrection stone not being able actually resurrect people from the dead is a red herring in it self. The wand isn't unbeatable and the cloak isn't foolproof either.

*** I agree. The legend exaggerates the items powers. The cloak could be just a cloak, but special in that it doesn't wear out. The wand may just be a wand, but special in that its much more powerful in dueling magic than most. If anything the stone is the most special in this respect, since it isn't an "more powerful" version of an existing item, its a unique, one of a kind enchantment.

And since the book doesn't specifically state that the brothers made the items or that the tale is actually true, we can all have our opinions about which it really is!

**** doesn't belief that Death is an intelligent acting entity conflict with almost all of cannon? after all if Death is real with intelligence then why is he never seen/interacted with? it appears to have similar problems to existance of god. The only evidence for is old tales and their is a wealth of lack of eviddence of current existance (no way to detect Death, no one interacts with Death, Death commits no discernable actions) If Death existed in the past he would continue to exist, after all by definition Death would be immortal

** Most legends have some truth in them, and the truth is most likely that these three brothers did possess these artifacts, but they likely created them themselves, and while powerful, are not infallible.

Otherwise we're led to believe that there is some otherworldly entity called Death that has no other reference in canon other than the tale in which the entity is featured, and I don't buy that.

** I also like to believe that the story is more than metaphoric. I don't have any reason for it other than I like it better that way.

My pet theory about why moody (actually crouch) and Dumbledore can see through the cloak is this: the cloak allows you to go without death following you. Almost everyone I'm the book series is afraid of death; there are only four characters I can think of who I would describe as truly unafraid of death. Dumbledore, who is wise enough to not be afraid, Crouch Jr, who is devoted enough to be willing to sacrifice himself, Moody, who is principled and determined enough to die for his cause, and Flamel, who has lived long enough to realize death is a rest, not a loss.

Only two of these wizards are ever shown seeing through the cloak: Crouch and Dumbledore. I think the reason other people can see through the cloak is that other people are afraid of death, and thus they carry death with them wherever they go. Only people who do not carry the burden of death can see through the cloak, because the cloak allows you to hide from death, not people.

** Option 3) Other people created them but are lost to history and the reason the Peverell brothers are remembered is that with bringing them together and spinning an iconic lie around their acquisition they made a public impact.

** I'd have to go back and re-read PS to make sure, but I'd always gotten the impression that Dumbledore couldn't really see through Harry's cloak, he just knew that Harry was wearing it and present in the room with the Mirror of Erised. The omnipresent doublespeak and half-truths 'Any sufficiently perceptive wizard can see through the effects of simple trinkets, my boy.'

Moody's eye, on the other hand, requires a bit more hoop-jumping. I'd just figured that it was either charmed entirely by Dumbledore with the Elder Wand, or just added to with a 'see through invisibility cloaks' spell that because was cast with the Deathstick, could see through Death's own cloak of invisibility.

** Fairy tales are often based on stories that are already around. Grimm's Fairy Tales were not really written by the Grimm brothers - rather, they were an amalgation of various fairy tales that they had heard. The tales also aren't 'exact' in a sense. They would have heard each fairy tale multiple times, each with minor, or even major variations. They're also living. Not all parents will remember it exactly, and some would even have made changes to make it more 'dramatic.'

Assuming the book we have is just an excerpt, Beedle likely did something similar. So, the idea that they met death is probably false, since it's likely an embellishment added somewhere along the line. Nowhere else is Death mentioned, and it's unlikely that such a being would exist, even in a magical world. Plus, this tale isn't the only one with made up things - see Babbity rabbity, and the Warlock's Hairy Heart. So, I think that, it's extremely likely that the Hallows were not given to the Peverells by death.

I think, however, that it's much more likely that they received the hallows from another wizard, or a member of another magical race. It's a very simple change to the story - instead of receiving it from person A, they got it from person B. If, however, they had made the hallows themselves, it would be a much larger change, and would be much harder for it to turn into the modern version.

Other reasons I think it was given to them by someone else, is that to make these magical items would have required a /lot/ of work and knowledge. The brothers would need a lot of study, knowledge, and time to make these. Other people would know about this - it's kinda hard to study in complete secrecy, and convince other people you're not really doing it. So it would be more or less common knowledge that they were intelligent, and not a huge leap for most people to assume they made these items, making both the fairy tale, and the legend much harder to develop. Plus, the brothers behaviour is a bit difficult to fit with this. They're all smart - and yet, the first brother boasts about his unbeatable wand. The third brother, on the other hand, seems to do a lot of hiding, so how would knowledge of the invisibility cloak get out? Similarly, it's unlikely the resurrection ring would be boasted of. So, we've got one item that a smart person would conceal, and two items that are personal, and of which knowledge wouldn't really be spread around of.

TL;DR: Death was a literary device, the truth in the story is that the Peverell brothers got it from someone else. It fits more with the story, and assuming they made it brings up a few problems.

*** I like this. Great reasoning! I mentioned in the post about it being Death or some being "like" Death that gave them the items, but I like the idea of a different magical race the best. It would explain how wandmakers that may have tried to emulate the legend of the elder wand never came close, or enchanters that tried to make an invisibility cloak that never faded failed as well. If a wizard/witch made it once, in many generations it should be able to be recreated. But not if they were given them by another race that has kept their knowledge from wizards!

** I feel like even in the Wizarding World, death is not a corporeal being. While you have "fixed" the plot holes, which I say loosely because I can't agree that death came up with the technicality of the Elder Wand, you haven't said why you think it was death who gave them the hallows.

To me, the idea of death hanging around a river like some magical Wile E. Coyote seems stupid. Death doesn't plan deaths, he just picks us up after the fact. If he was like that, he would have been gunning for both Voldemort and Harry who have escaped certain death multiple times.

It is far more likely that the Peverells, after crossing a river that would most certainly have killed them, started thinking about how one could /prevent/ death. These brothers, brilliant even by wizard standards, each came up with their own way of prolonging lives as much as possible. The Elder wand, a powerful wand to protect its users from those who mean ill; the Resurrection Stone, to keep those who have died from passing on; and the Cloak of Invisibility, which hides its user from danger. Of these brothers, only the one who looked not to conquer death, but just stay out of the way survived very long. In fact, using this, he survived so long as to be noteworthy.

This story, started as interesting news of the three brothers who sort to conquer death, became more outlandish through time, as stories often do. For evidence of this sort of thing happening, you only need to look at Harry. He is literally known as the Boy Who Lived.

That's my theory, at least.

*** I actually did say why i think Death gave them the items, though not with a lot of explanation. While there is no proof either way, and it may be "more likely" that the brothers created them, my take on the wizarding world is that unexplained things can easily happen, like death actually showing up and giving gifts to three semi random brothers. Fairy tales and Myths in the wizarding world are just as likely to be mostly made up as they are to be mostly real, because MAGIC!

Not a great reason, but hey, they don't explicitly give us the answer, so I like to believe the more fanciful story :)

**** My response to this is an "eeeehhhh..." with a raised wavering hand. I will concede the point that magic exists, and stories like merlin and dragons are true. The problem is, every wizard worth their salt knows these are true, while the deathly hallows are treated as children's stories. And yes, the deathly hallows were real, but even so, they weren't nearly as good as the story says.

The invisibility cloak was about as good (maybe worse) as any other cloak of concealment and whatnot, citing moody seeing through it and people can still hear you. The resurrection stone worked exactly as stated, so no actual resurrecting. The elder wand was just a pretty powerful wand which could lose as you said yourself.

If death was a corporeal thing, people would be actively looking for ways to evade, deceive and trap him and you know it. There wouldn't be one, but thousands of stories of those who had attempted and succeeded to cheat death.

As nice as it is to believe death is real because MAGIC, even when harry was dead, there was no death there to greet him and say "oh no, not yet buddy." Just another spirit.

***** Very true, i never really though of it that way. If Death were real it would be hunted (and he no longer has his fancy cloak!). Also, the history of wizards is our fairy tales, so their fairy tales would need to be mostly fiction /for them/.

That said, many of the tales of beedle the bard could happen in the magic world with less tweaking than our arthurian legends would take to happen in the "real world". So while i completely agree that its not death that gave them the items (/something/ has to be made up), i like the idea of a previous poster that it was a different magical race that gifted them the items.
