  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Maybe he now actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well...

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic. Non-epilogue compliant, non-slash.

** Linkffn(Natasha Romanoff and the Secrets of Death) for Harry Potter/MCU

The start of the premise is that Death from the HP universe resurrects Black Widow after her death on Vormir (Avengers: Endgame), plonks her on Halloween 1981 in Harry's room just after Voldemort had offed himself and asks her to look after Harry as he's in danger. She takes Harry and runs. Death from the MCU universe then resurrects the just deceased James and Lily Potter to fuck with her counterpart (and everyone else).

  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. But meeting Death himself who gives her a baby who's being hunted by terrorists? That's a new one. Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her. Natasha Mother Figure. T/M rating.
