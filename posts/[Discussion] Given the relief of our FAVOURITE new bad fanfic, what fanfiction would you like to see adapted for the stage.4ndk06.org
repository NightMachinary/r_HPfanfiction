Just for pure entertainment value, I'd love to see a play version of My Immortal - Dumbledore's character alone would be more than worth seeing, and I'd love to see the drama put into the costume department's presumably massive Hot Topic budget.

They could even have a guest appearance by Gerard Way!

Otherwise, perhaps a live action version of the Potter Puppet Pals, with everyone wearing terrifying puppet masks. The Mysterious Ticking Noise: A Play In Three Acts.
