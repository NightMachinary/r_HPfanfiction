I'm looking for fanfics where Harry is gay but that's not what the whole point of the story. I'm not looking for something smutty either (it's okay if it comes up in the story but I don't want that to be the focus). Also please no Harry/Older Male (ie. Snape, Sirius, Remus, Voldemort, etc.)

** You could try Shadow Magic by Lomonaaeren. It's Harry/Theo, but romance isn't the focus. It is Slytherin Harry and iirc has some slight Dumbledore bashing, but again not the focus. It's complete at 50k words, so even if it's not normally your cup of tea it might be worth a read.

  HPTN slash. AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically. Amoral Harry, seven parts. COMPLETE.

** Not Harry, but Draco in The Man who Lived. The fic is a character study, that just so happens to have a small romantic plot.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

  Young Harry is flamboyantly gay and forms a connection with his cousin. The result? Dudley loses a punching bag but gains a sassy gay friend! Based on the Sassy Gay Friend videos made by Second City Network. Now with more drabbles!
