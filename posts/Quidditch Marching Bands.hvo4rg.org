I just feel like it'd be neat to read a fic where Hogwarts has marching bands for its House quidditch teams.

All the marching band fics I've found were for college AUs, and while those are also neat, I'm a huge sucker for the high school marching band life. The competitiveness and stamina you're expected to keep for marching band is absolutely insane.

The thought of Draco bribing all the marching bands to play a melody of a song saying Potter Stinks in Goblet of Fire during one of the tasks is really funny to me. They're desperate to play anything since there's no quidditch games to play for.

So yeah, please share your Hogwarts marching band fics.

+I play piccolo for marching band btw. I'm the one bleeding all your ears with high pitched squeaking.+


** Britpicking police!

Marching bands around sport events are very American thing, aren't they?

*** Yep. Pretty much our only marching bands are military, scouting clubs, and big city-street parades.

But we also don't really have any School Sporting things as big as Quidditch is in Harry Potter, so the magical world is definitely not like Real Life UK in this case.

Everyone goes to Quidditch Matches at Hogwarts and knows the players, but I couldn't even tell you if any school I went to even HAD a sports team, nevermind who was on it or when they played. Our school sports are... way less bombastic than the Americans are.

And well, this is fanfiction. If people can use 'Mom', they can use 'Marching Bands' at Sports events. Could even make it that Ilvermorny played a match against Hogwarts some centuries ago and the school picked up the habit from there, if OP wanted a verisimilitude reason for it to happen.

Of course, everything is less bombastic than the American equivalent ;), but I would think that events like the Oxford-Cambridge boat race, and ... actually I cannot find anything else, I would expect some inter-university matches in football or rugby (after rugby is because of The Rugby School, isn't it?), but I cannot find anything on Wikipedia at the moment.

***** Exactly. I would imagine every school I went to had at least one sports team, but I heard literally nothing about them to the point that I didn't even know if they existed while I attended there. And I wasn't exactly at Harry Potter levels of obliviousness to just have not noticed. :D

And the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race is more of a unique school historical thing than a cultural one. Oxford and Cambridge university culture is practically a subculture all of its own, these days. It's not indicative of greater UK culture, just the individual schools.

*** I vaguely remember one of my non-American friends laughing about a marching band playing for a soccer game one time since they usually stick to competitions with other marching bands, but it's quite possible that could have been a fever dream. But yeah, it's def more of an American thing.
