Harry inherits a property with House elves and all of them are the complete opposite to normal house elves in the terms of language. Where normal house elves talk like a two year old just learning the language Harry's new elves are extremely sophisticated and hold the worlds largest thesaurus in their heads. Their grammar is flawless and they constantly pick Harry out on his poor grammar. When they speak they use essay formatting and language techniques of all kinds in their speech. Harry returns to Hogwarts after a summer with the elves with a vastly extended vocabulary and a remarkable ability to write essays.


** Perhaps the elves watched a lot of Yes, Minister while waiting for an owner to return? And took cues on how to be a proper servant from Sir Humphrey Appleby?
