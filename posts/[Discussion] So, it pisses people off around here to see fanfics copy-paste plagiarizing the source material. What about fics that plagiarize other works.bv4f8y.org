So, is it just me where it really equally as pisses me off to be reading a fic and see a whole entire concept or dialogue ripped out of other stuff, like TV shows and other books and movies? Like, examples here: The entirety of Ender's Game being plagiarized by that Methods of Rationality story written by that smartass cultist dude.

Or, this other fic I just read recently that had an /entire conversation/ copied and pasted, word for word from Mass Effect and just plopped into their story! I mean /fuck/, am I alone in thinking that if you can't think up meaningful, "deep" or interesting dialogue yourself, then don't even try it? Do something else with your storyline, go somewhere else with it! Or at least try and take the risk it sucks. But to be so lazy or unoriginal that you literally plagiarize an /entire conversation out of another work/ and use it like its your own? Cause it doesn't make your story at all as interesting or cool or whatever as the /original work you stole it from./ It's infuriating to see people praise the author like /they/ came up with it themselves when they just stole it!

It seriously pisses me off and makes me stop reading when I see fanfic authors pulling this shit. Why can't you be as creative as you were in the whole /rest of your fic?!/ Why copy-paste entire parts of other works into your shit? It's like Frankenstein's Monster, a totally out of place part that's just tackily sewed onto the rest and looks like shit.

And then you have all these people in the reviews section going all, "OMG that was so CHILLING ITS SO AWESOME THATS SUCH A SCARY CHARACTER!" Bitch, it's an entire plagiarized conversation and nothing about it was original or uniquely thought up by the author! Their character would be flat as shit without something to steal from that's actually /good/ and /better than their shit/.

So yeah. That's a rant. Sorry. Had to get it out, after running into this more than once recently, with the above examples.

To me it's worse than plagiarizing whole sections out of the source, because at least then maybe you just don't want to have to write the whole scene out again or whatever, and you have the E-Books on hand or something so you just do it.

**** Does she plagiarize? I didn't know that. I just finished reading the last book in her new series and all I could think was that it read like a fanfic. It actually had a threesome in it. It's YA so no actual sex scenes or anything but it was basically a slash fanfic.

*** Not quite. The concept off all of those battles between the 3 factions is similar, as well as the progression of things against Harry's army. There was one line when the whole team was training underwater and Harry asks the rest of Chaos Legion something along the lines of "What are you all doing upside down?" That line was taken from the books, if not in letter then in spirit, but I saw that more as a comedic nod to Ender's Game more than anything.

**** Yes, HPMOR contains hat tips to many, many different fantasy and scifi works, not just /Ender's Game/. The references are usually just names of characters or spell names. The author of HPMOR has always encouraged people to pick out the references and enjoy reading/watching/listening to the original works.

In the case of /Ender's Game/, Monty Python, /Warhammer 40k/, /Star Wars/, /Lord of the Rings/ etc. those are all actually in-universe references, because the AU nerdy version of Harry Potter in 1991 is a fan of those muggle works and enjoys quoting them/taking genre-savvy lessons from them. The author wasn't trying to pull a fast one; his version of Harry is simply a fan of scifi and fantasy.

** I think taking concepts and general ideas an putting your own twist on them is fine, but that does not mean simply copy-pasting other people's work.

It also depends on how well-known the source material is. If you adapt the plot of Pulp Fiction for your fic and even use some of the dialogue, people will recognise it and think of it as an adaptation/reference, but ripping off your your fellow ficwriter? It's plain old stealing, and I'm amazed how many people did not get the memo that stealing is wrong.

Regarding lifting concepts of others, all I'll say is that this is a key aspect of fanfiction. Directly using concepts from others is one of the staples of this craft (among other things, like lifting others' concepts and mixing and matching to make something new, or creating a story for your OTP). Because of that, I don't see any issue with HPMOR satirizing or emulating parts of Ender's Game, nor do I find it an issue when other fics do the same. Hell, even for published literary works, people can write books with concepts very similar to each other, legally, without even mentioning it, so long as other aspects of the work are sufficiently different enough. So to hold unpaid fanfiction authors to a higher standard seems a bit silly to me.

Even with dialogue, if it's not the fanfic author's original work, but fits the story better than anything the author can come up with, I don't consider it a problem because the way i see it, the fanfic author felt that this was the best dialogue for the situation. That said, I feel anybody who rips the dialogue directly from another work should credit who they took it from.

** For a second I thought you meant quoting stuff from the Canon books. I do that in my fic when the stuff is exactly same: I just put it in bold and mention that it is quoted directly from the books

I agree with you, although only partly. I personally wouldn't mind reading a appropriately relevant dialogue copied from somewhere, as long as it is credited (in the AN for that chapter or something)

I think fanfiction is something that should be free of the shackles of originality given its nature. But only as long as it is credited
