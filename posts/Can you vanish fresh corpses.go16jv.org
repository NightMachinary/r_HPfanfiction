Just like the title. Can you vanish a fresh corpse or do you have to wait for it to begin decomposition or is the fact that it could be intact (you broke their neck or used the Killing Curse, but it's still whole) would screw the whole symbolic and not work on it? Would you have to rip its heart and behead it before vanishing the evidence? Also, while at it, could you empty someone's body of the entirety of its blood by using an overpowered /Tergeo/?

Asking for a friend...


** You could probably, in theory, vanish a living person. Small mammals like kittens however, are as we learn in ootp, very challenging to vanish. So humans would probably be even more challenging.

This difficulty rating probably also applies to corpses, because in GoF Barty does not vanish the corpse of his father, but instead turns it into a bone and buries the bone. Would not vanishing it be superior and leave even less evidence? So perhaps it was beyond his skill level.

Not really sure where the ripping out someone's heart and beheading came from, but it's possible that smaller parts of a human would be easier to vanish, just like smaller mammals are easier to vanish.

You have to remember the guy's fucking nuts - he probably knew about the "Bone of the Father" ritual, and intended it as a further symbolic link between him and Voldy (remember he had a whole list during his monologue at the end of GoF)

*** I thought in the symbolic lines that since the heart and the brain are pretty much the two most vital organs, removing them from the body (even though they aren't working anymore) would amplify that the person you try to vanish is well and truly dead, therefore an object by certain definitions.

** While I see [[/u/blast_ended_sqrt][u/blast_ended_sqrt]] point that Crouch jr was insane, I think it's more interesting to take canon at face value in terms of the limitations that magic has. It is entirely in line with a world where certain potions only work for people who are completely human & where souls exist (as again pointed out by [[/u/blast_ended_sqrt][u/blast_ended_sqrt]]), to have magic that in principle should work on what's really just meat on the bone but which does not. Thus, I hold that Crouch jr transfigured his father because it was the best available option. Hence, vanishing corpses is not something I think the "rules" allow for.

** One thing I haven't seen mentioned here is that humans have souls; it might not be a matter of complexity, but that it's flat-out impossible to Vanish (or do certain other basic magic to) something with a human soul.

(The HPverse doesn't say anything about animal souls - maybe they don't have souls the way humans do, or maybe there's an Elder Scrolls-like distinction between sapient and subsapient souls.)

** If you take Taure's theory on vanishing, you could then conjure said corpse out of non-being. I doubt the heart and head would really have to be removed for it to count as conceptually dead.

** BCJ transfigured his freshly dead father, so I don't see why one wouldn't be able to vanish it.

*** u/Taure:
#+begin_quote
  He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot worse. At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall.
#+end_quote

Harry just about manages to vanish an iguana and he's an E-level Transfiguration student. We also know that the difficulty of vanishing increases with complexity.

Therefore while I imagine that it is magically possible to vanish a human being, I doubt it's within the capability of even a normal O-level student. You probably need to be a master of the art to manage it.

**** I wonder if there have been experiments to that end. We know that the Vanishing Cabinet is based on the Vanishing charm, but it would make for a great fic-hook if someone created a way to reconstitiute vanished objects and beings.

You'd get a lot of garbage, a lot of dead bodies, but very rarely, you might get people who disappeared during cabinet transference, who never apparated after disapparating, whose portkey broke mid-transit.

Or for crossovers, perhaps another device, like the Stargate, or a Star Trek transporter, is advanced enough to catch the stray magical pattern of the protagonist as it drifts through the interdimensional medium, rematerializing them in that universe.

Would definitely be a better crossover hook than just the Veil /again/.

*** Exactly, and why in the world he would bother with transfiguration into a bone, when he could vanish it completely? QED, he couldn't.
