I've seen so many where someone becomes Harry and even a few with Hermione but I'm wondering if anyone has written any for Ron. And the time travel fics I've seen that include Ron are only including him as part of the group, never him on his own. I'm mostly looking for Ron being badass and maybe manipulative if I can find it.


** I'm reminded of the Ronbledore theory here.

** I've only ever read one Ron time-travelling on his own fic and it wasn't very good and was abandoned before it even really got going. I've searched through hundreds of Ron fics as well and not come across another one hopefully someone else has one.

** There's linkffn(Gryffindors Never Die) where Ron and Harry both travel back. Ron isn't the protagonist, but he's the second-most important character after Harry and is actually from a future where he's been Minister for Magic for over twenty years, with Harry as his right-hand man.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

This was really good! But finding its abandoned was a real disappointment.

  So," he said conversationally, while his grip on his wand tightened even more. "Time travel then? Alternate dimensions? Voldemort induced hallucinations? Something else impossible?" AU, M for language
