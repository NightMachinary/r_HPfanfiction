Looking for fics where Harry attempts to gain an edge over Voldemort via various methods, but ends up becoming a far worse threat as a result. For example, he might use some sort of ritual to make himself stronger magically, but end up turning into a parasite that feeds on the magic of others. Or maybe creates the potion equivalent of a super-soldier serum that turns him into an implacable killing machine, continuing to slaughter even once the Death Eaters are destroyed. Maybe he makes a chemical weapon to use on the Death Eaters, but it breaks containment and mutates him.

Regardless of methods, he must become a monstrous being, lacking in any humanity or empathy. If he has a relationship, he dominates their will and uses them as a tool (/no smut though/) or else they are as monstrous as him. No happy, lovey-dovey redemption. If he's redeemed, it has to be because whatever power turned him into a monster is undone. If anyone knows any existing fics like this, I'd love to read them! I was inspired by a past reading of The Prisoner's Cipher, plus playing lots of [Prototype].

Thanks!


** This was in the past one of my favorite fanfictions that features this, although it diverges from canon quite a bit, and I haven't read it in a while so its quality may be worse than I remember. However I still recommend it.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

*** I've read this before. I made it a few chapters in and couldn't go on. He's supposed to be a powerful Sith, according to the narrative, but he's an absolute animal. Does nothing but kill and have sex. This seems to be consistent with most of what Darth Marrs writes, and there's nothing necessarily... wrong with it, but it's not my type of story. I won't say it doesn't fit the prompt though, besides the creepy sexual behavior in it. Thanks anyway!

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

***** It's been awhile since I read this particular one...

I remember correctly it's a heavy Harry/Fleur story. It starts off slow but eventually the get together and I think there are some chapters from her POV.

Sorry I can't be of more help!
