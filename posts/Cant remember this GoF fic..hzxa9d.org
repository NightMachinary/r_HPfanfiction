:END:
Ok, so I remember that Harry goes into the chamber of secrets after he is announced as the fourth champion, dobby cleans the place up for him, he misses the wand weighing, and hes being taught by a system the Salazar slytherin left for his heir. Basically he finds the library, finds Salazars diary, reads it, a new book could be selected to read, after finishing, and practicing it. Only then can he read the next book. I also remember him installing something for hedwig, and accidentally making his model dragon into a real one, he does a ritual using dragons too.

  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.
