Hi everyone,

I just finished the fic "Bearings" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3137306/1/]]) and I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the story but also how it was written, it was written with the mindset of a grown up 22 year old Harry instead of some angsty teenager who started to discover love with an insecure Ginny.

Anyway, does someone know a story like Bearings? I don't really like time traveling and a Godlike Harry but everything else is okay. Thanks!


** on top of my head I can remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10050946/1/At-Long-Last][at long last]] it's still being updated and it's set 3 years after the battle of hogwarts
