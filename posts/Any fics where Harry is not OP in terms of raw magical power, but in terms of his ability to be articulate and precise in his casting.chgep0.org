** That's difficult to find.

There's obviously no such thing as a magical core in canon, but authors like that.

They also like making Harry indeterminately stronger than his peers.

Then there's the whole intent thing powering spell strength.

I kinda like a mix of 2 & 3. Where each character varies in spellcasting, but intent does a lot of good.

I'll look though. I read something with a good teacher Quirrell that sounded like that, in which every wizard had the same potential.

** By articulate you mean he pronounces spells well? Well it's clearly not sign for a strong wizard as we know you can silent cast. If he's not proficient in silent casting a simple silencing spell will do him so it's rarely a feature we see in fics.

At best if we consider that you need the wand movement you can find fics where you can flow from one spell movement to another to gain speed (spell chains).
