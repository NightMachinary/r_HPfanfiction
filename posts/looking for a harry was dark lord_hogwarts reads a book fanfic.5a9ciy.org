Looking for a Dark lord harry potter that sends back a book of his life to harry potter during the G.O.F (Harry/Daphne maybe also Harry/Hermione).


** Linkffn(The Dark Phoenix) - I think this is the story you are looking for.

**** Yep. One of the shittiest story you will ever find along with linkffn(Paid In Blood) in the fandom. Funny thing both story has similar plot - Harry being Dark Lord in the future & pairing H/D.

  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.

***** True, but it's one of the few 'Hogwarts reads' that had nothing to do with the J.K Rowelings Harry Potter books.

  Harry Potter is annoyed. Being entered into a Tournament he never wanted to join being shunned by the entire student body and the nightmares getting worse Harry has enough to deal with. But when a book containing information about the future is given to Dumbledore and he has to read it to the Great Hall things just got a whole lot more complicated. HPxDG Weasley Bashing.
