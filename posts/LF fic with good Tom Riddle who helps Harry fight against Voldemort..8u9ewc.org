I read this fic a long time ago, but I can't remember any details about it besides the ending. It ends with Riddle having trapped Volde's soul in an alchemical contraption, where he could interact with it occasionally by letting it possess the body of a small jellyfish. It would let Riddle interact with the soul for a few minutes until Volde's magic killed the jellyfish and he returned to the prison. I thought it might have been A Riddled Universe because I read it at around the same time but it wasn't unfortunately.


** I could be wrong but sounds like linkffn(3401052)

*** Sounds like it, but I don't remember any jellyfish in Black Comedy, only the rest, Riddle helping Harry by making a prison under the sea (if I'm not mistaken, it was in the same cavern that Voldy hid the locket) or something liike that.
