So much Ron bashing on this site and I'm sick of it. Even when Ron is positive he is pushed to the sidelines. I want a fic that while still has Harry as main protagonist, has Ron as an actual important person in his life. Will 10000% take them as a pairing but also just best friends work. Doesn't have to have it, but I acually wouldn't mind having some Hermione bashing, as that would be a breath of fresh air


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]: Ron and George are the most resolute followers of the emerging new Dark Lord Harry Potter. They contribute a lot too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]]: With Hermione missing, Ron and Luna are the two people holding Harry together.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]: Harry was not nice to Ron initially, often using him as bait and dissing him in his thoughts. But Ron met all his challenges and eventually earned this Harry's respect.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]]: Not is only Ron Harry's dependable Auror buddy, but he greatly helps saving Harry and Hermione's relationship.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  In which Harry's being an orphan has an unexpected side-effect, and Ron helps him out---learning a lesson in gratitude along the way. (Harry-Ron friendship fic, because Ron doesn't get enough credit and Harry needs a hug.)
