I don't understand why people won't read slash or romance or gen or avoid a particular pairing. Specially the last one.

I do understand everyone have different tastes but how can a pairing determine if you will like the fic? I have read horrible fics of pairings I'm fond of and marvelous ones of pairings I didn't knew I liked.

I'm sometimes in the mood for something with zero romance and sometimes I want to read a good romance and there is trash and master pieces of everything so why would I limit myself?

In the case of delicate matters as age difference and the like I do understand some people wanting to avoid them but even then you can't say they are all bad and I don't really see the point in restricting my reading material.

What I'm trying to say is that my personal morals, life view, favourite character or whatever does not affect at all my enjoyment of any particular reading.


** I think that's a weird question. why should we read something we don't like only because it's well written? let's say you like fantasy and don't like sci-fi. you would read fantasy books. you aren't going to read the sci-fi ones even knowing they are good and generally liked.

that's the same as asking why people won't read lemons. maybe some people just don't like lemons. or like horror movies.

I've read some of the parings I don't enjoy and although I did like the fics, I wouldn't go looking for that pairing in particular. I don't think I will ever read Tommary, even if million people would recommend it.

and with the HP fanfics being so plenty, it isn't hard to find something that is well written AND something you would like to read.

I'm not actually that put off by bad writing if the story is good enough. although with bad writing, there's usually a bad story too.

**** I mean there are a number of wonderful pieces of fiction in literature that are well written that many people who love reading just are not into. I know 1984 is well regarded and well written but most people I know who read it were forced to. Why read Harry Potter when there is Crime and Punishment or The Grapes of Wrath or Frankenstein? Well, because well written isn't close to the first thing people seek.

** Sometimes I'll come across a story that is objectively well written - the structure is sound, the language flows, there's proper escalation of tension, etc - but I just don't enjoy it. Eg I gave up on Divided and Entwined about halfway through /because/ it was doing an excellent job of depicting how War is Hell. Starfox wasn't getting it wrong, it just wasn't what I like.

Similarly I wasn't seeing writing problems with A Cadmean Victory, it's just that I didn't like Harry being cold and cruel to his former friends.

No matter how expertly a flavour is recreated, some people just won't like that flavour.

Or am I missing the point and the flavour you can't stand is cruelty? Crude stories can be very off-putting but you think there is no possible way that you can read about something cruel no matter the writing style?

** Question just seems odd. Well written does not mean interesting. There are millions of well-written fics out there, and there is no way to read them all or even want to (i.e. expect to like them). Sturgeons law applies to well-written fic just like it applies to everything else. Once there is enough of something, you have to be choosy.

** There are two main ways people read.

Some people read as an observer to the story. They maintain their outside perspective and they hover over the action like a ghost, viewing the story events and characters as an objective third party.

Other people read as if they are a particular character in the story. They view that character's actions as their own actions - the character is their avatar, like playing a video game. They don't view themselves as a reader, but rather a part of the story.

For the latter type of reader, the reading experience is ruined where they lose their ability to identify with the protagonist. All sorts of things can break this identification, and the specific list is personal.

Importantly, identification isn't about accurately reflecting the reader's own traits. It can just as often be about allowing the reader to explore traits they wish they had, or find interesting to imagine having.

Still, there are some fairly common items which will break identification. The protagonist making decisions that the reader considers stupid is one. The protagonist acting in a way the reader considers immoral is another.

But an almost universal identification-breaking act is where the protagonist engages in romantic or sexual acts the reader does not wish to engage in themselves. It feels like you yourself are engaging in those acts, and if they are acts which run contrary to your preferences this can result in a visceral dislike of what you are reading. For me, reading slash produces the exact same sensation as if a man was kissing me in real life.

I am this type of reader, with one caveat: the only character I ever identify with in HP fic is Harry. Which is why I only really read Harry-centric fics, because the other type of "detached, observer reader" experience feels like a substantially lesser experience than being in the story yourself. So yes, when reading Harry-centric fics, I dislike reading slash for exactly the same reason why I would dislike reading Harry/Molly: I personally do not find Molly attractive.

*** That's the best explanation I have ever read. I had a huge crush on Hermione in the films and couldn't wait to see Harry and Hermione to become a couple, since I imagined myself as Harry-who unfortunately lacked my enthusiasm to learn and read about new things(come on, it is magic)- and I remember scolding Harry for goofing off with Ron and acting like a git in the PoA and GoF to Hermione. While I was reading the sixth book, I was just crying to myself. That is the best thing of both Reddit and FanFiction.Net: I can finally see and read about what could have been written different and divulge into scenarios the fanfiction authors from the imaginations of these amazing people and I can see the books ending with Harmony with some plot twist that I would have given anything to see in the canon.

Furthermore, if the pairing is one I can't stand(like Ginny), it will take a story that's beyond amazing for me to want to read it, and even then it's something I usually dislike.

You can write about a character called Harrold Baratheon, the son of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister, who grew up in Westeros, has no knowledge or memory of the Harry Potter universe, and has completely different character traits to Harry Potter, and I will identify with him completely and utterly from the first word if the story summary tells me that this is a version of Harry Potter.

Conversely, you can write 100,000 beautifully crafted words about Neville Longbottom and I still won't really care about what happens to him. All I'll be doing while reading the story is thinking "I wonder what Harry's doing?"

And secondly, no, because the character being Harry is just the start of the process. A protagonist being Harry is /necessary/ for me to read a fic, but it isn't /sufficient/. The fic still has to avoid any of the other identification-breaking moments I detailed above like Harry making stupid decisions or being paired with someone I consider unattractive.

I don't care what the story is like I don't like Harry/draco because in my head Draco is almost always going to be essentially a hitler youth and so many stories with Draco doesn't actually have him with an actual redemption arc.

Harry/Voldemort or Harry/snape is wrong to me because voldemort is responsible for so many deaths including Harry's parents and the age difference is way to much for a school kid and snape, disregarding all other factors in a story, is a teacher and, once again that just seems wrong.

Daphne for political Harry/gray/Indy harry(last one especially I typically hate the writing of)

Hermione for a super smart Harry/Hermione that do no wrong and are more capable than everyone else in the world.

** I view pairing as an important part of a story. As it stands, it has the same importance than, say, "Dark!Harry" characterisation.

So then, it stands to reason that some people will accept different things. For exemple, I tend to put Slash in the same category as "Indy!Harry", which is "better avoid it because I'm not gonna enjoy reading that". Romance in general is in this category, through Slash is just a tiny bit less enjoyable.

Some fics may be a masterpiece for a specific category - "the best slash fic in the world", "the best indy!harry", "the best Dramione in the universe" - but I won't enjoy it, because it's not a category I like. It's not something I can like.

** Well, a story might be well-written, but have a theme or plot that disgusts me. Like "the purebloods did nothing wrong, Voldemort was just too extreme" or "slavery is ok as long as it's elves" stories. Daphne appearing as a main character is often a sign that the story will follow this pattern - worse if Daphne is portrayed as "neutral" in a war between a genocidal wizard Nazi and the brave people who oppose him.

Then there are plots I'm not interested in. Any plot where Harry is the central character, outshining everyone, especially when Ron and Hermione are at best sidekicks, not equally important characters who can hold their own compared to him, I'm not interested in no matter how well written it might be. Worse, of course, if the trio's replaced by "better friends for Harry" - the friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione is the main draw for me, and replacing them with others doesn't appeal to me at all.

With regards to limiting myself - I don't have unlimited time. Most of the time I spend on fanfiction is spent on writing, not reading, so when I read, I don't bother with stories that have a plot or setup that doesn't interest me.

** I think the first question should be "What is a well written fic?". There are people who only care of the form of a story (orthographe, grammar, pacing . . .), while other mainly care about its content (what happen inside the story). There are also people who need both the form and the content to enjoy a story.

Let's take the example of a pretty well known fanfic author, RobSt. It's been a long time since I have read one of his fic, yet I would call them "well written". I can't remember spotting any obvious mistake, the pacing is alright and the story even stay coherent. You could probably call his fics "well written".\\
And yet, I hate his fics. I hate how his story are full of tropes (though to be fair, he probably invented, or at least democratized some of them), I hate his version of Harry (who, in my opinion, is an asshole most of the time), and I hate the "Perfect Harmony" he puts in every one of his fics.

Does the fact that I dislike his stories make them bad? Probably not since a lot of people love them and they are among the most popular ones. Should I force myself to read a story because people said it was good? I mean, some people love Snarry, and it's their choice, but I don't see why I should force myself to read what I abhor (and consider pedophilia) just because some people enjoyed it. At the same time, I'm sometimes readiing some terribly written story, just because I loved one idea the author got, but it doesn't mean I should force people to do the same.

Reading fanfics is a hobby. What people read is a matter of preference and they should not have to justify their choice.

*** I am merely curious not against whatever reading preferences the fandom has. To each their own. Sorry if the post came out hostile it was not the intention.

The reason I was curious is that I do not separate form from content, for me they are too dependant on each other to actually believe they exist separately.

You can't exactly write an action plot the same as a romance, just the amount of verbs necessary change the form and that's just a gross example.

What ones consider well written is completely subjective but it depends a great deal on writing styles. Writing style does change a lot depending on the subject matter (content) but it would have never occurred to me that something as specific as a character love interest (regardless if it's a romance) could be considered important enough to change the writing style, I consider genders (as far as they exist) to have big enough differences to change the writing style ( call it form for practicality)

So the way I saw it: obviously you have something you like and consider good, why not read more of that just because what I considered things too small to change the actual style I like (this includes both form and content)

What I did not understand about fandom and that this very useful (if downvoted) post has bring to my attention is that in fandom pairings and the like are actually very close to be gender.

I assume it's because trends are too strong that most of Harry/Hermione are Mary Sue Hermione Or most Harry/Daphne are heavy in politics.
