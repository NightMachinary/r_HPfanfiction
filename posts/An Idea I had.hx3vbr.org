So, I have to get this idea out of my head. I don't know if this is exactly what this reddit is used for, but I think it at least fits. I have this idea for a fanfic. Basically, this a trauma harry story that diverges at when harry goes to the graveyard at the end of year four. Voldemort plays around with him, using Curcio much more liberally.

Then in the care of Barty Crouch, he tortures him some more and then Barty Crouch Jr. escapes capture. However, Fudge does understand and believes harry which means this is where the second wizarding war starts (this means no Umbridge stuff). Voldemort will no longer have the entire year that fudge gave him, and they immediately launch into offensive operations to overthrow the ministry and Dumbledore.

The Azkaban breakout happens during the summer when harry is at the Dursleys. They don't treat him any differently than in canon, but the psychological damage will take its toll on Harry and he has no one to talk to, he tries Petunia, but she doesn't lend him an ear.

Harry will basically barely be able to sleep; his sleeps will consist of nightmares that keep him awake. He gets dementors, Barty Crouch, Voldemort, and the Basilisk. This leads to him pretty much not eating and going into a shell. He lashes out much like he does in the order of the phoenix.

Hermione and Ron make no headway into trying help him, Ginny does a little, but he doesn't open up to her nearly enough. He goes back to school and with the aid of several different types of potions he starts to be tamer and sleep more, but the potions slowly lose their affect and he goes crazy. He starts hallucinating, more not sleeping, and constantly practicing to be a better duelist. During the middle of the night, he breaks out a lot and goes on joy rides with his broomstick, doing some incredibly reckless stunts.

Stuck in his head, everyone tries their best to support Harry, but Hermione lets it slip that Ginny has a crush on Harry. In his terribly broken mind, Harry sees this as an opportunity to feel something other than anxiety, fear, loss and fatigue. Harry pretty much uses Ginny for a little bit before he casts her aside.

This made him lose pretty much most of the people who were trying to support him, citing that he is basically a lost cause and has lost his mind. This is when Voldemort attacks the school, and everything spirals even further downhill. Upon seeing people die, to protect him, Harry takes a couple of things and runs away. The assault on the school gives Voldemort the chance to steal Gryffindor's sword, which makes it so that he has the founder's set of horcrux's (he doesn't turn nagini into one).

This is all of the idea I have; I think it would be an interesting fic that dives deep into Harry's psyche, having witnessed so many traumatic events happen. I have no intent to write this. If anyone wants to take some things, I said here feel free. I honestly just needed to get these ideas out of my head.


** Sounds, cool. Quick tip though, it seems to be more along the lines of a prompt rather than a discussion.

**** No prob. Some times the bot finds out and sends mensagens though, never saw a case in which it actually did delete a post for using the wrong flair, but could happen.
