Hate to be the one mentioning these kinds of things ^{^{again,}} but...

There recently was a whole power-scandal in [[/r/HarryPotter]] and its associated subs, with [[/u/CatholicGuy]] and [[/u/kemistreekat]] right in the middle of it. [[/u/CatholicGuy]] is no longer a moderator of the [[/r/harrypotter]] community, but [[/u/kemistreekat]] is still a Head Emeritus.

I won't get into specifics, but this is my question: *Does the fiasco on [[/r/harrypotter]] affect us on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] at all?*

--------------

For some history:

[[/u/kemistreekat]] was [[https://redd.it/3i96gk][originally appointed]] by [[/u/CatholicGuy]] before he [[https://redd.it/3le43q][resigned]] from the post of Headmaster on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] giving independence.

[[/u/kemistreekat]] is still a mod and [[https://redd.it/3ied18][will continue]] to be a mod, which I have no problems with, as she brings good moderator experience and has helped out around the sub already.

Thanks ^{^{^{^{and}}}} ^{^{^{^{please}}}} ^{^{^{^{don't}}}} ^{^{^{^{hate}}}}

***** I actually only minded how unapologetic he was about revealing the private subs "but I had to do it so people knew the truth!!" Uh no, you could have been an adult and messaged the mods in private and kept us all put of it

*** Thanks for the clarification. I didn't want any backlash from [[/r/harrypotter]] to come to [[/r/HPfanfiction]] especially since we were separated before the scandal even happened.

** From now on, if we are to mention this stuff again, can we call it something like "Mod-Gate" or something? I don't know, just something creative with -gate added on at the end? Just make it /really/ cliche.
