** I just saw this recommended on another post, and it's pretty similar to your prompt (though Tom is still arguably sociopathic, Dumbledore definitely helps him and sees his actions as signs of vulnerability): Last Lord of the Sun by Lomonaaeren linkao3(11486688)

It's short, but had a really cool description of this thing called a Shadow Grimoire in Chapter 2 which was really unique and interesting.

  When Albus Dumbledore visits Wool's Orphanage and sees the terror and rage in Tom Riddle, he decides he cannot leave the boy without a mentor. On the one hand, he may never make a Light wizard of him; on the other hand, he will keep him from going down the path of the Dark.

  After the wizarding world learns of a prophesy that appears to indicate Tom Riddle will vanquish the Dark Lord, everyone expects him to defeat Grindelwald. Once it becomes apparent the prophesy doesn't involve Grindelwald, however, the question arises as to who exactly is the Dark Lord referenced. A slow-build tale told in 3 parts. No smut.

Because he knew Harry cannot die by Riddle's hand, So he plan harry to sacrifice himself to Riddle willingly so achieve two things:

1. Harry will live(obviously)

2. a "second blood protection" on Harry's allies, making it so that spells Voldemort tried to place on them quickly wore off, minimize the casualty.(most likely)

#+begin_quote
  "You won't be killing anyone else tonight," said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. "You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people"

  "But you did not!"

  "I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?"

Go reread the book, and between the lines, the hints are all there.

Besides being manipulative is not inherently bad, it was only the intention that matters.

** I think this is a really interesting prompt, especially considering that JKR has said before that because Tom was conceived under the use of a amortenia that Merope Gaunt used on Tom Riddle sr. that Tom wouldnt be able to feel love. I don't particularly agree with this, considering that this would essentially make a large proportion (I'm assuming here) of the wizarding population psychopaths. I like the idea that Tom simply acted the way he did because of his childhood, and so was the product essentially of nurture over nature, as I think it is such a cruel thought to have a child born into the world with a set path of never understanding or feeling love.

It would have been way better for Tom, had he been adopted and raised by a loving muggle family.

On the other hand we're also supposed to pretend Tom Riddle (the muggle one) was the bad guy for leaving her. So it's not really surprising. The poor guys worst crime was literally being slightly snobby. He deserved better.

She should have let the whole thing be one of Dumbledore's assumptions and be done with it. That would have given fans more wiggle room to toy with the idea and they could have gone either by Voldemort's version or by Dumbledore's.

As for Merope... we know very little about her. When Harry encounters or hears about her she's at some of the lowest points in her life. It's up for interpretation whether she would have been a good mother (even for the sake of her former lover and to oppose her dad's practices) or an abusive one like Marvolo.

Also Harry was raised by a not so loving Muggle family and he turned out alright.

In what way does that indicate a particular affinity for raising a child?
