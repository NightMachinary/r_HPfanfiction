Hey guys,

I think [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] just died for a sec.\\
Lemme explain

So, I was here reading Deathly Hollowed and went to the next chapter when the screen says "Web server is down". I know it's not from my side, it says its from the host.

Anyone else see the same thing? And does anyone have any idea why it happened?


** Website must have crashed I have the same issue.
