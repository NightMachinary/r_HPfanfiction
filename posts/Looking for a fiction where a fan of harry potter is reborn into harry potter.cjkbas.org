Either as Harry himself or as another person. Ideally not a babysitter for the golden trio.

Thanks


** I'm writing my own story of that type linkffn(Harry Potter: Self-Insert by 15Redstones) but it's probably not very good, I'd be glad if you could review it and help improve it though.

*** It's a decent fic, nothing that makes me want to close the tab and purge my internet history. There's a noticeable difference in tone from J K Rowling which seems to be effortlessly British children's lit, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Each chapter is quite short though, and everything seems to go so well for him. You've eschewed all sorts of dialogue scaffolding such as "Harry said" etc, which makes conversations, what few there are, unnecessarily harder to follow.

You've chosen some very tropey fanon aspects to the story, such as wandless magic, starting your magical education early, etc. Again, not bad, but not every readers' cup of tea. The summary seems to hint you're going to turn this into a muggle wank of some sort, I just hope you'll do it decently. The SI seems to be constantly doing suspicious things like request a Holly and Phoenix feather wand, sending owls to the most paranoid auror in existence hinting at in depth knowledge of Death Eaters, pulling out a bezoar as a first year student, etc without garnering any suspicion or blowback. The animagus form seems to be a cop-out to make the SI seem weak after a bit too much wanking, but that's just my opinion.

A good example of foreknowledge working in a balanced (for narrative excitement) way in a fic is Harry getting Sirius released after the capture of Peter Pettigrew, but this causes people like Malfoy to argue for the release of other Death Eaters, and suddenly Bellatrix Lestrange is released from Azkaban on a technicality. So Harry's gained an important resource and guardian but the other side has also got one of their most dangerous agents walking free too.

  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Dragging the Wizarding World into the 21st century.
