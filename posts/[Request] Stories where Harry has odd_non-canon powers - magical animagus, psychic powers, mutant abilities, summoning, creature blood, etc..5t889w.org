Basically, I'm looking for a Harry (or any main character) has some ability other than the bog-standard magic. If he learns some exotic form of magic - say, /necromancy/ - that's cool too.

I would /prefer/ non-slash and non-crossovers, but I will read them if they're good enough. I don't mind bashing, smut, or anything like that, so fire away.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Would a mega crossover (various DC & Marvel comics, Dresden Files, etc) with Harry being a mutant and also the son of Thor from the Avengers count? Long story short, Thor was sent down as a baby to teach humility. Said baby was James Potter. After LV "kills" him he goes back to Asgard and goes crazy and Odin hides those memories. FF to Harry's third year (The timeline is moved up to mesh better with the MCU movies) and Harry is falling after the Dememtors attack during the Quidditch game. Thor/James remembers and saves Harry. Lots of other stuff happens as well. Some character deaths but no real romance for Harry. Also a reformed Loki takes on the Weasley twins and Hermione as apprentices also.

I enjoyed the hell out of it but you might not.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

*** I've seen that a few times now but i never tried reading it because i've never watched any of the movies or read the comics; will i have trouble understanding whats going on?

I'm familiar with Norse mythology but i doubt that the comics are all that accurate. I've also read Dresden Files but IIRC someone once told me that the Dresden Universe doesn't really play that big of a role.

**** It's about 85-90% Marvel/HP with characters from other fandoms also being there. At least it was up to the point where I lost interest because of the combination of how complex it gets and how long it was between updates.

***** So that's a 'no' then? Just because a lot of content is from the Marvel universe doesn't mean that i won't understand it. What's important to me is how detailed explanations are; does the author just assume that i know certain things or is everything explained?

** linkffn(harry potter air elemental)

Written explicitly as a "Harry has a mutant style power" fic. It's pretty good.

linkffn(for love of magic) linkffn(with strength of steel wings)

Both have Harry dabbling in rune tattoos without really understanding the consequences and lucking into some pretty good power boosts.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
