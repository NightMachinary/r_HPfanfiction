Just a tiny thing i've been wondering about that google has failed to tell me is when did Hermione get her dress and where did she order it from? Harry and Ron get their dress robes from Mrs Weasley when she reads about them needing them on their school list...did she also get Hermione a dress due to it saying Hermione would need one that year?

... Or did Hermione not get a dress until closer to the ball was happening and did she get in hogsmeade or order it from elsewhere? this is just a tiny thing that jumped into my head and I couldn't seem to find out when/where Hermione got her dress, thanks in advance anyone who has any information on it!


** She most likely bought it with her parents before the start of the year, as they would have seen her school list and went shopping with her :)

*** very simple and probably true answer, i guess i discounted her parents due to Hermione being at the weasleys that summer...did the get their school lists much earlier? i cant remember...anyway you're probably correct, its odd the random details that my brain just gets hung up on sometimes hahah

**** I'm pretty sure the lists didn't come until Harry and Hermione were already with the Weasleys.

***** Isn't that the yeat that Mrs.Weasley does everyones shopping (bc they are at the world cup)?

Harry leaves money with her to buy his school supplies, i assume so did Hermione.

***** yes i wasn't sure on this...i was just thinking did Hermione head into Hogsmeade only after viktor asked her to the ball to find a dress or did she get one earlier due to seeing it on her school list....or was she like 'well no one going to ask me to a ball so i wont bother'...i think its just an interesting thing to maybe write into a fic sometime.

***** But that would be way too late for the first years, wouldn't it?

****** First years get an acceptance letter not just a course materials list. I assume they are sent out earlier.
