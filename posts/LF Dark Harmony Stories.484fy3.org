I'm just looking for good Dark Harmony stories. Preferably in the Hogwarts years, not post DH. My subreddit search attempt wasn't very successful.

Edit - The pairing doesn't have to be Harry/Hermione, but Hermione has to stay friends/allies with Harry when he goes dark.


** I know of two off the top of my head, but neither of them are very good.

Birth Of a Dark Lord was written a very long time ago, IMO doesn't age very well, and has quite a bit of bashing. In Too Deep has past mentions of D/Hr. It's probably also one of the most angst-heavy stories I've ever read.

  Hermione is the Dark Lords' most prized death eater. But when he sends her on a mission to befriend Harry Potter, her sworn enemy, things don't go quite as planned. When she took the mission she never anticipated falling in love with her target. HHR

  It's the summer after 5th year and Harry is not a happy camper. With his godfather dead, Harry has nobody left to turn to. Except one. One who has been with him since the beginning...
