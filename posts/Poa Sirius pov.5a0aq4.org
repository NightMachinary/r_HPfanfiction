As Title says, im looking for a fanfic that tells poa from Sirius pov. I havent found it on ffn, but im not good at searching, as im rather new to this fanfiction stuff. Thank You in advance


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/940338][Padfoots Tale]] is this and it's really good. It's part of a series where PoA is told from Remus's POV too and then a fic about the summer after. It's slash but still completely canon compliant IIRC. Linkao3(940338)

  1981-94: From the unbearable torments of Azkaban to a life on the run, Sirius has known little peace in twelve years. But when he comes to Hogwarts looking for Harry and Peter, he finds Remus, the man who could break his heart or save his life. A retelling of Prisoner of Azkaban from Sirius's point of view. Heavy in Marauders-era and First Wizarding War flashbacks.Warning: This story has not been edited yet, and may contain unintended problematic elements and tropes.

**** Most of the slash is in flash back IIRC. Maaaybe you could skip those sections, but I say give the slash a try. Wolfstar stuff is usually the most palatable slash for people who aren't slash lovers because it can still be canon compliant like this one.
