In cannon, before first year, Hagrid takes Harry from the hut in the ocean using the only boat there, thus stranding the Dursley's with little in the way of supplies; by the time period (1991) it is actually quite likely that either none of them had cellphones (home-bound phones were a lot more common at the time and in no moment of the entire series we see any mention of them having pessoal cellphones), right after a storm (so quite possible that the location and time caused somewhat frequent storms around there), the Dursley's somehow managed to survive and get back home... but what if they didn't?

The way I see it Harry would get back home by train and notice they weren't there, he knew they were stranded in a rock in the ocean, but didn't really get worried about it, both too excited about Hogwarts and not caring enough about them. Depending on how you want to shape this Harry he could get caught up on studying ahead or enjoying unfiltered access to the TV and Dudley's video games/toys without them there. Eventually Harry would notice that his relatives weren't around and get a little worried (he may not like them, but he is not heartless), eventually I see him rationalizing to himself that they went on a holiday without him and (not knowing a possible location) he is unable to check.

With September first approaching he starts getting worried about getting to Hogwarts, at this point he would remember that owls beyond awesome pets also make damn impressive mail-carriers and send Hagrid a letter saying that he didn't know if his relatives would be able to take him to London (maybe also asking about the platform? It shouldn't change much, but to each their own I guess), Hagrid then answers telling him about the knight bus, reassured Harry completely forgets to worry about the Dursley's for the rest of the summer.

Harry then gets to Hogwarts and do his normal (or not) first year cannon routine. He doesn't wonders about the lack of contact or the penny the Dursley's sent him in cannon because he really wasn't expecting it in first place. So the year ends and he goes back to London.

With the Dursley's nowhere to be found he waits some time before deducting that they left him to make his own way ‚Äúhome‚Äù and (with a very put upon sigh) calls the knight bus. When he arrives at Number 4 he sees the house deserted and, baffled asks around (preferentially to someone he doesn't know personally -maybe to not incur their Dursley's stories induced distaste or to make sure this don't get back to the Dursley's, or even he just asks a bored house-seller that is waiting for the next potential client). The person then tells him that the Dursley's were found drowned/starved to death/dehydrated on a hut on the ocean, the investigation having come to the conclusion that their boat floated away during the storm, stranding them there, the little boy (Harry) with them must have panicked and tried to swim away, since he was never found he was presumed dead.

It is looking at the empty house and remembering the boat he and Hagrid took back to London that the shoe drops for little Harry, the Dursley's are dead.

While I don't think cannon Harry would start to dance on the spot out of pure joy these could be taken anyway from here, from Harry finding new guardians or trying to live by himself, to him feeling guilty or vindicated, doesn't even need to be a major point in a story.


** I'd read this in a heartbeat! Can someone please write a fanfiction of this? But no really, it's quite an interesting view point. I'm just wondering what would happen next. Would Harry be asked to speak to an auror? And if so, is he going to tell them that Hagrid not only used magic but left with the only boat? Because basically, it's Hagrid's fault, not Harry's. Harry is just an eleven year old boy. Is Hagrid going to be punished for using magic and "killing" the muggles?

1) It is a muggle family who died. Who cares? 2) Dumbledore is the one who is arranging things - if anyone asks he can say that with Harry rejoining the wizarding community he no longer needs to stay with his aunt. 3) Almost everyone in the wizarding society will feel better with their hero living with magicals rather than muggles.

** If you wanted to make this a comedy, Hagrid could be the one to deal with ALL of the problems through the years.

Quirrelmort - maybe Hagrid comes to feed Fluffy just as Quirrel is going for the trapdoor. Hagrid yells to the Fluffy that it is dinner time as he backs in dragging some load of meat so he never sees Quirrel. Fluffy wakes, sees Quirrel, chomps down on him since he is reflexively hungry at Hagrid's call.

Basilisk - Hagrid comes into the castle to show Harry his prize rooster, maybe it has blue feet or something. At that time the basilisk is in the walls looking for its next victim. The rooster crows when Harry gets near to look, the basilisk dies in the wall - Finch's cat is the only victim. No other problems, no arrests, no challenge to Dumbledore's position.

Sirius - Hagrid catches Sirius in Grim form in the forest, decided to make him one of his special pets. Sirius now has shelter/warmth/food/caretaker. One day the Trio come in, Ron with Scabbers. The grim pounces on the rat. Just before he is killed the rat transforms back into Peter to avoid getting his head torn off by the grim. Everyone is shocked, but Hagrid recognized Peter. Arrest, interogation, Sirius is now known to be innocent. Maybe Sirius comes to the Ministry later for his pardon.

*** Eh, could boil down to many factors, first she may not have kept such a close eye on Harry. Many stories (even more so Dumbledore Bashing) put her as spying constantly on Harry and the Dursley's somehow while keeping detailed reports down to what they had for lunch and the color of their piss, these reports than would go to Dumbledore who would skim it to make sure nothing too big was happening and then ignore it. What if instead she was actually really only keeping tabs on Harry, the Dursley's would call her to take care of him sometimes and she would see him around time a couple of times and ask about if he is feeling well, than she tells it to Dumbledore later during casual conversations (really casual, she was in the order, they must be on friendly terms). She wouldn't notice if the Dursley's weren't around for some weeks if they didn't frequent the same social cycles, she has her own life to care about after all, seeing Harry walking around once or twice without any sign of distress would prevent her from worrying or even thinking there was any problem at all, then maybe she took a vacation of sorts now that her charge (even if casual) is in Hogwarts, if she had only arrived when Harry gets to the town she would be too busy re-organizing her house/life and catching up with friends to worry about not seeing the Dursley's for a couple of days.

Other ways would be to go with the easy way of just killing/sending her away offscreen and be done with it. Hell, even just sidestepping the whole issue by having her never having been sent there or being a muggle wouldn't be too hard, in the end her use as a character was mostly to make Dumbledore seem prepared (which backfired making him seem either incompetent or malicious) and later to help Harry carry Dudley home (which is now a no-issue).

She already knew how he was treated (and treated him as good as she can get away with without causing the Dursleys to forbid him going there because he liked it there), and Dumbledore did nothing about it. What's this report going to do? He's probably ignoring them all.

*** I feel like, as OP said, it's entirely plausible for story purposes that she didn't watch closely enough to know that the Dursley's had disappeared. As for anyone else reporting the Dursley's going missing, we don't know how much time Vernon had taken off work, or how he paid for the hut on the rock. It's also entirely plausible that the authorities didn't discover the Dursley's and who they were for the duration of August. The basic premise stands.

That being said, it is likely that their deaths would be found out by Dumbledore through Figg or some other channel before Harry was sent back at the end of the year.

It is implied by Dumbledore that he made something with the blood protections that created the wards, so maybe the actual protections on Harry himself will just start to degrade slowly, or even be kept to the very end. Though I also would prefer that he found another way of either keeping Quirrel in the room until Dumbledore arrives (supposedly not too much time after he killed Quirrel, so a obtainable goal) or outright defeating him (he thought he was going after Snape, so he has the perfect excuse to brush up on some nasty hexes), or even go a somewhat not so overdone route of stealing the stone himself by accident first and then giving it back to Flamel).

**** I figure that without having to power the wards on the Dursley's house, the protection that Lily put on Harry suddenly gets more powerful.

The protection was at its weakest on 1st november 1981 after saving Harry's life. It didn't have enough power after reflecting a killing curse and vaporizing Voldemort to completely protect Harry from the soul shard, thus letting the leach latch onto Harry.

It would have ramped up to full power after a couple weeks and blasted that soul piece out of Harry's head, except that Dumbledore created the blood wards. And it had to work to protect not just Harry but the whole household, wasting all its power so it couldn't free Harry from the soul piece and its negative affects, like making Harry dumb, blind, and very passive.

A bit after Harry leaves for Hogwarts and the blood wards fall, the protection has a few weeks to charge up, and then it begins fixing things that had been hanging for 10 years.

Earthquakes, hurricanes, being on a boat during a storm...) if the authorities had ruled that Harry tried to get back to the port by swimming during a storm chances are that it would fall in this category and he would be declared dead soon after.
