**** Well, in that case, Hermione would have a laser-like focus on vital necessities, and wouldn't even be in the book section of the store.

On the one hand, it would be odd for Hermione to not look at books.

On the other hand, she might reasonably expect the average book not sold in a dedicated book store to be something that wouldn't hold her interest. A witch of her academic calibre can't be bothered to pick up just any random book, and especially not any random muggle book.

***** I dunno I mean what if she's looking for something to distract herself/Harry/Ron from the negative feelings of the locket or even just the despair that they had to be feeling alone, on the run, not having much information, terrified they'll be caught, with no idea what to do. So yeah I'd say it's possible that could be a reasoning on why she looked.

** Even better, in linkffn(3867175) Hermione contracts unknown Muggle writer J. K. Rowling to publish their memoirs to get money for the seventh year last campaign against Voldemort. I am not completely excited about the story though, it is pretty heavy Harmony bashing everything around (including JKR).
