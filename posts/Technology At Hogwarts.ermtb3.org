(Only English) Are there any fanfiction where Harry or FemaleHarry develops ways for technology to work at Hogwarts I will even read OFC Main Character stories. PLEASE No HarryHermione Pairing!!!

Crossovers are fine too but I've already read most of the ones where Harry is Tony Stark's Son/Daughter.
