"Huna" is pretty awful, and "Larry" is even worse. Are there any other portmanteaus I'm overlooking?

** These are all horrible since I just created them (unless they were in use before)

- Lunarry
- Harruna
- Luny

If you don't want portmanteaus, here are a few ideas:

- Scarred Moon
- Loony Lion
- Chosen Conspiracy
- Quippy Quibbler
- Crackpot

As I said before, I'm horrible at this. I think "Crackpot" is pretty good though.

*** Pretty sure that Luna/Harry is Lunar though. That said, the ship is rarely given a name and the most common context I've seen the ship name used is in Lunar Harmony, Luna/Hermione/Harry, which has some rather well-known fics. I have seen it a few times without the context of Harmony but it's really rare.
