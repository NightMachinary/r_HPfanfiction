There's a Tumblr post where someone said the Marauders would exploit a loophole in the rule by levitating their beds through the corridors at night until they got into a debate with McGonagall about it, and I was wondering if there's any fics/oneshots expanding on that concept.


** I'm going to need a link to that tumblr post
