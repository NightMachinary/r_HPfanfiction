So I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]], and I'd love to read more fics where multiple people time travel or get dropped into an alternate universe, but they don't necessarily go there together on purpose, but end up finding each other when they're there. I've got no preference on the who, or ships, fem/slash/het/gen, whatever goes, any characters.


** Oh man I got the perfect fic since you mentioned I'm Still Here. You'll want linkao3(From Ruin) by GraeFox. I'd have linked FFN since I sort of hate ao3 but there's some backstory involving author impersonation with the story on ffn. Anyway, it's in much the same vein as I'm Still Here, as you'll be able to see in the author notes. Best of all it isn't semi-abandoned the day ISH is

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  What happened to the Other Hermione that Harry encountered in "Shadow Walks"? As she struggles to survive, despite immense loss, in a world that no longer has a place for her, how will the reappearance of someone she'd thought she'd never see again change her life completely? Reading "Shadow Walks" first is advised. Companion piece; alternate universe.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

*** Commenting to second this - it's one of my all time favourites. The author is actually called smallesttabbycat :-)

Also an amazing portrayal of a realistic redemption of Regulus Black - he doesn't immediately decide he's a good guy and reject everything he's grown up with, there's a steep learning curve and you get to see it.

It's a Sirius/Hermione pairing, but Sirius from when he goes through the veil and Hermione from a couple of years after the war, having time travelled separately.

Yeah, Regulus is amazing in this, so complex and real. I feel like I finally understand him.
