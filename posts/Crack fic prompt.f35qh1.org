I just thought of it and it'll probably be the most ridiculous fic. It's derivative and probably boring to others, but damn if I'm not giggling over it like it's the best thing ever.

Harry goes back in time to save Cedric, but Cedric still dies, just in a different way. So he does it again. And again. And again. And again.

It starts out grim and dark and sad, but before you know it Cedric, having narrowly survived the graveyard, the portkey back, landing after the portkey back, and Barty Crouch Junior and the dementor squad, is tripping in the hospital wing and lands on his wand jammed into his femoral.

I'm still giggling, this is a great idea, I'm gonna make it happen.


** I'm picturing a sequence where Harry has finally had enough, snaps, and tries to kill Cedric himself, only to fail miserably.

*** He tries to kill Cedric, fails horribly, only for Cedric to die in yet another implausible manner

** You could add that death is set in stone. You can delay it, even for a time, but when someone is meant to die, they'll die.

** Hmm...have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548][The Boy Who Died A Lot]]? It's actually pretty straight-faced drama, except for all the ridiculous ways that Harry gets killed.
