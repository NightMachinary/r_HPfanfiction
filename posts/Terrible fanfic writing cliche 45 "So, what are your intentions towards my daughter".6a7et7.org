Just for once I'd like to see a protagonist giving the honest reply: "Well Sir, since I'm 16, I intend to have long, uninterrupted, snogging sessions with your daughter, which at some point might escalate into heavy petting and then at some point - if she is agreeable - we will engage in sexual intercourse, probably multiple times in a row. Since she is my first serious girlfriend I'm certainly not ready for marriage or anything excessively serious, that would be really weird, not to mention stupid and quite presumptuous of me."

I know, I know, it's a cultural thing, but I really don't get it. As a father I'd rather be worried about the "tip-my-hat to M'lady"-nice-guys who immediately presume to marry her later. Are all of these Arthurs, Dr. Grangers or Lord Greengrasses fathers socially-handicapped and don't understand what's involved in teenage dating? Or is it some kind of test about how accomplished the potential suitor is at lying his ass-off? Or is it just some archaic bullshit... fathers who see their daughters as something that is theirs to give away - affording their daughters almost zero agency? The implications that authors present this as laudable taking-care-of-their-daughters behaviour totally weirds me out:

If they're truly worried isn't it a better idea to make the boyfriend behave as naturally as possible around them, so that they can notice if something is wrong with him, instead of scaring the crap out of him? Seems like the protective father tactics are rather useless if they demand a facade from the outset and put suitors on their guard at all times. It seems like - literally - the stupidest thing you could do if you want to sniff out potential rapists. "Oh sweetheart, you want us to have dinner with your parents /again/ on Friday? Sur... ehm, actually, no, I have a very important... I always polish my wand... I have to take my owl for a walk on Friday! Bye!" - [[http://i.imgur.com/MfwpODV.png][conglaturations]]: He's now avoiding you like the plague! [[http://i.imgur.com/YdPVHMp.jpg][Good job, dad!]]

PS: Yeah, yeah, I made #45 up, I'm not actually keeping a list!

"Sir I have known her for 2 years and i care very much for her. I plan to take her to the dance, get some dinner, and have her back here by midnight after an evening that she can hopefully cherish."

No lies no underlying agenda, other than showing her how much i loved her. I wanted her to have a great night and have fun. I didn't and mostly still dont care about the sexual side of dating. My parents raised me old school with at least a little chivalry, to date to find love not for gratification. So when he pulled out the "what are your intentions" line i had no fear in telling him straight out.

** This is one trope that always bemuses me because I only see it in fanfic and American media. I'm unsure, as a non-American, whether it's just an affectionate stereotype or cultural touchstone, or whether it's actually true-to-life with how courtships and relationships between fathers, daughters, and boyfriends actually go down in the US.

Certainly the father-who-is-threatening-to-daughter's-boyfriend character making in appearance is something that immediately marks a fic out to me as written by an American author.

The idea of a father in the 2010s (or even the 90s, when a lot of works are set) feeling the need - or that he has the right, or the power - to intervene in his daughter's dating life and legitimately threaten her partners is really alien to me as a non-US reader. Is this acceptable in real life in the US, still?

In southern US we have the shotgun speech, where this basic conversation about respecting boundries, knowing how a teenaged boy thinks, etc, happens while the father's cleaning/holdung/shooting a gun of some kind.

It's so ingrained in the culture that dad's brag about how much they scared the poor boy in question at work the next day.

*** The only way it works is if the author basically does what Rowling did and has Ginny call her brother out on it, thereby highlighting the underlining misogyny while also accurately portraying Ginny's character.

I've actually seen this in a lot of H/G fics that aren't based in a Victorian-style society. The brothers play that role, Harry cowers a bit, Ginny calls them out and acts defiant about doing what she wants with him. It tries to play both sides. Also, Arthur usually winds up being more open to the idea of his teenage daughter being intimate with Harry than Molly, who is all about not being a scarlet woman.

"And then where we would be?" said Tonks, her voice carrying all the signs of a well-rehearsed argument. "We have few enough leads as it is."

"I'm just saying," said Remus, getting agitated, "we can-"

"So Harry," Hermione interrupted, speaking loudly. "What were you doing all alone with Ginny?"

Though about as subtle as a niffler in a Gringotts' vault, Hermione's attempt to steer the conversation was a huge success: both Tonks and Remus stopped mid-sentence and swiveled to face Harry, the glint of curiosity in their eyes.

"Yes, Harry," said Fred, who had apparently been listening. "What exactly were you doing with our sister?"

"Not besmirching her virtue, I hope," said George, coming to rest his hands on the back of Harry's chair. Harry's cheeks tinged pink and he glared daggers at Hermione, who at least had the grace to look vaguely apologetic.

Tonks cackled. Apparently it ran in the Black family. "Getting a special birthday present, Harry?" she asked, grinning widely.

"Now, now," said Remus, his own mirth barely hidden. "I'm sure they were just talking."

"About what?" said Hermione, "the colour of Ginny's underwear?"

"All right," said Harry, trying to calm them, "I think that's-"

"Ginny!" cried Fred, just as she emerged from the stairs. He waved a doughy spoon in the air like a wand. "What've you been doing to poor Harry?"

George laid a protective hand on Harry's shoulder. "Not been besmirching his virtue, have you?"

Remus snorted; Harry had to resist the urge to obliviate everyone, instead sending Ginny a look that he hoped said "help me!"

Ginny smirked. "Only a little," she said, sending Tonks off laughing again. "And he wasn't complaining much." Harry began to feel ganged up on.

"Only a little?" said George, looking shocked. "Don't tell me you left him hanging?"

"How many times have we told you?" added Fred, who was clearly enjoying himself. "Once you Wingardium-"

"-you better leviosa," completed George.

**** Because the dad in question is valuing his daughter's virginity over her own choices of what to do that night. Loss of female virginity was/is legally considered a father's property loss in various cultures because then it would be more difficult to sell his daughter to suitors/bidders because she was 'spoiled goods' (aka possibly carrying another man's child). Thus virginity until marriage and not remarrying after being widowed until a year has passed were ways for men to ensure that the progeny that their property (their wives) produced were indeed theirs.

****** What does threatening or intimidating a date have to do with having a conversation with your actual child about their relationship? Plus, the OP pointed out that deliberately intimidating your kid's SO is a shitty way to determine their intentions anyway.

I don't know where you live, but dads being creepily interested in keeping their daughters virgins until marriage is definitely a thing around here (US). Have you heard of purity rings? [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/daughters4god.wordpress.com/2010/07/02/a-commitment-to-purity/amp/]] Plus, a father walking his daughter down the wedding aisle to her groom is literally a historic symbolic transfer of her-body-as-property from the father to the husband, which is why people nowadays update it to both sets of parents walking their kids down the aisle, to change the symbolism from a female property exchange into two families equally relinquishing their role as their child's primary family unit before the children form a new primary family unit through marriage.

Anyway, OP was talking about Harry getting quizzed by an overprotective father/brothers who are 'protecting' their virginal females backed with an overt threat of violence. That doesn't really have much to do with honest, respectful, gender-neutral, and blunt conversations with your children about the wiseness of their choices and getting a feel for who they're going out with, which is what I think you're referring to.

**** I would say, "because it's rooted on the belief that a girl/woman can't take care of herself and needs a man to come to her rescue." It could also be, "you bespoiled my daughter/sister (a.k.a. property) so now I'm going to hurt/kill you."

*** From what I remember none of them were too hard on Harry for dating Ginny.

But definitely different in fics.

** If it's done for humor like this scene from Bad Boys 2 then I'm good with it: [[https://youtu.be/YMnP_zQmMLw?t=14]] or like that fic "This Means War" when Ginny decides to date Harry and he has to deal with all her brothers with a prank war and whatnot.

** It is mostly (anymore) a practical joke, hazing, it was done to you as a lad so you do it to your daughters suitors. For the lulz

There is worry there about her chastity when they are younger because they remember being that age, and hope that a little bit of fear will make them at least cautious.

My girls are not quite teenagers now, I plan to tell boys not to hurt them not freak them out that I'll kill them if they touch her. But in fiction? it's a trope and a cliche, but tropes exist for a reason.

** I actually have used this before, but in more of an ironic or humorous sense. Hermione's father says it to George in /Lady Archimedes/, but he jokes that as a dentist with a teenage daughter, he's been waiting to say that speech for years, and he's "disappointed" that it doesn't work now because Hermione is way scarier than he is.

Also, Hermione basically does this to Harry regarding Luna and Harry to Neville about Hermione in /The Accidental Animagus/, but I hope I made that come across as brotherly/sisterly teasing rather than a serious threat.

I agree with [[/u/EpsilonDenarius][u/EpsilonDenarius]] that it's more of a real life cliche, but it's still fun to play around with if the characters are genre-savvy about it and don't take it too seriously.

** The only appropriate answer is "I don't know man, do you really want to know?"

I have never heard of anybody asking this irl but for some reason it comes up a lot in american fiction, that and the shovel speech.

** Eh, I don't see it as a problem. A bit overdone, but it's normal for parents to fish for information about their children's relationships. Is this a long term thing and they should consider the possibility of marriage? And more immediately, what time do you expect her home?

As a threat, it's also probably more common among pureblood wizards the way that in the past the aristocracy has cared more about bastards than the lower classes. Especially given all the 'marriage contract' tropes flying around fanfiction, it really seems writers like to portray wizarding society as being very aristocratic and old fashioned.
