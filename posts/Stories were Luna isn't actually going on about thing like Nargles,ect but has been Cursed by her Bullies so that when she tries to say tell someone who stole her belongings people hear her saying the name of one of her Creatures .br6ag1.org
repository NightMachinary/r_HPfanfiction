with Luna herself hearing herself say the Bullies name instead of one of her quibbler creatures.

I am sure I have read a story were something similar to this has happened but have since forgotten it.

*** Dude my exact thought. I was like fuuuuck. We've obviously seen and read much darker on here but I guess cuz it's bullying and bullying has been such a big social issue lately, this one had me thinking "very interesting idea... no fucking way I want to read that right now"

*** Its even Darker than you think since its is an accepted habit of Luna its means that she has been Cursed since her first year.

And none of Her Bullies apart from the person who cursed Luna in her first year even know she is cursed. its a vicious cycle for Luna the more she mentions quibbler creatures the most she is Bullied the more she is Bullied the more she mention quibbler creatures as she tries to tell people who is Bullying her.

Part of the Curse probably also makes it so that she can't tell people that she has been Cursed. so say she goes to one of the teachers to try to tell them that she has been Cursed all the teacher would hear is more stuff about quibbler creatures.

**** I can imagine the person who actually cursed her to have abused her in some way, and cursed her so she couldn't tell anyone.

Doesn't her social isolation begin after her mother dies?

It's not really stated--we don't meet Luna until the fifth book, and while Ginny is amicable with her, they're not exactly friends either. It's possible Luna was odd even before her mother died.

That being said, Harry does notice that Luna is "considerably better-groomed" in the photograph with her mother that rests on her bedside. It's possible that Mrs. Lovegood was more the primary caregiver.

It's not unreasonable to think that Xenophilius and by extension Luna became more defensive of their eccentricities, but there's not much in the way of dialogue that says /She wasn't always like this/ or /She's never been the same since her mother died./

** "Has anyone seen Cho?" said Micheal Corner, frowning. "I want to comfort her over Cedric and Harry."

"Oh yes," said Luna, smiling very gently. "I killed the nargles for bothering me."

"Sod off, Micheal," Ginny said. "Luna, are you alright?"

"Never better!" said Luna. "The nargles have gone where they'll never bother me again."

*** Interesting - something extremely dark has more extreme dark added. The dark sort-of cancels out and the result is oddly feelgood.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

***** Yeah, but it's not from a curse. Luna does that in a lot of stories, and maybe even in canon(been a while since i've read it). That's not what OP was asking for in any way.
