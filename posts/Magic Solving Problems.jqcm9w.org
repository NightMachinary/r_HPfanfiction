I'm just looking for fics where magic just... /solves/. Pollution, global warming, overpopulation, not enough food, even small issues like relationships between characters (but, yknow, hopefully not in a love potion type way)- you name it, I just want a warm, fuzzy fic that solves all the problems to help me get through all the bs we've been going through. Please.


** OK so I know the title seems like I'm ignoring the love potion thing but I promise, it's not. This is a fluffy thing I wrote in a similar mood to what you describe linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/users/gladheonsleeps/pseuds/gladheonsleeps]])

short and cute: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26415190]])

magical muggle solutions: Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6894757]])

slower pace, some interesting magic; I remember this being a soothing read: Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3217646]])

there's another one I'm trying to find but I'll leave these here

*I have no idea where the first link below came from, but that isn't recommended for your request. The link I meant to have for my fic Real Love is a Potion Away is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14263605/chapters/32896794][here]]

  Summary: Harry breaks the copy of Sirius' mirror in 7th year, after the horrific end of the war. He is sent back to 1975 and takes up the mantle of Lord Peverell. He hopes to turn around the tragic Black family story. How? By getting newly widowed Lord Orion Black to fall in love with him. SLASH, Mpreg, Time-Travel, mild Character Bashing.Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter. Everything you recognize is owned by J.K. Rowling, Warner Bros., Bloomsbury and Scholastic.

  After Harry and Ginny part ways, Harry goes off to figure out who he's supposed to be, and ends up on the Western Coast of Ireland. Oliver Wood works out there making racing broomsticks.It's a story of being lost, being found, and a giant magical boulder that seems to give and take precisely what people need.

  The Celtic druids once made a decision that kept magic in abundance in Britannia, but they couldn't account for the technological advances Muggles would make centuries later. Now magic is dying on the isles, and this is not a dark lord that Harry can fight. OR: Harry Potter doesn't save the world this time, but he does get a lot of hugs.

**** pleasure! I didn't find the other one I was looking for but this one has a magical hedge that solves a lot of problems. It does involve a global crisis but magic does provide a solution and it has a happy ending. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13388116/1/]])

  A real prophecy involves Rubeus Hagrid. In Harry's second year, the giant spends his days planting a hedge around Hogwarts. Story takes dark turn every once in a while with "wait... what?" Lots of bashing of Dumbledore, McGonagall, Fudge, and Umbridge. There'll be seven parts.
