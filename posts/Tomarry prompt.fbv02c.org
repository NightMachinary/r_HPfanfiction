I want to see a fanfic where Harry has a major crush on Tom Riddle AKA Voldemort since second year. And it is the highlight of puberty of course he will dream about him but remember that he has vision too. What if while he was dreaming Voldemort is in his dream and thought he was a dream but in reality he is real as it can get.
