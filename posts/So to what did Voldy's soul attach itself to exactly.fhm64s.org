** In my head, Avada Kedavra works by ripping the soul of the victim out of their body violently enough that the body just dies outright.

So Harry and the soul piece get ripped out of his earthly sleeve, but only one of the two remains bound to life by Lily's sacrifice. So Harry can return but the soul piece cannot.

** As I recall, Harry DID die in the forest, but came back. I'm not sure if that was the resurrection stone at work, or directly that there was more than one soul in him, but either way, once he died, the horcrux was broken and when he returned, he returned as just him.

** I always thought that AK /was/ indeed capable of destroying a horcrux and other horcruxes could have been destroyed by it. The reason they weren't is because AK is such a taboo curse, not to mention probably hard to cast. Another reason may be that there's little information about horcruxes and it may simply not have been mentioned in books that Riddle/Dumbledore/Hermione used for information on them. Considering that AK is believed to â€˜damage the soul' I doubt people would cast it without a solid proof of it working. Regarding RB, he died at 18, he might have been a DE, but I doubt he was a battle-hardened one. It's highly possible he had never used AK in his life. Look at Draco, he couldn't kill Dumbledore in the end (though admittedly there's a difference between your Headmaster of six years and a piece of metal).
