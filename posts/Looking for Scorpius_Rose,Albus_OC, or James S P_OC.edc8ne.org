** I have a JSP/OC fic - it's in a non linear order and lightly references some of my other work, but can be read independently.

*** I was wondering if people made Fanfiction about OCs but I'm Hogwarts like a normal 7 years at school

**** Oh, sorry, yeah I don't red/write a lot of Hogwarts based stuff, I prefer grown ups. I'll ask my discord if anyone knows any though.

***** I enjoy grown up more also. I want to find a place pro quidditch centric fanfic that is written by someone that actually has watched a sport in their lives

** Also, my favourite Scorose writers are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2801658/GraeLiars][GraeLiars]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1394384/inadaze22][inadaze22]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1223404/languidbones][languidbones]] - in no particular order, they're all brilliant in different ways. There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/798171/Josephinee][Josephinee]] who's also incredible.

For specific fics not by these three guys, you have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12621795/1/Falling-For-You][Falling For You?]] by MoonstoneAndStardust (You've Got Mail inspired, it's really good) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11372570/1/Unequivocal][Unequivocal]] by BeanerWeasley, which are both pretty good.
