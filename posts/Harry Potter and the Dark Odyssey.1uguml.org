I've been writing my first full-length HP fic, with the input from several helpful people on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]]. (Thanks, [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer][u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] !)

I'm posting the first 7 chapters in a drop-box link here. I have another 300 pages written, though they are extremely rough and I'd like any feedback you're willing to offer before I begin with the second round of editing.

Link: [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/30hc6riv1shrqwo/Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Dark%20Odyssey%20-%20Chap.%201-7.docx]]

Some notes: I've taken to heart a lot of the tired cliches and plot devices mentioned in this subreddit, and tried to omit them. As well, I've tried to include some subjects that aren't often included in fics.

Things I'm trying to avoid:

-Needless character bashing (Ron and Dumbledore in particular)

-Powerful!Harry, Independent!Harry, and pretty much all non-canon Harry that can't be developed and justified in the story.

-Mary Sue / Harry Stu

Things I'm trying to explore:

-Horcrux Magic

-The Deathly Hallows

-Beedle the Bard

-Voldemort Wins

Any feedback at all, no matter how scathing, is appreciated! Thanks for your help, and PM me or post here if you have any questions about where the story is going, need elaboration on any confusing parts, or just want to let me know if you had to stop reading because you found my writing too tedious (though I hope you don't).

Thanks, and enjoy!

(Here is a link to a really short story I posted before, my first fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9763839/1/Secure-Containment-of-Prophecy-Case-Number-368-SCP-368]])


** I've read SCP before, and thoroughly enjoyed reading it again. As for the new story, I found that it took too long before i got my feet on the ground. It wasnt until ch 4 i think that i started enjoying it. I am concerned about pacing. You have a lot of tension and no breathing space.

*** Ok! Good to hear! Any part in particular that struck you as too tedious, that you'd recommend cutting out?

** Very enjoyable read after that first chapter. At first I was incredulous after a few pages of by the book intro, but as soon as the AK hit the bell jar, it grabbed me and pulled me in. The next few chapters definitely give a feeling of anxiety, confusion, and anticipation, as Harry's whisked from one dream/reality/vision to the next. Hermione's weakness and vulnerability is a big change from what I usually read, but of course, you are drawing a world where at least teenage Harry and Hermione are truly human, with real reactions and confusion. Did find a few typos, but those can get weeded out with a beta reader or three. I have found myself having to go back and reread portions of different parts, because you definitely can pack a lot of detail into each line. Can't wait to read more.

*** Thank you so much! First chapter edit is on the way, and I'm working on "unpacking" the chapter to make it smoother, focusing more on suspense and less on action-packing and details.

There's just so many details that I want to include, but I know I have to weed it out.

Thank you for your complements! I'll let you know as more of the fic is completed.

*** I've heard that said often, and that's something I'm going to spend a lot of time on.

EDIT: Mind if I throw some story descriptions your way? I'd like to hear of something intrigues you. I could PM you my ideas.

Wow! I cannot tell you how much that means to hear! I'm eliminating the A/N (which was more of a note to beta readers), and re-editing the first chapter, cutting canon down to a minimum. I'm also reworking the 2nd chapter to make the rabbit a bit clearer, and to add more suspense with H and Hr being tracked in the dark by the snatchers.

You're right about the collapsing building. Re-reading it, I think it is a bit much. I'll focus more on the chase through the streets, and work on making it less cheesy.

I'm glad you like the story, and I thinkthat means you'll like where it's going. Thanks you for your help! I'll gold you in a bit, when I'm out from the office.

*** Thanks for the attention to detail! I'm preparing to do a massive find-replace to ensure I have the names of the spells spelled correctly, and numbers written out.
