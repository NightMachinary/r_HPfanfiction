Question about a minor detail in my story: do you think the old-fashioned, pureblood wizards are familiar with muggle drinks? We always see them drinking pumpkin juice, butterbeer, elf-made wine, and firewhiskey, but are they also familiar with things like orange juice and champagne? I'm considering writing a wealthy pureblood witch who's never had champagne, so I'm wondering if that would strike readers as odd, or make sense.

  "Pick-me-up, that's what he needs," Slughorn continued, now bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. "I've got Butterbeer, I've got wine, I've got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead ..."

The Statue of Secrecy was only passed in 1690, so wizards should be familiar with Muggle drinks that were invented or popularized before their worlds were separated, even if they prefer magically produced equivalents like Firewhisky over whiskey/whisky. This means wine, mulled wine, mead, ale and lager, beer, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer][small beer]], and distilled spirits.

As for champagne, modern champagne as a sparkling wine was made popular in the 1800's but "champagne" as a name for a drink was used in the 1600's, so it would be reasonable for wizards to never have tried it, unless they're French or of French origin like the Lestranges (and Malfoys, according to Pottermore). Then again, wizards have a double decker bus for public transport, so post-Statute cultural exchange isn't impossible. As long as wizards aren't drinking Red Bull jello shots, it should be fine.

I thought it was a triple-decker bus.

*** For all that the purebloods go on about muggles being inferior, it seems like most of the food served in the Great Hall are relatively modern British-style muggle recipes. Treacle tart, Harry's favorite, was [[https://britishfoodhistory.com/2012/05/22/treacle-tart/][invented post-Statute.]]

  "The pudding itself as we know it has only been in existence since the late nineteenth century since golden syrup was invented in the 1880s."

You'd think that the real hoity-toity wizards would be eating roasted Occamy and drinking Dirigible Plum Wine or something.

**** We see wizards adopting Muggle things eventually (trains, wireless, etc), so having treacle tart after a century isn't so strange. All that it takes for something to become acceptable to traditionalists is time.

**** The upper class still use toilets too just as we peasants do. Purebloods still have to eat and it would be incredibly inconvenient to not eat things that muggles eat as well.

** For wizards to drink muggle drinks they would probably have to have some unique element that would make it preferable.

In this case, I can safely say that magic can probably replicate any muggle style of food or drink and make it even more special like a chocolate frog.

Therefore I doubt Wizards have any reason to be familiar with muggle cuisine at all considering magic's vast capabilities of enhancing food.

Or some unscrupulous shopkeeper buys a load of beverages for cheap on the muggle side and the resells them for a markup to the wizards.

***** No, the unscrupulous part comes in where they "forget" to tell their customers that those are muggle drinks... or muggle potatoes... or pumpkin juice made from muggle pumpkins.

****** I knew a farmers market vendor who lost a customer when someone finally told her that the eggs he was selling came out of chickens' butts. The customer switched back to supermarket eggs because they don't come from such an unsanitary source. The farmer hadn't been misrepresenting his eggs, he'd just sold them and assumed she knew all she needed to know.

** Same way people rationalize smart muggles in bad fics; I'll have you know that Einstein was a wizard, he just didn't realize that E was failing in muggle schools. I'm surprised you didn't know that the recipe for orange juice was created by a wizard, who's recipe was stolen by a dastardly squib. Without wizards doing it first, muggles would still think showering brought plagues.

** No. Blood-puristsake it a point to detest all things muggle. I do think it's hypocritical of them since they share the same types of foods and drinks that muggles had before the split of societies.
