Do you just come home with a great idea and start writing your fic right away? Or maybe you make some notes first - bullet points, character descriptions, whatever? Is there any particular plan of events or do you make everything up little by little? Try to describe the process please

There are several ideas on my mind right now, and while I'm not sure I'm going to actually post anything, it would be nice to write them down. I have been thinking of some of these ideas for quite a long time, so it'd probably be better to finally write something and move on.

The problem is, I don't know where to begin. In desperate need of your help.

Edit 11h later: Thank you guys very much for your willingness to help!


** Personally, I work out a rough list-of-things-I-want-to-happen-at-some-point, decide on an ending, and then just start writing. Having anything more detailed than that depresses me and stifles my creativity. But I know there are some people who are the exact reverse; I'm afraid you're just going to have to try both ways and see what works best for /you/.

** Generally, I come up with a concept, then I chose a character who I feel would be the best view point for that concept. If that character isn't someone I've written before, I take a bit of time to do some research on either their direct history according to canon (I basically only write historical fiction so...) or literature they would be most likely exposed to so I have a strong voice in which to cast the story I want to convey. (Narrative voice, tone and immersion are hugely important to me as a reader so I prioritize those facets as a writer

Then I write until I come to a point where I need to do more research or I hit a snag. When I hit a snag, I usually go back and read through all the work I've amassed, edit, revise and come back at it for another pass.

I tend to spend a lot of time going back to research materials, checking dates, and looking into cultural studies of the time/place of the setting to keep both my narrative voice and my details consistent and historically accurate and I never finished with the first draft. Even if I post it looking for feed back/to keep it all in one place. I also tend to bounce a lot of ideas off my wife, who's the only beta patient enough to work with me lmao.

** Honestly, the best way for me is a conversation with my co-writer or even a friend willing to let me ramble for a few hours. Then that becomes a planning document. After a while, that planning document evolves into a folder. I find myself scribbling notes to myself to add to the folder.

If the fic gets big enough (not unlike ren, my big labour of love), then you can end up with a folder with several sub folders which have folders. If you were to look in there, you'd find our canons for each order member, death eater and death adjacent person, the black family along with solidified dates and circumstances, notes on relationships and sexuality, half written snippets, several plot documents and one-shot ideas, a couple of maps I've drawn and a canon timeline vs our timeline.

Then I stick on a characters playlist (depends whose pov it is) on spotify, open up the pertinent docs (i.e. if we're at Lucretia's house, where does she live?), open up the books to check on speech patterns if I'm uneasy about the characterisation or if I need to fact check something is canon not fanon and start.

Usually, a doc with c-whatever-the-number-is is set up, I check the plot doc for the next set of scenes that either go together (like a single event) or just the next 3-6 depending on what needs to be covered and set up dividers between each scene with a bullet point at the top saying what the goal of the scene is, sometimes with notes like 'then sirius can just react like the drama queen you know he'll be and everything will be terrible'. If it's a chapter following on, I usually also read the previous chapter to regain momentum and read the comments over for a nice pick-me-up when motivation is a struggle.

**** That's always nice to hear! The folders look ridiculous (the timeline goes up to July and we're in November, for example) but we have a shared instrumental list which is good background for writing in general, no accidental lyric inputs.

Otherwise, the music is just what I think the characters would listen to (Sirius has Clash, the Jam, Queen, some Bowie and Bolan, maybe some Stones vs Emmeline is the Carpenters, the New Seekers, Dusty Springfield, some Beautiful South vs Remus who's more Kinks, Animals, Troggs, Who) which just really centres the mindset. Writing different POVs was never the plan, so having something to help stimulate the shift in viewpoint that feels tangible helps with the thinking pattern/vocal shift for me.

** I start with a bunch of fragmented ideas written down at random times and try to figure out, at least in general terms, of what I want to happen and in what order. Makes it easier to have some kind of an outline to follow. Nothing detailed, though, just bullet points.

Then I write the scenes I have a clear picture of in my mind, regardless of order, and figure out (or not) how to connect them later. Beats struggling to come up with what feels like filler when writing strictly chronologically.

** I write on scrivner, which allows me to write out of order and piece together down the line. I need that, because I can write internal monologue for days but cannot write action to save my life. So I do what comes easy, plan the rest, and hope one day it actually flows.

For each WIP, I use a Google doc to store snippets of dialogue, ideas, concepts, timeline notes, character points, revisions I need to make, etc., and keep a second reference doc for character notes that I pull from canon; things like tics (e.g., tends to drop things when surprised) and Rowling's dialogue tags, queen abuser of adverbs that she is.

When I have an idea for something, I also read the hell out of actual novels from the relevant genre and highlight like there's no tomorrow. Couple weeks back, my brain decided 2 AM was a good time to drop a horror story into place, and by the next day, I'd downloaded everything from Haunting of Hill House to The Turning of the Screw. I think it helps your writing and you'd be surprised what you can pick up from osmosis, hah.

** I follow a character. I have an idea and maybe an outline in my head, but I come up with a character first and try to not let my outline get in the way of how the character develops. This usually means that the story goes places I never thought it would, but also means that sometimes it doesn't end up as exciting as I thought it would be.

** I used to have a great idea and start writing everything right away. I'd handwrite the story on looseleaf and have a nebulous idea for how everything would run down, but I currently have a graveyard of abandoned stories to testify how that panned out.

Nowadays, I have started to make drafts and documents setting up the characters, the chapter by chapter summaries, plot, and other ideas I may have. It's best for me this way, so that I wouldn't forget to bring up subtle and important plot points and I keep the characters in character. It also will help if you ever hit a writer's block as well. You'll have everything set up so you can pick up where you left off. That's not to say it has to be permanent (leave yourself room for growth and change) but it should have a place on the drawing board.

I'd also suggest writing up multiple chapters at a time. if possible, complete your story a quarter or halfway through before posting. It'll help you stay on schedule and take the edge off staying on top of everything.

Good luck!

** I spend at most two hours outlining a single chapter with bullet points on what happens and work from there and repeat. Like, I know what's roughly going to happen in the long run, but breaking it down chapter by chapter works really well for me if that makes sense.

** I dive in, after stewing on it for a few days, move the starting point several times, then eventually get overwhelmed with all the ideas going on in my head and start making notes, then they make no sense, so I start writing a proper timeline outline, and then I pants it from there. I'm definitely more of a pantser than a planner, but I will eventually plan and I tend to write out character profiles with important information that I probably should not forget.. then I lose my character profiles and randomly find them one day a year later, covered in dust, hiding under my bed in the exact spot I looked originally.

** I generally get an idea I think would be cool, search for it, promptly find that nobody has done what I was thinking of, and decide to do it myself. This leads to a basic summary of said idea.

I then spend the next five months writing random bits of world-building down before actually getting anywhere.

I am not a particularly great writer.

** First off, research from pottermore and other things from the books,just the movies or both. Write the facts down, making sure those facts that you are using can go in your story. Some people like to see some facts from the resources.

Make a page or more what kind of character you are using or making a character. Make a list of the character biography, skills, power, family and other things. To help understand more of the character background. Like a example: the character is a pureblood....

Make a pro/con list to help out.

Then make a rough draft of your story. Make notes on it also to help out to add more or cross some things off.

Then make the story.

That's how I do it.

Just my pet peeve: a lot of people whom make a story, that they don't care about the facts from pottermore or other resources. That make their story no sense.

** For me, things I need to write a story are the characters I want to write, a beginning, an ending, a certain kind of mood/feel I want the entire story to have, and it goes on from there. I usually spend a while developing the story through a chapter-by-chapter outline, while making lots of notes on backstory/worldbuilding/etc., and then I alternate between writing the scenes for the chapters and thinking about the plot/changing the outline. The mood/feel is very important to me, because it helps me figure out how plot events should happen, and what kind of journey it should take to reach the end.

An example of a 'mood/feel' would be 'exhausted and uncertain but fighting for happiness'. Maybe someone would call it an 'emotional theme'? Anyway, it has to be an inspirational feeling, because chasing after this feeling and seeing it through to the ending is a long process, and anything short of inspirational and important to me means I write a story and abandon it halfway. Thought I'd chime in with a slightly different process.

** I like to think about my characters first. What would I like to see the characters transform into/be in certain situations ? Do I want Hermione to be a badass mf or Harry to pick up smoking etc etc. Then I bulk up my stories with 'why?'

I wrote a whole post-Hogwarts story about war trauma/ptsd that came from the idea of wanting a three way in a story 😂 The first thing I asked myself was 'how would they end up in this situation?' 'what are believable circumstances that a normal non-wizard could find themselves here?'

I also find making notes about the characters very helpful to refer to if I want them in a new situation.

For example:

Hermione: - strong, independent - started S.P.E.W. at the Ministry at 23 (driven) - working on getting over her fear of flying (flying lessons with Harry on Tuesdays/Thursdays) - xx years old (Sept 19 1979) - close with Harry - Molly pushed her away after she and Ron broke up

Then I write the fun stuff first, like action, confrontation or sex scenes first. Let it rest for a bit then add filler chapters between the good stuff. I also have a friend and my husband who will proof read it. Then I'll read it about 10 times. If by the end, I want to read another story like it, I find that a success and upload! (I also write it all before releasing it, not chapter by chapter so my readers have the enjoyment of getting one new chapter per day and I don't feel pressured to throw something together)

I hope this helps a bit! :)

** I think it's probably better to outline things first.

It doesn't have to be overly detailed, but having a good idea of where you want your story to end up will prevent word bloat or writing yourself into a corner and then abandoning.

Also be aware that the first thing your write will probably suck. The first ten things you right might suck. That's how it feels for me, at least.

Getting down to the technical details: I usually will jot down ideas/plot outlines with pen and paper in a journal. Then when I'm home, I will type the actual story into a google doc.

**** I don't think you have to have the final scene explicitely planned out, but I do believe that you should have an idea about the climactic moment in the story. Not fully formed -- that will come when you actually sit down to write it -- but you should know what you're building towards.

So whether the story ends up with a big battle or some confrontation between Harry and Professor Sprout or whatever it is, I think you should know what your characters are working towards.

** I get random bursts of inspirations for random OC characters (like the daughter of Queenie and Jacob, without taking Crimes of Grindelwald in account). I write as much as I can then lose interest, Then I drop that story and focus on something easier like a story about an OC that ends up with Charlie Weasley or something similar.

I also find post Hogwarts stories easier to write than Hogwarts stories.
