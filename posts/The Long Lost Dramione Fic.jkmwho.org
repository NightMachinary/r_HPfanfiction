:END:
I have looked everywhere for this fanfiction, I've posted it in groups on Facebook. 5+ years ago I read a Dramione fanfiction where Dumbledore was away, Voldemort wiped everyone's memory at Hogwarts.. Draco and Hermione had been fighting and assume they are boyfriend and girlfriend. Hermione went to the manor with Draco for Christmas and she lost her Virginity to him, he gave her a ring. When Dumbledore comes back he restores their memory, they break up. Hermione throws the ring at him and pansy finds it in his robes assuming its for her. That's all I remember.
