** Like that time he imagined carrying Hagrids bag as assistant groundskeeper after being expelled, or in a more positive way?

*** i'm starting an hp/fallout xover soon and he's the dada professor. But as i was doing some research, i realized groundsman or caretaker would allow him more freedom for graverobbing which is what he is in his offtime in my story(indiana jones reference).

*** I really don't think that working with Hagrid every day would be boring or particularly bad! I mean, the expulsion part would suck but I think Hagrid would somehow make everything worthwhile. In a similar vein, I tried looking for any "Harry raised by Hagrid" stories a while back and couldn't find any :'(
