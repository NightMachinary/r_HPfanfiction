#+TITLE: LF A fic I read quite a while ago, so I'm not sure my info is 100% accurate. The only part I definitely remember is that Dumbles 'doped' Molly Weasley and was Ginny's father. He's eventually 'defeated' in the quidditch pitch(?).

Molly or Ginny (can't remember which one though I think its Ginny) comes down to him after and kicks him (I think). It's not a lot to go on, but I hope you guys can help. Also, it was just a subplot of a much larger fic, that I think was a H/Hr and those two ... adopt Ginny? Not sure if that's part of this fic or not.
