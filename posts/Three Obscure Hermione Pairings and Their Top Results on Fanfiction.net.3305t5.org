There are 310 Narcissa/Hermione fics on FFNet. The top result by favorites is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9426206/3/One-Step-Left][One Step Left]] by Cysteine Snap

#+begin_quote
  What would have happened if Dobby had flinched and taken one step to the left, leaving Hermione behind to fend for herself and thus causing a terribly different outcome of the war. "You defeated my husband on his own land in a duel. Pureblood tradition states that you claim all that was his...including his wife."

I was surprised not to find any Hermione/Marietta fics. There were three that listed them both as characters, but in none of them were the two actually in any kind of relationship.

#+begin_quote

There are 6 Hermione/Phineas Nigellus (the painting) fics. My personal favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7907028/1/To-a-Portrait][To a Portrait]] by CeliaEquus.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione wants information; Phineas wants a show. See where this is going? Basically this is PWP, set in "Deathly Hallows". Could be considered canon, in the wrong frame of mind.

***** Is that on FanFiction.net? I found a Periwinkle Wink on FanFiction.net, but her three Hermione/Hagrid stories are one-shots and aren't what I would call "realistic relationships" and "intriguing plotlines". Do you have any links to good stories?
