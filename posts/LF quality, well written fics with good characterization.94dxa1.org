I am looking for new material to read! Basically my criteria is that it should be well written with good characterization. I don't mind if slash, any pairings is good really, as long as everyting feels realistic and has good foundation.

Bashing and OP characters are big no's. I love alternative universe and world building. I love for want of a nail fics, time travel, sorting au's...

My all time favorites are;

On the Way to Greatness Changeling Reign of the Serpent Escaping the Paradox Applied Cultural Anthropolgy Six Pomegranate Seeds

Thanks!


** I'll give you my personal favorite characterizations for each character, rather than link you the same old fics I always rec. Many of these are rather short, but I love them all the same as they manage to capture the essence of that character with only a few hundred words.

Harry Potter: Across the Universe by mira-mirth

Hermione Granger: Stages of Hope

Ginny Weasley: gone was any trace of you by Annerb

Neville Longbottom: Asking for Roses by Dogstar101

Severus Snape: So it Goes On by History101

*** Ooh this is really good! I love that you have categorized it by character. I think I read Actoss the Universe and gone was any trace of you but I'll have to check!

Thank you!

** Copperbadge has a great one for Remus Lupin for the twelve years between Voldemort falling the first time and POA. It's more character study than plot and I like that it takes into account that it was a war rather than that spot of bother a few years back or some such- linkao3(Sweet Home by copperbadge)

The Stinging Habits of the Western Honeybee is one of my favorite for want of a nail fics- linkao3(The Stinging Habits of the Western Honey Bee)

This one is cannon compliant centered around Luna and Snape (as teacher and student, nothing else). It's beautifully written and I read it several times- linkao3(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know; Yet I Live and I Love)

This one is an AU (canon compliant up to like CoS, IIRC) starting with McGonagall not putting up with Dumbledore's all will be well bs (without turning into character bashing). It's a series as well and follows Harry, Neville and Draco throughout.- linkao3(Age and Wisdom, or, Never Underestimate a Crone)

I think I probably recc it every time I post in this sub but Blood Magic is a favorite of mine, mainly because it manages to be another well-written characterization of Snape (still bigoted and kind of a dick, but also a whole person)- linkao3(Blood Magic by GatewayGirl)

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.
