I'm rereading Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches at the moment and there is an author's note that perfectly sums up the stupid "overprotective Dan (and of course he's named Dan) Granger" trope

"Dan: /Grrrrrrr/ "You better not look at my daughter in any way funny, twelve year old boy who has only saved my daughter's life multiple times, and been her only friend that she's ever had."

This, just this. This is so stupid and I don't think I've ever once read it and found it enjoyable.

Why is this so common?

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

That's idiotic. They didn't die in a random accident! They fought in a war, friends dying left and right, defied Voldemort multiple times and finally went into hiding because the Dark Lord was out to kill them. Yeah what an absurd notion to write a will, no one would think of that! How ridiculous, obviously when you're young you're not going to die anytime soon and never consider the possibility - even when confronted by life and death situations and surrounded by death.

There's just not enough sarcasm to express my utter bewilderment when I encounter this reasoning. If you want to fix this obvious oversight by JKR just write that the office of their solicitor got blown up and all copies of the will have been lost - don't make the Potters retarded.

There are many ways they could have filed their wills without risking themselves. Absence of will seems like a dumb and idiotic idea.

*** It's definitely flawed in the "every girl falls in love with Harry and blushes/has 'those' thoughts at every positive interaction" sexualization of characters that are probably too young - I feel like a lot of decent fics suffer from this where it seems like the writers are writing some strange parody of teenage "hormone driven" romance. Probably my biggest gripe with it.

There's also some magical core, lord this lord that, way too political eleven year olds, occlumency makes you have super powers, but that I can overlook as the author works into the story decently and it does make it quite fun. A little too much wink wink nudge nudge at times with "this spell is OP", but despite all my complaints I do read it so would qualify as a guilty pleasure fic.

Really like the end of year 1 at Hogwarts and there's a lot of fun moments, just hope the author can keep it up especially as they get more and more powerful. Feels quite a bit like HPMOR now that I think about it, flawed but fun with an OP Harry but also a better Dumbledore and Voldemort to match.

**** *Focal point (game theory)*

In game theory, a focal point (also called Schelling point) is a solution that people will tend to use in the absence of communication, because it seems natural, special, or relevant to them. The concept was introduced by the Nobel Memorial Prize-winning American economist Thomas Schelling in his book The Strategy of Conflict (1960). In this book (at p. 57), Schelling describes "focal point[s] for each person's expectation of what the other expects him to expect to be expected to do".

** Honestly, its common because it was and still is a popular trope on tv, in movies and books and some people actually DO experience this, hell I experienced this on prom night with my best friend of 3 years father.

Something to remember is that there are many, many authors who dont come to communities like this, or who are not trying to go against tropes because they actually DO like tropes or might even have seen them take place in real life and use that experience in their writing.

Yeah its a bit strange to say to a 12 year old, but there are over protective dads out there who would say something like this to kids even younger as a general "dont mess with my daughter" threat.

IDK man why does it need to be analyzed, the author put it in because they either liked the way the scene reads, they thought it was realistic, or they thought it was in character. Its not something just seen in this fandom.
