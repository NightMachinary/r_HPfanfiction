So basically what it says on the title. I see a very large variety of Harry getting dropped into another universe, sometimes it's a canon world and he changes stuff and the story goes from there. However I've never seen one where pure canon Harry gets dropped into an Indy or super Harry universe and I think that would be a great storyline to flesh out. I mean imagine that they're talking about how super op Harry was able to defeat Voldemort.

(to set the scene, canon Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, The teachers, maybe some people from the ministry all sitting around Dumbledore's office.)

"So Harry, judging by your age can I correctly assume that you've defeated your version of Voldemort already?" questioned Dumbledore as soon as everyone had sat down and collected their drink of choice. Dumbledore was of course suckling on a lemon drop infused with just a drop of calming potion. Hermione had a strong earl grey with just a pinch of sugar while Harry and Ron were sipping on butterbeers.

"Yes I did. I beat him almost 3 years ago. I'm curious, how did my... counterpart go about defeating him?"

"Well it was a rather impressive battle, I believe the deciding spell Hadrian used was some form of soul burning fire he found in the Black family grimoire. Alas, he never did tell the theory or the wand motions needed to summon that particular flame. And how did you fare in ending Voldemort, did you use some ritual? Perhaps a spell from the potter family side of things?"

As the silence dragged on, everyone who was in the room noticed a steadily increasing blush appearing on Harry's face.

"I used the disarming spell." said Harry to the floor.

"I'm sorry what?"

I feel like this could go a great number of ways. Just Harry sitting there describing his adventures to people, and them just asking him how he's still alive. Either a really good crack fic, or a good light hearted story.


** "I used Expelliarmus."

There was silence for a few seconds before the Ron started snickering. "Good one Harry. You are funnier than Hadrian can ever be. But seriously how did you beat your 'You Know Who'?"

"I really used the Expelliarmus to kill him."

"Really?" Hermione said with curiosity clear in her voice. "I didn't believe it was possible to kill someone with the Disarming Charm. You must be an exceptionally powerful wizard to be able to do so. I doubt even Professor Dumbledore or Hadrian could do it."

"You are correct Miss Granger. I don't believe I could make an Expelliarmus powerful enough for it to kill someone. Perhaps a Stupefy but not Expelliarmus."

'My Expelliarmus didn't actually hit Voldemort." Harry was regretting asking about his counter part.

"Bloody Merlin. Your Expelliarmus is so strong that you didn't even need to hit with it to kill You Know Who." Ron said awed.

"No. Voldemort used the Killing Curse and I used the Disarming Charm. Our spells hit each others and his Killing Curse rebounded and hit him." Harry said through clenched teeth.

There was silence when the others heard about it and he wished he could be anywhere but here. Then Ron made a sound he has only ever heard his Ron make when talking about Chudley Canons.

"You mean you actually hit You Know Who's spell with your own?" There was even more awe in Ron's voice than before, "Like the Super Heroes in the comics do?"

He didn't know what to say to that. He had never read a Wizarding comic. He had not even read a Muggle comic book. "Yeah." he answered hesitantly.

"Show me." Hermione demanded. She was already drawing her wand and getting out of her seat. He hesitated but followed suit. When they were standing facing each other, wands in front of them he waited patiently for Hermione to cast first.

After a moment she drew her wand arm closer to her and his eyes widened. /What the hell is she thinking? Using Reducto inside a room./ As she brought her arm back forward and the blue spell left her wand; he moved his wand forward and thought /Stupefy./ As their spells collided the reducto deflected into the floor a few meters before him and his spell went whizzing just over her head.

He was about to snap at her for her choice of spell but halted when he saw the look of disbelief and awe on her face. "I never thought this was possible. Professor Dumbledore have you seen anything like this before?" she asked turning towards the Headmaster.

"I don't think I have Miss Granger. Harry here must be extremely skilled to be able to do this." he replied and he had.. admiration in his voice.

Ron slapped him on his back and as he turned towards him said, "You are so much cooler than Hadrian. I can't wait to rub the fact that you killed Voldemort by deflecting his own spell at him into his face."

â€‹

In canon Harry did in fact fire spells at already fired spells to deflect or block them. And as far as I know he was the only one to do so.

**** In the films, there's several instances of spells being blocked in Beam-O-Wars.

The special case in Harry's case was the Priori Incantatum, where Harry overpowered Voldemort's wand and forced it to show the wand's previous victims, along with the golden cage of light.

In Deathly Hallows, it was caused by Harry being the true master of the Elder Wand, causing the wand to backfire (like how Ron's wand backfired on Lockhart).

I always hated that bit, because unless every instance of that happening involved wands made from the same core material from the same animal, like Harry's and Voldemort's wands, the spells should've just bounced away from each other in random directions, like what was described happening in Book 4 when Harry and Draco cast a spell at each other simultaneously.

** "I've assumed you've taken the mantle of Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Le Fay?"

Ron sharply inhaled his drink, visibly trying not to laugh. He tried to disguise it by coughing into his hand.

"Uh," said Harry. He pushed his glasses up his nose. "Nope. I'm just Harry."

"And your harem?"

Ron couldn't hold it any longer.

** The goblins "I assume you've already gone through the inheritence ritual?"

Harry "Th-the what now?"

"The ritual in which you prick your finger and drop blood onto a peice of parchment, thereby magically creating a list of all your powers, titles, and properties. All orchestated for free in 10 minutes by the goblin nation of course, since you did smile at one of us once."

"...Um, no I don't believe I've done that."

"What?! Preposterous! You mean to say that when you were 11 years old you /did not/ conduct your own legal, financial, and political business without the consent of either your muggle or magical guardian? Nor did you claim your ungodly amount of seats on the wizengamot, therefore guaranteeing your complete control of magical Britain before you even hit puberty?"

"Ron, Hermione, I think we should get out of here. These guys are completely round the bend."

"Did you at least solidify your marriage contracts?"

"Contracts?? As in plural?!"

"Naturally. Your marriages gaurentee you access to the entirety of the Greengrass, Bones, Carrow, and Weasleys estates and vaults."

Hermione "Is this legal?"

Ron "Bloody hell no. If Percy heard of all this he'd have a conniption and die on spot. Imagine all the legal trouble and paperwork..."

Everyone ever in the HP Indy universe "Paperwork? What's paperwork?"

** "I used the expelliarmus."

In the silence, the breeze blew, autumn leaves fluttering among the grass on the grounds of Hogwarts. It seemed marvolous that the grim battlescarred halls were here in their pre-battle state. It almost brought a tear to his eye.

The group stared at him in shock.

"But, there has to be more than that?" Hermione's question was reflected in the gaze of all present, and Harry sighed.

"I don't want to talk about it." THe tone was final and harry looked with haunted eyes, looking and seeing not what lay before him, but the echoes of the past. Fred. Tonks. A tear slipped past his eye. "You really don't want to know. Not even I."

"We used a school as a fortress. Yes, we evacuated most of the children, but some remained. You really want to know that in order for you to win, some first year jumped in front of an AK for you?" Harry let out a tear at that particular memory. Not all of the first years had left.

"I was ready to die. To give up on this world. So, I died." Harry took a deep inbreath, as he watched the thestrals, wandering if there was a Colin in this world as well. "I was ready to go on. In cowardice. Abandoning my freinds." There was steel in his eye as he made this declaration. "You know what they say."

"Hell is empty, and all the demons are here."

"I didn't want to kill him. I, I just could not bring myself to kill another human being. So, I threw the first spell I thaught of, expelliarmous at his AK. It rebounded, killing him." Harry saw a ruffle in the air, the telltale sign of disillusionment , and threw himself to the gound before throwing a protego.

"Jumpy are you?" Dumbledore asked.

"No. Just prepared."

Besides that one little thing, I can't find anything wrong with it. It was short but it was deep. It gave so much in such a small bite. Honestly I'm jealous.

**** I dunno. When you spend most of maths filling graph paper with fanfiction and then stress yourself to hell and back when the exam comes up. It's even worse now with school at home ... :(. I do have a fanfiction that I'm writing. It's meant to be a relatively short oneshot about twins who lived. (I love Harry Potter and the boy who lived by the santi). Plan is, Harry ain't the boy who lived, does have a horcrux on his head. Currently trying suicide by the enemy, aka putting himself in unwinnable positions. I'm trying to base it loosely on this guy, (I tried to find him but I'll give you the gist. NZ soldier in world war two, had personal vendetta against all things germans for gassing his uncles, and went batshit crazy after his girlfreind broke up with him, attempting suicide by charging enemy machine gun nests. Repeatedly.(Actually it might be this guy with his acheivments overblown by the lads in the army [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Upham)]]) Knowing that he needs to die, Harry takes on increasingly stupid risks, dropping out of school to fight the war, he gains the respect and the command of the fighting arm of the order of the phoenix. I also would like to work in some PTSD. I've been reading the body keeps the score and damn, that shit is dark. As Harry is a total badass motherfucker in the field against Death Eaters, he cries at night for the people he's killed. Not just those that he's killed personally, but those that have died for him. He's a haunted man. Death eaters will be competent, and casualties will be evened out. No:Harry instagibs 50 death eaters destroying voldemorts support base. Yes: Harry killed three, bellatrix killed five, lets get the fuck outta here. No:"By right of conquest I steal your shit" bullshit, Yes:"accio gold chandelier, family jewels, dark artifact that can be sold, malfoy's fancey silk shit, lets get us some more safehouses with this money. In short, a Harry Potter fanfic that will be very, very grim. Wanna be my beta reader, Internet stranger?
