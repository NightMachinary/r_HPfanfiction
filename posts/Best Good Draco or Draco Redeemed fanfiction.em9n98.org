So when I say Good Draco I mean AU where he's not such a dick from the start. If he isnt cuz AU he isnt a dick or AU he had better friends who influenced him no other explanation needed.

If one or both of his parents are good now more explanation needed.

If its a redeemed story and its not he good from the start then it should focus on what changed his outlook ( it shouldnt be romance). And it shouldnt be easy for him he should have to earn trust or be in a position where it makes sense for the others to trust him.

No Draco/OC ships No Draco/self insert No Draco / Anyone of the Marauders gen or older

This also applies for any major canon character Dracos age.

Also No Draco/Hermione ( sorry not a fan even if Draco starts out good im meh on it)

No genderbender ( trans characters are fine i dont consider genderbenders trope to overlap with that)

Apart from this any other ship is fine slash, fem slash, whatever.

Though no ships are also fine and I actually prefer friendship focused.

It should be Draco centric with Draco as the MC or a MC if there is more than 1.

Preferably no fics that Bash Griffindors and put Slytherins on a pedastal both have flaws that can be acknowledged tho. Also no Ron bashing fics.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** I'm not gonna lie that is a lot of specific requests. Check out linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) which is the first of 5 books so far (5 is current WIP), and you don't get much Draco-focused until some of the later books in the series. I know it breaks multiple of your rules but best AU Good Draco depiction that I like.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** It might come across as a bit bashy towards Ron and Hermione in places (YMMV), but linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble) has a wonderful post-war redeemed Draco becoming friends with Harry, resulting in much snarky banter.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!
