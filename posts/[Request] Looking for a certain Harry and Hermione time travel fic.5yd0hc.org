I can't remember too much about it, only that after Voldemort died, his backup plan activated and caused firestorms to ravage Britain, along with (I think) water supplies being poisoned.

  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

** Linkffn(10807718).

Unfortunately abandoned. The author received a fair amount of negative reviews towards the end and decided not to continue the fic.

***** Ah. It's unfortunate that the story was abandoned, but I had already stopped reading it after that. The plot had started to feel rather overfull of forced drama between Harry and Hermione.

** The thing that bugs me about these stories is that meglomaniacs can't conceive that they could possibly be defeated so there's no way they would come up with a contingency plan to cover that situation.

(I've been bugged by this since the end of System Shock 2.)

*** Yeah it seems really out of character for a Voldemort-type villain. This is something that someone more like The Joker would do.

*** iirc that very problem of why Voldemort would have such a horrifying contingency plan is brought up in the story... but it's implied there's a big answer. The characters also wonder at why the contingency was so well hidden compared to his Horcruxes. But because the story is abandoned, we'll never know.
