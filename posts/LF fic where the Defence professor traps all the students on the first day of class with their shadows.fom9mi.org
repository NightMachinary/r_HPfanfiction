:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
And the only one who is able to escape is Harry, who uses lumos to banishes the shadows away. It was done as a demonstration to keep everybody on constant vigilance or that wizards are scary or something like that.

I'm pretty sure it's one of the more commonly recommended fics but I can't seem to remember which one it was, so if one of you could be kind enough to jog my memory by giving me the title of the fic (and maybe the chapter in which it occurs) that'd be awesome!

Thanks in advance!


** I think you are talking about the comment by [[/u/NOTASALAMANDERSPY][u/NOTASALAMANDERSPY]] on the *Harry and Tom go back in time, unaware of each other* prompt.

Hope this helps.

*** It did! That's the one! It really does speak to the writing quality of some of the responses to the prompts on these subs that I thought it was an actual fic. Thank you! :)
