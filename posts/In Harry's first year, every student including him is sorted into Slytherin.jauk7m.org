What happens next? Assume that this can't be reversed or fixed. And that the sorting goes on because of Hogwarts bylaws or something.


** Ok, so, all kids in the older years were sorted normally? That means Slytherin is still mostly Slytherin. Very overrun by firsties, though.

I'd think there would be discussions about the Hats magic failing after 1000 years, but no prove and the hat creates a similar bond/contract to the Goblet of Fire, so officially nothing can be done.

Still, people will think that, because it happened so uniformly, it is the Hat's fault, not the kids'. That means, Ron, Neville, and any other kid from a family traditionally in another house will be treated by their families as having been done an injustice to, not as having failed. Maybe the older kids "adopt" certain firsties they think should have belonged in to their house. - Within Slytherin, though, the kids who "should not be there" will be treated pretty bad.

This creates a situation whe the muggle-born kids may be the worst off. They have no house they would have belonged to traditionally if not for the Hat, no prior magical family connections to look out for them, and the older Slytherin kids definitely yl don't want them in their house. They may be banding together, deciding that strength in numbers will get them through this.

All of this will not lead to death, but may lead to different relationship dynamics. Different friendships and rivalries. Though, Harry and Ron are already friends, and Harry and Draco already cannot stand each other and that won't change.

Outside of school there will be articles in the Prophet, and an initiative to change the sorting to be done a different way come next year as the Hat is no longer trustworthy (And some other initiative about fixing the Hat SONEHOW instead, because tradition). So, by next year something is set in place to make sure the sorting debacle does not repeat itself, though the "something" may only be temporary while other things are sorted out.

** Slytherin wins the Quidditch and the House Cup because of themselves and not because of Harry. Hermione and Dean get tied to the mast on top of the Astronomy Tower and get "Mudblood carved on their foreheads". Ron and Neville get disowned by their respective families.

*** Jeez, Hermione and Dean really copped it. Also I'd disagree, if anything approximately 75% of Slytherin house would now comprise of typical 'non-slytherin' individuals. There would have to be some sort of uprising from the others, and the bigoted purebloods would be knocked down a peg or two. Would be cool to see Slytherin House rise to prominence in the complete opposite way people expect it to
