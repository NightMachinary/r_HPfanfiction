Y'all - I just spent the weekend reading this amazing trilogy. Well, two parts of it and the beginning of the end. But it's really good. It's a next-gen fic, centered, in part on a Slytherin Rose Weasley and new relationships between the goblins and wizards. If you're into political fics, there's a take on communism, socialism, and anarchy that I have yet to see before, and there's plenty of action if you want that too. Highly recommended - 10/10.

** Good recommendation. Also, best Rose/Scorpius I've ever read, if anybody cares :)
