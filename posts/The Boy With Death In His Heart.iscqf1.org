Walden McNair was an average looking man, a pureblood in a society of wizards and witches. One day, he was walking in the market Diagon Alley. Of course, as a pureblood he had certain advantages and expectations. He was in a rush, the crowd parting around from him as he made his way to Gringotts. In his haste, he did not notice the wraith of a boy gliding toward him, making it's way in the other direction. They crashed into each other, and the anger that flowed through McNair in that moment was so immense that he immediately grabbed the boy and "nicely" told him to watch where he was going. Walden thought that was the end of it and started to make his way back to Gringotts, when he started to feel ill. A sudden coldness started in his chest, like the presence of a Dementor but so much worse.

His throat caught, it became so much harder to breathe, it felt like he was drowning, all the while the coldness started to spread even more. His very magic was getting eaten away by the coldness. In that moment, he knew he was already dead.

He spun and fell to the side, and as he looked he found the cold, glassy, dead eyes of the boy looking at him. The boy had his head tilted as if there was something fascinating about his demise. Then Walden flicked his eyes upward, and started in surprise, for there was a lighting bolt scar, faded upon his forehead. Walden's last visage upon the world was the scar and the boy's terrible, horrible dead gaze.

The boy turned his dreadful gaze around and walked towards the exit as everybody else rushed towards the corpse that was once known as Walden McNair. The boy was an impossibility, an abberation upon reality. A walking corpse traveling the earth. For how can one but be known as an abomination with Death in their heart. For this boy knew Death completely as Death knew him, and they always loved making new friends...
