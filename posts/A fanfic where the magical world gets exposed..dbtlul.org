It doesn't matter when it gets exposed or what happens afterwords, it just needs to be seen by muggles.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

*** I hadn't read this because I worried it was going to go all Dark Knight Returns & Have minister Thatcher serving for life. It nicely averted that.

It has a couple of very nice arcs (Sirius is great), and I love the Hermione & co becoming animagus for their friends. And the Granger's being Republican was a nice touch.

It does have a few problems though. I cringed at the formally swearing 12 year olds into military service. Actually given how this fic tended to advert the steriotypes, I was surprised to see it played straight.

And the author has an annoying tendency to overuse "they didn't know it, but this would be remembered as". Over and over and over again.

And the timetable was a bit too compressed. There wasn't any reason to have so much stuff happen every year, the amount of events in the fic could have easily happened over twice the time frame...
