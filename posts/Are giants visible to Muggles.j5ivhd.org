I know that it says in Book 5 that giant attacks on Muggles are associated with avalanches or people lost while hiking but then in book 6 the giant attacks on a village are associated with a hurricane. Was it because of memory charms or because Muggles could only see their houses ripped by an invisible force?

  “That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably. “Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. “Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries ---” “It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's followers. And...and we suspect giant involvement.” The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall. “What involvement?” Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the grand effect,” he said. “The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock, we've had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we've got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we can't find the giant --- it's been a disaster.”

The scene you reference mentions that misinformation is being spread by the ministry and obliviators are wiping the memories of the muggles who did see the giant.

*** Probably the most aggravating scene in the book for me, because there's no way anyone with half a brain would have bought the hurricane story.

Weather satellites had been a significant thing for two decades by that point. Hurricanes show up on them for quite a while since they take days to form out at sea, and then break apart. The damage isn't even remotely similar to what a hurricane hitting should be, since there's no flooding mentioned.

Tornado is barely plausible, and might have been what they meant. In which case it's abysmal editing.

** possibly the muggles can see giants as you need VERY powerful magic to make them invisible because they're big
