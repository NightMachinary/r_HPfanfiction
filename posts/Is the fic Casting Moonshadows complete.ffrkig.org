I get confused.

Casting Moonshadows [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378356/86]]

I thought it was marked as complete here, but it ends rather abruptly.

Does anyone have any recs similar to this fic?


** I thought the same when I read it. It was such a long slow buildup and then BAM finished. It felt so rushed in the last couple of chapters.

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.

*** thanks for that, it might be what I saw

this writer updated the fic a year or two ago after a long while and has said in a number of places that it isn't abandoned...but I guess I should just put it aside and be happy in a year or something if it does get updated :P

I just believed their notes from earlier on haha, when they said it would go to 7th year.
