I just want a fic we're Harry is just the heir to five different houses. But don say like “it's lord Potter to you!” I just find that really annoying and I don't think his personality is like that at all.

Preferably no hinny or harmione.


** So a Harry who is like Dumbledore. Has stupid amounts of influence and power but chooses to ignore it untill he needs to use it
