The part that I remember, it's during Harry's fourth year and during the riot that's after the quidditch world cup, the author wrote something about percy dueling a death eater and then Bill goes to help him, someone knows what's called?


** Maybe linkffn(Percy Takes the Wheel)? Not sure.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.
