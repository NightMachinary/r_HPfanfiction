**** JKR originally had Dean play a much larger part in the books.

#+begin_quote
  Dean Thomas was originally going to be a more prominent character in the novels, like Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood, but his role was initially cut down. Originally, Dean was called "Gary", and in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Dean Thomas was going to be first introduced during the "Sorting Hat" chapter.

  His character was cut from the UK copies due to needing to shorten the chapter, however he still is in some US copies. He also was going to be featured in the chapter "Midnight Duel" going along with Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville to confront Draco Malfoy, but he was cut out of this scene entirely. After having cut Dean out so much from the books, Jo did not want him to go unnoticed in the films and when the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was in production she blew away director Chris Columbus with the amount of information she had on such a minor character.

  In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets J.K. Rowling had originally included Dean Thomas' background story, which explained about his "Muggle-born" blood status and his father being a wizard, but it was cut out again as it was "unnecessary content." Jo has said that she believes she swapped developing Dean Thomas to develop the character Neville Longbottom instead, as he was more relevant to the overall plot.

  Dean later plays a somewhat larger role in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, where he becomes Ginny's boyfriend and a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, where he is on the run, kidnapped,and rescued.

**** IIRC in-universe he thinks he's a muggleborn because his mom's a muggle and his dad is absent. JK revealed at some point that his dad was a wizard who got killed in the war (IDK if it was by Voldemort directly or something else).

** Not through scrying, but they get to watch football in linkffn(A Different Halloween by robst).

Yes it's a robst story but I can actually read this one because for once he doesn't even pretend it's anything other than a feel-good story, so the lack of conflict isn't really an issue.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
