Tired of reading the same thing over and over again and want to read something different perhaps? Or have a bunch of ideas that you'll probably never write about? Feel free to write down ANY idea, any character as a main character, any era, any pairing or anything you can think of.

Maybe someone will be willing to write it in the future, or so. Or maybe it'll inspire someone else to write something different in general.

ANYTHING goes at all.

Feel free to also promote stories with different ideas that other people have written as well.

Edit: I'd say that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4738757/1/Harry-Potter-recommends][Harry Potter recommends]] (hover over the title, you can click on it to read it) for instance, is pretty different fic from the usual. Like it has similar ideas as other stories, but the overall idea feels different, and stuff like that.

So if you have something like that, with a usual idea done differently, or an unusual idea with similar ideas thrown in, that'd work as well.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Well, there is concentric wavelengths by VotN. There is also equal and opposite by Amerision. Also, check out Resurrexit by Master Slytherin.

** I have pondered the idea of a crossover with yes minister for a while. It would have a taboo on amending any laws that Merlin wrote, contradictory rules (document must be signed in green ink using a blood quill), another taboo on bringing up the issue of house pride, a coalition between Dumbledore and Lucius Malfoy, civil service machinations preventing Fudge, Scrimgeour, and Thicknesse from ever doing anything, lots of blue and orange morally, and the most unlikely 'power the dark lord knows not', bureaucracy. Of course, it would be a crack fic, because there's no way this could be all that serious.
