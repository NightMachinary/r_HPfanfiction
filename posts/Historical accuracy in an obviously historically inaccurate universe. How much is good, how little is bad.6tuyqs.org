So I've been working on a "Harry in the times of the Founders" fanfiction for a while now. There's not much written, but a lot of research done, a lot of popular media dealing with that time consumed, a lot of books on that time read.

The thing is just, obviously there weren't any actual witches and wizards there at the time. Wessex had no wizards to defend it, the Norse had no actual völva to sing the spell-songs, and the Danes had no heks to further their grasp on the british isles. There were no actual Seidmennir to interpret the flight of the raven and so on and so forth.

So, you have to mix these two worlds. There has to be an actual hybridization of fantasy and history going on for this all to work. Last time (I think a month ago) when I posted my first chapter here for criticism, I got a few feedbacks saying that some of the vocabulary doesn't mean what I make it out to mean. Well, obviously, or not? Muggle historians after the Statute was in place would not be able to write the actual history of it all down. My use of "seidr" being effectively the witches of the Norse was frowned upon, for example.

And I wondered, without disregarding these feedbacks, how to mold those two sides, fantasy and history, together in a way that would fit. This, of course, is not just a problem with the history of Britain, but a general one once you begin writing anything before the Statute was in place (and even after that, you will often find yourself in tough spot of worldbuilding).

If anyone is interested, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBAaNj5RWAp0-85l1c6VzyjAUDrU8rLbjE7GcvFhfGU/edit?usp=sharing][this]] is the chapter I talked about. You don't have to read it to participate in this discussion, though. I think it is a general enough topic.


** I've often wondered the same thing, in regards to my story "Seasons of the Witch". On one hand, I wanted it to be as accurate as possible, yet on the other, I still wanted it to feel like an HP story.

The issue was, that I simply wasn't a historical expert. I could do research, sure, but wikipedia and google searches would only get you so far, and you'd get called out all day long by people who are actually from those countries, and know the language and history.

So, I decided to eschew the historical accuracy in favor of better storytelling.

There was a thread previously, with a similar topic, also with a story posted (it focused on Salazar and Godric, iirc). I see it done a lot in historical fiction, where the story is written in English, but the author always uses foreign words for nouns, usually in italics. Seidr is a good example, and its one I came across in my research as well, and I ultimately decided against using it myself.

The problem is, it's just jarring. It kind of breaks the immersion. What if the context for the word isn't good enough, and the reader can't figure out what the word is supposed to mean? It's not crucial for historical accuracy either, as I've found that whole practice to be kind of arbitrary, like just marking off a checkbox. The whole point of writing in English is to have a common medium to tell a story, so when you're using another culture's word for city, or witch, or army, or noble, it doesn't always come off smoothly. For the sake of storytelling, it's probably best to just keep it simple.

*** How would you go about the vocabulary used when there is a definite difference between the witches (and wizards) of the world? In my fic I work with different traditions behind every magical culture. There are Seidr and Völva, who are in the process of merging two viking traditions of magic, with "runemasters" and sorcerers on the other side who slowly but steadily exchange "feminine" magic and "masculine" magic. There are the celtic wicca and druids, the danish heks, we'll see germanic hexen and even some greek, persian and berber.

I took the path of using these names and translation of "witch" to emphasize the difference between their magical traditions. I'm not sure though. Would you exchange it all for "witch" and "wizard"?

** Ultimately this depends on how you treat the statute of secrecy.

Option 1: The statute merely made official what had been de facto the case already: that wizards did not typically involve themselves in Muggle affairs. When the statute was passed, little had to be done to create secrecy, because it was already the case that most Muggles did not interact with wizards.

Option 2: Prior to the statute, wizard and Muggle society was fully integrated with wizards involving themselves in society. When the statute was passed, wizards actively removed these elements from Muggle history and awareness.

If you choose option 1, then your history should be relatively accurate, because real history still largely holds. If option 2, then what we Muggles consider history is a highly edited version of events, with the wizards knowing the true history of the world. In this case, you have a lot more freedom to create your own version of history in your fanfic.

*** I myself did definitely go for the second option. So far that the insertion of Harry into the world leads to a war between "the heathen army" and Rome for superiority in Northern Europe.

So I would say that in this case you're along the same line as me. More fantasy, more freedom and let history be the flawed end-product of a global magical censorship campaign.

** No matter who you look at the Statute of Secracy, you should aim for as close to historical accuracy as you can manage unless you are explicitly changing something for the story, and even then, the changes you make should have some sensible historical basis.

In this scenario, there is a not-so-fine line between laziness and worldbuilding. I understand it's not possible to know absolutely everything about a prior era, but just because you're working in a quasi-fictional historical world doesn't mean you can substitute a a fictional history for period research.

The correct approach is to research the historical era, people, places and events surrounding the set and setting for your story, use it as a basis for the fictional world, and then implement specific and targeted changes to that history based on the fictional world you want to create.

This explanation sounds like it could have come about one of two ways.

1. You researched the historical terminology from the time period for the various cultures in the region (presumably Norse and Danes in Britain sometime around the 1000s CE) and made the intentional decision to change some of the vocabulary to fit the story better. Your critics, while potentially correct in their protestations, are making irrelevant points, as you've already made the conscious decision to change some things around.

2. You looked up a few Norse terms and decided to use those as they were the first ones you found and it sounded cool, and would be easiest to just go with it. People criticized your obvious ignorance about vocabulary and language about the time period (either correctly or incorrectly). You then justified your ignorance by rationalizing that everything pre-statute is fictional anyway, so who cares if you got some minor details wrong.

I'm not going to attempt to discern which of the above is closest to the truth, but I think I've made my point. You want to be closer to the first possibility than the second.

*** For my personal work I looked at the stuff on wikipedia, in the books I bought, or the documentaries I saw and filed them as "this is the stuff the muggles saw and documented". Its the outside perspective on magic, heavily influenced by myth and legend, and of course, doctrine.

For example, most of what we know of Vikings is what catholic monks wrote down. So you have the perspective of the victims of severe and unbelievably brutal raids (the blood-eagle is just one testament to that), and you already have to interpret this information with a bit of distance. What is factual, what is hyperbole?

Same with magic within the internal logic of the universe. What is simply hyperbole and muggle superstition and what do their reports give me to form and describe the practice of magic of different traditions of magic? In the end it won't be the same as reported.

** I can't remember who, but a successful fantasy author once said that making the world as realistic as possible was important for fantasy because it helped the reader believe in the world more. That it was easier for a reader to accept the fantastical when basic details of everyday life were believable.

I am no historian, but reading a Founders fic where basic things are off annoys me. Like there not being a language barrier. It's so easy to fix this issue with a few lines about a character casting a translation spell. Because it'd be a big problem if a person were to really go back a thousand years. Similarly, making gender dynamics the exact same as they are nowadays just makes the story feel inauthentic, even though I don't know exactly how men and women would have interacted back then. Bonus points go to stories that point out the lack of eating utensils back in the day, etc. I suppose it's mostly a personal thing, because stories I read that have the food and eating habits be the same as now don't bother me as much. So stories that read counter to what I'd expect to find back then annoy me, whereas someone with different expectations would be annoyed by different inaccuracies.

*** Realism (or, rather, Consistency) is not just about making it easier for the reader to accept the fantastical, but also about letting your reader understand the world and made predictions about it.

The reason (in my opinion) why the Sword of Truth books were unsatisfying was because 90% of the book didn't matter. The main character just pulled a new magical ability out of his ass to solve the book's problem in the last five minutes. Even worse, some of the solutions were contrary to the world! At no point does the reader get to feel clever because they figured it out. No, the reader just feels blindsided because the solution was "fuck it, magic, I guess?"

Contrast that with the Mistborn series where the capabilities and limitations of magic are fairly well known and the protagonist must use the pre-existing world to prevail, rather than just saying "I win" and then winning.

**** This.

You can write any ludicrous world, absolute insanity, as long as the solution at the end (as well as those during the book) are based on the same internal logic.

** My process:

- Decide on what magic can do for what cost/effort (i.e. figure out the laws of magic in your universe, at least vaguely)
- Extrapolate from that how new magic might be invented or found in nature.
- Look at the societies you are writing about, and their precursors and peoples they interacted with as far back as history goes, including of course their religion and myths.
- From that, figure out how the magics in those myths and legends fit into your universe's magic system.
- Extrapolate what magics might have been misunderstood, made taboo, had interesting sociopolitical effects, or been subject to rules of thumb that worked in most cases but would fail spectacularly in the right cases (which is a very convenient plot device, and fun for the reader if you only leave hints as to what went wrong).
- Then iterate back and forth between that step and the history-step, building up a narrative of how the magic shaped the actual history and vice versa.

But it's kind of intense and wall-of-text-notes-y, and that's coming from a person who will sit for an hour to type a wall of text. (this one only took five minutes or so).

** Hey you should read this too:

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-malfoy-family]]

"The Malfoy name comes from old French and translates as 'bad faith'. Like many other progenitors of noble English families, the wizard Armand Malfoy arrived in Britain with William the Conqueror as part of the invading Norman army. Having rendered unknown, shady (and almost certainly magical) services to King William I, Malfoy was given a prime piece of land in Wiltshire, seized from local landowners, upon which his descendants have lived for ten consecutive centuries."

Edit: Wow, I didn't realize she'd added a bunch of details on the major wizarding schools since I last looked. Awesome! The African one sounds pretty badass.
