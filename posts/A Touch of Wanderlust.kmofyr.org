Wanderlust: /A strong desire to travel./

I'm looking for any fics where the mc is Harry and he basically just lives out of like a suitcase. I want him to see great magical sights as well as just have this theme of freedom and adventure. You guys have anything like that?

** Wanderlust Fics

[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=araceil&sort=title][Against my nature]] by Araciel. Harry is transported to the past in an accident, and goes to hide in Africa becaus he is worried about messing up the timeline. There he meets Newt Scamander and joins him as he travels the world looking for magical creatures. Was deleted of FFNet but the link is to a place where you can download an EPub. Slash.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A_Second_Chance_at_Life][A second Chance at Life]] by Miranda Flairgold. When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic. FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3397283?view_full_work=true#main][Dragonheart Caravan]] by witch dragon. 5-year-old Harry Potter overhears his aunt complaining to his uncle about the "freaks" camping nearby. Maybe if they are the same type of "freak" he is they will want him? heartwarming. Hits the spot for wanderlust. AO3.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary on his first trip into Diagon Alley and finally sees someone he can look up to. Unfortunately, he's not quite right -- at least, not yet. Follow the unlikely duo across all seven continents as they embark upon a Grand Tour, finding knowledge, adventure, and maybe, just maybe, something like family. NOT a Tom x Harry story!
