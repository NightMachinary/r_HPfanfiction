I started reading a fic on ffnet like that, but I can't remember what it was called. It also seemed to be leading up to Harry/Ginny, and it had the eighth years living in Hogsmeade?

  Rocked by guilt from the Battle, surrounded by ghosts of the dead and drowning in the expectations of the Wizarding World, Harry vanishes one night from the Burrow and is not seen again for months. But don't worry. All is well.

** Maybe Yellow Submarine by Deadwoodpecker? Even if not, definitely recommended. This was the story that actually got me to give Harry/Ginny a serious chance

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.
