** Well, I missed my (purely internal) deadline for the next [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][Shadow of Angmar]] chapter. So that's bad, and I feel bad. On the other hand, I spent an evening cleansing my palate and posted a new chapter for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous][Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous]] last Friday.

*** I read that obscenely quickly after it was updated: a happy confluence of checking my email fo see if prod studio had replied yet about spec show and seeing the alert.

I was given the challenge to write a story in which Rose and Scorpius fall in love, and Hermione doesn't accept it and exacts revenge. The prompt was given to me as part of a "I Never" thread, because I would never. But I did. Sorry, JKR.

** Just released chapter 12 of linkffn(The Lesser Kindness), the HP/Witcher crossover I've been working on for the past 8 months or so, after a semi-lengthy hiatus of two months. While it's not the most faved, followed, or reviewed fic in its archive (not even close, in the case of reviews), I'm pretty proud of it.

I had been low on motivation to write after the last release in August, and had actually been contemplating leaving the FF scene behind to finally take a stab at original fiction, but taking some time away from the fic has sort of renewed my fervour for it, and so I ended up working on both projects concurrently. Where I only had one idea of where to go after the current 'arc' in August, I'm now spoiled for choice with 6 or 7 different paths I can go down.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an fascinating life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. Heavy AU.

*** I had that sort of issue. Before Star Trek Online was available on xbox 1, I was kinda saddened by the fact I had finished the outline for Trek to the Stars but then as i played, I realized I could hook in a few sequels as well as a number of side stories following tertiary characters.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11859282/9/Darkness-Ascendant-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]] Edit: Oh, also the most faved, followed, and reviewed in its niche as well but there's only two so that doesn't say much really.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10622535/9/A-Trek-to-the-Stars-The-Potter-Files]] Third most followed in its tiny niche, sixth or seventh most favorited. got my first "i'm quitting reading this because I don't like how you write this" review too(too much sex(which might be a valid point but it was also my last sex scene in the story for quite some time)). I loved this review though:

#+begin_quote
  This is a heavier read than Tolkien. There are some mile-long, rambling sentences that are nearly incomprehensible. This is the most frustrating story I've read in a long time. I feel like I'm having a stroke. I have no idea what's going on.
#+end_quote

He should go back to reading Dick and Jane.

I hope that reviewer sees this, so I can watch the inevitable fight.
