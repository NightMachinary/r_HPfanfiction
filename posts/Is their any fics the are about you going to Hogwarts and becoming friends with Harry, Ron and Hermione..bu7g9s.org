** Are you looking for a standard self insert (SI)fic, or something where the story addresses you the reader as a character?

Archive of Our Own has a reader/character tag which might help.

**** Linkffn(13041698) is the only SI I've dabbled with. But the SI isn't really friends with the trio, that's sort of the point.

But this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7mp4n1/a_collection_of_self_insert_fics/][link here]] should set you in good stead.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** Ha, you may enjoy mine! If you'd like to give it a go. :) Though I consider it very much OC, not self-insert.

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP.

â€‹

And along that vein, you would probably also enjoy this, though I am not sure if it will cover going to Hogwarts, but I think it may in some form or other. I suppose we'll see! It's hilarious.
