Can anyone recommend me fics that have some element of these two ideas?

Harry and Ron Bromance -e.g. talking about girls, talking about sex, generally being good friends.

Or

Ron/Hermione stories about pregnancy- discussing whether they want kids, trying to have kids, being in early stages of parenthood.

Tried to keep it quite vague, but if you can suggest anything along this vein then it would be welcome. Thank you!


** To address the first, here's one by [[https://adenei.tumblr.com/post/635155300728668160/okay-well-i-always-see-fics-where-the-girls][Adenei]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23655484][here's]] another one I wrote in the same general arena :)

For pregnancy/domestic bliss type stories, you can't go wrong with [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3999345/1/Burning-Down-the-House][Little0Bird]]. Also check out the domestic life tab in the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o67w6F3UbpZ6lcrTuLXA1WOxBTkIZ8tWUtQbw7ImfaA/edit][Romione spreadsheet]]. Hope that helps!
