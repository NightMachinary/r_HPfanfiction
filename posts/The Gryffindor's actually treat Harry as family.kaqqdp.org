I'd rather it be Gryffindor Harry then Slytherin Harry being treated well in Slytherin, just because I personally prefer Gryffindor Harry.

Maybe the Gryffindors help Harry out, maybe they tutuor him on stuff he needs help with, maybe certain Muggleborns or Half-Bloods see how Harry is dressed, and get him better clothes, etc. Maybe they don't believe the stuff coming out of the prophet, or just anything like that.

Anyone can be the main character/can be on any site/any length/old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc doesn't have to focus on pairings.

NO! Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche/no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.


** Please. Maybe even throw in hufflepuff being nice and loyal as well.

***** Fair enough, but when a person asks for recommendations for a certain plot, that's what they're wanting. But thank you for the first one.

  "While you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts," said McGonagall. Following the 1991-92 school year, the Gryffindors decide to make good on that promise.
