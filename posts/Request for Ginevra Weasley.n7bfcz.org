Hello! I'm looking for stories that might make me -at least- like Ginevra Weasley. I usually avoid reading pov ginny or when she is the main romantic interest. And I recently realized that I might, maybe, missing a lot. Soo I appreciate it if it's pov ginny, she doesn't have to paired with harry, or there doesn't have to be romance at all!

My first language isn't English and I'm not very good at it yet so please ignore the mistakes. Thanks!

It also has sequels by the same author called the Armistice series.

*** Eh, it has its strong points, but it's a fairly /unhappy/ Ginny. YMMV.

** I don't remember the title or the author but there was a Ginny-centric story I really liked, maybe one of the other know it? It's basically a travelogue in which Ginny runs away and travels around the world. Starting in France where she earned some money as a street-magican. At some point she get the idea of a Rainbow-family? Well I can't say I like the typical fanon-Ginny in the stories I normally read but this was alright üòâ

** First, I would suggest [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][my comments on how poorly is Ginny written in the books]], and then perhaps some good Hinny stories:

- stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] (start with ‚ÄúTales of the Battle‚Äù and then go on)

- stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter, which is the main story)

- ‚ÄúInner Demons‚Äù by serendipity_50 linkao3(601124)

- [[https://www.siye.co.uk]]

The truth is that a lot of Ginny needs to be written by the fanfiction authors, because how poorly JKR wrote her, so it is difficult to say that you have some opinion on Hinny in books, because there are many different Ginnies by different authors (for what I know, even Ginny in linkffn(5141159) could be canonical).

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** Brennus has several stories that star Ginny (paired with Harry) and all of them make her a more interesting character, even while remaining fairly close to canon. I'd probably recommend Gothic first and foremost, as it is separate from canon & pretty interesting.

** It's been a while since I read linkffn(Seeking Ginny), but I seem to recall it at least did a decent job of developing her character, which is arguably what her canon depiction really lacked.
