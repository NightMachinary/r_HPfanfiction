Magic in Harry Potter is incredibly annoying. Stupefy, expelliarmus, avada kedavra, almost all the spells in Harry Potter require the caster to just say a few words and point their wand. I'm looking for any fics where instead of that, Harry uses different kinds of magic. Fics where he uses rituals to get ahead, uses voodoo to take out his enemies, stuff like that. Really any fic where the magic Harry uses isn't the magic that canon uses.

#+begin_quote
  Fourth and last in the Black Queen series. Jen has just months in which to kill her destined foe, but after defeating the Turk, she is sure she now has a chance to succeed. Unfortunately, Voldemort spent his year's sabbatical uncovering secrets that she would have preferred him never learn. Secrets that could now prove deadly for everyone.

  Second in the Black Queen series. Last year, Jen had to contend with a deadly Tournament, a revived Dark Lord, a meddlesome Headmaster, and worst of all, reconciliation attempts by her parents. Surely her OWL year can't be anywhere near as complicated. Can it? NOT for children!

  Third in the Black Queen series. Jen chose to embrace the darker aspects of the world long ago, and she has never once regretted it. However, serving Baron Samedi creates its own problems. A new enemy is on the prowl, and now she needs to eliminate him... before he can do the same to her. Jen/Luna; as always, not for children

Divination, parsletonge, Metamorphmagic, and house elf magic are much more integrated in the story.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
