Ever since I started reading HP or HP crossover fanfics I noticed that Twilight is the series that have the most number of fanfics. So I'm just wondering why that is.


** I believe it's just because they are both very popular and have a very large active fan base, they were also aimed at a very similarly aged audience, that's also why there is a lot of fics and crossovers with Percy Jackson or Naruto as well.

** It was partly a chronology thing. HBP and the first Twlight book both came out in 2005, and DH came out in 2007, the same year that the third Twlight book came out, so loads of HP fic writers started writing Twilight because the HP series was over, but Twilight was in its ascendancy. Plus, both fandoms had vampires and werewolves, so crossing the worlds was easy.
