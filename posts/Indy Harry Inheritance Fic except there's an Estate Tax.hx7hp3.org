I think it would be really fun to read a fic where it starts out like all those fics with an Inheritance test, and Harry is starting to plan his tyranny over his serfs and then...the Goblins start applying the estate tax, and some banking fees.

He still leaves rather wealthy, but Indy! Harry feels wronged and tries to bring feudalism to the Wizarding World whilst maybe Hermione or Ron is leading the Socialist movement?


** The purebloods would never allow an estate tax.

*** I know. The premise is Indy! Harry thinks he;s in a "Pureblood Politics" fic only he's in a more equitable society. It's funny because he'd hate it

** That would be amusing. Harry goes all money hungry & Hermione goes Socialist.

I think there was once a fic where Harry "accepts" an inheritance/lordship and it turns out to be a shitty falling down castle in a swamp that every Potter before him had been too smart to claim cause they knew it would end up costing more money than it was worth.

** No government controlled by rich people with old money would allow said old money to be taxed significantly, hell you can see this is the truth because /it happens./

Inheritance taxes tend to vary country to country(or state by state in some) depending on where did that money came from to the people that run the show.

*** the govt being controlled by old families is pure fanon. Yeah, Lucius bribes the minister but that's more run of the mill corruption that shows up ine every form of government. Nothing of canon suggests an oligarchy.

**** If anything The ministry, which is shown to have most of the power in the books, is very bureaucratic or technocratic, with a democratically elected Minister. (who is held accountable by votes of confidence as shown in HBP)

**** Yep. Also, I'm 99% sure the only mention of "lords" or "nobility" is the Black family & LV. The whole "pureblood society lords and lady" thing is pure fanon based off their being a book of old pureblood wizards.

***** I am not talking about nobility I am talking about money, Malfoy controls Fudge, and there's evidence that these families always had their way(Sirius said his grandfather practically /bought/ an Order of Merlin /First Class.)/

**** Malfoy pulled Fudge's strings, Sirius said his grandfather practically /bought/ an Order of Merlin /first class./

The Wizengamot seems to be corrupt and open to pureblood prejudices for a long time, many of the darker purebloods seem to be from old rich families.

I am not talking about fanon "Lordship" I am talking about the real world situation of rich people manipulating the government to get richer. They don't control the Ministry directly, they lobby and bribe and do all the stuff we see happen today.

Almost every government today is an oligarchy, it's just cloaked in democracy.
