Hello Everyone!

So, around 6 months ago I made a HP fanfic list. Well, I might have gotten distracted by other fandoms along the way and making more lists, so this one took a while to put together. However! I finally got it and I hope you all enjoy it.

Also, someone made a comment about wishing to know the length and if it was abandoned or not. So, along with the summary I put not only the amount of words, but also when it was last updated to my knowledge. Which means, some of them might have new chapters, some might not. I also included if they were a crossover and if so with that fandom!

Once again I hope you all enjoy! If you want other fic lists I have more post for those as well so check em out!!

startabby

Summary:

In the canon Harry Potter universe, Sirius and Walburga Black's mutual hatred is the stuff of legends. But, what if that hatred wasn't real? What if, instead, it was secretly one massive prank?

Behind closed doors, House Black is strong and united.

Harry Potter would know; after all, he's secretly been raised as the Blacks' pride and joy. But, shhh, you can't tell anyone that.

Much of this story was originally written for April 2018's Rough Trade Challenge: 'Call it Magic', though it has seen some editing since then.

*Taking Charge*

A_Perverted_Romance_Addict

Summary:

Cedric's death marked Harry. It made him think. Really think. About life. About death. What it means to live and what is important in life. His priorities change. His perception of the world and people within it changes.

As he evaluates his life until now, he comes to the realisation that his life has never been his own and that he was never truly alive. Determined to change that, he makes a decision; he is going to take his life into his own hands. He is going to be the only one in charge of himself and his happiness. Because he wanted and deserved to be happy. He wanted and deserved to live without people meddling and trying to control him, without trying to hurt him.

He was aware people would be confused. They will have questions. Some will support him, some will absolutely resent him. He still wasn't sure who will fall into which category, but he honestly didn't give a damn about it, because almost nobody seemed to give a damn about him either.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18760663?view_full_work=true#main]]

*The Magnum Opus*

NeverBeyondRedemption

Summary:

Gringotts and Hogwarts have failed to hide it, so as a last resort Dumbledore turns to the only other place that can rival them. Nurmengard, warded by two of the brightest wizards of all time and almost faded from memory. But hiding it from one Dark Lord puts it within easy reach of another and it might just be the missing piece that lets him escape.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18119081?view_full_work=true]]

*The Pretender*

NeverBeyondRedemption

Summary:

Hermione was by no means an expert in Dark Magic, what she needed was someone who was. Gellert Grindelwald, one of the most powerful dark wizards of all time, was certainly no fan of this 'Voldemort'. Maybe they could reach an agreement.

*Completed: 2019-07-28 Words: 71,906*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18118676?view_full_work=true#main]]

*The Devil You Know*

SilchasRuin

Summary:

All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better.

It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162?view_full_work=true#main]]

*The Journal*

bellachrome, PurpleMango

Summary:

Harry Potter felt like two different people on even the best of days. Life was a series of duties, of appointments to fill, of masks to put on. There were four different masks he was wearing, and personally he thought it worse than when he had been at war.

Then he comes across the battered journal of Abraxas Malfoy...

He always knew that his 'saving-people thing' would get him into trouble

*Hermione Granger, Demonologist*

By: BrilliantLady

Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot.

*Reformed, Returned and Really Trying*

By: Starfox5

AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

*Light's Dawn*

Shadowblayze

Summary:

Medivh faced the nearly complete summoning circle and mulled over his options. He was not surprised when he felt the disturbance in the Twisting Nether just beyond his fingertips- not when he knew to look for it- but to meddle or not to meddle?

*Updated: 2016-08-12 Words: 86,268*

*HP/World of Warcraft X-Over

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7503465?view_full_work=true#main]]

*Triumphant, the Dreamer*

Shadowblayze

Summary:

Heather's not exactly sure how she got here, but if these people thought that they would be able to manipulate her little brother without a her raising hell about it, they were about to be unpleasantly surprised.

*Updated: 2017-10-26 Words: 206,934*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10051634?view_full_work=true#main]]

*Curses of Interest*

InsanityUnleashed

Laurel Potter made a mistake and poked something better left alone. A mad escape flung her into a far off reality, into the lap of Naruto Uzumaki, Hokage-to-be. Now in between deciphering the runework keeping her trapped, she has to train Naruto, avoid the ANBU trying to figure her out, and find a way to stamp out every source of sabotage aimed at her new charge.

*HP/Naruto X-over

*Updated: 2017-09-27 Words: 111,163*

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10603038?view_full_work=true#main]]

*But I Don't Want to Be a Hero!*

shigeka

Summary:

Ibuki Ryouka behaved unlike the usual children would behave. She was quiet and expressionless, composed and mature, and she possessed knowledge that far greater than what she should have known at her age. Why, you ask? For she was the 27th reincarnation of the great hero once known as Harry Potter!

* HP/ BNHA (Boku No Hero Academia (My Hero Academia))

*Updated: 2019-01-06 Words: 44,202*

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter.

  The magical world isn't as ignorant of muggles as it seems, and Lucius Malfoy has an idea on how to get Harry out of his way. Now Harry is in Japan and trapped in a virtual world of swords. Cut off from his friends and allies, and what he knew, he has to make new ones and get used to an illusory world that has become all too real. Welcome, to SAO Harry. Do try to survive.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Cedric's death marked Harry. It made him think. Really think. About life. About death. What it means to live and what is important in life. His priorities change. His perception of the world and people within it changes.As he evaluates his life until now, he comes to the realisation that his life has never been his own and that he was never truly alive. Determined to change that, he makes a decision; he is going to take his life into his own hands. He is going to be the only one in charge of himself and his happiness. Because he wanted and deserved to be happy. He wanted and deserved to live without people meddling and trying to control him, without trying to hurt him. He was aware people would be confused. They will have questions. Some will support him, some will absolutely resent him. He still wasn't sure who will fall into which category, but he honestly didn't give a damn about it, because almost nobody seemed to give a damn about him either.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy.

  Laurel Potter made a mistake and poked something better left alone. A mad escape flung her into a far off reality, into the lap of Naruto Uzumaki, Hokage-to-be. Now in between deciphering the runework keeping her trapped, she has to train Naruto, avoid the ANBU trying to figure her out, and find a way to stamp out every source of sabotage aimed at her new charge.

  Ibuki Ryouka behaved unlike the usual children would behave. She was quiet and expressionless, composed and mature, and she possessed knowledge that far greater than what she should have known at her age. Why, you ask? For she was the 27th reincarnation of the great hero once known as Harry Potter!

  fem!Harry getting together with Voldemort/Other Edge Lord.
#+end_quote

Theres around 37 fics here and i believe only about 10 of them are fem!harry at all. Then the edge lord thing? Sorry, dont know what your talking about. All of tese fics are pretty decent so.

This is a list of fics that I thought were good enough to share. I put fics in a list if i liked them enough and put them on here for pther people to enjoy too.

If you dont like these fics, dont say something like that. It's rude because some people enjoy that. Instead tell me kind of fics you do like so i can keep an eye out.

If you dont have any nice or helpful or recs or requests then please dont comment with a comment that could possibly offend other people.

** Hello, I'm looking for a copy of Tears falling into darkness by Evil Minded as the autor took it from several sites. Do you happen to know where I could find it?

It date from around 2010, it was a story of a really abused Harry who when he arrived at Hogwart got to live with Snape. It was a really long story but incompleted.

Thanks for your help

I am sorry to say that I dont think I have read this fic but I have tried to find it for you but I had no such luck. You could try making your own post and see if someone else might have an idea of where to look or if they have it?

I'm sorry I couldn't be of much help :(
