Edit: I legit started drafting out a plan for the beginning a few hours ago. Nothing is set in stone and if something doesn't work and you point it out I will change it. This also means the smaller bits and pieces haven't been worked out yet.

Edit 2: this is just a basic overview of a few points. I didn't wanna make the post too long.

So I'm kinda obsessed with the time/dimension travel fics of this fandom and want to throw my own into the fold. However, I'm aware that because this is such a popular trope that there are also very popular opinions about where previous fics have gone wrong.

Like OP Harry. Mary Stu character types. Just because they've gone back a couple of years they're suddenly flawless gods. Yah know.

My own story is going to have the fiendfyre room of requirement scene as the place that Hermione, Draco and Harry get sent back from, into fourth year as different people. Ring a bell? I recently read the dimension travel fic c'est la vie linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224]]) which is kinda both famous and infamous I've found. I enjoyed it but I can see why people get frustrated.

The difference will be that mine won't have any changes to the universe and everything will have gone exactly as it had done for the first three years of Hogwarts, but this odd trio take up new identities and their past selves still exist.

I'm defineilty not gonna have them OP. Just the same skill they had when they left their original timeline. E.g. of course Harry will be a bit of a defence progidy but just smart in the other subjects. He's missed a lot of education anyhow.

What are some other tropes I should avoid? This is my first Harry potter fic, I want to make it count.

Tl:dr Hermione, Draco and Harry go back in time to 4th year as different people. What tropes and common faults should I avoid?

#+end_quote

Canon rehash. Short of author fiat, there's no rational reason for them (especially Hermione and Harry who already experienced subjectively changing the timeline) to try to keep the timeline intact.

Instant friendship. You're putting together three people who were about to kill each other and their attitudes ought to reflect that.

Dumbledore. If you choose to do good!Dumbledore, fic's over in 20k words and Harry's involvement begins and ends with telling him babymort and the horcruxes are. Fourth year is both the best and worst starting point for a time travel fic, because you can do anything super easily, and that takes all the tension out of the fic. You might wanna think up how to deal with this.

PTSD. You're making three young adults coming straight out of a year of civil war in which they've fought and been tortured go back to their (relatively) carefree schooling years. They're gonna be noticeably different and have troubles reintegrating to a peaceful environment.

I was thinking perhaps them not having a feasible access to a means of destroying the horcurxes. This Harry is in a new body with no Voldemort soul and thus no parseltongue. The basilisk is a no go. Godrics sword isn't exactly easy to acquire and since I'm coming from the fiendfyre scene and setting it up as if they would have died I'm gonna have them avoid it like the plague. I've got an idea or two for the solution but it won't be taken up straight away. I'm also having the looming death of Cedric hanging there as a sort of "we need to fix this before it's too late" to hopefully add some tension there.

It's gonna be a hell of an angsty fic. But yeah, I totally agree and this is something I need to put more thought into the intracacies of how this would effect their day to day. Also gonna research, I don't want to present people with a half arsed portrayal. I've also given them some back story for their personas for convenience sake so their behaviour doesn't immediately draw up confused red flags for the other characters but instead can be explained.

Godric's sword is in a display case in Dumbledore's office and it's not like fiendfyre must be cast by or in front of Harry & co.

Capturing and interrogating Crouch basically equate to captive Voldemort, so there's no real time costraint involved.

Notice that I titled the paragraph "Dumbledore", not "easy mode". The whole point of 4th year being easy is the availability of a fully empowered and informed Dumbledore. So long as he's involved, gg Voldy within a week and gg horcruxes within a month. Pretty inescapable really, and you didn't address this in your comment. If you want my suggestion, focus on why he /wouldn't/ be involved. Like for example Harry not trusting him anymore after the "you've been raising him like a pig for slaughter" bit.

***** Harry not trusting Dumbledore has been used so much, though, especially for this reason. Sure, it's been so used cause it makes sense, but even now the first thing that comes to me is that I already know where this is going.\\
Not that it's the case, mind you, but it certainly feels like it.\\
So I'd like to suggest something else.\\
Why not have Draco running straight to Voldemort. He explains everything, naively thinking Voldemort will reward him, instead Voldemort puts pressure on him, begins using him more and more while not giving him any respect (kinda like he did in canon) and sets him up in the road of redemption (that if you want a good Draco, otherwise just make him a regular, if named, Death Eater).\\
Of course, when Dumbledore & Co go fetch the Horcruxes, everything's already long gone and they find only traps.\\
This would steer you away from Canon rehash.

Also, if Harry and Hermione are coming back in time, you have to decide what to do with Ron. Cause their relationship just can't stay the same after something like that.

****** I'd just like to point out that regardless of redemption, Draco feels very unlikely to appreciate Voldemort's rule by that point. In the end, his life as a death eater consist in being an unremarkable peon for a monster who will happily torture him and his family at a whim. He's not respected anymore, he's not safe, he's not rewarded with anything but belittlement and crucios in case of failure. It doesn't really make sense for anyone who isn't a sadist sensu stricto or forced to loyalty by the dark mark to actually want snake boy to come back. Especially not someone who's already at the top of the food chain with nothing to gain and everything to lose.

******* You do have a point, but I wouldn't be as sure as you are.\\
Draco is young, he finds himself in a strange situation where he's alone, he likely needs stability to get back to his feet. It's not terribly unusual to go back to what you know when you experience a setback, even when what you know is sub-par.\\
Don't forget, either, that Draco's parents stand with Voldemort, as well as all his friends and likely most of the people who follow the same ideology as him.\\
In this scenario, Draco needs another nudge, he needs to realise he's getting inconvenient.\\
That way, Draco doesn't switch sides because of a case of conscience or because he grew out of his ideology, but because he doesn't have the choice and there is no one else. And the Order accepts him because they can't afford to turn down any willing Wand.\\
They are allied because of circumstances and everybody can keep hating each other but they have to work together to face a more powerful enemy.

That ought to be a given rather than a temptation imo, the whole concept of information advantage in this context refers to all they've learned about things that have happened already in both timelines (horcruxes, where Voldy is, what he's doing /now/), not to what they expect to happen (what Voldy /will/ do). Their very arrival inherently breaks the causal chain, and they certainly can't predict in any way the consequences of their actions.

However I'd suggest that rather than have back up plans they just have an exit strategy. Most of the time, back up plans feel just so /convenient/, that the main plan was foiled in just the right way so that the back up would still work..

Once Voldy slips away, you have carte blanche once more, instead of being chained to the canon plot. Hell if you're feeling bold (and the arrival timing is early enough) you could very well avoid the gof plot entirely. Well the Voldy bit anyway, the tournament must have been in talks for at least months and more likely years before actually happening.

Done and saved! Or Stun him in the maze, with Hermione under the invisibility cloak because why would they follow the rules of the tournament? That's an artificial limiter.

Yes sorry but unless your fanfic has the whole "Fate wants things to happen the same way" thing going on, then it's not a tension builder at all because it's as simple as Stun him and hide him in a closet and it's avoided.

** *Ron Weasley* - you only have Hermione and Harry (and Draco) going back, without Ron. While I hope that you have Harry and Hermione continue being Ron's friend and eventually (or immediately) tell him the truth, I suspect that you don't like Ron and that there isn't going to be a Golden Trio in your fic. That's fine, obviously.

But don't flanderize his negative traits. Yes, Ron is insecure and jealous, but he's more than that. If you're planning to have Hermione and Harry break away from him, make it gradual and believable. After all, they forgave him and mended their friendship after he abandoned them in the Forest of Dean, so they still love their best friend when they went back in time; to have them suddenly hate him wouldn't make any sense.

Actually, *no bashing* in general. Shape is unlike able enough already, don't make him a blithering idiot with a trigger temper. Molly is overbearing and controlling but genuinely loves Harry. Ginny has a girlhood crush but she's not a love-potion fanatic who hates Harry having a girlfriend who isn't her. Etc.

*Dumbledore* - he's difficult to do in any fic, but time travel fics are even harder. If Harry still trusts Dumbledore, then the horcruxes and Voldemort are destroyed by Christmas. Which could work - the remaining Death Eaters could cause enough trouble to take up a lot of time, and help keep you from writing the Stations of Canon. If Harry doesn't trust Dumbledore, please please please don't make him angry look-how-smart-I-am-Harry who can argue circles around Dumbledore. The man is brilliant, and has been an international politician for over 50 years. If Dumbledore is straight up evil, don't fall into the trope of evil=stupid, because again, Dumbledore is brilliant and experienced. He's crafted his benevolent Dumbledore persona for decades and Harry/Hermione/Draco aren't going to crack it in a few chapters, no matter how many of his plans go awry.

*Amelia Bones* - a lot of writers use Amelia Bones (and other side characters like Andromeda Tonks) to circumvent Dumbledore, and they do it poorly. These side characters are always raring to go take Dumbledore down and never believes his “bullshit” and have enough political clout to act against him. The man single-handedly ended a war and has been the leading figure in international politics for decades. His Order of the Phoenix was an effective force against Voldemort in the 70s. People listen to him and respect him so much because he's effective and, again, brilliant. If you use Amelia or another side character to circumvent him, make Harry work to get them to believe him, let Dumbledore really convince them he's right a few times.

With Harry being back from the future, it isn't clear at all that the prophecy is still on. Maybe it was a freak occurrence outside of reach of fate, and Dumbledore has no way to know.

** Is the story going to be time travel or dimension travel because isn't it established in PoA that if you go back in time you already went back in time so whatever you would do already happened meaning you can't change anything?

What exactly do you mean as different people? Like as new OC characters or like they're sorta possessing/stealing classmates bodies? If they're sent back in different bodies does that mean there's a younger them running around?

I'm not sure how I feel about the time travel point. 4th year has the extreme potential to be “easy mode” if harry just tells Dumbledore where all the horcruxes are. Harry mistrusting Dumbledore is an overplayed trope imo because sure Harry might've been mad at him for not giving up all the info but he has no reason not to trust dumbledore, maybe if he had heard the Harry needs to die speel but he didn't hear that yet.

A possible way around the “easy mode” is that if they went to another dimension maybe the horcruxes are the same. This Voldemort hid his horcruxes in different places or picked different objects. That way their knowledge is immensely helpful for the war effort but that doesn't mean it will become easy. I'm just speculating tho.

Please no instant friendship between the 3 of them cuz unless you're planning to mess with canon then they've been trying to kill each other for the last year with 6 years of mutual hatred. That will take time to overcome.

So I'm currently trying to think up a way of them finding out and having some kind of reason to not immediately go to him. An obstacle. Perhaps Hermione will take more strongly to the notion.

Definitely not. They've got a whole backlog of issues. The way I was gonna set it up is that they're the only three people in the entire world that know the truth of things. Harry and Hermione can't just let Draco wander about because what if he tips off Voldemort? But they don't want to trust him with any planning because of the same reason. Meanwhile Draco doesn't have anything here, no name, no family. I was thinking of making him a muggleborn as well to really drive that in. It's a working with the enemy sort of scenario. Plus they'll probably be bitter because it could have been Ron yet this git is here.

This has to happen otherwise your mixing two completely different time travel theories. Either everything that has happened has to happen and nothing they can do can change that, or by their very existence in the past changes how the future will play out. The only real advantage they should have is knowledge of what the Horcrux are as even the location can be explained away by virtue of them just being in the past and things changing.

** My advice would be very different. I think the first mistake you are making is taking exactly the characters to do the time travel, that everyone has read two billion fics about. Leave out Harry and Hermione. Take Ron and Luna or Neville and Cho or Susan and Goyle or Marietta and Flint instead and then do your thing. This is a thousand times more interesting if something we already know is approached by someone we do not know that well. There are thousand stories about time travel that are about Harry or Hermione, but leave out Ron. This is exactly what not to do, if you want to write something original or good.

  What tropes and common faults should I avoid?
#+end_quote

I would say including Malfoy would be the number 1 thing to avoid, especially since he ought to rot in prison for war crimes, like attacking civilians and hiding between them.

But given that you seem to be set on this course, against which I would advise once more, you need to have something believable why he went from happily supporting genocide as long as he didn't have to get his hands dirty, to wishing for a rewrite. Then you would need to find some plausible explanation to why Harry and Hermione would trust him after all the shit he pulled, like leading Death Eater into a school full of children and nearly killing two of Harry's friends. I am also pretty sure that the mere mention of "Malfoy" would trigger PTSD for Hermione after what she went through at MALFOY Manor.

So once you have overcome these rather significant hurdles, think about how the trio would go to change the past. The easiest way would be to simply kill a whole bunch of people, namely every Death Eater and everyone who helped the Ministry carry out its magical Holocaust. And "But they haven't done anything wrong yet" excuse does not work. Umbridge happily tortured children. All Death Eaters are guilty of multiple war crimes by virtue of being a Death Eater. Given their nature as illegal combatants (no insigniae, hiding behind civilians, attacking them), any side in WWII would have summarily executed them, including the Allies.

#+begin_quote
  Just the same skill they had when they left their original timeline.
#+end_quote

They are literally adults competing against teenagers. And given that they were top students before the time shift, it would be surprising if they were just barely better. Canon Hermione could cast NEWT level spells in her 5th year. And that was before the second war.

  He's missed a lot of education anyhow.

Most of the Hogwarts curriculum is barely relevant in combat either way. Stuff like Herbology or Potions (unless you build magical gas grenades or something similar). And the relevant part was never an issue for Harry, especially given that he won a civil war.

I'm having him along not because he necessarily was wishing for a rewrite but rather for an out. The way I saw Malfoy was as someone who was stuck in the thick of things and didn't know what to do. He wasn't so devoted to Voldemort that he'd kill Dumbledore. Pretty sure he knew he'd be killed if Dumbledore didn't die or that he would face some kind of consequence. Anyway, just someone who is in the middle of something ugly and needs to escape. Not saying that he didn't believe in the ideals of Voldemort, he grew up with them after all. And the he's in the past under a different persona and the only two other people in the world of have an inkling of an understanding are the enemy. He's not going to want to help them but he's there. He's lost. He's got a lot of thinking to do.

#+begin_quote
  Then you would need to find some plausible explanation to why Harry and Hermione would trust him after all the shit he pulled
#+end_quote

They won't, at least not at the beginning. I didn't pick this dynamic for an idealist friendship but rather for the difficulties. They can't just let him go because what if he finds Voldemort and tells him? But they also can't trust him because again... what if he finds Voldemort and tells him. But Malfoy can be useful. The nuances of this I have yet to fully figure out considering I've been planning this fic for like a couple of hours.

#+begin_quote
  I am also pretty sure that the mere mention of "Malfoy" would trigger PTSD for Hermione after what she went through at MALFOY Manor.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure I would go that far. The place yes, Bellatrix yes. The name will hold those connotations but I don't think it would have debilitating consequences through mention. I'm talking from my own experience here with having places poisoned. I'm gonna give it the made up name of "Umberton" cause I don't wanna like release where I live. Anyways, went through a trauma in a place called "Umberton Ville". I live in the town "Umberton" and hear it somewhat frequently. It's more the specific area that fucks with me rather than the mention of a related name.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I had a scene in my head where one of them mentioned that they should play it down or that they would be progidies. Then Harry being like "sure, you would Hermione, you already were" and then noting that he never really had that much of a passion of herbology and he hasn't exactly been revising potions while hunting for horcruxes. People forget things. I'm just a year out of high school and I've forgotten most of my biology knowledge and I got an A in that subject. Defence hell yeah though.

I was more so reffering to the academic side of things with this. I've read fics where people have had Harry come back and just set records for exams and what not. His combat will be pretty bloody good and one of the opening scenes involves a duel to showcase this. Same for the other two.

Hermione didn't bat an eye after she led Umbridge into a gangrape by centaurs. She had no issues permanently disfiguring Marietta either. She brewed an illegal Potion which required stolen ingredients at age 13. Hermione has a firm set of morals, but who crosses them gets no mercy.

And I am 110% sure that Magical Nazis and those who carried out a magical Holocaust (Nürnberg laws, hunting squads, concentration camps with inhumane standards, random executions) against people LIKE HER would get no quarter from her. And it would be ridiculously easy for her to make Harry follow along through emotional blackmail (Do you want to make Teddy an orphan again? We have the power to stop that, or do you want to watch Sirius die again?).

Then let me tell you from personal experience that I dislike and mistrust anyone named Sascha by default due to something which happened almost a decade ago. There are people with combat PTSD who can play Battlefield but get triggered by a car engine. Traumas are not universal, and given that Hermione went through a torture session with Britain's most sadistic person, who went all out on her, I lean towards a strong reaction for her.

Malfoy got exactly what he asked for. Any negative consequences are the results of his own wishes, his wet dreams of Muggleborn genocide. Again, he should rot in prison for war crimes, or even be outright executed, not be in a position where he can plot time travel.

This gotta be the most insane piece of fanon to have become widely believed by the fandom. The woman gets kidnapped and held prisoner for a while. Afterwards she's traumatized and scared shitless of her kidnappers.

That in itself is a common enough reaction for kidnapping victims that suffered no injury or violence whatsoever. Umbridge most likely got humiliated, at worst tortured in some way. Rape is at no point hinted at, and quite frankly it's hard to imagine other humans wanting to fuck Umbridge, nevermind beings further disincentivized from it by virtue of being a whole other species.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

Defence is basically Charms + Curses + Counter-curses + Dark Creatures. It isn't a core branch of magic like Transfiguration or Charms. So, having HP as a prodigy in Defence but kinda meh in Charms doesn't make sense.

Other than what other people have said, you need to ensure there is conflict and a source for the characters to be challenged. If everything is the same as before, there is none of that, and the reader knows what to expect - which makes the fic boring. Keep the reader guessing.

Well he wouldn't be anyway, given his actual grades. Knowledge that requires revision though I would expect to be somewhat lacking though. I imagine it'd be up and down like "yeah I remember this, I can do that" one lesson and then another lesson being a lil' less sure. I'm just drawing from my experience, I've graduated with an A in biology but if someone gave me a test now a year on I reckon I'd get a C, maybe a B if I'm lucky.

You'd be surprised at how easy it is when you're revising. A lot of people on DLP shake their heads when they see HP performing better in class after a summer of revisions, but I can safely say that these people have never actually tried it in real life. I've a Masters in Engineering, and I was able to revise 4 years worth of engineering stuff in less than 6 months. It works, because you're not learning new stuff - you're just revisiting those concepts you already went through.

I'm not familiar with the British system, but if you were to put an A grade for scores between 50-75 percent, an E grade for scores between 75 and 89 percent, and O for 90+, that's a pretty meh aggregate you're looking at. Overall, around the 80 percent mark, which for an examination written by 15 year olds, is pretty mediocre. A good score would be between 85-90, a great one would be 90-95, and 95+ would be an extraordinary score.

He also flunks two exams. History and Divination. At 15, that's terrible, no matter which way you look at it. People say that Divination is unpredictable and whatnot, but it is an elective, something he chose to study and flunked anyway. He could have chosen something else.

Typo there. He's no prodigy, he's average. Heck, even that is stretching it. In my country, getting low 80s for the exams that you write when you've finished 10 years of public schooling (at age 15, that is) is quite shameful.

Also you can't compare grades across countries, it just don't work my G. The differences in examining boards, style of questions, criteria, length and intensity of education etc. Are different and all factor in. I hear in America you can add to your grades through additional points? Extra credit was it? In Britain it's all exam/course work depending on the qualification. Regardless of whether or not credit is a thing, the way we get grades are different too.

It's not grade 9= 95. Its the top 2 percent of students who scored the highest across the country that get grade 9. E.g. if your generation is generally quite dumb but you're average, you'll get a higher grade than you would expect to if the average person your age was pretty intelligent. The graph looks a bit like a bell and C always has the highest percentage of grades allotted.

Anyways, that was kinda off topic. You just managed to tick two things that irk me. Personally I believe in descriptivism when it comes to language.

** Your premise is shit, Harry knows where all the Horcruxes are at this point and giving this info to Dumbledore is an easy solution. I'm also unsure why you want those three, or how you're figuring those three get caught in whatever magic causes the incident. Harry has one broom, Hermione and Ron the other. Harry picks up Malfoy, the others Goyle.

I have to wonder what story you actually want to tell based on this premise. I think there is a lot of room for a good Draco time travel redemption story. I think there is a lot of room for Harry and Malfoy stuck in the past working together to prevent what happened. I can only assume you're sticking Hermione in with them, and excluding Ron, because you want them to fuck. Which is bad.

**** It is constructive, just because you don't like what I said doesn't mean otherwise. In any time travel scenario involving Harry the first action is to contact Dumbledore, any other response is contrived. That is the simple fact that makes 99% of such stories shit from the very beginning. You want to 'do a time travel fic Right', which means acknowledging this fact. You can try to dance around it, but without ludicrous mental gymnastics it remains the same.

I was going to suggest, in my original comment, that you're simply not traveling far enough. Harry and co should just emerge from the Room of Requirement in 1968. That gets around the also hard to understand body swapping you'd proposed, and it makes contacting Dumbledore the right choice, but also not an instant win condition. The locket, the cup, and the diary were certainly not in place until the '70s. So Dumbledore and Harry can collect the diadem and the ring. They can work together to stop Voldemort before the first war begins. You could write a genuine time travel story using your basic premise without the flaws of time travel stories.

This is why I asked what story you want to tell. If it's just about those characters being stuck in the past and forced to work together than this is the idea you should write. If you want to write something else, which from the premise you stated is setting up used and abused cliche about manipulated Dumbledore, or the common and horrible Drarry/Dramione, than taking my time to respond to this thread is a complete waste.

Or dump them in ~1970, perfect setting for murder, mayhem and anarchy. For example, using "accidental magic" to push pre hogwarts snape under the lorry. Applying teaching job in hogwarts and trying to teach marauders while others are happily murdering voldemorts followers and hunting horcruxes etc.
