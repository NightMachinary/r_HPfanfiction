:END:
I think Daphne Greengrass is outside the hospital wing, and she casts the listening charm. Madam Bones is in the room, and she is shocked but is taking notes of his abuse and sets the ball rolling to help Harry. I think Harry ends up going to live with the Bones'. Cant remember much else.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
