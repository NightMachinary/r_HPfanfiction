:END:
Harry Potter fights the whole war with kid's gloves on. For eg. he oblivates the two death eaters in the restaurant in DH instead of any permanent method knowing the charm will fail and voldemort will have one of his best death eaters, Dolohov back. He also abandoned No. 4 Grimauld Place instead of dealing with Avery. In Malfoy manor the most harmful curse he used was stupefy.

The most fics which avoids these scenarios are time travel peggy-sue, over done godly Harry Potter or revenge torture fic where Dumbledore is somehow evil mastermind villian.

What I am looking for is a more pragmatic Harry who will deal in a fitting manner to resolve the war, may it be dealing with threats, collecting information or getting the job done without the above mentioned tropes.


** linkao3(For Lack of a Bezoar) fits this request exactly, it's just canon Harry choosing to take a more ruthless approach after he loses his best friend to the war. There's some revenge torture there, but it's all aimed at Death Eaters and doesn't go into revenge porn territory. No Dumbledore bashing either.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** This story of mine is very much about Harry becoming more & more ruthless as the war goes along. It also diverges from canon as he becomes a cold blooded killer.

** Unfortunately linkffn(Forging the Sword) never got that far. Harry was pretty clearly in a harder mindset where he absolutely could have done whatever was needed, but the war hadn't properly started yet.
