Are there fics where there's another Dark Lord going on to try to deal with the troublesome pure bloods and Death Eaters to prevent them from harming the muggleborns?


** So, a "Dark Harry" fic?

I've actually been thinking about some very dark scenarios with a Dark Lord who has an obsession for maximizing the magical population and latches on to the idea that if you start with one "pureblood" witch and 1 "pureblood" wizard you can get more magical babies faster having them work separately to make halfbloods than working together to make purebloods.

*** Barring magical/technological breakthroughs, such as invention of artificial wombs, Wizards having a harem of Muggle women is the quickest way to scale up population. There are of course plenty of problems with that scheme, but it beats that garbage shipping trope marriage law by several magnitudes in effectiveness.

**** A Dark Witch using magic to clone her ovaries and replace muggle women's with her clone ovaries so all the muggle women's children are actually the witch's offspring?

** Gryffindor Tom Riddle in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is Nothing to Fear series]] really pushes for equality, but he's still an utter scumbag.

Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] declares himself the next Dark Lord, champions for equality, and kills off Blood Purists.

Blood purists tried to push a marriage law through after Voldemort's defeat in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]. Harry and Hermione staged a revolution and killed that bunch off, but now other European Pureblood regimes decide to intervene.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8495269/chapters/19468255][To Reach Without]] features an absolute clusterfuck of sides and conflict, where the only person on the side they claim to be on is Albus Dumbledore. Tom Riddle's scheme is to bring down purebloods supremacy using Voldemort to discredit pureblood supremacy while legislating it out of existence as Thomas Gaunt. Severus Snape is spying on the Circle of Agastya for Thomas Gaunt, spying on the Death Eaters for the Circle of Agastya, spying on Dumbledore for the Death Eaters, and spying on the Death Eaters (again) for Dumbledore. It gets complicated.

** Well there the There's nothing to fear series of short stories linkao3(1087368) where, in an alternate universe, Voldemort fights for the rights of all the people marginalized by the purebloods but he is still, well, Voldemort.

There also used to be one which for the life of me can't remember but maybe someone might recognize, where Dennis Creevy is pissed at the wizards, particularly Harry, for not showing proper respect to Collin so he radicalizes the Muggleborns who feel like the Ministry is not giving them proper justice to hunt down and kill all the purebloods (including those that fought on the right side such as the Weasleys, the Abbotts and the Shacklebolts). He also has a long term plan where he plans to force wizards to mate with Muggles so that in the future no one will be born without magical powers.

  Instead of becoming Voldemort, Tom Riddle established a school of “secondary importance” for Muggleborns, half-bloods, and Squibs. Since the school frees Hogwarts to continue drifting more towards the purebloods' whims and wishes, they haven't raised any large fuss. Besides, everyone knows that half-bloods and Muggleborns don't have any real power. Just look at Riddle, who had ambitions that outpaced his magical strength. They don't see the revolution coalescing under the surface.

** In linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or) Voldemort actually does hate pureblood supremacists. Of course he has to pretend to like them to gain their trust so he can stab them in the back later, but he also forces them to take a permanently visible mark of their bigotry (in hopes that they'll be shunned from polite society), and he starts a war that gets a bunch of them killed, and he crucios them every time he has an excuse.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
