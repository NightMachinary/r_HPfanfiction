All the thing is very AU so that Harry can bend more in the world of Fate.Name: Harry James PotterAge: 20Titles: The Boy Who Lived, The Chosen One, The Master of Death.Class: Caster

Overall description: Harry Potter is a british hero that saved the magical world from the threat of the Dark Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, he was trained by Albus Dumbledore and during his life, he realized feats worthy of legends.

Powers: Harry is capable of miracles of magic that normal magecraft can't, including Teleportation, his arsenal is filled with hundreds of spells, in the worst cases he can resolve to his most mortal weapons, his curses, very deadly dark magic attacks that can cause unrelenting pain or unstoppable sword slashes.

Main weapon: Harry uses a Holly and phoenix wand to fight most of the time, but this is just a normal wand just like Heracles fights with a normal sword.

Noble Phantasms: Harry was blessed with five of them.

The Deathstick: The most powerful wand in the world, using it Harry can boost his power several levels.

The Cloak of Death: A silvery cloak that hides Harry from every form of detection, making him undetectable to everything while wearing it.

The Resurrection Stone (or the Peverell family ring) : It's a golden ring that can summon the spirits of the dead, it can also draw other servants out of the spiritual world and charge Harry's mana with the energy of the ghosts, granting him the power to act independent of his master.

Hedwig the white: Harry's familiar, a Snowy-Owl that most of the time just scouts and spies for him, it's extremely inteligent and protective and in dangerous situations can shape shift into a white bird-like monster to fight alongside Harry.

The Sword of Gryffindor: A very sharp sword that was used by Harry to slay Slytherin's monster, after that the blade became cursed with a venom so strong that can destroy almost everything in minutes, there's no cure.

Extra Power: His status as the Master of Death grants him imotality, and as long as the Hallows are whole or with him, he can come back to life as much as he wants.

Srry about my clumsy english, it's not my birth language.

EDIT: Many peaople are commenting that the Hallow's powers does't match the canon.\\
That is because in canon was explained by Dumbledore that the Hallows are just powerful enchanted artifacts created by the peverell brothers.\\
Here in order to make them into Noble Phantasms they're gifts from Death herself, so the powers are very buffed and the status as Master of Death is more than a hollow title.


** I had a fanfic idea where the Tri-Wizard Tournment was the 4th Holy Grail War and Harry who wasn't supposed to be a master Summons Godric Gryffindor who is this wars Saber Face thus a chick. She would have the Sword of Gryffindor and the Sorting Hat (which blocks mental intruders without Godric having to do anything)

never got around to writing it.

** The main problem is that Magecraft and HP's magic are fundamentally different in nature. So meshing the two of them is rather difficult. Check out Fictional by Dark-Syaoran. It's essentially a Harry Potter as a Servant fic, and pulls it off quite well.

** First off, you didn't include Harry's intended wish on the Grail. My suggestion: He wants to get himself and his friends/family freed from the Throne of Heroes so that their souls can join their loved ones in the "next great adventure".

Most of the characters from the Potterverse could fit the Caster class, but Harry also fits well into the Rider class (youngest Seeker in a century, anyone?), and could passably fit Assassin or Avenger. While he did use a sword once or twice, he'd be a lousy Saber.

I still want to see a fic where the irregular Avenger summoned for the Third Grail War was Sirius Black instead of Angra Mainyu, and his "taint" on the Grail mostly just gives it a twisted sense of humor.

***** Even if Harry was't sadistic, he used the Cruciatus two times in the books, the firs one was a failure and he did it out of revenge.\\
But the second one gainst Amycus Carrow was obviously wanting to see him suffering, he could just have him stuned, he had the power and was in position of doing so, but he chose to use this curse.\\
I think that after Dathly Hallows, Harry could fire this at anyenemy ho messed with him.\\
But i agree with you, he would't have any anti-fortress or anti-army noble phantasm.\\
His powers would be very versatile and useful, making him a troublesome enemy to most of the classes, pretty much like Emiya during the UBW route.

*** I'm not very deep into the Nasuverse, but from what I understand, servants in the Grail War manifest based on their legends. The servants themselves might be aware of any discrepancies, but if you summon, for example, /Lockhart/, he'd be closer to how he portrays himself in his books, rather than his inept bumbling self.

That is to say, if people /believed/ that's what the Hallows did, then that's the kind of abilities he'd have as a servant.

**** Here's the thing, I think you can get away with changing it without changing canon. Harry was hardly a master of sneakiness. Remember, Peeves heard them, and he's hardly a shining example of observation. Moody/Crouch likely knew about the cloak, so hearing/smelling/seeing anything different around him isn't hard to see him piecing it together.

Though in another fic, they made Moody's eye an ancient artifact from Egypt that explained why it was so powerful.

It's why Dracula is possible and why Elizabeth Bathory is part dragon.

The Hallows did't grant imortality because in canon it was just some powerful artifacts, but here they're in fact gifts from Death ans imortality is fairly common in other servants.\\
I never said that the stone could summon servants, it just summon ghosts without physical form.\\

***** Depends on who you see as writing the legend. Basing it on the HP universe, Hedwig wouldn't be all that recognised. But if it's based on the fandom's interpretation of the story, Hedwig plays a much bigger role because it's so focused on Harry's personal experience, not the bigger picture.

Harry's in-universe legend would probably grant him different powers than what OP detailed, but Harry's fandom legend could work out pretty well for the powers listed.
