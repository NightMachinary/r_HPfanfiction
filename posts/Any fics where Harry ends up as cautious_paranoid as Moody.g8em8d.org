Between Quirrel, the diary, all the Animagus and werewolf madness, and then fake Moody it would be interesting to see a Harry with dozens of danger detecting gadgets jinxing every animal, person, or object that looks at him funny.

** It's trope-y as shit, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]] has a paranoid Harry. It's acknowledged as a character flaw as well, brought up pretty frequently by other characters.

Updates are rare. Been like three years, I think.

**** Nah, I agree. Love her stuff. Wish she'd update I'm Still Here though.

It's just people make a big deal out of "tropes" (which I don't care about, personally. Especially in fanfiction, lol) and such. So I figured I'd give some warning.

** If you'd like a crackier version of this idea, Rorshcach's Blot's famous Odd Ideas file included some "Harry Moody" chapters, wherein the Boy Who Lived is raised by our favorite paranoid auror. My favorite part is when Harry is clinging to the underside of the coal car on the Hogwarts Express.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

I'm aware, that is in fact tbe joke. That Moody is basically going around yelling at them to, given the circumstances, be appropriately cautious.

** Well, over on Twisting the Hellmouth there's a cross where a post series Xander Harris wakes up in harry's body just as hagrid is breaking down the door. Includes a half-feral Xander/Harry stabbing Ollivander in the spleen when he tries to pull his usual stunt. Also includes a proactive Xande busting into a bar in knock turn alley to send a message to the "imperius'd" death eaters and gelding fenrir greyback in the process.
