He is cunning, ambitious, smart and sharp-witted. He is mature and understands the wizarding world. He is aware of the many things going on around him (Dumbledore's manipulations etc) and takes a careful approach to resolve these problems. He prefers to trust nobody but himself, and has few to no friends. He works from the shadows so as not to raise suspicion. Like a true Slytherin, he pretends to be friendly and normal around his classmates when he actually hates all of them.

*** No, he's not crazy. He despises his classmates as they easily betray his friendship causing him to lose trust in them. Hence he becomes cunning and ruthless. To prevent dumbledore from suspecting he is going dark, he acts normal around his classmates.

** Too Young To Die hits on a few of those things listed above. It's decently well written, and has a unique view of dark magic. Highly reommend
