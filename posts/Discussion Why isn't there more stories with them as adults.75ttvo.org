So many of the Harry Potter stories deal with the characters as children/teenagers, those are fine and there's quite a few that I really love that deal with them as students at Hogwarts, but I wondered why there wasn't more about them as adults.

It could even be before they had kids themselves, just something adult related would be nice with real world issues.

There's quite a bit you could do with the characters as adults (in my opinion anyway).

Maybe Harry and Ginny or Hermione and Ron have trouble having kids, maybe they do a job switch, maybe wished that they had time to actually be kids/teenagers but because of the war they had to mature faster then most, or just whatever.

I really enjoyed Grow Young With Me (needs a serious update). It dealt with more mature issues with the characters that we know and love.

I also rather enjoy Northumbrian's works as well, they write the characters as adults rather well (in my opinion).

And I know that some people are rather mixed with Lomonaaeren's works, some like the author while others don't and that's okay. But I think they write the characters as adults pretty well.

I just wondered why there wasn't more stories with the characters as adults. It doesn't even have to focus on Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron. It could focus on other characters, is it because it's easier writing them as teenagers? Just used to it? Or something else?

What do you guys think? Thoughts?


** As another post already said, a lot of this probably has to do with the age of fandom (skews younger) combined with the "normalcy" of familiar settings. I'd also add that even for older authors/readers, the Potter world does provide a bit of escapism back to teenage years, so it can be comforting to place a story in that setting.

But I think it's more than that too: there are much greater challenges to writing fics post-Hogwarts. If you write about a story that takes place within canon (or within some variant of it), you have a ready-made set of locations, schedules, minor characters, etc., and all of their interactions to draw on. You read the books, and you get your details from there, and it's relatively straightforward to riff off of that.

As someone who is roughly the age of the Trio according to their canon birthdates, I attempted a fic a few months ago. It was basically all post-Hogwarts, spanning time up through the epilogue. And I wanted to try to stay as close to JKR's post-Hogwarts information as reasonable. There's a lot of research, imagination, and creativity that then has to go into sorting everything out, even to create a basic setting. Precisely when do H/G and R/Hr get married? When exactly are the children's birthdates? (That's not so much of an issue if a kid is 8 vs. 9, but it is an issue if the kid is 6 months old vs. 18 months old, or if someone might be pregnant at that point.)

And that's only the tip of the iceberg, because then you have to fill in all the details for locations the characters frequent as adults, where they are in their careers exactly at that point and what their work dynamics would be like, how their schedules work, how family/work interactions happen, what it's like to have kids who are 2 and 4 vs. 7 and 9 or whatever, what sort of changes/issues are likely to pop up in relationships after 5 years together, after 5 years with kids, etc. And that's before you deal with the challenges of portraying the characters as realistic adults, extrapolating from their teenage personalities while incorporating any backstory that may have accrued and affected them in the meantime.

There's just a lot of variables if you want to do it seriously, perhaps even more so than writing AU Hogwarts (or pseudo-Hogwarts) fics, which often merely change a few specific variables.

I have experience with a lot of this real-life stuff, but I can imagine it's harder to try to piece together all of this and make it realistic, unless you've sort of lived it. I've seen quite a few post-Hogwarts fics clearly written by people who have no clue what mature adult relationship dynamics are like, particularly in affair fics. And others who seem to want to write post-Hogwarts fics and basically ignore the fact that kids exist or the real-life challenges of planning around them.

I first encountered fanfic around 2005 or so, and frankly I was creeped out a bit by all the 14-year-olds having sex in stories. So I immediately started looking for fics with older characters, and even back then there were quite a few. I'll admit I became a H/Hr fan early on (at least in terms of fanfic), partly due to early encounters with some fics that placed them in a more mature setting. Once HBP and DH came out, many new H/Hr stories also progressively migrated toward post-Hogwarts settings to create scenarios that played out future relationship dynamics after subverting canon pairings.

(To be clear, I'm NOT trying to convert anyone here. I know a lot of folks dislike H/Hr, and I'll be the first to admit there's a TON of crap with that pairing out there. I'm just saying the very nature of the canon with the pairing seemed to draw people out to make them picture post-Hogwarts settings as more of a norm to somewhat attempt canon compliance, though often ignoring DH epilogue.)

Anyhow, I absolutely agree with the post here: nowadays I tend to read mostly post-Hogwarts stuff, and for romance plots I really only want to read post-Hogwarts. The only Hogwarts-era romances I can stomach anymore typically are humor fics. I was never a fan of the idea that all the main characters were more-or-less locked into "happily ever after" romantic pairings at 17ish, and I'm always interested in fics that try to show how they develop as young adults, and then how they navigate the world of families. But it's rare to see it done well.

Oh, one last obvious thing: so much fanfic revolves around romance/pairings, and stories that involve characters "getting together" are often significantly more popular and common than stories about characters in established normal life relationships. But if you like canon pairings, then you're mostly stuck with romances worked out already by the end of Hogwarts, unless you do something like break the characters up and put them back together again... or go more significantly AU.

*** I also think authors find it difficult to find the right balance in a post war fic. Either the fic is some crazy new evil villain-type story, which almost always falls flat compared to the original, or its an over-the-top soap opera where the characters all wind up OOC, or its an incredibly-boring, nothing bad happens, canon compliant fic.

Which is a bit silly since there are plenty of legitimate storylines one could tell about post-war Harry and friends that are as compelling as the original series. I think a lot of authors simply can't help themselves.

I find most of the adult harry stories that hold my interest have to do with him ending up in another universe.

I read harry potter as an escapist fantasy fiction and after Hogwarts harry was very determined to be "normal" and Normal is boring .

But as a previous poster mentioned, the older you are the more “real life” tends to get in the way of engaging in the fandom.

** I think that a large part of newer writers to the fandom are young(er) people, namely teenagers. Since it's easier to write of your age category, authoring Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny as teens is by and large "easier" for that age subset. As adults, real life takes over (e.g., university, work, family) which makes it more difficult for adults to pen works of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny as actual adults.

Quite honestly, I'm more interested in reading the characters past their Hogwarts years and into adulthood (as I'm now one myself). Reading about Hogwarts and them going to classes just doesn't interest me anymore in FanFiction. Also, few people actually can "write" teens, as many of them are moody and distant and dramatic, which can sometimes spoil the reader into rotten territory.

As a last thought, there's probably a sense of normalcy in which authors of these stories think that many readers want to read these characters within the confines of Hogwarts castle, Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley, the Burrow, and everyplace in between as fans of the series can recognize these sites as the foundation of the books. Parting these characters from what is known of them can create unfamiliarity and an unwelcome change due to the setting being so different from what authors and readers are used to.

I certainly don't shy away from new works that have them as teens, but I show a higher interest in stories that display originality and with the characters well past their school years.

*** I loved reading fanfics when the characters were at Hogwarts when I went to school, just because I could relate (you know ignoring the whole magical world aspect). So yeah that does make sense.

But now that I'm an adult I'd just love to read stories where the characters are adults like I am. So it just irritates me that there are so few well written adult Harry Potter fanfics out there that are worth the read.

I'd just like more stories with the characters as adults dealing with real world problems, and I've seen on here that I'm not the only one, so it's good to see that I'm not alone.

** As a reader and a writer, I'm much more interested in the characters as adults than teenagers. I find trying to write them as teenagers, especially in the confines of Hogwarts, to be much too constricting. I much prefer being an adult and being able to eat ice cream for dinner if I want to, rather than being stuck as a teenager trying to avoid Filch in the halls.

** 3 main reasons in my opinion:

1: Writing them as adults would take way more effort when it comes to developing the world. You cannot fall back on the book content but must invent your own, and you have to develop an interesting world and a plot within it that keeps peoples attention. A lot more world building required if you will (and we all know how limited the pool of good world building fics are).

2: Lack of interesting content. With canon ages you have a war going on, you have action, adventure, excitement all set to be utilized both within and beyond Hogwarts. In canon, all that stuff to some degree comes to an end right when Harry and co enter adulthood. So suddenly you have to create something new. Reusing the same plot devices seems boring. Having another war... really? Everything seems too normal so you would have to spice it up somehow and that's hard.

3: Ages of readers. We may actually start to see at least a few more adult-oriented fics appear now that much of the original HP generation has aged into adulthood. But there is probably still a skewed amount of younger readers. So fics lean towards school age material.

--------------

Now, I will say that one fix to numbers 1 and 2, is to use content from the past. In other words, an adult Harry (and maybe "& co"), end up back in time for some reason during the 70's or around the era of the "1st Voldemort war" or maybe even further back. This allows modern canon figures, to live as adults within a historical canon past (of which we know more about than the future when it comes to the world of HP). We see a few of them, but honestly, I was always shocked there were not more fics similar to this.

** Outside of straight-up romances, post-Hogwarts stories lack a defined structure. What drives the conflict in the story? Is it an AU, or is it possible to slot into canon? Even romances can be very tricky, as the books take place mostly in Hogwarts, but a post-Hogwarts story needs to develop the setting, characters, and basically everything without the Hogwarts setting to prop it up.

Extremely boring.

Why would I want to read a Harry Potter story about the most mundane shit of life? Not to mention that there's already hundreds of years of world-class literature that has addressed all of these subjects much more seriously than a fanfic ever could.

Harry Potter is about Magic, Unicorns, Trolls and evil Wizards. Not young adults figuring out their place in life... that's a whole different genre. What's the point of setting such a story in the HP universe ("oh and by the way, they are wizards, so of course Harry uses Accio when playing catch with his kid")?

I think this is way too oversimplified. Yes, the unique aspect of Harry Potter compared to more generic fiction is the magical world. But so much of the books is about adolescent characters finding their way, developing their friendships (and enemies), learning to navigate the strange world around them. And - a bit to the detriment of the books in my opinion - they're also a bit about petty teenage relationship squabbles, though I understand why JKR included a lot of that stuff... because that too is a significant part of adolescents figuring out who they are and how they fit into the world.

So why can't fanfic delve into such issues after Hogwarts? A survey of fanfic genres also clearly shows that most writers aren't interested in merely exploring magic. The majority of stories revolve around romance or relationships of some variety, even if they aren't central to the plot (though they're much more central in many fics than they ever were to the original books).

People write fanfic for all sorts of reasons, but a lot of it is a kind of escapism coupled with a desire to see characters do things they didn't get to do in canon. Hence why you get so many Draco/Hermione or even Harry/Draco fics. Those aren't about "magic, unicorns, trolls and evil wizards," though those may show in the plot too: they're about writers who want to see characters play out fantasies about the characters' personal development. Heck, even JKR herself admitted there was a degree of "wish fulfillment" in wanting to have the DH epilogue there, something that again had nothing to do with magic -- it was about the characters' lives, how they played out, what they meant to each other.

Of course, that doesn't mean there's going to be a huge audience for a "Harry Potter and the Fertility Treatments" fic, even if there's an author interested in writing it. But maybe to an author who had struggled with such things, there could be a plot that they'd find satisfying to write. Why should the fact that other fiction explored such issues better stop anyone from writing fanfic about it? There's a lot of literature that does "bad boy meets staid girl who explores her wild side" a hell of a lot better than 99% of Draco/Hermione fics, but people still write them (and a hell of a lot of them).

I agree with you that the bare plot outlines suggested in OP don't sound engaging on their surface, but it depends on what you do with them. And there can be significant magical issues involved too; I've seen examples of plots like that where you don't just have an occasional "Accio" grafted on.

After defeating the big bad, I want to see them making it to the top, colonizing new planets, and having some adult actions thrown in between. For example, the Prologue of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12435331/1/I-Aim-to-Misbehave][I Aim to Misbehave]] could be hell of a story in itself, or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12492790/7/The-Heinz-Dillema][Chapter 7]] of "The Heinz Dilemma" fully expanded.

** I daresay the average age of the fandom is a lot to do with it -- teenagers probably want to read about teenagers. And the age the older part of the fandom was when they read the original canon matters too. The nostalgia element probably makes a difference.

BUT I think there are plenty of post-Hogwarts stories out there if you look, (apparently 13.9k in English on ffn) but apart from a select few, they don't get much attention. I notice you only mention stories that are already very popular on here, so I wonder where you are looking.

Unless they choose to feed him a whopping dose of handwavium and continue from there, and I've read a number of excellent fics that do just that, so...

Plus, you know, I think people tend to write stories set during the Hogwarts years because that's what we're most familiar with, if that makes sense. Like, we know the setting, we know the characters, why not stick with what we know?
