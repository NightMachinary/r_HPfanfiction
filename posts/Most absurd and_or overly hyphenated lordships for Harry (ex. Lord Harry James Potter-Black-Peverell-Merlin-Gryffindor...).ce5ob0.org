** This is pure fanon naming right? Or was Potter-Black in the books?

Because this is not normal naming for any normal title of nobility. "Harry Potter, Illustrious head of the most Noble house Black, conquerer of Voldemort's, Head of the Gryffindor Clan, Revered leader of the Peverells" would make more sense... And I think it follows how Dumbledore/Lockhart are titled?

Course I immediately turn off an any fic that uses 'that is Lord (whatever) to you Dumbledore, mind your manners). Which I assume includes all these fics.

Now what would be funny is if everyone ignored the titles, except Hermione who keeps correcting Everyone.

Harry: Ugh Snape

Hermione: Professor Snape, Harry!

Snape: Potter! What are you up to!

Hermione: Lord Potter-Black, Professor Snape!

This is pure fandom, yes. His inheritance from Sirius was:

  "You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringott's, and you inherit all of Sirius's personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy... is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place."

Congratulations Harry potter-black, no you dont get a choice in the matter, its why giving people all your possions is not polite in wizarding culture as they also inherit your name. people think my last name is dumbledore but its in fact percival wulfric brian dumbledore due to my families inheritances .

  In fandom, a ficlet is a very short story, usually fan fiction but sometimes original fiction. The term is commonly applied to stories under 1000 words, although there is no hard and fast rule about how long a ficlet can be. "Ficlet" is preferred to drabble by some fans as a term for stories that are near the length of a drabble (around 100 words) but not 100 words precisely.

  True Name:

  False Name:

  Harry James Potter
#+end_quote

So he has, like, one true and one false name, and no other names exist? What I'm trying to say is that he could have an infinite amount of false names.

Edit: more importantly, I'm pretty sure the goblins are just doing this to see how much blood they can scam out of Harry. Sorry, I meant Harald James George Arthur Philip Albert Richard Lokhi Nicholas Potter.

LOL, what the hell is this fic.

*** Born Harryjames (nicknamed Harry) Salvatio Amethyst Potter, registered in school by Petunia as Harry James Potter (see Chapter 39), renamedSalvazsahar (Sal) Serendu Harryjames Emrys Potter Evans Ollivanneder Black Pendragon LeFay (see Chapter 6, last two surnames added since he was adopted by Arthur and then Morgana), also known as Morganaadth, later nicknamed (which eventually became official) Salazar Slytherin, renamed again as Salvatio Amethyst Malfoire, which he then uses in combination with his old name (see Chapter 53) as Salvazsahar Malfoire, from which came the nicknameSal Sanctuary.

That's all of his names in order of use, I think. I've blacked it out since his names give away a lot of crucial plot points.

And yet those are just his names--he could probably claim lordship for other family lines as well, like Prince (as it's derived from Slytherin), Gryffindor (as it's derived from LeFay), Grim/Peverell/Black (from his godfather), and most likely more that I can't remember off the top of my head.

It might seem a little overwhelming to those who haven't read it, but his numerous identities are an integral part of this fic, and it's woven into the plot really intricately. It's honestly one of the best time-travel fics I've ever read, and I'd seriously recommend it.
