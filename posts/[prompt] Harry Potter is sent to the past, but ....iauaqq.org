He is sent in an Alternate Universe, where things happened in a different way.

In this Universe, the Local Harry Potter undergoes the classic "everybody has been lying to me^{TM} and I need to become stronger^{TM} so I can get back at them", except it's not entirely the truth.

For instance, the Weasleys have really been posted to platform 9^{3/4} on Dumbledore's orders, but not because it made Harry more manipulable but because several muggleborns had forgotten how to get there in the past. Talking loudly about "muggles" is their way to make sure the muggleborns know they're a wizarding family, so they could at least watch them go through the portal.

And so, the new, misplaced Harry Potter is forced to team up with Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix to stop the mad "Lord Potter Black [insert tiles here]" in his quest for undeserved revenge, because as manipulative as the Dumbledore from this alternate reality may be, he still is a good man working for the betterment of the Magical World.


** Don't usually go for fics parodying/subverting a trope I hate. But could be fun. Bonus points if Canon Harry gives Lord Paranoid Revenge Fantasy Potter-Black a good Reason You Suck Speech.

** More plot twist: the deranged Lord Potter-Black joined Voldemort and hooked up with "Ice Queen of Slytherin" Daphne Greengrass.

*** Also Daphne is sort of like Macbeth's wife encouraging Lord Potter-Black-Malfoy-Sacred28 de Mimsy-Porpington to kill all his rivals to the point that he grows so paranoid that Daphne is plotting with Voldemort to overthrow him, so he kills them and creates a super-Horcrux that incorporates all Voldemort's horcruxes.
