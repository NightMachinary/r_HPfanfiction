Hello, everyone,

​

I have finally released Cauterize. It's not professional by any means, but it's what I came up with in one take and I think it's good enough not to re-record.

​

You can find it at this YouTube link.

Thanks for reading/listening. Let me know if I need to re-record anything.

The first chapter of /Saving Connor/, the first book of the Sacrifices Arc, will go up on May 20th, 2020.


** Sounds good but you need to turn up the input. Your voice was way too quiet.
