Hey I found a really nice podfic about the marauders: I think I've got the right link: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/917717/chapters/1781114]]\\
(It's been quite a while since I found this so I hope this is it) - but It was only recently that I actually discovered this awesomeness. To be able to listen to fan-fictions on the bus or just anywhere. Pretty cool. Anyway I was wondering if any of you know about good podfics.

I'm not much for slash and but would really like something with Remus Lupin or the Marauders. :)

- here is a website with some podfics if you're interested: [[http://www.audiofic.jinjurly.com/search/node/]]


** If you just want to be able to listen to your fics while commuting and generealy prefer to read I might suggest using an ebook-reader app for your smartphone that comes with text-to-speech support (for example Moon+ reader).\\
In conjuntion with a good TTS-engine (I like the IVONA range of voices) I find this to be a good compromise for on-the-go listening over short periods of time like on the bus or while mowing the lawn ;)

You can get the necessary ebook files for your fics by using a fanfiction downloader (for example the ffdl-plugin for calibre or one of the many online alternatives) or the ebook-download option of AOÂ³.

That way you can enjoy /any/ fic while you commute with the tradeoff of a slightly robotic voice.

** I'm assuming you mean besides HPMoR? Other than that, no.

** I've actually had someone, only half-joking, suggest I do this for my fics. But as they aren't finished yet, and I'm not (yet) that egotistical...

** fanfictionaudiobooks.com is a really great site that makes fanfics of Harry Potter and other fandoms into podfics!
