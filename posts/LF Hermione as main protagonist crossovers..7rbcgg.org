Adventure stuff is preferred but anything is fine. I just had this beautiful image of Hermione in Skyrim as Dovaahkin and annoyed at having to slay dragons when there's so many books to fill her new home's libraries.


** Im incredibly partial to this Game of Thrones Crossover:

Incredibly short, and unfinished regrettably. But the premise was so interesting, i really wish it hadn't been abandoned

** There's a beautifully written linkffn(Effloresco Secundus by romanescue), in which Hermione is reincarnated into Sakura (of Narutoverse). It is a WIP, and updates are unfortunately very rare, but relatively steady.

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom, and finished with a battle outside her tent. All she wanted to do was finish her equations and find a way home. [Or: Hermione ends up in Westeros and is confused and unhappy.]

*** Hermione being herself - does that mean she doesn't accept Westeros's evil and corrupt ruling system and doesn't follow the Starks as if she were a bloody peasant raised to revere them, and actually uses HP magic to do what's right (and easy, since HP magic is OP in Westeros)?

***** What about logistics? A day spent casting the Gemino Charm means no more hunger in the North during the next Winter. No more supply train for an army. Seeing as the Starks were willing to have Robb marry a Frey just to use their bridge, that spell alone makes her more powerful than pretty much any Lord Paramount in Westeros - she can duplicate trade goods as easily as food, which directly turns into money. She can apparate across the country, cutting down transport time and costs by shrinking say one log of timber, and duplicating it at its destination.

And that's before getting into combining Apparition, Disillusionment Charm and Hermione's canon skill at memory charms to replace say Cersei's personality with a less psycho one.

****** What you are describing would be an ideal fanfic , too bad i can't find anything like it. She meets Robb in the middle of battle after the Frey deal and ignores them at first and only joins them for information to return to her world , Hermione with her canon abilities would walk all over anyone in this world but their would be no conflict and the story would be very short at least that's what an writer once told me. I would love to see what you described .

******* Well, you could have a lot of conflict - though not the usual "close fight". If Hermione is stranded in Westeros, can she simply leave the world (and leave the smallfolk to their fates) once she has a way back? Can and should she try to install a democracy? Can a democracy work, without some traditions to build on, and without an educated population? Should you take over as queen, or be a power behind the throne, puppeteering the king/queen? Social changes are much harder, even with magic, than stomping armies. Settle for a decent regime, or try to lay down reforms? Start some industrial revolution, or improve what's there? How much does Hermione know about technology, anyway?

And the Others might present a challenge even for a superb witch, depending on what exactly they can do.

So, there'd be conflict - just not the usualy ASoIaF kind.

There's a story where Ginny and Sirius end in Westeros, and pretty much conquer Essos without trouble, then start some diplomatic relations with the Targaryens. Ginny/Rhaegar, IIRC.

"Legend of the Gryphon"

******** Well she could do that but I'm not the author and i agree with you. I liked the Legend of the Gryphon conquering part but not the pointless politics with weaker westeros and romance . With how powerful Sirius and Ginny were they should have conquered westeros but end up playing the petty game of thrones . linkffn(11255223) and linkffn(11132113) are my favorite representations of what an HP wizard should do in westeros.
