** I'm just going to recommend ones that are newer, as the ones that have been around for years (TLAT) aren't worth reiterating. These are all WIP, though, but with pretty sizeable starts.

The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275]]

Come Together: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22187539/chapters/52970545]]

but let us first do: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11972910/chapters/27077862]]

the lost generation: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1110486/chapters/2235718]] - goes deep into the Black family, too - good stuff.

Youth: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14343858/chapters/33105450]] - has Snily at the start, but is very much a Jily fic by halfway through and to the end.

The Mapmakers: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14447502/chapters/33372651]]

I have a bunch of Jily only fics, too, if you're interested - but they don't feature a lot of any other character, so I thought I'd stick to the more broader Marauder Era fics first. Hope there are a few there you haven't read before.

I've left a couple of reviews as a Guest, bc I don't really use FF much anymore and couldn't remember my old account / password. Awesome to randomly stumble across you here, though :) I will definitely be keeping an eye out for future updates!

** Lots of good ones mentioned already, but here's a few more, in no particular order:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10840977/chapters/24066027]]) Dirty Blood is a good one that has a lot of Lily and friends as well as the Marauders. WIP. Not wolfstar if i remember correctly.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19900360/chapters/47135293]]) A few months in the Marauders fifth year, from four pov's. Anthem has my favourite characterization of Sirius, and actually good characterization of everyone else too. It's both very dark and gripping as well as funny and whimsical. Bit of wolfstar, bit of Sirius/others and Remus/Dorcas and pre-jily. WIP, but the sequel set in 1979 is finished.

Sequel: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16417496/chapters/38435513]]) This is an AU of a horcrux hunt happening in 1979. Lots of characters and how they fared in a similar to canon but still AU war, lots of relationship/friendship drama and lots of both funny and sad moments. The first chapters are a bit short and uneven but the quality picks up after that.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16281977/chapters/38077013]]) Into the Fire was finished very recently. It's wolfstar and jily and it's an au where the triwizard tournament happens in the Marauders seventh year. Great story, clever dialogue, interesting american school participating instead of Durmstrang.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13552503/chapters/32525703]]) Tangled Strings was finished this summer, or it might still be missing the epilogue, but close enough. Sirius, Hermione, Luna and Ginny timetravel back to the Marauders era and decide to change the course of history, It's well-written, lots of new things happen because they change things and it has a satisfying ending. Remus becomes one of the main characters, and I think there's a bit of Peter as well, and obviously old Sirius. Not much jily, but they're there. Not wolfstar.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]]) face death in the hope is another time travel, Harry is the one who travels back in time. It's more focused on Harry and Regulus Black, but they spend most of their time with the Marauders, Lily and Marlene and Dorcas. WIP.

If you're in the mood for angsty relationship drama for grown-ups, then I'd recommend something by montparnasse, for instance linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10400106]]) or something by flourescentgrey, for instance linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4978138]]) These are mostly wolfstar, but it's interesting takes on the Marauders era nonetheless.

And finally obligatory recommendation of theDivineComedian. My favourite is The Age of Lies, which is an AU take on Regulus surviving the Cave and seeking shelter with James and Lily in 1981. Wolfstar but as with their other stories, it's not focused on romance at all. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801/chapters/30392982]])

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from December 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** My favorite story is this one [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8074987/chapters/18503287]] “How to Tame a Marauder” by melian225 There's also another story where there are “deleted scenes” and other POVs. But it's 99% canon compliant, not wolfstar and goes around with Sirius/OC but with a general perspective of the Marauders. It's additive and wonderful. This is now my head-canon on that era :)
