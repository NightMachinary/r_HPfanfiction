** Honestly? Never heard about it.

"Detailed and grand" sounds like "full of purple prose" which is something I tend to Nope right out of.

If you want to rec it though, you could provide a link and maybe more details so people know if they want to give it a try.

**** Mmm. Thanks for the heads up. Word count doesn't mean anything if it's mostly pointless filler. I'd rather have a shorter story where things actually happen.
