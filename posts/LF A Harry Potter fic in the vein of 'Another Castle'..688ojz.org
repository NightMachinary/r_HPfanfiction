Okay, now you've gone and had a nice read, I was wondering, are there any HP fics with this kind of story? Someone magical who doesn't remember the magical world (despite having family and/or friends reminding them) until the plot happens to jog their memory?


** Not exactly like this, but robst's "You're my Density" has elements of the plot. Harry has forgotten all about magic until Hermione comes to get him.

*** It starts with Harry and Hermione being adults, but they go back to their first year in Hogwarts after one or two chapters, and it becomes another "peggy sue" of sorts.

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.
