It feels like every gamer fic out there has the same structure with Harry finding some interface, and then it is nothing but stats, HP-based combat and completely immersion breaking things like inventories (with space management) and farming.

And while there are certainly some games which have that kind of structure, plenty of others do not. Many shooters have very minimalistic interfaces instead of the information overload you see quite often in the fics (which takes up pages). Many games have no or one active skill at most (Halo, Battlefield, all simulators, Borderlands). Combat is quite often based on hidden HP and one-shot kills, be it shooters like Insurgency or vehicle-based games like War Thunder. Hell, Mario is one of the most known games around and it has none of the elements you find in gamer fics.

And most of the popular online games are way faster than the kind of stories where Harry beats up some spider mob with a stick and each hit has its corresponding HP change written out in full sentences. In League of Legends (and other MOBAs) you kill enemies by pressing R,W,E,Q, right click, R within a second, yet the gamer fics lack that kind of fluidity.

Tl;dr: Why do some many gamer stories feel like a transcript of some Youtube LP channel? And do you know stories which break this mold?


** The point of gamer fics is mechanical growth. They don't simulate a videogame, they simulate character development (in the power level sense, I mean). How would you even write a Super Mario/Harry Potter fanfic? Harry jumps on Voldemort's head to defeat him?

*** Not sure about Mario, but you could easily include Cortana as AI who interacts with Harry, provides a minimap, health indicators and so on. Or a Mass Effect omni tool. You can have a borderlands style system with a skill tee you level but only one active skill in addition to your weapons (magic in this case).

Or a Moba style approach with quick deleting of enemies and a greater focus on gear instead of character stats.

**** Then your fights and action scenes turn into 'I CLICKY DA BUDDOM I WYNN' and 'OH KNOOO VOLDEMORT KAN CLICKY FASER DAN MEEEE'. In a RPG Setting a player or character can be of a lesser level or miss matched only to pull it out due to intelligent play and skill.

RPGs also give the player and reader a clear sense of level progression. The MC gets new Gear to boost stats, they get new spells and they get Perks/Skills. It doesn't feel like the MC is knocked down to basic bitch levels like when dealing with a MOBA (you don't carry levels or gear over between games). Plus RPG battle rules are very flexible when adding action to it.

As for the Cortana thing, most Gamer fics add something similar to that just through the MC's UI. Skill Trees also fit finely into Normal Gamer Style fics as well

*** YES!!! :) Harry gets a YOSHI EGG and has YOSHI pets and different color yoshi with different powers, and he gets a fire flower and a fly tail and frog suit and if he eats mushroom he becomes an adult with more powerful or controlled magic, and also he can super jump and smoosh people. :) Also he can break through walls like the breakable bricks! :) Maybe he also gets the mario sunshine water jetpack! And the water can wash and blast away magic. :) Also he can get the HATTY from mario odyssey and he can possess people and animals too! Like he can possess the dragon in the tournament, in second year he can use it on a Slytherin and learn about the Chamber stuff without having to polyjuice. And instead of whatever he possesses getting mustaches they get his lightning bolt scar. :)

In the second task he can use a blue yoshi to be underwater!

Mario can work yes if you focus on the items! Lots of them are super cool magical! :)

**** "Harry gets an Invisibility Cloak for Christmas...and also a suitcase filled with his mum and dad's inventions! Flying capes, flowers that produce fire, mushrooms that make you double in size...and a series of exuberant letters from someone named Yoshi?"

There you go, imagine a fic that has that blurb.\\
Although I'd like to point out that the Hatty is called Cappy, and I don't think he could read Slytherin minds to learn about the Chamber of Secrets (besides, even if he could, Ginny Weasley is the 'culprit', all of the Slytherins at school are innocent). And Blue Yoshis fly with the help of koopa shells, rather than swim.

By the way, I do think that a Harry who could possess others (and have his distinctive scar show up on whoever/whatever he possesses) ala Mario Odyssey would be pretty cool.

***** Oh yes, right, Cappy. :) And you are right, blue yoshis get the wings. :) Sorry! But, oh no I didn't mean read the minds of people he possesses, I mean he'd possess a Slytherin to talk to Draco instead of using polyjuice on Crabbe and Goyle. :)

I guess Harry wouldn't need a water yoshi if he has a water item already anyway. Do the water jets from Sunshine help him swim faster too?

Yes, Avaday thanks! :) I'm going to put this all in my ideas folder for later.

Well, the Turbo Nozzle gives some very fast horizontal movement in Sunshine, and it works underwater, at least until you surface. In the game you can't use it to go up or down but I could see it being used that way in the Second Task.

** I remember reading a Fallout/HP crossover where Harry /wasn't/ the player character. Instead, the player character wasn't even in his "party" and was behaving, well, like a PC does. The news of those antics sometimes reached Harry's (and his companions') ears as they fortified their settlement.

I vaguely recall a scene where a survivor approaches Harry in panic and goes "Help, there's this mad woman wearing a Vault suit, she just killed everyone, I managed to escape." Immediately I went "Holy shit, is that the player character?" Very interesting approach, I'd say.

Edit: the story is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11690341][The Salem Settlement]] (abandoned, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12588456][picked up by another author,]] now slowly updating), and the scene, which I wildly misremembered, goes like this:

#+begin_quote
  "So you're saying you don't know about your Dweller friend, that fucking psycho bitch. You wrote an article about her, how could you not know?"

  "Nora was here?" Piper whispered. In one moment her entire posture changed. Her jaw muscles tensed and the cool and smiling eyes burned up in anger.

  "That is the one who left you behind, wasn't it?" Harry asked to keep her from exploding. He remembered very well the first time Piper had been able to muster enough strength to rage to her hearts content. Merlin be thanked for Reparo charms.

  "Yes," Piper pressed out through grinding teeth. "Yes, thats her name. That damn..."

  "Calm, Piper." Harry urged her. He laid a hand on her shoulder and just as if he had pressed a button, Piper slumped into herself and sat down onto one of the still somewhat intact theater chairs. "You're alive and well."

  "So I'm not the only one that crazy vault-dweller fucked over? Mildly interesting." The ghoul said. He turned a bottlecap in his fingers, looking at it with a sad sort of smile. "Thats what she left me. One lousy bottlecap. Should've just killed me and be done with it. What am I supposed to do now? My arena is in freakin' Raider territory, I don't have a fighter, and..."

  "Wait, wait, wait," Piper interrupted. "Cait isn't here?"

  "Nah, she left with the vault-dweller. Crazy met crazy and they liked each other from the start, I reckon."

** I once had the idea of something of a gamer!Harry, but it functioned through achievements and some of them giving him abilities related to the achievement.

For example, one achievement would have been awarded on meeting Draco at the tailor, and it would have spoiled that this guy he'd just met was going to be important to Harry in some way. Harry would then make the decision to try and start off his relationship with this guy on a good note and introduced himself. Things proceed, and once they part ways, Harry would receive another achievement for befriending someone that would could have been an enemy... and there by earned the ability to see the opinions others held about him in general terms. Using this ability to tailor his approach to someone else later would have given Harry another achievement that refined the ability into knowing specific opinions others held towards him, similar to Tyranny's Favor/Wrath system.

This story wouldn't have had the common RPG elements of stats or levels or grinding, but it would have had some of the more esoteric ones, like the above mentioned favor mechanic.
