I've come across:

1) multiple Dumbledore and Filch, including one of Dumbledore licking Filch's behind.

2) several Umbridge, including one of Harry waxing off her butt hair

3) at least two of Vernon Dursley

4) Dumbledore and Voldemort, with Dumbledore saying ‚Äúhow do you like the feel of defeat‚Äù?

5) teenage Lupin and Sirius raping Snape while Peter Pettigrew wishes he could join

6) Voldemort and Pettigrew

7) Ginny and Pettigrew in rat form

8) way more than you'd think of Dumbledore and Snape

9) McGonagall and Cho

10) Hagrid and Dumbledore

11) Hagrid with chained obese Ginny and Hermione


** I'm perfectly happy to never see these in my life.

**** All of them ? The least horrible would be McGonnagal/Cho, if I were to picture someone else as McGonnagal like Catherine Bell.

** Suddenly the classical painting of Hagrid with the sorting hat over his privates doesn't seem that strange at all.

Why, why, why oh why.
