I don't want anything smutty. I feel like gender bent fics are few and far between and kinda misunderstood.

I just want a cute little fic where the characters have their genders bent, that's all. I'm just really interested in how the story would play out if somebody had a different gender, like, what if Harry was a girl and looked like his mum? Or what if Hermoine was a boy, would anything be different?

Any recommendations?

Edit: I have no idea why this is tagged NSFW, that's honestly the exact opposite of what I want üòÇ

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** One of the very few I like is one where after he dies, Draco meets Harry in between and Harry reveals that Death is going to let him send someone to another, very similar world to be reborn. Draco agrees, as his life hasn't been great between his father, Astoria dying, his son, and so on.

Cue the birth of "Dancia Lyra Malfoy", who decides she's going to help Harry's shit life this time around. It's fluffy and very well done. And very humorous in spots.

It's called "A Life Twice Lived"

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco
