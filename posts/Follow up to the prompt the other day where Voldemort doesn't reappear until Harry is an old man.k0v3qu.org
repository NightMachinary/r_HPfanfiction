*The prompt posted the other day:* It takes Voldemort a long time to regain a body after getting "defeated" by one year old Harry that his Death Eaters are already in their 100's, Harry Potter is in his 70's, and of course, Albus Dumbledore is dead.

*The scenario the prompt prompted:* A Dumbledore who didn't die in Harry's sixth year because Voldemort hasn't come back is slowly descending into madness from paranoia waiting for Tom to reappear and dementia brought about by old age.

*And now, I present this /thing/:*

/Harry resented Dumbledore for preparing him for a threat that would probably never come. The old man claimed Harry as an apprentice after his graduation from Hogwarts. Sure, he got training in Transfiguration, Occlumency, Legilimency, Alchemy, Dueling & arcane magics from THE Albus Dumbledore, who retired as Headmaster and resigned from all his other positions just to focus on Harry./

/So why was he being such an ungrateful protégé?/

/Oh, Harry understood Dumbledore's reasons. There was the prophecy. There were the remaining Death Eaters who would go on Muggle baiting reunions every once in a while. Pro-pureblood vs pro-Muggleborn ideologies continued to clash. But no one was really willing to restart the Dark Lord's crusade in earnest. It was deemed too radical except for his loyalists who were stuck in Azkaban, anyway./

/The years went by with no sign of Voldemort ever making a move. The Dark Lord became a thing of the past, his nickname "You-Know-Who" relegated to the annals of history. Young scholars were even starting to spell out his chosen name "Voldemort." The Wizarding World moved on from its old problems to face new ones but Harry felt like he was stuck in the past because of an old man who couldn't let go./

/As decades passed, Harry Potter wondered what his life would have been like if Dumbledore had just let him be and not forced him into this mold. What was he really good at? Would he have become a professional Quidditch player? An Auror? Something else? While Harry was better than his peers in the subjects Albus taught him, he was never going to reach Dumbledore's level of proficiency and power at those things. It was the difference of a natural genius and a hard worker. Harry knew that the old man had only wanted the best for him but as dementia settled in, his master's eyes gradually lost their twinkle. He could no longer hide his disappointment in Harry for not living up to his impossibly high standards./

/Still, Harry could not bring himself to completely leave the old man no matter how frustrated he was with his lot in life. When the former Headmaster reached his twilight years and could no longer teach anything, Harry applied for the post of Transfiguration professor in Hogwarts and got accepted. He took Albus with him to Hogsmeade and set him up to live in with his brother Aberforth. Even if Harry had a room at Hogwarts, he went home to the Hog's Head daily until Albus Dumbledore died./

/When Albus Dumbledore died and still no Voldemort appeared, Harry felt like a puppet that had its strings cut. What was he going to do with the rest of his life? Would he continue to teach Transfiguration? Or would he finally get to live, to discover who he really was?/

*And that's it!*

This Harry can then disappear, change his name, go on a world adventure, marry and settle down or remain in Hogwarts as Transfiguration professor until Voldemort finally returns.

I couldn't think of any more details about the Death Eaters aside from them muggle baiting not out of any loyalty to Voldemort; they just wanted to flex that they were still around. The truly loyal ones would probably have died already in Azkaban due to malnutrition and psychological trauma.

It was hard to think of what could have happened during Harry's Hogwarts years so I didn't even try to write about that. So I don't know who he became friends with. Heck, I don't even know if Sirius got out of Azkaban or if he died there. It looks like he didn't coz this Harry felt like his only family was Albus Dumbledore. Harry had willingly accepted the apprenticeship at first but gradually came to regret it.

Oh well, at least I got some writing practice out of this.


** I like this. Interesting alternative to the common idea that Dumbledore ought to have been training Harry to fight Voldemort.

** Following that I can actually see this Harry Potter just retiring and quietly leaving and starting over someplace else as a new man.

No famous name following him, no grand expectations, no fame or infamy, nothing. Just pure freedom to make whatever choice he wants.

** Shouldn't Harry still be famous for being The-Boy-Who-Lived? There is no reason for the papers or Ministry to demonize him. Unless the many years he spent out of the public training with Dumbledore made the fame go away.

*** He's still known as the-boy-who-lived but with no Voldemort appearing from the time he was a one year old until he is an old man, that, and being the last apprentice of Albus Dumbledore are the only things he's known for because there wasn't any opportunity for heroics during his Hogwarts years.

I imagined a Harry who lived this kind of life to really want to be "just Harry" so he doesn't go into politics and chooses to be a Transfiguration teacher. I don't think the papers would demonize him; where did that come from?

**** Because as there is no Voldy plots and whatever there is no reason for the Prophet amd Fudge to fuck with him. He is "just Harry" as you mention. What about Hermione, Ron, Ginny, the Weasleys?

***** As written above, I didn't get so far to think about them.

** Sirius got out of Azkaban because of the Weasleys' images appearing in the Prophet alongside Wormtail, so all things being equal, I think year 2 and 3 would be the same as canon.
