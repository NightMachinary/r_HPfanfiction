/Luscious/ instead of Lucius. Diagon /Ally/ instead of Alley. /Occlumancy/ instead of Occlumency.


** Luscious instead of Lucius is hilarious rather than anything else.

I've seen Ginny's full name misspelled as Ginerva a few times. If you are going to use her full first name, it's Ginevra.

*** To be fair I think there are a couple of translations where she is called Lilly, as that is the local way to spell the name and people not always realize that there is a difference, because most people read the books in their native language.

In my language, Hermione is spelled Hermine for example, so don't be a too big of a dick about it, not everybody is a native English speaker and you can often take that as a sign that the story you read and understand is written in a second language

So, until he's (could be she or they, but it's shorter using masculine) corrected, the narration write it as 'Dumblydore'. If your going to make a spelling mistake, at least be intentional about it and give it a reason.

Also, the spelling mistake I hate the most is 'Diagonally Ally' (because of course, they can't even spell 'alley' correctly). The combination of the two words is supposed to be the play of words, not the first name alone!

** Then when they mean than.

Do you say Ben when you mean ban? No? Then why are you saying then when you mean than?! JFC.

Other fake homophones too.

Their they're there errors, as well (to help you remember, you could always pronounce them slightly differently, y'know, like uh... The-ir, they-er, ther.)

The "it's its" error, well, it's its own annoyance...

All of those things and similar, where it's just slightly off, causes my reading flow to stumble and can in sufficient quantity derail me.

There are worse things you can do, but if there's much worse than those in the fic I won't even read it long enough to remember it in the future.

Also, not a spelling thing, but getting your tenses mixed up in the same paragraph of narration is pretty atrocious writing.

Similarly, don't switch between first and third person for the same character in the same scene from the same POV. It's just wrong.

Keep author notes outside the body of the chapter. Start and/or end only. It's not in book page format, you can't do footnotes like in a book.

Stuff like that.

** I recently read a fic where the author was decent if not for their clearly lazy proofreading most of their mistakes were something that someone could catch by simply reading it over. The author wrote cooperation every time they wanted to write corporation, which I can only assume was the result of some sort of autocorrect system. I almost dropped the fic, but I ended up using my word replacer to fix it.

    I usually just find grammar and spelling errors funny rather than get annoyed, but I've seen diagon alley spelled as one word without the E, so diagonally. Voldemort and Dumbledore frequently misspelled. More than one fic that misspelled index as Indies or indes(which isn't even the same sound but that doesn't stop people confusing then and than, so...)
