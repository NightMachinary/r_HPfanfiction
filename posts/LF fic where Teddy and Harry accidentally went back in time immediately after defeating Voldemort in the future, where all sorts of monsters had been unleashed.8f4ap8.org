#+begin_quote
  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.
