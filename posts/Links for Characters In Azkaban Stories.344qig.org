Do you have a favourite story featuring someone locked up in Azkaban? Leave a link below.

I'll leave a few submissions to get things started:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5371934/1/All-The-Dementors-of-Azkaban][All the Dementors Of Azkaban]]: AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1480438/1/Redemption][Redemption]]: COMPLETE! Harry Potter has spent six years in Azkaban. Now, Dumbledore, Black and Lupin are here to retrieve him, now certain of his innocence. Will they be too late to save Harry's sanity? And if so, what does this mean for the world? AU after year 4.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1291535/1/Betrayed][Betrayed]]: In his fifth year Harry Potter was framed for murder and sentenced to Azkaban. Ten years later his innocence is proven. What will Harry do? Written PreOotP. COMPLETE!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2329599/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freedom-of-Apathy][Harry Potter And the Freedom Of Apathy]]: COMPLETE. PostOotP. After ten years in Azkaban Harry emerges a changed man. Enlightened and respectful, he is creature of magic full of disappointment and shame in his own race. And yet wielding power that none can match.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary][Harry Potter - Mercenary]]: Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.

Honourable Mention: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2107570/1/Lord-of-Caer-Azkaban][Lord Of Caer Azkaban]]: A letter causes Harry to learn some surprising things about his lineage, a different twist on the usual Harry in Azkaban story line. (Not strictly a character in Azkaban fic, but the prison features prominently throughout the story).


** Someone should write a Count of Monte Cristo type story involving Harry and Azkaban!

*** There is something similar with Harry and Grindelwald in Nurmengard:

**** Ugh... Don't tease me like that, a 6 chapter story that hasn't been updated in 5 years? I'll pass, even if the story is excellent, it's all the more reason not to read it, because you'd be pissed off that there isn't more!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8588360/1/The-Dream-of-a-Waking-Man][The Dream of a Waking Man]]: When Harry accidentally apparated into his Azkaban cell, Sirius struggled to protect him. They've managed to escape, but with the Aurors chasing them and dark wizards lurking around every corner, their journey to safety is far from done.

** Harry Potter and the Azkaban Parody is good for a laugh. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2205019/1/Harry-Potter-the-Azkaban-Parody]]

It's not Shakespeare and it's kind of abandoned, but it pokes fun at all the overused tropes in this type of fic. I don't remember the pairing or anything bit that was not central to the fic.

*** Thanks for the link. I love parodies and I think satire would be incredibly difficult to write well.

** Not really locked up in Azkaban but a good read nonetheless(it has been a while since I read it tho, so don't know how accurate that is)

** I'd recommend [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=286873][Ebb and Flow]]. I remember it to be quite (well, very) dark and a bit twisted, but very good. The sequel is also enjoyable, the second sequel not so much.

** Can't find a better link than FF.net at the mo, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4661762/1/The-Gilded-Cage][The Gilded Cage]] by ApollinaV is an amusing twist on a MLC fic.

Author summary:
