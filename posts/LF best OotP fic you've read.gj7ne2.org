Order of the Phoenix is my favorite book. I've been scouring the web for the best of the best, but it's hard, and I've read so many fic at this point that sometimes it's hard to remember which is which. Especially nowadays, where reading fanfic is one of the few things getting me through quarantine without going crazy.

I'm not picky about what I read, so please recommend me your favorite OotP fics :)

-Bashing is fine, but I prefer for it not to be the entirety of the fic

-Crack is welcomed

-Don't care about relationships, I'll pretty much try any pairing

-Completed fics are preferred, but I'll take what I can get. Sending me incomplete fics is fine too!

Thanks in advance.


** linkao3(evitative by vichan) is probably the best one I've read. The Dark Magic lore is interesting to read, and Slytherin! Harry is always a plus for me.

Besides that, there's linkffn(I Welcome the Unwelcome by XxXxDarkVampirexXxX) -and don't be put off by the author's name. It's a Fem! Harry/ Voldemort (although he looks like Tom Riddle and isn't crazy) marriage/ peace treaty fic. Despite the slight absurdity of the premise, I found myself liking it a lot, even though it is abandoned/ on hiatus.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** If you need some catharsis for what Umbridge gets away with, here's my favourite in that category: linkffn(12098960)

53 chapters of Harry embracing his Marauder heritage and deciding not to take any crap from the only DADA teacher that manages to do a worse job than Lockhart. Glorious pranking fun and hilarity ensues.
