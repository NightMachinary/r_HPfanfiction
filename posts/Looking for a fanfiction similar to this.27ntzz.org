** What about this story do you like? The fact that Volde is still in charge? Harry's mom is still alive? He becomes a bad ass?

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]] One of my favorite fanfictions of all time. It is a /very/ long read, but completely worth it. It's like seven books rolled into one, if that helps. It deals a lot with Harry's relationship with a very strong Voldemort, as well as the politics of this new world order.
