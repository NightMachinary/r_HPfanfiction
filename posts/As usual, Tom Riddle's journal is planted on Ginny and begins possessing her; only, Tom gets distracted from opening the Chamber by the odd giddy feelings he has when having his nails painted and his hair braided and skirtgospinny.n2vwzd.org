Trans Girl!Riddle, basically.

Like imagine Riddle finally possessing Ginny when she writes in her dorms, but doesn't have a chance to make an excuse to get out before Ginny's dorm mates get her caught up in the flurry of activity and talk about trying make-up and the like. It all snowballs from there.

And no, I have genuinely no idea how the situation would resolve itself in the end. I had this idea at 3AM. Maybe Ginny and Tom would end up cohabiting the body because Tom needs /someone/ to learn girl stuff from.


** Now I want to see trans!Diary Tom explaining it to Voldemort like "So I figured out why we're so murderously angry all the time. And why we kept self-destructively ruining our body through dark magic. It turns out, well... we didn't have a word for it in the 40's, but... they do now."

*** He was drawing close, sword in hand. Tom panicked - the sword was soaked in venom, one of the few things that could destroy him. So he did the only thing he could - awoke Ginny from the enchanted sleep, made her grab the diary lying next to her and hurl it into a nearby pipe.

Grinning victoriously at Potter's baffled face, he only had a moment to savor this victory before buckling over, the quickly increasing distance violently severing his connection to Ginny.

And then he was a book again. An indestructible book that would not be destroyed by the water that was currently carrying it to parts unknown, but still a book.

In a sense, he felt... sad, perhaps that was the right word, to never get to be Ginny again. He'd have chosen another name, perhaps, but that road was forever closed.

For the first time in his life, Tom felt like he could cry. It was an odd, odd feeling.

--------------

The water carried his diary along a network of pipes, and luckily, it was not the sewer kind. No, he was likely inside the rain water drainage pipe, which eventually fed into the great lake.

He would need to draw on the life force of nearby fish and sea animals in order to manifest a body. He hadn't wanted to before, it was unseemly to sully one's soul with animalistic parts, but in the absence of a human it was necessary.

And so, the following day, a small diary washed ashore on the far side of the Great Lake, just outside Hogwarts' wardline. And it wiggled. A fox came over to sniff at it, and instantly dropped dead when its nose touched the leather.

And then, Tom Riddle was existant once more. He shook himself, his original, male, body feeling... wrong, in some fundamental way, but picked up the book with clammy fingers, brow creasing in exertion. The only reason he could even lift the book because he and it were one and the same.

--------------

Having no wand and being not much more than a soul infused with the meagre life-force of several trees and a patch of grass, Tom did not risk an apparition. Who knew what would happen if he splinched a part of himself in this state?

However, being a soul, he also had no need to eat and could not feel the cold. His original theories proved to be correct, he could not fully manifest and anchor himself to the world without a human sacrifice. He did not even need a soul to override or a body to take over, but he did require the passage through the Veil that a human death would create. He now felt rather foolish for even attempting such a showy and ultimately unnecessary ritual, especially as it had cost him his first chance at resurrection.

No, he would simply find (or create) a death, and use it as passage. Muggles were fragile, weren't they? Maybe he'd go to one of their hospitals and look there.

--------------

The white, sterile walls unnerved Tom. He felt anachronistic, disconnected from the world - the muggle world had changed so much, in so many fundamental ways. There were no asylums you could hear from across town, no nuns praying over the sick. No, it was all very... white. White walls, white coats, though he did sneak through one room (the sign had said Surgery) that looked like a murder had happened inside.

Finally, he found his invisible self in the so-called Emergency Room, and had a target in his sights. An unconscious man who, by the looks of things, had broken every bone in his body. He could not feel any thoughts and the soul had just about departed (how odd, that a muggle could die without their body doing the same), so he used the opportunity to slip through the crack left by the man's halfway-death.

The feeling was... unpleasant, to say the least. He felt jagged, inflamed - like his deepest self had been flayed alive. All his senses became clearer, unmuted by the Veil, and the jarring noises and bright colors almost made him pass out just then. But he did not, because among the stinging pain, there was another emotion he had never felt.

He was... content. calm. How peculiar. His entire life had been dominated by anger, hatred at the world, cruelty to those that deserved it. but now...

He felt... different. Unlike before. More than the sensations, more than his new flesh and blood, he...

He looked into a nearby mirror, and was glad he'd been silenced to all but himself.

For he was no longer a "he".

--------------

It took some time to come to terms with his new body (her new body? Referring to himself as female made Tom feel things he was afraid of), but the first thing he (she?) did was sneak into Diagon, under an invisibility spell, and relieve a girl about his size of her shopping bag, which was emblazoned with the logo of one of the more popular robes shops.

She would undoubtedly be angry at the loss, but he had to admit she had good taste.

Tom shook himself. Where had that thought come from? He was Lord Voldemort (what a stupid name... what?), he did not compliment people. He did not appreciate people. He had no business feeling as euphoric as he did. He was the kind of man who felt coldly satisified, not giddy. What was wrong with him?

--------------

Tom grew ever more comfortable in her (HIS!) new body, doing things totally out of character for his previous self. He'd realized that nobody, not even Dumbledore himself, would realize just who he actually was, and so he decided to forego the invisibility spells and return to one of his old haunts, Borgin and Burkes, in order to make some money. she (he!) had an alter ego to locate, after all.

In a way, being seen both made his life better and worse. On the one hand, he was paranoid to no end about being recognized. On the other, he felt extremely, concerningly warm and glowing whenever he walked freely along the alley. He had actually /cracked a smile/ at a passerby! What was happening?

--------------

As it turned out, Borgin and Burkes was not what he remembered. It was filled with dusty, cursed antiques, the least of which was its owner.

How she'd ever stood to spend a day in his presence he did not know.

The man was constantly leering, and eventually got smart with his hands - but he was quicker. Watching a human being flayed alive by his entire shop had never felt so satisfying to her.

Given that he was not exactly a legal employee and all the documentation of the shop had mysteriously vanished, no Aurors came to question her involvement in the man's death.

--------------

Eventually, through the combination of a scrying spell, a divination in molten silver and one basil leaf, she discovered the location of her alter ego. It was roaming around a forest in Albania.

However, before she could hunt it down, she had to come to terms with what to do. It was no longer as simple as performing a resurrection, because over the last few months, she had discovered that with her new body, she felt... content, might be the correct word. She no longer felt anger at the world, anger at all the people who had what she had not.

Eventually, she'd grounded herself in an occlumentic exercise and examined her brain-state. It was a basic technique, but she'd never used it before - and now she knee why. It would reveal, objectively, what her brain was like, and she was forced to admit that her current mind state was much healthier than what had driven her before.

Oh, she still loved the Dark Arts, going against Ministry law, and she did not care much for minor, victimless crimes, but the senseless murder? The torture? She was forced to realize that that had been lashing out. The self-mutilation, the constant anger and hatred at everything, the emotions dulled to nothingness... all these had vanished.

--------------

Lord Voldemort was in a dark place. There were only two pinpricks of light, and he spurned the deer he was possessing on further. He'd been travelling like this for a year by now, jumping from animal to animal and fighting its will until it withered away. It was slow-going, but the part of his mind that was not dissecting the animals' minds was busy concocting a ritual.

A ritual which would finally restore his true form, this time without all the imperfections. He would be reborn as his true self, finally complete.

He could not risk possessing a human, no no. Humans were difficult, stronger than he remembered. A tiny part of himself feared that he'd been irreparably damaged, and a few other tiny parts agreed. He could feel that he was incomplete.

Tom stepped forth from the bushes, and slammed the black diary down on the deer's head. Immediately, it went slack, and the book took on an aura unlike before. It was still a vessel, though now empty - and as a vessel, it could still hold a soul. with her alter ego thus contained, she silently apparated away.

--------------

Voldemort found himself once more, and gone was the panicked mind of the animal he had inhabited. No, it felt like he was... back inside his Slytherin dorm? Hed almost forgotten what that had been like. One of the only places that had ever felt like home.

Suddenly, there was a great drawing from above, and his body was hurled into the darkness, only to slam down onto a carpet.

Looking at himself, he saw that his body was almost completely translucent, visible only by a slight contour. Looking around, his red gaze eventually found a woman sitting opposite him... a woman who looked strangely familiar. It couldn't be.

...

"Mother?" he rasped, the very idea of sound making his body waver as it tried to hold itself together.

"Goodness no. Our mother was a useless squib, and we're anything but." she said.

Voldemort was perplexed. This strange woman... she claimed to be him?

"Are you one of the Horcruxes, then?"

"Indeed. Or, I was. Now I am not."

"I congratulate you on attaining a body. Permanent possession takes some work."

"Oh, this isn't a possession. This is a real body, created when I passed through the Veil in reverse."

"But why... why is it female?"

"Oh, Tom, we have a lot to discuss."

***** It started innocently enough. Tom was in his room going through his box of treasures when his eyes landed on a golden bracelet with charms he stole from another older girl and slipped it on as well as silently clasping together a necklace and slipped on a few rings and allowed a soft smile to grace his lips as his normally cold eyes shone with content and warmth.

When Tom was 9, he stole a jumperskirt and blouse from the laundry and after the orphans went to bed, he slipped it on and twirled slightly, watching the skirt fan out slowly then settle on his thin legs. When he slipped on the jewlery and caught himself in his cabinet mirror, he nearly teared up as he ran a hand reverently over the necklace and skirt and pledged to aquire more.

11 year old Tom sat sullenly as Dumbledore explained Hogwarts and how thefting wasn't tolerated, like it was his fault the other kids were idiots, and gripped onto his jewlery he had shoved into an inner pocket he sewed onto his shorts and nodded as Dumbledore left and let out a sigh as he made plans to get his things. +Timeskip to Golden Trio Era+

Diary Tom was bored. Day in and day out, he dealt with silence and muted monochrome memories floating past as he sat cross legged under a mockery of a tree beside the Lake and tugged awkwardly at the male Hogwarts uniform he was wearing, emotions warring as he resisted the urge to take it off and burn it. It didn't... feel right to him.

When Tom possessed Ginny(poor girl. What a horrid name), he laid off on releasing the Basilisk again after that muggleborn with the camera got petrified because he got distracted by the colorful Witch Weekly Ginny read and all of the outfits inside, imagining himself in each one.

In the Chamber, Tom squared off against the supposed ‘Boy-Who-Lived' and sneered at the waif of a boy sobbing over Ginny's body before another unfamiliar feeling welled up inside of him and with a deep sigh, picks up the diary and steps back before flinging the diary in one of the deep pools and with a cocky grin, disappears back inside the diary before it sinks and Ginny awakes with a gasp of air.

Tom moaned and heaved onto the grass as the gentle bobbing of the water his diary was in nauseated him. As his prison floated, it would eventually wash up on the banks of the Thames River remain there for another few days before a sharp pain went through Tom and he passed out. When he awoke again, the smell of sewage and fish filled his nostrils and he woke up with a gasp and looked around, unaware of where he was at first. ‘The Thames..? How did I..?' He looked down and poked at himself and felt solid flesh and a beating heart and the soggy diary. ‘I-I'm out. But.. how?'

Tom took the next few days reorienting himself with how much London has changed since the 20s and after a bit of mind magic and spellwork, he had himself a comfortable flat not that far from Diagon Alley working at a coffeeshop and was secretly overjoyed at the malls, which boasted an assortment of clothes. Within a month, Tom Marvolo Riddle was gone and in his place was Evelynn Merope Edwards.

** Tom couldn't really remember being a diary. He was one, he knew, but he didn't really remember it. He remembered being a 16-year-old boy. Then he remembered being inside this 11-year-old girl's head. There was no in-between, no knowledge of whatever strategy he'd used to get in there. That was fine. Even being so young was surely preferable to being an inanimate object.

Every time he slipped into Ginny's head (and wasn't that such a terrible name, Ginny? He would have chosen something nicer and more regal. Perhaps Elizabeth, like the princess) it got easier. Her mental defenses were weakening and every time he felt more at home. It wouldn't be long until Ginny was completely overwritten by Tom, and then he could steal her life to regain his own.

In early February, he decided not to let the basilisk free, just once. He needed a feel on how the school was handling the situation, and to see how the students were reacting. No plan could succeed without intelligence, after all. Plus it was a Saturday. Ginny had come to the Chamber wearing a long skirt, and he had to admit there was something oddly satisfying in seeing the end of it fly away as he turned a corner sharply. Checking to make sure the corridor was clear in both directions, he tried a quick twirl. Yes, extremely satisfying indeed.

He knew Ginny suspected something was wrong. He still didn't remember existing as a diary, but he somehow knew what she'd written to him and what he'd said in return. Someday, when he was free, he might have to research the sapience of souls that were removed from their bodies. That day was coming soon, and--

HE WAS A BOY! Why was he a boy again?! How had she slipped his control? She shouldn't have been able to resist him at all by this point, much less oust him and dispose of the diary. He had to stay calm. She would seek him out again, and if she didn't he could just start over. Odd how being in a boy's body after being a girl for so long felt wrong now. Show him the memory anyway. Begin to get him on side.

Ah, this was better. A mind that was prepared for him, that didn't fight when he entered. Today was about making sure Ginny wouldn't try to shake off his control again. He could read her memories, flip through them like files in a cabinet. She wasn't particularly close with the girls in her year (that was probably his fault; he couldn't really expect someone who kept running off to let loose a murderous monster to have a full social calendar), but not so distant that he couldn't mend things.

His nails were painted. Well, not really his; Ginny's, to be precise. But he was Ginny right now and therefore her nails were his, so his nails were painted. They were a soft pink that sparkled now and then, and occasionally the light shimmered across even if he held his hand still. It was magical, and magic was wonderful in all its forms. He did always love discovering new magics, and how would he have known about this? Painting nails wasn't the sort of thing boys did. But maybe it should have been.

It was odd to see Ginny from the outside. He'd generally avoided mirrors when he possessed her. He could never see Ginny's face in the mirror without wondering what he would have looked like if he'd been born a girl. He knew girls thought he was a handsome boy (learning legilimancy when no one expected you to have the skill was completely unfair. It had also turned out to be a bother; most students' thoughts weren't worth trying to read, and the few secrets he'd learned had turned out to be too salacious to be worth thinking on for any length of time), so perhaps he would have been a rather pretty girl? He would have worn his hair long, he thought, and--and this really wasn't the time, was it? There were footsteps just outside the Chamber. He knew he was the sole heir of Slytherin, but somehow someone had found their way in. No matter. They were too late.

He'd almost been wrong. If Harry Potter had come down 5 minutes sooner, if he'd been a hair faster grabbing the basilisk fang, Tom Riddle wouldn't exist now. In a way, maybe he didn't exist. It had occurred to him, at the last possible second, that perhaps Tom Riddle's death would serve a better purpose than Ginny's. The pathway into the girl's mind was still open--it was how he was extracting the last bit of her life, after all--and creating an illusion of Tom Riddle's destruction was simplicity itself, even done wandless and wordless. There were downsides to this, yes. He still would have preferred to be called Elizabeth and to have dark hair, but he was comfortable with Ginny and red hair could wear ribbons just as well. He could make the best of this situation.

Or perhaps it should be "she could." Yes, something about that felt right.

**** One of my main thoughts with this was that Tom, being a 16-year-old from the 30's and 40's, probably would not be well-versed in gender theory and would therefore be less likely to connect the dots. I also figured that he (and I'll keep using male pronouns and the name Tom since in my fic he doesn't identify as female until after taking over Ginny) is still Voldemort. He's still the wizard that killed his parents as a teenager and willingly set a basilisk on a school full of children. It would be cracky and funny for him to go from "KILLL THE MUDBLOODS" to "hehe twirly skirt go brrr" but that seemed massively out of character. Which, yeah, crackfics do lean towards out of character characters, but I did want it somewhat realistic. The rest of it was trying to convey to the reader that Tom had some stuff to figure out without making it so obvious that you wonder why he hadn't yet.

** Tom Morvolo Riddle sat on a bed in a room he only knew about from description curled up. He had messed up, instead of sacrificing Ginervra "Ginny" Weaslys body to build a new one for himself he wound up possessing it. Thankfully nothing was left of the girls soul or he'd have problems. When he was just possessing her the feelings were muted but now that this was his body he was overwhelmed by the sensations. It might have been the absence of such feelings for fifty years but everything just felt right.

He quickly found how comfortable he felt in the roll. Over the years he came to realize why. At the end of her third year she found herself at war with her original, with plans to act as spy.

The realization that the feelings she felt were more than mere hormones was a hard pill to swallow, but soon enough she found herself firmly against her original self.

In her sixth year she wound up actively fighting & witnessed the destruction of another horcruxe & her original. Never would she reveal this secret, not to her husband, her children, or her friends but it didn't matter because she was happy, even on her worst days she was happier as Ginervra Molly Potter ne Weasly than she ever was as Tom Morvolo Riddle.
