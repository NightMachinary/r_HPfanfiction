:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think that Hermione came of the idea of them simply walking out of Umbridge's class and not following her orders and Educational Decrees, based on the non-violence movement led by Gandhi. I think there are some pranks to drive her batty (actually, that may be a different fic... so sue me). Eventually, Umbridge is forced to leave, chased to the gates by a mob of pissed off students. She returns with Fudge and a few "Loyal" Aurors to try and force the students into line; they may or may not be threatened with gaol time if they refuse. After this, the civil war begins in ernest with the involvement of squads of militiamen led by members of the DA. Dumbledore returns from wherever the heck he's been hiding, right into the middle of a firefight between militia and Ministry forces (who have steadily been showing their true colours as time goes by).


** Don't know if it is the specific fic you are referring to but linkao3(The secret language of plants) does have a non cooperation moment/revolution organized by the students. Aurors are sent and are met with peaceful non cooperation.

  ‚ÄúJust... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.‚ÄùWhat was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
