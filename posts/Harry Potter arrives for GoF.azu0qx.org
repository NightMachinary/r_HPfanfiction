*** When you break it down to the premise of the first part of the first act, it sounds like it wouldn't be good at all.

I think it's one of the best ones, despite dragging a bit in the middle.

**** Yeah, but the ending felt really rushed too. Like they were building up all this interesting mystery stuff about things and then just kinda dropped it.

***** Oh yeah, that's right. It felt like the author was losing interest, and just wanted it to be over.

At least my lasting impression was of the ironically beautiful descriptions of what a blind wizard "sees."

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  When Hagrid arrives at the Potter cottage in Godric's Hollow, he finds no sign of Harry Potter. It takes five long years for Harry to be found, in the care of a distant cousin, having been dropped off by his Great Grand Mother.

**** Nope. But it's an old TV show. It uses the characters and some of the world, but you don't need to know it to enjoy it.

I personally have never seen/read more than the Wikipedia page for the show.

** Harry potter: the chaotic wizard.

Harry Potter, age ten, made a wish...

He wished that he could go to a place where he could do all of his magic whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and the wish came true...

A few years later in Earth time, he has returned and found himself back in the hands of one Albus Dumbledore, who wanted to use him as a Weapon against Voldemort. But Harry is not happy, since his 2 thousand year life vacation was interrupted...

He is now Discord, The Spirit Of Chaos & Disharmony, and he is gonna have a FUN time with this...

*** Are you joking? I find it almost impossible to believe that a Harry Potter/my little pony crossover could be good, or even readable. You certainly don't make a case for it considering you just recited a author's summary.

Is there an actual reason to read this?

**** This one is okay not the best but readable. (if wishes were ponys) is a good read thought. In that one harry goes to equstria through a portal and the muggle and wizarding world have to deal with literally real life aliens except the Aliens are colorful ponys.
