  /The repercussions of Harry's actions in the Department of Mysteries catch up with him. Features Angry!Harry. Really, really angry/

This was released shortly after OttP. Up until then, the "Harry shouting at people" trope was basically non-existent. This fic was one of its cornerstones.

Heh. The Angry!Harry part of the summary was actually my idea. I told draco664 that it would draw more reviews, since people were hungry for more of an anti-hero Harry - up until then, 99.5% of fanfic featured him as almost angelic, fully self-sacrificing and heroic to the extreme.

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.
