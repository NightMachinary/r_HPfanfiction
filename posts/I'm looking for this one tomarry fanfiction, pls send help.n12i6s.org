:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's about Harry going to a spa. Harry got this chance to go to the Spa from Bellatrix Lestrange and because of this he was suspicious that this is a trap. But Harry thought that this is a good chance to relax and he went there. In these Spa Harry meet a beautiful man(Tommy boy)who is going to help him relax. You know massage and these things. But uhh in the end this wasn't about just relaxing.... I don't find it, please if you recognise comment and uhh thank you! (Sorry if my english is bad or some grammar is bad english isn't my mother tongue)
