There's quite a few 'funniest phrase/comment' etc posts going around at the moment, so here's mine.

You know how to enter the visitor's entrance to the Ministry of Magic, you get in a phonebooth, dial MAGIC, then state your name and purpose? And you get a badge?

In fanfiction, what are the funnier statements of intent and subsequent badges you've seen?

e.g. Seventh Horcrux, Ron's comment about brownnosing gets him a badge labelled 'Meeting the Minister'.


** There's one where Scrimgeour sends Harry a howler and tells him his parents would be ashamed of what he's been doing lately. So Harry immediately heads for the Ministry and says "I'm here to give Rufus Scrimgeour a piece of my mind!"

He's given a badge that says "Living Howler". The people with him get badges that say "moral support".

#+begin_quote
  There was a soft click and a badge slid out of the change dispenser of the phone. Sirius picked it up, pinning it to the front of his robes with obvious delight.

  /Sirius Black/, Harry read, laughing despite himself, /up to no good./

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** +Shit, I can't remember the fanfiction, but there was one where death eaters went to take over the ministry at night, and entered through the phone boot, stating their reason for visiting as : "murder and mayhem". And the badge was printed as such.+

OKAY, as [[/u/Dreikorg]] pointed out, the fanfiction is xerosis and here's the actual quote:

"Once everyone was in, Xerosis typed in the numbers. "Please state the purpose behind your business at the Ministry of Magic," the pleasant voice requested as the booth started its decent.

"Lord Xerosis and Death Eaters, here for the purpose of death and destruction," Xerosis intoned in a bored voice.

"Please enjoy your visit to the Ministry of Magic," the voice replied as five buttons popped out of the bottom.

Xerosis glanced at the buttons, then passed he four stating 'Death Eater, Violence Against Ministry Personal and Property' back to the others behind him, smirking to himself.

  AU. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, he went to Stonewall Secondary. His main goal in life was to leave the Dursleys' and go to college, until Remus Lupin finds him on his seventeenth birthday and his life changes all at once. See Ch 1 AN for more info.
