Delenda Est, Narcissa's Chance, Laughing all the way to London, stuff like that.

If at all possible, I'd prefer reading longer stories than one-shots or really short stories. You know, something that can occupy me for a long time.

And please, no slash.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

**** Same here. But I keep hoping the author will go back to it. One benefit to Covid-19 and the quarantine was that a couple of stories I thought were abandoned got updated. I think the oldest had last been updated 5 years ago. So I hold out hope and check once a year.

For a twist here is a Bellatrix goes back in time and gets with Harry. It's call Bellatrix's Second Chance by Winmau
