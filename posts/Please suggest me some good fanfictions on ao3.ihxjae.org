** Apologies if any of these are double-posted - I generally prefer reading from ao3 over ffn... some might be in both places without me noticing. Also: you haven't discovered the glory of tags, obviously.

Here's a bunch and it doesn't even scratch the surface. linkao3(12424344; 20174284; 17926664; 5121464; 13695783; 2535527; 11249700; 23382799; 4472270; 7833937; 1134255)

Note: Whispers In Corners is... non-explicit slash. Very, very minimal romance that's a side-thing in the story. And this story is /absolutely fantastic and utterly unique./ Give this one a shot if you're fine with background slash pairings, because it's not a big thing in the story and it'll be worth the attempt.

Note 2: Muggle Management looks short, but it's the first installment of a larger series. And yes, the series can be considered finished as is.

Um, and I should probably do ffnbot!slim too.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  Maze knew there was something different about the bone-thin child in rags she'd seen rummaging through a trash can for food. She was going to find him again and figure this out. He shouldn't be any harder to track down than a rogue demon after all, his appearance was quite distinctive. Scruffy black hair, round glasses, and a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead.Contains a quick overview of the Lucifer (TV) fandom.

  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.

**** Do it the other way: go to exclude, and exclude m/m, f/f, and multi (this will get rid of some f/m harems, but mostly m/m/m).

Or... search for specific pairings or tropes. Exclude things you don't want to see (I almost always add fem harry and tomarry to exclusions for example). You can keep applying filter after filter to your search.

It's a much more powerful search system than ffn, but there definitely is a bit of a learning curve getting used to how people tag things.

****** There is a filter sidebar... Top is must haves, middle is must nots, and the bottom is length, language, etc. Very bottom is a 'search within'... When browsing, anyway.

Include/exclude is pretty much every tag you can think of.
