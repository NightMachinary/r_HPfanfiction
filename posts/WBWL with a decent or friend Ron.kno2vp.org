In most WBWL fics, the BWL is an arrogant arsehole and Ron is his lackey which constantly follows him and shouts at anyone who dares to disrespect him. Even if the WBWL is decent then also Ron is WBWL's best friend and not Harry's.

Is there even one WBWL fanfiction which includes a decent Ron who is a friend of Harry?

*** Honestly we should either have a bot that replies with PoS for every post OR autodelete it's mention (cause it literally does explore everything and yet has not really gone anywhere due to all the tangents, so it's just all a big disappointment)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
