Hello!

I'm looking for a Harry that doesn't go around white knighting. I don't want him always eager to help and play the hero.

What I want is a Harry that cares only for himself and those close to him. No need for an "edgy dark Harry", simply someone that lives for himself not for others.

Thanks!


** I don't know many such stories.

The only one that has any semblance of quality is linkffn(Harry Potter and the apathy of freedom by nonjon), but he goes around white-knighting magical creatures, kinda.

Also, linkffn(A black comedy by nonjon) might fit - Harry certainly is self-serving often, though it isn't any focus of the fic, so I'm not sure.

I'm sorry that I can't give you more than these two admittedly poor matches.

Generally there are the Azkaban!Harry fics (search this sub for "Azkaban"), but most will have people Harry genuinly cares for rather fast, and where he will be willing to sacrifice hinself.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results. A seemingly simple step pitched his life into a direction no one had ever expected. Harry Potter, the Jack of all trades and Master of Misdirection. Intelligent! Harry.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.
