But I wanted something good. Nothing like "Hermione is pureblood, friends don't want to know her, she is in slytherin and best friend with Draco and co"

No!

I wanted something where Hermione can't accept that she is adopted. Something where she love Grangers and don't want knew family. Where her friends support her (really? In what earth Harry would abandon her for share blood with Nott or Zabini?)

I really like concept family. I was obsessed with fics like "Harry in another dimension where his parents are alive".

And now I want to read something with Hermione :)

But I can't find anything like that... Any help?


** Yes, please! Just once, I'd like to see a Hogwarts-era fic where Hermione learns that she is adopted and her values and loyalties /don't/ do an immediate 180.

** In linkffn(Nihil est ab omni parte beatum by Seselt), Hermione is adopted and is very unhappy when she learns about it (for a good reason). This is a major element of the story, but not its primary focus.

In linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean), she is adopted and embraces all three sides (the Grangers, the biological father's, the biological mother's). The adoption is crucially important for the plot, but is not its focus.

  An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.

** It's been quite a while since I've read this one, but I don't think Hermione had learned yet that she was adopted when the author stopped updating.
