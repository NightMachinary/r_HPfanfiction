#+begin_quote
  were the three brothers of the tale,' said Dumbledore, nodding. ‘Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road ... I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.
#+end_quote

They're not perfect objects, and they're still limited by the ultimate rules of HP. You can't bring someone back from the dead. They're flawed objects, reflecting the fact that humans are flawed. They're powerful, the cloak can hide multiple people and has lasted far longer than any other invisibility cloak, but they're not perfect.

Edit: [[/u/BasaltOnFire][u/BasaltOnFire]] deleted his comments, so I'm adding the relevant information from the chain below:

#+begin_quote
  Q: but they exsist in Canon, like the stone at the battle, so the Cloak is true Hallow that even Death was unable to detect....

  and yet Moody has even more power then Death. wth (what the heck?)

  A: Yes, the objects exist. But they're not created by death. They're created by people.

  The stone was an attempt to create an object capable of resurrection. It could summon shades but could not truly bring back people.

  Moody doesn't have more power than death. Moody's enchanted eye is simply superior to Peverell's enchanted invisibility cloak in their contest of concealment and detection.

#+begin_quote
  the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner.

  I mean to say, it is not a travelling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it.

Even it wasn't created by death - think that makes the marauders map even more impressive. Not only did they invent a map that shows all people in Hogwarts but it also trumps the cloaks magic.

Absolutely right, I find that all the time in the book, if you need to tell your readers something just put it in her. There are only two characters that you can put it convincingly into their dialogue. One is Hermione, the other is Dumbledore. In both cases you accept, it's plausible that they have, well Dumbledore knows pretty much everything anyway, but that Hermione has read it somewhere. So, she's handy.

Flow of ideas:

Legend is untrue --> cannot be relied on as evidence

Dumbledore states that the objects are created by people --> moody's eye is created by a wizard --> moody's eye could detect Harry under the cloak --> moody's eye's enchantments were superior to those of the cloak.

This is not the only instance. Dumbledore could also detect Harry.

Was it? It was always referred to as pieces. Sure, Hagrid could cast some small stuff, like igniting a fire, pushing the boat, etc. But when he tried to turn Dudley into a pig, it fizzled out.

Ron got away with a broken wand for a year, and IIRC, it fizzled out or failed spectacularly for the "complicated" stuff.

***** I think that's more a reflection of Hagrid's patchwork magical education (he gets some training, but a poor foundation). For example, Hagrid casts aguamenti, a 6th year charm, very well (a jet of water as opposed to a trickle. Hagrid manages a partial human transfiguration, and silently as well. The wand isn't the issue, it's his education.

Ron's wand, on the other hand, botched the simplest of spells in spectacular ways. It wasn't a failure to perform at its peak. It straight up hexed the caster. And Ron's was only broken at the tip, still hanging on. Hagrid's wand was completely snapped in two (and I doubt they just snapped it at the tip). A human transfiguration with a broken wand? That sounds like a guide to killing yourself or someone else; it's dangerous enough with a working wand.

Hagrid might refer to it as being in pieces, but I doubt he wants to incriminate himself. He's very nervous about talking about the umbrella. This doesn't make sense if it's in pieces. It's legal to have the pieces so long as you don't use them. And I doubt Dumbledore is sending Hagrid on missions without a working wand. Hagrid's bad enough with magic as it is.

So allegedly does not mean what you think it means. Using allegedly means that's the reason given as to the reason for the cloak's creation, something thought to be true or asserted to be true. A fairy tale or legend, like the myth of the tooth fairy, is not something that is alleged. I do not say that "the tooth fairy allegedly took my teeth as a kid." The use of allegedly does not imply something to be untrue, it implies something to be true, though more evidence might be needed to prove the assertion.

The fact that the legend is untrue grants us this:

Cloak was not made to escape death --> the fact that Moody is not death is irrelevant --> an alternative explanation must be sought besides "Moody is not death, therefore the cloak does not hide from Moody?"

Now if you had said:

** Possible explanations:

1. In Book 4, the concept of the Hallows didn't exist yet. J.K Rowling forgot about Moody seeing Harry as she retconned the Cloak into one of the Hallows.
2. The Cloak makes you invisible, not inaudible or impossible to sense in other ways. Moody didn't /see/ Harry, but Harry gave himself away enough for a paranoid bastard to know he's there.
3. The legend is just that, a legend - not entirely true. The Cloak doesn't actually hide you from /everything/, it's just an Invisibility Cloak that lasts forever and can be thwarted by magical sight.
