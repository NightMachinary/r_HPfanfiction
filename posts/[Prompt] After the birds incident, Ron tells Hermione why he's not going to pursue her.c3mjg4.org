Write this fic with a Ron with a bit of self-worth. Hermione's canon actions could be looked at.


** "Well,putting it frank,you've always been a bit of a bitch" said Ron with pursed lips

Hermione began to sputter a denial but no coherent words came out of her

Ron immediately began a rant that he seemed to been bottling for years

" You've always seem to think that just because you've caught the best grades,you've got the right to act like you're some sorta god . You're always shtting on Lavender and Parvati and I don't think you've ever even spoken to Sally-Anne or Fay. You don't know the names of anyone in our year who wasn't in the DA even though we've been in classes together for six years "

" Terry and Michael tell me that Marietta cries herself to sleep every night. Yeah,she was a bloody sneak but the purebloods are shallow cunts in this world and you've pretty much killed her chances of ever getting a decent career."

"Your parents are well-off and they know it. I've seen the way they look at my parents when they think everyone's turned their backs. You get a nice fancy house,a big room with all the books you want and holidays to France when even my bloody pet was a hand-me because my dad committed the crime of being a decent and honest person in Wizarding Britain."

"And before you bloody start,the fact that Scabbers was that fat bastard doesn't excuse how you acted like it was my fault that your fucking animal,kept trying to kill one of the only things I own. It being Pettigrew DOES NOT excuse or justify you being a self-righteous bitch in anyway"

"Now if you'll excuse me,I'm seeing Lavender in Hogsmeade later. And before I came to see you,I resigned from the Quidditch team and told Mcgonagall what really happened at the tryouts,so have fun with that."

*** /Slow clap/

The narrative always calls out Ron and Harry for their mistakes, but Hermione gets a pass or some sort of caveat that shows she was right or somewhat right after the fact (The broom, Pettigrew, Lavender's pet, etc).

This fixes that nicely.

**** Can't forget her gloating about the potions book after Dumbledore dies. Did she ever learn tact in school? If she did all her actions in the war, but wasn't friends with Harry, she would have just ended up in a low-level department.

The next book she promptly starts using spells from it and no one bats an eye.

Hermione in the books was a hypocrite and a boring character. It's why I prefer a smarter Harry and an older student mentor like Percy or Cedric. It makes getting certain information palatable, and it makes Hermione's character actually have to grow to stay relevant.

The movies made mistakes in the other direction, making her character too perfect. Emma Watson is pretty yes, but her character ended up stealing lines and being a Mary-Sue. Also, I find her voice annoying. So much smugness.

** "What the bloody hell?!" Ron screeched as he ducked under the birds that Hermoine had conjured to attack him. Harry quickly vanished them with wide eyes and a slack jaw. Hermoine, in turn, turned a sharp glare behind her at her friend.

"Whose side are you on?" She hissed through closed teeth.

"Why are you attacking him?" Harry asked dumbfounded. Ron was nodded in agreement on the other side of Hermoine.

"Because!" She screeched. Both Harry and Ron flinched at the high pitched toned. Harry rubbed his right ear while she continued, "He chose Lavendar over me!" Harry stopped rubbing his ear and looked at her confused.

"You attacked him because you're jealous?"

"I. Am. Not," She threw a stinging hex at Harry who dodged it. It, unfortunately, hit Ginny as she entered through the portrait hole. Seamus, who was next to her, cried out in surprise when blood started to seep from the cutting hex that hit Ginny's cheek. Hermoine ignored the two continuing her tyrant, "JEALOUS!"

Ron was attempting to sneak past her to get two his sister but she rounded on him brandishing her wand directly between his eyes, "I can't believe you're choosing that BITCH over me!"

"I'm not," Harry mumbled lowly only to receive a minor blasting hex. The wind rushed out of his lungs when he slammed against the stone wall. He groaned as he pushed himself onto all fours.

"This is why!" Ron motioned to Harry with an open hand. "You just attack people for no reason." In the corner of his eye, he could see Ginny getting to her feet with a murderous look. He also saw Lavander standing behind her and Seamus with a murderous look.

"You belittle Harry for doing better than you because Heaven forbid someone is better than you!"

"He was cheating!"

Ron ignored her and kept going, "You are controlling. You look down on others because they don't know as much as you. Then when you don't get something you want you to throw a hissy fit. You attack people! You think you are above rules!"

Harry finally stopped wheezing and had pushed himself to a standing position once again. He was slowly inching toward the portrait wall while Hermoine's back was turned.

"I do not," She rebutted with a scrunched nose.

"So then what was the polyjucie in the second year?"

"That was because of you and Harry!"

"Oh? What because you can do no wrong?" Ron was moving the opposite way Harry was heading so she wouldn't see him. Once he stopped moving, her back was to the group in the entrance. To keep her attention her kept goading her, "How about the way you treated Trewlany? Or Marietta? Let's be frank, you're a bloody bitch."

She snapped her jaw closed with a loud snap and raised her wand readying to strike when Ginny screamed out a /Stupefy/ hitting her square in the back. Her body seized up before lurching forward and dropping to the ground with a loud thud.

Lavender had darted out of the entrance to find McGonagall while Harry and Seamus flanked Ginny. The bleeding had stopped but there was still a bright red angry gash on her left cheek. Harry was pulling air in but his breaths were shaky and rugged. Seamus had a look that was halfway between surprised and pissed.

Meeting Harry's eyes his shoulders slumped down, "Fuck this."

** “Because we aren't the slightest bit compatible. You're too critical for me; I'm a guy that needs frequent affirmation and affection. Lavender gives that in spades.”

That's all you need. Don't need to turn it into some cringe Hermione-bashing session. Ron did very mean things to Hermione throughout their time at Hogwarts. Hermione was rarely an aggressor in those scenarios. Even with the scabbers incident, any responsible pet owner would cage such a vulnerable creature. Real rat owners do that. I grew up with cats and a lizard, I just made sure that the lizard was caged whenever the cats were around and only brought out the lizard when I knew it was safe. It's really not that hard.

*** People are divided on Scabbers. Hermione's pet was attacking him, and considering these magical pets are well trained I could see why Ron was angry. As a counter-argument, toads for instance are often hunted by cats.

However, for this, I took offense at her attacking him for simply having a good time with his girlfriend. Is that a healthy way no.

I'm of the personal opinion Hermione's character had potential, but since Rowling needed an easy source of exposition, left undeveloped.

Oh Crookshanks behavior was fine after all, Scabbers was a freaking Death Eater.

Oh I'm didn't think you would get the prefect badge that Harry deserves, oh Dumbledore gave it to Harry.

Oh the potions book was bad, oh the writer was Snape.

Rowling never really let her learn from her mistakes. Hell, I would have liked an arc where she just was more empathetic to other people's feelings. For all the fandom's complaint about tactless Ron, look at Hermione. A girl who started correcting people without prompting in book 1, tattled to a teacher and dismissed the death of a pet (Ron and Lavender's), degraded Luna's dad and her, manipulated a friend into teaching the class while he was tortured, pretty much told Ron she thought he was a bad Quidditch player when it turned out the felix felicis was not given, and rubbed it in Harry's face after Dumbledore died.

​

Also, let's give a scenario. Instead of Hermione, reverse it and have Ron send birds at Hermione at the yule ball.

**** Again, any responsible pet owner doesn't let their small animal pets out in the open at all times like that. Trevor ran off. That should be at least a partial example of why one shouldn't do it even without other pets acting as predators.

Did you even read what I said? She didn't “attack him for having a good time.” She sicked the birds on him because he burst in at an emotionally fragile moment with a reminder of the source of that anguish. And the Lavender incident is after they had already agreed to go on as dates to Slughorn's party together, so don't give me that innocent “he was just enjoying his girlfriend” line. He was purposely spurning the girl he supposedly loved to get back at her and his sister because he was jealous.

If you didn't know Luna you'd likely degrade her dad too since he'd basically be the well-meaning wizarding version of Alex Jones with all his conspiracy theories. Hermione is someone who thinks in logical terms, of course listening to the stuff Luna refers to would be a point of derision for her. It's not as if Hermione publicly shamed her with comments of what a nightmare Luna was.

“Manipulated a friend while he was being tortured” oh dear lord, please. You're seeing what you want to see with bash-tinted lenses. Seriously? Hermione was the one helping Harry with the pain after his sessions with Umbridge and she motivated Harry into a leadership position he excelled at that helped boost his confidence where everyone else including Dumbledore seemed to undermine him. Hermione was an excellent friend to Harry in fifth year and there's no way around it.

The comment about the Felix Felicis is a bit moot given that she saw Harry, who made an active effort to make it look like he was giving Ron the potion. Of course she'd be suspicious.

What's the point of your scenario? They're completely different contexts and Hermione did nothing to Ron during the Yule Ball. She was having a good time before he ruined the night for her with his jealousy. And before you try to compare it to HBP, no, they're not the same. While what Hermione did with the canaries wasn't right it was absolutely incited by Ron taking actions meant to hurt her.

** Hermione angrily stomps through the common room, pushing people aside in a mindless quest; to teach Ron a lesson.

"Avis!," Hermione hissed. A flock of birds emerged out of the tip of the wand, fueled by her malicious intent.

Ron, with his hand around Lavender's shoulder, turned around to find out the cause of the commotion. He leapt out of the sofa in surprise, startling Lavender and the rest of the common room.

"Bloody hell Hermione! What's with the birds?" Ron said, frazzled.

"This, Ronald, is /justice."/ Hermione motioned her wand to Ron and the birds started pecking him.

Ron screamed in pain, Harry came out of his dorm and was shocked to see what was going on.

"Evanesco!" Harry vanished the birds. "What the fuck is going on here?" Harry demanded, patience running low after a few seconds of no reply. The room was silent, waiting to see what the outcome would be.

Hermione sputtered- "He was cavorting with that hussy!" She said, pointing at Lavender.

Ron finally lost it, "Shut up Hermione! Don't call Lavender that horrible name!"

Hermione started to speak, but Ron cut her off, getting into stride. "For all your intelligence Hermione, you've always been a judgmental bitch. I was actually going to ask you out before dating Lavender, but I remembered how you treat me and Harry. Harry beat you in Potions, and you had to throw a hissy fit!"

Hermion cut in, "What Harry did was cheating!"

"SHUT UP! I'm not done! Do you know what, I've resigned from the Quidditch team. McLaggen deserves to be there more than me, and he would been there in the first place if you hadn't meddled! You treat me like I'm an illiterate! I've been sticking with you for Harry's sake!"

"Eh, I've been sticking with her for your sake!" Harry said, puzzled.

Hermione actually started to tear up, were her first two friends actually going to leave her?

"But Ron, I like you romantically! That's why I was angry at you!" Hermione said, tears leaking down her cheeks.

Ron lowered his voice. "That is life. Jealousy will not win you anyone's heart. I thought I loved you as well, but I can't ever bring myself to think like that anymore."

That was the last straw for Hermione. She had finally seen their points and recognized herself. She ran out of the room, sobbing.

Ron ran a hand through his hair. This encounter had been difficult for him, no matter his outward bravado. Lavender comforted him, and thanked him for standing up for her.

"It's no problem," Ron said, with a strained smile.

"Come on mate, lets get you to Pomfrey, and then we'll sneak out to Hogsmeade," Harry put his arm around Ron, trying to cheer him up.

"Yeah," Ron managed a half-smile.

As they walked out, the common room was silent, having witnessed the biggest fallout of Hogwarts.

*** you should've stressed the real important part: that it is NOT okay for hermione to assault somebody and then expect them to love you back.

hermione has assaulted ron TWICE in the series: the birds, and later in book 7 when she attacked him with her own fists. that's literally a pattern of abuse.

ron on the other hand has never once put a hand on HER, so all those stupid as ron the death eater stories should be hermione the death eater. she has the record of abuse.

ron should've said "why would i want to be with somebody who hurts me just for being with someone else?" cause seriously hermione is fucked up with that. ron was with lavender freely, hermiones got no claim over him. and she can't just attack him over her own petty feelings and THEN expect him to still love her too! like fuck. she's abusive and unhealthy.

and if she ever did that to ME i'd tell her to fuck off if she wanted to date me later! i'd never date someone who attacked me over her jealousy like that.

and i'd love to read an actual post war fic where hermione continues to abuse ron over petty shit and he divorces her and gets help for being an abuse victim. takes his kids with him too for a wholesome single dad story maybe!

And I'm pretty sure that advocating genocide is illegal as well, yet you don't see Malfoy expelled for doing so. Hell, the guy commented countless counts of war crimes, attempted three murders and was part of a fascist paramilitary group aimed at committing a genocide and yet he isn't behind bars or executed, as the Allies would have done with him.

Also, have you never seen teenagers fight/brawl? It is rather common but rarely results in criminal charges. And Hermione didn't even cause any significant or lasting injuries.

********** If the punch wasn't serious enough to cause any damage, then no, why should it? (Bruising counts as injury).

If you go to court over it, the case would immediately be dismissed due to the insignificance of the damage caused. You might get that fine for insulting the other side's honour, but anything more would be unreasonable. And even that would depend whether the court decides that the gesture used was insulting or not. The common example here is being slapped, which does not count as assault unless you cause significant harm, but is considered insulting.

The Police don't hunt you with helicopters if you are ten over the limit, they give you fine or perhaps a stern talking to. The same principle applies here.

I have made it repeatedly clear that I was arguing within German legal standards, but even in the UK Hermione would at most face a fine since it's a first offense and there are mitigating circumstances as well, not to mention that no court would actually persecute an alleged spell which set a flock of birds at someone. And there seems to be no magical law against it since McLaggen wasn't arrested for nearly killing Harry with a Beater's bat which he had no business handling. I did my research, unlike you.

"I can't believe you would cavort with the enemy," yelled Ron.

He stormed past her to the staircase, paused, and turned around.

"AVIS! OPPUGNO!" Ron bellowed. The birds shot towards Hermione like golden bullets, pecking and scratching at every available bit of flesh.

"Ow! Stop, please!" Hermione yelled. She screamed in pain as Ron shot a look of vindictive fury and shot up the stairs. Harry thought he could hear a sob.

**** Please. You're behaving as if Hermione premeditated an attack on him. She was in emotional turmoil and wanted to be alone, especially from Ron since he was the source of her pain. And then he barges in, admittedly unintentionally, further flaunting the cause of that pain in her face. She lashed out in a moment of anguish and it was clearly a “get out” measure rather than a “let me sock you in the gut” one. It wasn't right but please stop pretending that she was some vicious abuser and Ron was an innocent angel in all this. He was behaving like a jerk all year even to his own sister. Neither character was in the right.

***** It's not premeditated, but she still attacked him with a method that's meant to be particularly painful. She was leaving the room and then decided to send birds to attack him. It definitely wasn't right, but acting like a jerk to his sister is irrelevant.

Ron was a jerk about Krum. That fact is true. They were going to go to a party, which Hermione tried asking him as a guest, not a date. Ron decides to start dating Lavender. They go to make out. Hermione is jealous so decides to attack Ron.

  The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.

  “Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed.
#+end_quote

The fact is that Hermione attacked him. What really disgusts me is the mention of the sob. She just attacked him and Rowling sets up the dialogue so you're supposed to sympathize with Hermione's breaking heart. She had no justified cause. It's that simple. Whatever moral high ground she had went out the window when she sent the birds to tear at Ron's flesh.

Now you are grasping at straws. The Cruciatus curse would fit that description, or any number of spells meant to recreate actual torture methods. I mean, I'd give you that point if it was a flock of eagles or similar birds of prey, but by the sounds of it, it was closer to sparrows than falcons.

Also, that description is a case of unreliable narrative since you can't see bullets, nor are they golden.

Oh yeah definitely, especially with no priors. I mean if Harry and Ron were vindictive they might throw her under the bus for brewing the polyjuice or setting Snape on fire or scarring Marietta and given the Ministry's attitude, she might be convicted. But I don't see that.

What I really want is for people to show why the bird attack is unforgivable for a friend to do to another friend for no justifiable reason.

I dislike canon Hermione. She had no character growth and was just as tactless as Ron. The way you treat her in the fics without her as a love interest is how I like seeing her in fics.

Her attacking Ron should have been the end of that burgeoning relationship, but the Harry Potter fics just ignore abuse.

She goes from "Or worse, expelled" to "I will organise an underground group to oppose a tyrannical government representative" and "Number 2 most wanted for fighting the fascist government and their ongoing mini-Holocaust".

*********** Rowling needed her character to explain things and Ron for some odd reason. The Yule ball would have been a valid location for their friendship to end, although I do think you're being a bit harsh to Ron.

The issue is that her character consistently did that. I actually view her ruthless protectiveness as one of her best traits. She lit a teacher on fire, brewed restrictioned potions, and broke time (although I give Dumbledore the majority of credit for that). I don't feel she grew because it was already there the first book.

She was willing to break major rules as of book 1. But that made her static later on.

I'm surprised Umbridge never went after her in the books. Harry was the one targeted.
