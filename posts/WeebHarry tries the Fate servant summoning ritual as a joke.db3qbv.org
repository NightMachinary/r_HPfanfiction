It succeeds, and he summons anything but a caster.

Or even better, the most unhelpful caster possible.


** Harry wants to start the ritual, but it's spread over several books, magazines, loose sheets of paper and even some musical notation. He asks everyone just where he's supposed to start this whole fate/stay night ritual thing and everyone gives a different answer. One student insists you have to do the whole thing in Japanese.

Frustrated by the disorder of ritual he gives it up as a bad job.

  ‘Because -- oh, shut up laughing, you two -- because they've both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball!' said Ginny.

  That shut Harry and Ron up.

  ‘Thanks a bunch, Ginny,' said Ron sourly.

  ‘All the good-looking ones taken, Ron?' said */Astolfo/* loftily. ‘Eloise Midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I'm sure you'll find someone somewhere who'll have you.'

  But Ron was staring at */Astolfo/* as though suddenly seeing him in a whole new light. ‘ */Astolfo/*, Neville's right -- you are a girl ...'

  ‘Oh, well spotted,' he said acidly.

  ‘Well -- you can come with one of us!'

** Harry summons Frankenstein, who spends her time trying to marry him and being generally useless. With zero magic resistance and no skills or parameters above B, she's almost worse than a wizard in a fight. Since she can't speak or express herself, she's not even good at moral support.

On the other hand, having someone to take care of and who watches over him would probably be good for Harry.

** "Ahahah, I cant believe it worked, I did this as a joke..."

"Master? !"

"Wait, I Just got stuck in a worse tourment... Bloody hell"

"I will save you Master!"

Harry summons Saber Jeanne how ends devolving to jeanne alter with a horcrux, Hermione summons Mod!Harry that subverts our expections by betraying Hermione to give the grail to his younger selft instead of murdering him. Hagrid rides Chiron into battle and kiritsugo has Berserker Hercules because we need a insame last boss.

*** Harry and Shakespeare would actually be a extremely good combo, since Harry's life already follows a certain narrative with him as the Hero, Caster's noble phantasm would probably increase Harry's plot armor even further and since this is Weeb!Harry he would know to use command spells to forbid Caster from writing a Tragedy.
