Why are there SO many new fics that keep bashing the same old characters? There are tons of bashing fics, if someone wants to read one there are many available. Why do people need to write a fic that is rehashed from other bashing fics? I started reading HP Fanfics a year ago and I went through the "bashing phase", because then it was a new way of poking holes in a fic. Now I just find it cringey and most new fics I find nowadays who have potential have bashing in them.

Ahh... Rant over!


** Well, what you just said. You went through a bashing phase. A lot of people do. So there'll always be bashing fics. Also, a lot of people have a very black and white view of the world and don't see the characters they dislike objectively.

** Also also, a lot of them aren't concerned how many of the same fics there are. They hate +their own incorrect perceptions of+ a particular character and they just feel they have to bash said character like the dead horse it is at this point. I know this because I too went through a bashing phase, and I remember the feeling.

** I honestly don't think it counts as bashing anymore. It's just a whole new, established character. Manipulative!Dumbledore has traits and a backstory that is, in some places, marginally different than the canon version. Evil Weasleys are also established characters with different traits than their canon counterparts, and so are the Good Malfoys. But among all the Evil Weasley and Good Malfoy fanfiction, the characters are pretty similar.

I like to think it is like different versions of comic book characters. Like, both Adam West Batman and Bale Batman come from the same character, but they are completely different.

This. Exactly this. People don't understand this. There's plenty of characters who are the good guy most of the time, but pop up occasionally as the bad guy and vice versa.

** I don't think a lot of the writers actually hate the charachters. It's just a cheap way to cause tension. They want Harry to appear as the intelligent independent guy, but it's easier to dumb down everyone else than to write a realistically competent Harry.

** Personally, I first read a bashing (maybe not a bashing since the character is meant to be hated) about Dolores Umbridge. The writing was horrible but I liked it because I wanted to see a person who tortures children get their just deserts.

I also feel that there will always be a demand for bashing fics due to multiple personal preferences of readers. People looking for bashings will always be looking to read new bashing stories, as opposed to rereading the best bashing fics constantly.

I too have gotten over the "bashing" phase but as long as there are new readers, the demand will more than likely always be there.

** It's weird to think that people seem to go through bashing phases. I went through a very short (about two months long) where I thought Theodore Nott and Millicent Bulstrode were good people, but I never thought less about a character than what I originally thought about them when reading the books.

*** Tbh my bashing phase didn't make me think less about the characters, but it made me think why did they take certain actions (eg Dumbledore). I wasn't exactly looking for these types of fics, but I wouldn't say no reading them.

** Because they have little creativity. It's easier to follow the same old Indy!Harry plot that bashes Ron, Dumbledore and/or Hermione or Super!Harmony fic that makes Ron and Ginny manipulative, potion giving idiots than try something new. I get it. Sometimes they can't think of anything new, or they just want clicks. Other times they DO have something new, but they're afraid of flames. But the result is that we end up with thousands of the same old fic with slightly different variations.

** Because it is lazy cheap plot. Let's see linkffn(A Different Halloween by RobSt). He started with pretty nice idea of saving Potters at the Halloween â€˜81. Sugar sweet, tooth-rotting, certainly, but for those who like this stuff, it is not half-bad. However, there is no story, no plot for more than two chapters. Then the author was still a bit fooling around, when suddenly in the middle of the chapter three, he even killed Voldemort (in a very nice way: Tom Riddle hasn't read the fine print), and there was absolutely no plot to write.

In this point, the author had two good options:

1. Just stop. It would be a nice short story, which could work reasonably well. Nothing against it.

2. Throw whole thing away, and consider it just a first draft. Sit down and create first the real plot, real story, with the first three chapter just as an initial setup. It would be a lot of work, but it could be good.

The author was not humble enough to stop and lazy enough not to work on the real story, so he took the third bad option: pull out from his behind the only other person he had around (Albus Dumbledore), make him into the Evil Incarnate, and write another seventeen chapters of the cheap stuff about the struggle with this straw man.

** There's whole fanon ideas around characters and if that's their jig then they're bound to have run through all the decent ones, so people write more. Most of that won't be any good, as fic is a playground for practising writing and so the hunt goes on.

I've never really got into bashing, though when younger I did think of some fics that I thought had done well. As I've got older, my view on characters has shifted to have more nuance and different understandings/preferences. I read a greater range of characterisations, provided the author can convince it

My impression is that bashing fics are often younger fans, or those who still have black and white views. Other's are just people who got into a particular fanon characterisation and stick with it as much as I am a stickler for canon.

** Bashing begets bashing. If you read bashing stories, like those disgusting slavery apologist stories that invent "reasons" why elves should be slaves, you might write the same drivel.

** Everyone goes through the bashing phase at some point. If you ever read a robst fic, you'll want a Hermione bashing fic to balance out the sycophantic Hermione worship bordering on God Emperor of Mankind level of devotion. I only tend to want to read bashing fics after I've read ridiculous glorification fics. If I'm reading a good fic and then suddenly Snape turns out to be kind, caring, and it turns out to be Severitus (Sounds like a Wizarding disease to me) utterly ruining what was a good fic til that point, then I want full on Snape bashing in the next fic I read. Perfectly Balanced, as all things should be, to quote Thanos.
