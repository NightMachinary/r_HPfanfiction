I was thinking that it's a bit surprising that people don't write a fic where Harry has a horcrux (if someone has I have not seen it). Imagine after killing Quirrell he somehow makes the Philosopher's Stone a horcrux. What do you think? Is it plausible?


** Purposely, in canon? No.

Creating a horcrux requires more than death, it requires outright murder, purposeful murder, though Rowling hasn't gone into detail beyond that.

It could happen in an AU where Harry is a lot more evil though.:)

*** Also Harry did not outright kill Quirrell. He just hurt him in order to get him to leave him alone. He later succumbed to his wounds and died but could have still been saved. We don't know what kind of murder is required for splitting your soul but according to Slughorn's statement that "Isn't it enough to think of killing someone?", creating a horcrux implies a form of intent.

** As Cyfric_G said, it is not plausible in Canon.

As explained in HBP, the creation of an Horcruxe require for the wizard to murder someone, not just kill but murder. It is something that harry has never done, and even the death of Quirrell does not count since it was more self defence (not to mention more on Voldemort than Harry).

But even then, the "murder" is only the first step of the creation of an Horcux, and only able to rip the soul apart. The creation on a Horcrux also ask to truly separate the torn portion of the soul and to put it it a vessel, by a process never mentioned in Canon (Rowling said in an interview that is was something disgusting, that she didn't want to put in writing or something like that).

Anyways, the point is that the "accidental" creation of an Horcrux is something that /shouldn't/ be possible. Voldemort only did it with Harry because his own soul was in shatter after the creation of several Horcrux. And even then, some theories say that he had planned to use the death of the Potters to create another Horcrux (since he was not yet at 7 in 1981), and had already made the preparation beforehand which means that a part of his soul was already detached from the rest (though it is not confirmed by canon and is just a pretty popular theory).

** A muggle raised average first year making a Horcrux? I think not, not even Voldemort would be able to make a Horcrux in his first year(I highly doubt it).

It would need to be extremely AU with Harry having been trained by a Dark Wizard pre Hogwarts. I assume its pretty complicated magic.

*** Oh yea if it was on purpose but I think I should have added “accidental” or something. That's on me
