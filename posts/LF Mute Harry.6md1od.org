**** "This boy seemed to have some sort of authority that could be used against him and so Harry decided the best option was to play it safe and respond.

"Well that's not a very good answer" the boy said."

He's not completely mute.

***** I think it was Percy that said "Well that's not a very good answer" If you go re-read that part. I think he shrugged his shoulders, since later in the dialog he only replied with gestures.

Harry in this fic only communicates via writing or gestures, I still have a few chapters to go before I reach the last chapter, but I can safely say, he is mute so far, granted its not a physical disability, more on an emotional level, so he might start speaking again later down the line.

****** It was Percy, after this point Harry takes out his wand to write his name and Percy goes for his wand as well. So there's really no way for Harry to have responded other then verbally.

  HPCharmed XOver. The Dursley's hate magic so much they are willing to try & handicap Harry to insure he doens't become a Wizard. However the wizarding community aren't the only ones watching over Harry & someone intends to intervene. Rating T to be safe

**** American television show from the late 90s/early 2000s. The 'magic' on the show was much closer to 'Wiccan' than what is encountered in Harry Potter.

The show is mainly remembered for becoming a thinly veiled excuse for Alyssa Milano to run around half naked.

** You know what I want to see? Ziz/Simurgh!Harry.

Don't know what Ziz or the Simurgh are? Read /Worm./

And if you don't have time for that, let me explain. In Worm, [[https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/parahumans/images/c/cb/Simurgh.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160122231952][the Simurgh, A.k.a. Ziz,]] is a fifteen-foot-tall, nigh-indestructible pre- and post-cog (can see the future and the past, but not the present) that can both build fantastical and devastating weapons and can scream in a way that drives people murderously insane.

Fandoms being fandoms, people like giving weakened versions of her powers to the main character of Worm. In the case of the fanfic [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ziz-worm-altpower-simurgh-taylor.512524/][Ziz]], the main character can't speak at all or she drives people insane with her voice. But she has all of the Simurgh's other powers too.

I think it would be quite funny for a mute-by-choice Harry to have those powers and just have fun with them.

*** There isn't enough of that in the normal fanfiction. The endbringer trend in the fandom seems to be dying though.

In other news, I just want more HP/Worm crossovers in general. Btw, there is a [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/travelers-guide-to-the-multiverse-hp-worm-crossover.544303/][new one]].
