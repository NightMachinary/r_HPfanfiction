  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

Is this sort of what you are looking for?

He turns into a girl and comes to school with a new name. Pretty good story, hopefully you like it.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

** Corvus Black by Fizazh is a good one. It features wizard politics, very realistic dialogue and networking, and a tastefully handsome Harry (a.k.a Corvus Black). linkffn(10478838)
