I don't really care who is the lead, as long as it's a female character, and the focus on the story is very much NOT on her various romances. I've just gotten a bit sick lately of looking for strong, female leads but always having to trawl through endless romances. If you know any, please offer some recommendations, self-promos also welcome! (All tropes are fine too, inc genderbending)

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

It has everything you are asking for. And little romance.

** linkao3(Weasley Girl by Hyaroo)

Also on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]

Essentially, Ron Weasley was born a girl. Now I usually don't read any AU's, especially genderbend, but this is the exception. The author is ridiculously good at for want of a nail things, the small changes that expand into a full-blown enjoyable butterfly effect. For example, in the first book (The Leapling, the short one-shot prelude can be read anytime) we are shown that she has taken a fact from canon, that animals seem to really love Ron, and made it into 'Ronnie's' gimmick, so she's a bit similar to Charlie in that aspect, and the author takes away her chess skills to compensate. Another thing, she ends up leaving Scabber's with Ginny so she wouldn't be lonely, setting up an interesting plot point for later discussion.

Anyways, Harry is the protagonist I suppose, but Ronnie is a strong deuteragonist and in the second book (Secrets of the Past) she gets to take the lead. Rated K+ in the first, T in the second because it's told in Ronnie's point of view and "the girl likes to swear", much like canon Ron.

There are no pairings (aside from the married canon couples) and the main story is focused on action and mystery, with a bit of slice-of-life; essentially the same as the early books. Ginny also has her canon crush, but it doesn't do much to hinder her awesomeness, and by the end of Secrets of the Past she can talk to him like a normal person. However, don't read if you're homophobic, got it? I won't spoil it, but even after romance takes a backseat and is solely brought up.

About one to two spelling/grammar mistakes a chapter, but they're barely noticeable and I'll let it slide since each chapter is usually 10,000 words or more.

Hope this helps!

** If I can do a self rec?

Linkao3(the might of the architect by tinyporcelainehorses)

This is a founders era adventure fic. It will have eventual f/f romance, but that's going to be very much a bonus rather than the main focus. It has two viewpoint characters/protagonists, one male, one female, and switches between them every two to three chapters. (The first two chapters are from the male protagonists POV though).

Hope that scratches the itch you have if you decide to check it out!
