AD:"Peanutbutter! Whey! Steroids! Tweak!" *flexes*

SS: "You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of macro-nutrition and proteinshake-making. As there is little foolish benchpressing here, many of you will hardly believe this is lifting. I don't expect you will understand the beauty of the ultra fine inbuild sieve-shaker with its additional free one gallon water bottle,- the worth of Vitamin supplements, and Arginin, creeping through human veins, bewitching your aesthetic body, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach you how to bottle what you need for fame, brew whey, even stopper muscle decay - if you aren't a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."

Stuff like that?

**** "[...] He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from grunting in surprise. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when he put more weight on the long barbell for deadlifting on Deadlift-Fridays --- for he had seen not only himself buff like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but a whole crowd of people standing behind him, in awe of his lats and trapezius! - But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. There he was, buff as adonis after a year on steroids, reflected in it, tanned and glorious muscled-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others of smaller statures. Harry looked over his swole shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible bodybuilders and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?"

***** [...] "So, back again, Harry?" Harry felt as though his rectus abdominis had cramped after a burnout session on the abdominal core machine. He looked behind him, sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than one flexing Albus Dumbledore, muscular arms oiled and glinting in the moonlight. Harry must have walked straight past the magnificient old lifter, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him. "-- I didn't see you, sir." "Strange how nearsighted being buff can make you," said Dumbledore, flexing his triceps to show off his recent gain, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. "So," said Dumbledore, slipping his glorious through lunges steeled glutes off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of the Elows." "I didn't know it was called that, Sir." "But I expect you've realised by now what it does?" "It - well - it shows me being swole --."

Alright, I dont have much time left - hope you enjoyed it :D
