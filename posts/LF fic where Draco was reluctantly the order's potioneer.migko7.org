:END:
I remember it was a harmony fic. At the end of the sixth year, before the horcrux hunt, Narcissa makes Harry and Hermione promise to take care of Draco since he would be hunted by the death eaters. So they kidnap him or something (not sure) and bring him over to grimmauld place. He ends up reluctantly supplying the order with potions for the duration of the war. I think Draco kind of had a thing for Hermione in that fic too
