Any fics that nail that Comedy of Errors vibe? For those unaware, this was a Shakespeare play where shit just went wrong and a lot of errors were made (real shocker there) along with a boatload of puns and word play. The wikipedia article also gives the definition as 'an event or series of events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout'.

EDIT - Essentially, a lot of hilarious misunderstandings that lead to more misunderstandings and a lot of trouble for the people involved.


** I'm not sure if this is the exact type you're looking for but have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]] on [[https://Fanfic.net][Fanfic.net]]? I really liked it but it can be a bit absurd in some places

*** A lot of Rorshach's Blot's work hews towards this trope to greater or lesser degrees. linkffn(Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood) has a fair bit as well.

*** Yeah, that's exactly the type of thing I'm looking for. Hilarious misunderstandings (and I just re-edited the thread description thingy to cover that more specifically). Less for the absurdity (though that is hilarious) and more for the misunderstandings.
