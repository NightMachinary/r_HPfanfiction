I'm curious to see what regularly updated stories people follow. Currently I'm following [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations][Magical Relations]],[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7746111/1/Harry-Potter-the-Halfblood-Auror][Harry Potter & the Halfblood Auror]], and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8973124/1/A-Year-Abroad][A Year Abroad]].

What are your favourite regularly updated fics?


** - [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence]] - [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1c24gj/the_perils_of_innocence_by_avidbeader/][info]] - IMHO the best currently updating story
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20]] - [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/19g562/harry_potter_and_the_natural_20_a_harry_potter/][info]]
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8052743/1/Harry-Potter-Game-of-the-Year-Edition]]
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9037762/1/I-Fall-out-to-Pieces]]
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen]] - very interesting Hermione, the scene about the brain accident alone is enough to recommend this.
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8902388/1/A-Wizard-Named-Harry]] ("Harry Dresden has taken a lot of blows to the head over his career, and woken up in a lot of interesting places, but... aboard the Hogwarts Express in the body of an eleven-year-old boy with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead? Yeah, that's a new one.")
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486108/1/From-the-Flame-to-the-Spark]] ("Ginny Weasley pulls a PeggySue after Harry dies in the final battle. Featuring a determinator!Ginny who doesn't care how the previous timeline went, she's going to save Harry no matter what. Also, a minor not-really but sort-of crossover.")
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2544950/1/Had-I-Known]] (almost completed)
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8914586/1/Harry-Potter-Junior-Inquisitor]] - it may end as interesting story or as yet another boring bashing of everybody likeable combined with Umbridge in Leather Pants.
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son]] - Story where the harem thing have implications beyond "a lot of sex". Warnings: work in progress, extreme AU, depressing.
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]
