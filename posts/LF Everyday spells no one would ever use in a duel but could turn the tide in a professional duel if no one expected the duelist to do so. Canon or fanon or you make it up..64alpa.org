I'm doing another series like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12127042/1/Stranger-in-a-Strange-Land]]) or linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11911913/1/Cookbook-of-Doom-A-Harry-Potter-Collection]]) where i'll add an entry occasionally. The premise is a Harry Potter who travels the world, using nonstandard dueling spells only---somewhat like miyamoto musashi's bokken duel---humbling braggarts by defeating them via wind spells or swapping their wands midbattle with needlefish. Looking for inspiration spellwise or duelwise if you wish.

** A spell that fills someone's mouth with soap, generally only used by parents to discourage swearing. Could gag a duellist effectively.

Also a sex spell that plunges them into their fantasy of choice. An effective distraction, no?

** In 'For Love of Magic' Harry has a practice duel with Fleur und he uses a sex spell for lubrication on the floor to make her slip.

I thought it was pretty funny since Fleur was basically throwing herself at him and he taunted her with his extensive knowledge of helpful sexual spells.

  *The reports of the Doom level of this cookbook are greatly exaggerated! Harry Potter wrote a book. It's not what anyone expected. He has revolutionized cooking by combining potioneering and cooking by utilizing the skills of a potioneer in a kitchen.

** Using transfiguration and physical objects is highly underrated. Imagine you conjuring objects to block spells (especially unforgivables); it seems easier and quicker to use a mixture of spells and physical force to combat anything thrown your way. Of course, a lot of things won't break a shield charm, but its a way to weaken the opponent (physically or by attention).

Projectile based dueling could definitely assist duel spell casting because you can easily follow them up one after another because of the relative ease of projectile conjuring vs a strong spell.

*** I have two transfiguration spells i've been desperately wanting to use. One has harry turning the walls of hogwarts into a massive liquid hand reminiscent of the wall master thing in zelda games and trapping malfoy within so only his nose is visible and perhaps an eye and a lock of hair. The other is in a moment of rage he transfigures the ground into spears and a squad or larger amount of men end up impaled on them, the spears carefully hitting them so they miss organs, letting them die slowly. Sadly, not viable for this story.

** As boring as it is, and I am certain at least some people are prepared for it, tthe Summoning Charm (Accio). It has a short incantation so unless they are prepared for it they will not make it with their defences in time (unless you are shouting the name of the thing you are summoning, which is not necessary at all with enough practice), it seems to conceptually not actually need to be pointed at the target which means shields may not actually protect anyone, and depending on the power of the charm you may be able to greatly inconvenience your opponent if you choose what you pull well.

Arguably, one could defend against that by duelling naked ... well, do excuse me while I go off and not take that possibility seriously.
