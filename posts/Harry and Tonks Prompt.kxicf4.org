One of you better give me a good Honks fic here.

The basic concept: Tonks survives the final battle, Remus does not. Harry is what Sirius was supposed to be to him to Teddy*. Over time, Harry and Tonks grow closer. Because sometimes love just needs to be good enough. Not soulmates or anything.

Or you could write a friendship fic, focusing on the family dynamic that they have and the weirdness of it. But please, someone write it. I'll build a shrine to you.

*This is one of the worst parts of the cursed child, why the fuck is Harry such a shitty person in the cursed child.


** BTW, I agree on cursed child. Vernon Dursley must be swollen with pride that Harry followed his shining example of a proper role model in parenting Albus Severus.

** Regrettably I can't write to save my life. Which is why I'm so grateful to all the fanfic authors who put themselves and their works out there for us to enjoy.

I would suggest you try the story Beginning to Live by TheIndigoRaven. The plot of that story is exactly what you are requesting. Only problem is it is a short story ~4.5K
