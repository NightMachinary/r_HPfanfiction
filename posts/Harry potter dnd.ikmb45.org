Ok so we know Harry is a Varient Human Sorcerer with the lucky feat. What are his friends?

Ron is a Bard Barbarian. Here me out. Ron is not a wizard. He is a Charisma caster with a low Charisma at the beginning. (His anger doesn't do well for Charisma) I'm thinking 2 levels Barbarian and the rest as a Bard. Or we could go Sorcerer but I don't know if ron can cast quietly. He needs Vicious Mockery at least cause his insults were enough to send Hermione off crying first year. Plus Ron is more about having fun then actually studying.

Hermione is a Artificer Bard Wizard. This is gonna need some explanation. Hermione is an intelligent caster but she's constantly telling people stuff and people don't listen (in the early years). I'm thinking she's a Bard (her parents probably taught her piano or something) for 2 levels and everyone called her annoying. Now her highest stat is Intelligent and we know she made a Bag of Holding. So she's at least level 7 Artificer Flash of Genius would work for her constantly telling people stuff and she insults people enough they react. With bardic Inspiration and Jack of All Trades (plus she gets pretty later on) so she'd be a great candidate for minister of magic at level 20. So 2 levels of Bard, 7 levels of Alchemist Artificer and 11 levels of wizard. Or go 8 Alchemist and 12 wizard.

Neville is the definition of a druid. Love of plants and he always looks uncomfortable in a brick walled building. Druid. 3 levels of celestial warlock cause he's one of the chosen ones.

Hagrid is a goliath ranger. He was kicked from Hogwarts so he's a level 3 wizard (third year i believe was when he got kicked so 3 levels) and maybe a druid level or 2 but he'd definitely have a Ranger with Beasts as a favored 'Enemies'

Dumbledore is a Half-Elf or a Tiefling. His Charisma is god like bit his main casting type will be intelligence. His eyes often sparkle (Prestidigitation or Thaumaturgy) Enchanter wizards would definitely fit his MO.

Remus is a wizard with the lycanthropy virus. Or a wizard with 3 levels in Blood Hunter. He was the brainy one of the marauders.

Sirius Black is a Black Dragon Bloodline. He knows polymorph.

Minerva is the same. Just a wizard with polymorph. Or since all students of Hogwarts are required to take Herbology and cats are a level 0 challenge, 2 levels of druid would work for both of them.

nymphadora is a changeling hands down. The innate ability to change her physical form at will is definitely a changeling. Or a level 15 Warlock but that doesn't fit the fact she could do that since she was a little kid.

Snape is actually something interesting. I want to go 6 Alchemist Artificer and the rest wizard but Rogue 15 gives slippery mind, but he is an Alchemist Artificer with a ring of Mind Shielding. (Call it natural talent).

Fleur is a glamor Bard.

Luna Lovegood is a divination wizard.


** Luna has no divination abilities, so a wild magic Sorcerer would probably be more accurate.
