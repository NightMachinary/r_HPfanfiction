Honestly, everyone has written about Voldemort tempting Harry to join him, but how about Harry tempting Voldemort? Cookie points for Dumbledore speaking about second chances and an invitation to a tea party to speak of ammends!

I would really love to read stories where Dumbledore has to deal with a situation where Tom M. Riddle asks for forgiveness and a second chance. The possible character interactions are just */mouthwatering/*.

And for those who don't like prompts: In /Magicks of the Arcane/, Harry and Dumbledore have a discussion about whether or not Riddle should be given a second chance.


** I've got one for you! It's a pretty AU MoD story, but yes, the major plotline does involve Harry bringing Voldy back in the direction of the light.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.
