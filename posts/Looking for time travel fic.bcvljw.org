Looking for a fic where Harry goes back in time somehow (can't remember how exactly) and (I'm not completely sure about this part) becomes the founders protege in a way. Then he becomes the headmaster at some point hen he is old (I'm definitely sure about this part) and there is also a scene where the ministry come to take over the school or something and he forces them out of the school.

Meanwhile in his actual time Ginmy and Hermiony try to find where he is and once they are suspicious that he may be this awesome headmaster from the past, they start researching him.

That's all I can remember, I hope it helps.

I read it years ago and it's been so long I'm even starting to think it doesn't exist and I just imagined it. Pls help if you can, it's killing me.


** This actually sounds interesting.

*** It really was. And it was well written too, well thought out. Not complete though, I believe.
