**** 2 that come to mind that are close are Accidental Bond (nonsexual focused harem fic that tries to have the characters respond in a more realistic way for their age and situation) after bonding with Hermione her parents adopt Harry and her mom rakes Dumbledore over the coals for how Harry was treated in potions. The second is You are my Density by robst, a time travel fic (and like all robst fics a HP/HG ship) where Dumbledore notices Hermione's distrust of Snape and concludes that his efforts to redeem him are in vain.

​

Sorry I can't think of one that specifically meets the criteria, I am sure I have read one but not sure of the title which is way I originally asked for more details.

** Dumbledore did nothing to stop the despicable behavior of Sirius towards Snape when they were children so the only plausible reason for him to do anything about how Snape treats others as an adult is because the victim in the OP's situation is (debatably) one of Dumbledore's favorites.
