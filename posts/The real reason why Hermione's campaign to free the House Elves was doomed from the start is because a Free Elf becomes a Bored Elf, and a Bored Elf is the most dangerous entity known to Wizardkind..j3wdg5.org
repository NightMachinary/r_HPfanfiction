** House elves are not actually elves, the name was given to obfuscate their true origins.

House elves are actually imps, tricksters and dealers of chaos. Also known as gremlins.

The gremlins could be bargained with to fulfill tasks, but were generally the bane of wizards who would encounter them as they got pleasure from pulling pranks on wizards.

One wizard council enacted a plan that would create a bargain to trick all gremlins into a task that would never end and continue to their children and children's children.

One of the natural enemies of the gremlins were the dementors. They had no natural defense from the dark creatures and in exchange for protection in wizard households, behind wards, they would perform tasks for the wizards.

That became their enslavement and eventually the forgot their true nature. However the wizards who know the truth are always afraid that some elves will become free and revert to being the agents of chaos they used to be.

This is also the origin of the phrase - Idle hands are the devil's playthings. This refers to a free elf will become bored and revert to acting like a gremlin.

** I know folks here have a love-hate relationship with linkffn(prince of Slytherin) but it touches on similar concept

Spoiler Dobby is free elf but answers to Narcissa similar to how he did to Harry in canon, she sends him in second year to attack Harry, and when they find out it's done by a free elf all hell breaks loose, including complete lockdown of Hogwarts

Edit: or might be the other way, but there's definitely free elf who's considered the most dangerous thing in that plot

Dobby will later kill Narcissa's House Elf after a short battle in a pocket Universe, to stop the elf from destroying the Hogwarts Express.

**** Yup, and the scene ends with Dobby being glad he's dealt with the other elf so he can on to the much more important business of preparing the great Harry Potter's room for when he arrives. After he caused a supernova in said pocket universe as part of the battle. It's a great little piece of understated crack that would have worked really well as a one-shot
