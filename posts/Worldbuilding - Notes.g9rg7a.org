Hello, everyone,

​

As some of you are aware, I'm attempting to create a culturally appropriate, internally consistent , realistic Potterverse which incorporates different cultures doing different styles of magic. I'm also attempting to expand on the magical subjects, such as Transfiguration, Arithmancy, and Charms.

​

Here are my worldbuilding notes.

Anyone is welcome to edit or add to them as they see fit.

** Can't say I'm a huge fan of making it "culturally appropriate". I assume this is a reference to the Twittergasm around JKR's use of American Indian folklore in a way that didn't accurately reflect the real-world belief systems (historical and contemporary) of American Indians.

But the essential approach of the HP magic system towards folklore, myths and legends is to subvert that mythology. With very few exceptions, the HP universe takes mythological things and changes them dramatically to make them /normal/:

- In mythology, Pegasus was a unique, legendary figure, the offspring of a god. In HP, winged horses are used to draw carriages and they drink whisky.

- In mythology, dragons are majestic, powerful creatures. In HP, they are kept in reserves and farmed.

- In folklore, ghosts are terrifying malevolent spirits. In HP, they are mascots who celebrate their death like a birthday.

All of this fits with a magic system where magic is principally used for cooking, cleaning and office work. The tone of the HP series is one of treating the magical as if it were mundane, while retaining the spark of romanticism that makes the magic feel magical.

With this in mind, I think that paying too much respect to the folklore of various cultures will result in worldbuilding elements which fundamentally contradict the established tone of the canon worldbuilding. If you want to produce material for non-Western magical cultures which matches the tone of the HP worldbuilding, you need to change and subvert that mythology, not incorporate it faithfully.

From a more general standpoint, I'm also not sure that treating non-Western cultures as if they are fragile, such that you have to walk on egg shells around them, is really a sign of respect. It would surely be more respectful to treat that mythology in the same way as Western mythology was treated by the series - as a rich source of ideas and inspiration which can be used and adapted any way an author likes.

As for the rest: not touching the poisoned chalice of "magic is energy and follows the laws of physics".

*** Indeed it was a reference to that.

Thanks for the advice. I'll try to subvert mythologies more in the future (this project is still in its infancy). I really appreciate you replying to my post with your help and suggestions.

** I quickly skimmed the magic document. Please stay away from magic is purely intent. If you go down that road, Luna Lovegood on drugs better be the most powerful wizard in the world. If you want to use magic is energy, you need to do far more research. You know how much energy would be needed to conjure one kilogram of iron if you went with a "physics model of magic"? Enough to make a nuclear bomb look like child's play.

*** While I'm tempted to make Luna Lovegood on drugs the most powerful witch in the world, I'll have to agree with you. I'll abandon the “magic is energy” path.

*** The magic is energy is dealt with deeply in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/993900][Arithmancer-Verse by White_Squirrel]].
