:END:
Hi guys,

i remember reading a fanfic way back where Ron was attacked and kidnapped so that he could get some details about a treasure from a girl who was also attacked by the brains in the ministry. He learned wandless magic and finally escaped and got back with Hermione.

Does anyone know of the fanfic? Would really appreciate if someone could link it.


** Ok i finally found the fanfic. Since people upvoted this post i will share it if someone else is looking to read it:
