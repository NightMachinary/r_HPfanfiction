I read a great fic about 6 months ago and can't find it for the life of me. Starts out with Harry sneaking into Hogwarts and stopping time in the room of requirement while he trains. One of the other main points is the trio going to Albania to find a horcrux.

I'd love to do a book club with some friends if anyone knows the name of this! Thanks so much!


** Was it called 'Harry Potter Redux'? I can remember reading a fic like that.. but for the life of me, I can't find it again on FF.net.

*** I found *a* fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3904296/1/Harry-Potter-Redux]["Harry Potter Redux"]], but it doesnt look to be like the one OP menitioned. Its all 7 years rewritten in 36k words. The author didn't like the canon ending. It that it?
