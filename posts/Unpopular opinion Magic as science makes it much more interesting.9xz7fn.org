Magic systems in fiction fit on a scale of hardness. A 'soft' system would be the magic in HP, where spell mechanics are not well-defined, i.e. *wave wand* water into liquid gold. Why? Because magic. Meanwhile, 'hard' systems are much more fleshed-out with iron-clad (and more fluid) rules.

Harry Potter fans seem to dislike it when fanfiction changes the magic system. Instead of having flick of your wand do X, there are variables -- U, V, and W -- that must be considered and how/why X does what it does. I can understand why a lot of fans hate this, as they claim it "takes away from the magic of Harry Potter". It does... when done poorly.

Like in real life, most things can't be shoved into a perfect equation -- there are margins of error, contextual problems etc. that one must take into account. I remember reading a fanfic where McGonagall was teaching the equation of transfiguration duration for an object. Several factors had to be taken into account: mass of object, intent constant, and innate magic of the user. If magic can easily be calculated and quantified with a simple equation or two, then yes, that would be boring and not the way for magic to be portrayed.

However, it is this break-down of magic into something of a science which can make it fascinating for readers, such as myself. Instead of simply saying that 'X does Y', there is a (detailed) explanation behind the processes and mechanisms involved, bearing in mind that -- like in real life -- there is a degree of subjectivity and a need for context.

In short, I feel as though a lot of HP fans are being unfair to decry the "magic as a form of science". Rather than take away the sense of wonder, it CAN make the magic of the Potterverse so much more fascinating to explore. What do you think?


** Eh, in this context my preference is for magic to be treated rationally and systematically but still be an ineffable, impossible force. Not a science but still treated like one. Humane but still fantastic.

As far as magic systems go I'd work from imagery/aesthetics to appropriate capabilities and the limits of what is possible. This stuff is social as much as it is mechanical so it fits under the umbrella of general worldbuilding.

I don't disagree with you per se but we don't need to be told the rules so explicitly, just being given the impression of consistency is enough in most cases I'd argue.

** From a story standpoint, I think it's more important that the (a) climax doesn't involve an asspull. The reader should feel as though they should have been able to predict the solution before they read it if only they were cleverer. The protagonist straight up pulling the solution out of their ass isn't nearly as satisfying.

I suspect more structured magic systems lessen the temptation to pull solutions from nowhere.

*** Indeed. "It's magic, not science" is stupid when it's used as an excuse for some deus ex machina. And HP magic does have rules and laws anyway. You can't just do anything with magic - there are limits. There are recipes for potions. There is research - Dumbledore and Flamel found twelve uses for Dragonblood, for example. The Unspeakables study magic. And if you can study it, it's part of science.

***** Okay, but when you study history as if it has rules and laws it becomes the science known as "historical materialism." The only reason history /isn't/ a science is because most historians reject historical materialism, and don't believe that history follows rules or laws.

****** I am rather unfamiliar with historical materialism. A cursory google search reflects an origin in Marxist thought and, therefore, to a refutation of capitalism and the inevitable achievement of socialism. I am sure such a prescriptive belief should not have any place in a science.

But even with a more general understanding of the term, studying something as if it has rules and laws (and I am unsure of the distinction between the two) is only useful if one can actually identify rules or laws. And, in particular and assuming rules and laws are a stand-in for scientific theories, only if those rules or laws are global enough that meaningful predictions can be made.

Perhaps the reason historians study history without using concepts such as rules and laws is not because of faith but because all such attempts have failed.

Right, and my only point was that magic /does/ have rules and laws. I wasn't trying to argue for historical materialism, per se, only using it as an example of why magic could be studied scientifically.

** The soft/hard scale isn't about how exactly a desk becomes a pig on the molecular level or whatever, it's about the rules of the system. Sanderson also doesn't explain how people swallow metal shavings and are able to turn that into extra strength, he just explains that this metal bestows that effect. He's pretty far into the hard end of the scale.

I guess the hardest would be basically scifi, something like Mass Effect, which has all the required technobabble about how eezo manipulates gravity.

However, calling HP magic soft is mistaken imo. LotR magic is soft. HP magic has some very obvious and some not so obvious rules. The most famous example being probably the Patronus Charm, which has a specific condition for casting.

You can include magical theory that you make up in your fic and it doesn't turn magic into science. Sciene magic is something like MOR, which, for example, limits Transfiguration to being temporary and therefore eating an apple transfigured from nails would be very bad for you.

*** Science is a process and mindset- that you observe the world, come up with hypothesis to explain it, then do experiments to verify, and eventually try to come up with an overarching theory for the rules of the world. In the real world, that's the principles of mathematics and physics and chemistry and so on. But in sci-fi/fantasy worlds there might be different or additional rules, but so long as they approach it with the right mindset it's still a science (ie. eezo/biotics in Mass Effect).

HP magic is a science. It is consistent, replicable and repeatable. There is a whole body of theory behind it. There are rules, and people who dedicate their lives to exploring and explaining those rules.

However, those rules entirely supersede and are separate from the 'mundane' laws we know.

Anyway, treating it as something to be studied and experimented with- yes, that's more than fine and is consistent with the books.

Exploring the rules and limitations in the narrative sense, so that solutions to problems feel earned rather than Deus Ex machina- yes, please.

Finagling magic to behave more in accordance with the natural world, a la HPMoR- no, that misses the point entirely that it follows completely different rules.

That said, I would think a fic where muggles managed to discover magic on their own would be very interesting.

** HP magic is not just *wave wand* *things happen*. Every spell has at least individual incantation and wand motion. Some spells also have a difficult psychological component (patronus, unforgivables). McGonagall can turn a table into a pig with a wave of a wand, but it's because she is super advanced. People spend years getting to what level. I assume they are studying rules and explanations of some kind.

So JKR's magic has logic to it, but it's more like art, poetry or philosophy than science. (Cause she is not a scientist probably). Wizarding power is meant to be more like person's creativity and knowledge than some sort of energy level, if you get what I mean. Like maybe it's easy to turn beetle into a button because they look alike or have similar names, and not because of their size or mass.

I think it would be hard to shove a "magic mechanics" theory into this particular story, without completely changing eccentric the feel of it.

** I think this comes down to philosphy:

Even in the real world there are idealists who believe that there are metaphysical or transcendental qualities to objects, which cannot be investigated by science. Magic being real would be seen as evidence that their world view is correct.

As a materialist I would look at Magic as a natural force that for some reason we are unable to detect without requiring it to be metaphysical (like the strong nuclear force, that holds atoms together, but is completely unknowable to primitive humans) or it's one of those things that we already discovered, but haven't had the correct name for yet (like Dark Matter or Dark Energy). In any of these scenarios I don't see a reason why it couldn't be investigated using scientific principles.

As the name suggests, the strong nuclear force holds the nucleus together (along with a variety of other things).

** It doesn't matter if magic is soft and mystical or hard and rule-bound. The second some wizard asks "But why it do what it do?," SCIENCE happens.

For a hard magic system, you invent a new branch of physics and be done with it. But even for a soft system, you can apply science... although it'll probably look more like psychology analyzing the mind of the eldritch being that made magic do the thing than physics analyzing the world. Because "mystical" and "soft" magic is really just hard magic with far more variables than you experienced and probably acts more like a mind (or emergent system) than standard physics.

And in the end, does it really matter what the root cause is? Bob the wizard is alway going to wonder why his fireball is half the size of Alice's. Whether it's because he has a smaller reserve of magic or he annoyed Yog-Sothoth once, the act of applying science to the question will eventually tell him the correct answer.

** The problem is it would make so little sense as to require one to squint their eyes in the dark and still have to rewrite a lot of canon. Science intentionally presumes a naturalistic view of the world, there is no magic. Events and phenomena have physical explanations. But with magic you have something that let's you cause effects that violate the presumption (souls and the after life exist so dualism is true, you can effect things in bizarre and extreme ways that are too detailed to be physically feasible (Transfiguration and repair charms, matter can be annihilated with Vanishing, etc.).

And in fanfic, this has the tendency of "...And of course that simple bit of science is why you lost, Volyshorts." There's never going to be an actual scientific explanation of things. So it ends up being useless as a plot element in every example I've seen, even in every other series that has characters saying that "It's not magic, just science you don't know yet".

I think hard magic makes better stories.

I think the appearance of hard magic is even better (where it feels like there are hard rules behind the system, but it isn't actually explained. This can be done by an author actually adhering to a hard magic system without explaining or just being really good at giving the feeling of limitation).

And any hard magic system would be studyable by acience

** Let me start by saying this is not a JKR bashing post. I love her and her work but I also accept that she is not perfect.\\
Personally, I do not like the science related explanations that JKR has given out, mainly because they are not very accurate. For instance, she said accio summons objects at the speed of light (which is quite impossible and definitely not the way it is portrayed in the books.) or the gene theory regarding muggleborns having magic is also very inaccurate.\\
However, I love the premise of magic being ruled by certain equations and laws of physics. JKR herself mentions it some places like Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration. Potions is often shown as a science in a lot of fanfics I have read. I am not sure about other ships but a lot of Drarry fics include Draco tutoring Harry and explaining why certain ingredients are put in potions in specific ways. Fred and George are literally conducting experiments for all their products in canon. It would be fascinating to see Transfiguration or Charms being dealt with the same way.\\
Additionally, how would one explain creating new spells without any laws governing them? If it was only the will and wand waving that did magic, then why would creating new spells be a difficult task? You would see new jinxes and curses every day at a school full of imaginative teenagers.

On a very different note, in real life, I always see magic as a precursor to science. Perhaps one day, we will be able to understand more of our own laws to be able to emulate more of the magic that we see in books. Just yesterday, I was too lazy to go fetch my airpods from the room and thought it would be so cool if they had a tiny geolocation mechanism so that I could "summon" them and they would read the location and come flying to me. Large drones can do that and maybe we could reduce the tech size for all daily objects to do the same in a few years..

*** Gamp's Laws are more similar to actual legal laws than laws of physics. Physical laws tend to relate concepts. “Every action has an equal and opposite reaction,” “E=mc^{2} ” relates matter with energy, etc. Gamp's Laws don't do that. They say “these are things you cannot do.” They don't explain /why/ or /how/ you can't do them. They just make observations and set limits. Physical laws stem from observations, of course. But they actually apply some critical thinking to come up with a relation.

**** Not really. If I state Newton's First as "an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted on by some external force" (simplified, I know), then an easy collorary is that "you cannot make an object stop moving without exerting a force on it". To do so would be an impossible thing- ie. a limit. (or like how you can't exceed the speed of light, as we know). But then you get further in depth to explain they /why/.

Same with Gamp's- Hermione just uses the most practical level of it. You cannot do this impossible thing. She didn't explain the /why/ of it, which presumably there is, but it's completely irrelevant to her argument with Ron.

It's like... let's say Hermione is driving a car. The brakes fail. Ron says "stop the car anyway". Hermione says "I can't. According to Newton's First Law, I need to exert a force upon the car, otherwise it will remain in motion. It's impossible to stop it without some way to exert force on it. Without the brakes I have no way to exert force on it, without straight up just crashing the car". Ron says "bugger".

His system is soft only because we don't need to know how it works, but it's very obvious that it does have laws and rules. In Harry Potter, magic is pretty much the setting - it's like if Tolkien didn't explain the geography and history of middle earth. JKR failed at world building though mostly because the series was initially for children.
