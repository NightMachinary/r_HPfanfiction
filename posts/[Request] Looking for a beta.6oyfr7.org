Looking for a beta for my fic: linkffn(11687216)

It's a first person fic (I know a lot of people don't read first person, so I figured I'd mention it right off the bat) from the POV of Snape.

Some basic description (with minor spoilers): This is basically a horcrux-takes-control-of-Harry fic with a twist in that it's not told from Harry or Voldemort's perspective. Instead, everything's seen through Snape's eyes. There's no romance or anything in this fic, but there is a bit of an emphasis placed on analyzing personal relationships. Although later on things are going to get a bit political (which is not a strong suit of mine; another reason I'm looking for a beta).

It's about halfway done (at around 70,000 words right now), and the first couple chapters aren't really up to the standard of some of the later chapters, since I wrote them kind of a while ago.

**What I would love is someone who's available to go through the older chapters with me and help revise them, and maybe read through chapters before I update as well.

I do okay proofreading my own chapters, so I'm not excessively worried about grammar/spelling type help, but having someone to help point out inconsistencies or things that don't read right would be fantastic. Also, I would love someone to bounce ideas off of and such. I have some friends IRL who I talk to about it, but they don't really read fan fiction and haven't read my fic, so it's not super helpful.

**Really, even if you're not interested in revising at all, having someone to talk to about future plot arcs would be fantastically helpful.


** I'd love to help out, Snape is my favourite character. Your story sounds good, just started reading it.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape finds himself wrapped up in the mystery that is Harry Potter, while struggling with a few more mysteries of his own. (OotP AU in which the horcrux in Harry's head isn't as benign as Dumbledore thought, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.)
