Second prompt of the day, spawned from the unholy chasm that is my imagination... as with the first one, if you use it for inspiration, I'd love a link :)

Harry was in pain... nothing new there, we all know his younger years wasn't happy. No, what was new was that this wasn't a pain caused by the back of his uncles hand, his scar or the annual Hogwarts mishap... no, this was his own goddamn fault for forgetting what Hermione told him... it's all too bright now... too bright, too clear, too MUCH...

"Hermione, how many drops of this did you say it would take again?" Harry asked nervously

"3, Harry, it's not that hard to remember. Those glasses are too easy for you to lose, or they could be summoned away from you during a fight. We need to fix your eyes, and this is the fastest way we can do legally" Hermione answered, adding the owl feathers to the slowly simmering potion.

"Alright, 3 drops. And how long before the potion is stable?"

"7 months, Harry. Now quit disturbing me, I need to concentrate on this"

"Alright, 3 and 7, I can remember that"

Hermione added the last ingredient to the cauldron "Alright, Harry, remember to let the potion rest for 7 months, then put 3 drops in each eye in the morning for 3 days. Hopefully you can drop those glasses before we start the new school year"

"Alright, potion rests for 7 months then 3 drops in the morning for 3 days, got it"

"Alright, 7 drops for 3 days, here we go..."


** So, the reason for both of my prompts today stems from real life - I personally have a mild case of sound-to-sight synesthesia in the form of waves (like the waves in a pond when you drop a rock in it) and severe hypersensitivity for sight, sound, hearing and touch. Changing these a bit and applying them to the HP universe is underdone IMO, so many fics has Harry being disabled through blindness, deafness etc but not a lot of them explore the opposite... The problem Harry is having in this is pretty much my everyday life when it comes to my eyes - everything is too bright, there are too many details and even when I know my sight has deteriorated a lot over the last 5 years I can still count the leaves on a tree 200 meters away. And lemme tell you, it's goddamn distracting when you already have problems focusing.

I imagine Harry would probably be banned from quidditch as there would probably be a rule agains bodymodifications that give an unfair advantage...
