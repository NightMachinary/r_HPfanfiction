As the title says, I am looking for a harry story where he has gone off of the walls. One active story is "the nightmare man" by Tiro is a good example of what I am looking for.

Also, please only link completed or active stories, unless there is am outstanding abandoned one.

I have done extensive searching, but haven't been able to find anything up to par yet. Also, the one shot "the mad scientist of azkaban" by Racks is the type of story I am looking for. As you might tell, I also like the more graphic and violent ones.

I loom forward to your recommendations.


** He isn't dark, but he does have very loose morals when it comes to spell usage and killing. He is also bat shit insane.

If I recall correctly the fighting gets graphic as well.

*** This is one of my favorite stories, and for me, is *the* "broken" or crazy harry potter story. It's excellent, and it is the reason I looked in this thread for suggestions. Very upvote this one.

** Harry's pretty crazy in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Wastelands of Time]]. I don't know if "crazy" is exactly the right word, but he's definitely... unhinged.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too young to die.]] Not your typical wbwl. Harry's motivation is to raise his sister from the dead, and he goes very dark and twisted to do so.

Gradual decent into madness and darkness. One of my favorite dark Harry stories due to the motivation.

In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.
