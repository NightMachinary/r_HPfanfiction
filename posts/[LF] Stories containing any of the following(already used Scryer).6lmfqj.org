*** Shits man, I have no idea. I've read well over 1.5k fanfictions at this point. The reason why I'm searching for that stuff was because I've seen it touched on lightly before and I wanted to see if there were any stories out there that actually made more use of it.

I remember a story where harry turn to into a human-dragon things because of dragon blood and the basilisk fang in his arm or something, uh..

Mastermind? Harry got an alchemy book given to him by Hogwarts?(I think that one got abandoned)

** Intelligent Hogwarts (Though it seems more complicated than that):\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging]])

Interesting dragons (though you don't see much of them) and completely revisited canon powerful artifacts. Hasn't updated since September and on hiatus, though. Xover with Dresden and self insert, you've been warned.\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11156953/1/New-Day-New-Life]])

The basilisk and Harry become acquaintances in (I think it's in the sequel though):\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First]])

No idea for the rest.

**** The merging is an excellent fic. New day new life could be better but is enjoyable for the most part. Travel secrets is enjoyable, although it will make some teeth cringe.

It's indeed a shame none of these updates much.

Ah, feys are mentioned in New Day New Life (It is a Dresden crossover, after all). We haven't seen them yet, but they're the reason some artifacts such as the Potter's invisibility cloak or the Mirror of Erised function quite different from usual.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/451982/chapters/775208]]

It's Hermione/Voldemort, so not for everyone, completely AU, and faeries are a big par of the story. It's probably my favorite fic, but again, that's not an usual pairing (but my fav anyway haha). It's explicit, often dark, well written, long and complete.

The author also has a new story (relatively regularly updated) with an interesting take on dragons. I like it for now, but again, same pairing, it's dark, explicit, etc.

** Linkffn(Weres Harry) Basilisk survives her battle with Harry, still losses a tooth. Fae and what is most likely an Avatar of Hogwarts show up in Fifth Year, and Fluffy is his hunting companion. The Basilisk venom does react to him, granting him a diluted form of them venom on his Beast form's claws and teeth, which nearly kills Riddle in the graveyard.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
