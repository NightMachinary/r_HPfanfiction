Almost forgot about the mirror present Sirius gave to Harry. Any fics where Harry uses it to communicate with Sirius and/or others?


** What was that one which had Molly Weasley shout through the mirror to get Harry to unwrap it?

...Ah, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/5/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading, Chapter 5]]. But that one veers away from canon by the very first chapter, being a 'characters read the books' fic and all.
