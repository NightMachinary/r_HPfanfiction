I've seen a lot of back and forth on this subreddit about magical cores. I've seen some terrible stories that used it and I've seen some amazing stories that used it, but this site feels like it's very against the concept and I'm curious about why.

Edit: for clarification, is it the idea that's disliked or is it the poor implementation that's frequently seen.


** I said in a thread recently - I prefer magic in HP to be like in canon, with less definition and stuff, even if that /can/ lead to self-contradiction, because Magical Cores make it... well... not magical anymore. Instead, everyone basically just has biological batteries, and that's boring.

Also, Magical Cores or other such power level systems are rarely implemented because the author actually wants to clarify the magic system, but because they want characters to be orders of magnitude better than their counterparts for no real reason, or because they want clearer rules that the protagonist can /immediately/ shit all over with their plot armour and power-ups.

Stories with "power indexes" like /Resurgence/ by Arcturus Peverell, regardless of the quality of the writing, essentially end up implying that there is a master race in the wizard world who are innately more powerful than other wizards forever and there being nothing anyone can do about it, and by quantifying the power levels of the characters or talking about the size of their Magical Core (there's an innuendo here somewhere, I'm sure of it) you take away most of the suspense for a fight between wizards except when they're both the same power level.

Also also, the terminology is all dumb and sounds really dumb and makes me want to quit stories because I can't imagine anyone saying "Magical Core" with a straight face.

Also also also, as I said in my original comment on that earlier post, no stories with power levels and stuff that I've seen have had a Vegeta "over 9000" reference, and they really should because it's a wasted opportunity.

/I don't, however, like Magical Cores./

They read usually like faux-science garbage like Midichlorians in Star Wars Episode I, and there are far more interesting (and less intrusive) ways to restrict the way magic behaves than by reducing it - because that's what Magical Cores do more often than not - to a basic, uninteresting, unsubtle... /thing/ that just makes a story worse by their very presence.

Like I said, I don't get that logic. "Magic is boring unless it conforms to these rules". And since JK did a poor job defining her world, those rules are based on opinion instead of anything based on the text. I think there's room for both stories, and I've read stuff with cores that I really liked and other stuff the was truly terrible.

Nothing like that. Magical cores are boring the way it's usually done. Of course, you can do it well. It's not often the case, and it's not often as interesting as other systems can be.

But it's not much a problem with magical cores per se, it's everything that often comes with it. Magical reservoirs, power levels as they're usually done in these fics, magical exhaustion, magical blocks and the like. It's usually unsubtle and boring.\\
And honestly, a lot (not all, but a lot) of stories that use magical cores would only be better without it.

*** It's not that magic in canon is vague and has no definition. They have stuff like magical theory, laws of magic (which sound a lot like the laws of physics or something). They also have arithmancy and runes, which are alluded to being factored in many other aspects of magic, at least arithmancy. (same way math is used in all science)

However JK doesn't borher explaining shit. Why? Because all that stuff doesn't concern Harry. Harry doesn't give a fuck if let's say: expansion charms are naturally designed to have the expanded space a level or so removed from reality due to the tendency of objects repeating themselves after some amount of space. (new concept I just thought of based on quantum states, just to give an example)

Other characters WOULD care, but JK's story is a rather limited to stuff mostly revolving aroung Harry.

I mean come on. Its said that Lilly's magic protected Harry, yet they never explain that more than her love was strong enough to will it. Why? Cause Harry never cared for high level magical theory and the such, thus wouldn't even understand had another explaination been given.

Another thing that enforces that view (that canon magic seems vague with no structure because Harry just doesn't care if it is structured or not) is that if all it took was to be strong emotionaly and just will it to happen: Voldemort would have won the war in a year or so. No dead Potters, no nothing.

**** Well - since you've explained - Rowling doesn't explain how it all works in canon, so therefore canon magic /is/ vague, and I didn't say it has no definition, but /less/ definition. You're likely right about magic having it's own rules and components that Harry never learns about or the reader isn't informed about, but anything there can only really be inferred. Regardless, there can still be rules and key components to magic - your space expansion theory is a good example of a singular rule, or Gamp's laws of Elemental Transfiguration - but Magical Cores are typically poorly-handled, poorly-implemented and poorly-written.

Generally, they spoil the magic-ness of magic by making into faux-science, which I don't want to read about. I'm absolutely fine with people coming up with rules - like you just did - and slotting them into canon magic because they can fit well, be mentioned in passing or easily worked into dialogue without an exposition dump, and have a distinct effect on a particular branch of magic or spell.

Magical Cores, on the other hand, are about quantifying /all/ magic, and once they're there, the Magical Core thrusts its grubby little paws into every facet of magic in a story, and I hate what that does to magic in the HP universe.

In the end, I never said that I don't want anyone to change anything about magic in stories ever, I just hate Magical Cores specifically, and the way they are typically written - for me this is very much a case of the idea being unappealing by association as, for every decent idea of a Magical Core there is, there are like fifty awfully-written versions too, and I'd rather just be done with the lot of it.

***** I know that the concept of magical cores can be twisted from what it can be into the abomination it usually turns into when used.

However as I have said in other comments in this post: Just because a concept is almost always poorly used it doesn't mean that it is a poor concept.

Personally magical cores should in no way be used to measure the quantity of magic or determine one's exact power. So you are born and your magic is like "dude, that's how powerful you will be, never growing weaker but never growing stronger." That's some major bullshit.

On the other hand, magical cores can be used to:

a)Pinpoint and measure talent, so you know...you have a grasp on what your raw, natural state is. But talent is just talent, it's useless unless you apply hard training and work on it.

OR

b)In a simillar ay determine the basic attributes of a wizard or witch. But that's if an author decides to use a system simillar to games or most xianxia novels.

Although my point still stands that canon magic is more or less unexplained because it wouldn't matter to the story if it was further expanded on. Rowling decided that Harry didn't give a flying fuck about why that spell did that and the other didn't. She decided that Harry cared about what spell can help aid him in his cause. Thus no need to explain stuff only elderly, scholary witches and wizards are concerned with.

It's not an objective judgement, for sure, but in the end I just can't stand Magical Cores, period.

As for canon magic, I agree with you - it /is/ unexplained, and I'm happy for people to try and elucidate matters with their own rules and additions, /as long as they're not Magical Cores/.

** All the below assumes that by "magical core" we mean that each wizard has access to a finite and quantifiable replenishing source of "magical energy", which they use to fuel their spells.

Why do I dislike this idea?

1. It is uncanonical and I prefer stories which stick to the canonical magic system, world and characterisations. In canon we never see wizards refer to any such core and we never see any wizard run out of magic (or even tire from magic use) despite some scenes of extended and intense magical activity.

2. It treats magic as quantifiable energy which I feel goes against the tone of the entire HP world. If undermines the supernatural aspect of magic and also the scholastic approach to magical theory (since, if magic is quantifiable energy, then magical theory would be essentially mathematical in nature and lending itself towards analogy with physical science, which also deals with quantity).

3. I do not like the idea of wizards being able to run out of magic. It makes them less wizards and more Muggles with a battery inside of them. Magic is supposed to be an essential part of wizards' being: for example, it has physiological effects which make wizards subtlety different from Muggles physically, such as their resistance to physical injury, as well as their slower ageing. I also feel like it is an attempt to arbitrarily weaken wizards relative to Muggles/technology.

4. It conflicts with the nature of wizarding society. If magical cores were a part of the system then magic becomes a scarce resource to be valued and conserved. Yet not once in the series is a view presented that one has to treat magic reverentially or with an attitude of conservation. Wizards use magic frivolously and continuously, for everything. It's as important a part of their daily lives as is their ability to walk.

5. From a writing perspective, I do not think it is good writing to resolve a conflict by having one character run out or run low on magic, a pre-determined and arbitrary fixed value. It would be like resolving a car chase in a Bourne movie by having one of the characters run out of gas. No, we want a car chase to be resolved through the relative learned and earned skills of the drivers as well as their personalities (such as their bravery/willingness to take risks).

*** And yet, in canon, "magical power" is treated as quantifiable (at least sort of) when Dumbledore and Harry board the boat in the horcrux cave meant for a single adult wizard and Dumbledore tells Harry that as a teenager, he won't be detected next to him.

Magic can be limited, and yet be frivously used. It depends on how quickly it replenishes, and how much you use. I certainly don't limit my moving around, even though I can't run forver, since in daily life, I won't run out of energy.

Having a character run low on ammunition/energy is a staple in stories. A hero having to deal with growing tired and even exhausted, is usually more appealing than an energiser bunny who can swing his sword around all day, without ever getting tired. Same for unlimited ammo.

**** Define magical power, is it the size of spells, the number that can be cast or the capability of an individual to cast more complex spells?

I strongly dislike the idea of putting a limit on the number of spells cast, firstly because I think it goes away from the magical world where magic is used for everything, secondly because I think it is almost impossible to work out a system for and can easily over complicate a story. How many stunning spells is a transfiguration worth? Is a killing curse more 'draining' than a conjuration? it also can lead to battle by numbers when used poorly.

The size of the spells and their ability to go above and beyond what a normal individual might be capable of using the same spell is a more workable concept for me. The idea that power is more like floodgates on an infinite ocean when the rate of flow can be higher for some than others but will never run out is something I can work with. Again though, it leaves open the idea of a battle by numbers rather than competency. As someone who does sport I can work with this a bit, sometimes you get freaks of nature who's raw physicality can overcome experience but it often takes away from the 'hero's journey' where they earn their power.

Competency = power might be the easiest to work with. It might not be the cleanest or most understandable and it opens up the merits of someone like Voldemort, Grindelwald and Dumbledore who have travelled and researched extensively. Teachers at Hogwarts who are experts in their area become powerful which feels about right. I think the idea of counter curses and rare spells opens up potential action scenes more than my blasting curse is bigger than yours.

Personally my preference is a blend of the later two done well.

This is definitely fatigue from the Dementor's effects, not from the casting. How do we know? Because we have numerous examples of Harry casting the Patronus other times and it does not tire him in the slightest, because he does not feel any of the effects of the Dementors (having successfully defended himself from them). The most obvious example being Harry's complete lack of exhaustion following his spell repelling a large number of Dementors at the end of PoA.

**** No one denies that magical power is a thing and different wizards have different levels of it. The argument is over the determining factors. My own (well publicised) interpretation is that a wizard's power is not a base attribute but rather a function of numerous complex factors - essentially, a magical expression of their entire character. Further, different levels of magical power can be explained in terms of quality without resorting to quantity. And finally, the context of the Cave boat quote is that Harry will not register as having magical power at all as he is under 17, which seems to imply that this particular enchantment measures number of magical adults in a binary sense rather than magical power directly (though other mentions of magical power guarantee that it is a thing, e.g. Moody on the Killing Curse).

As for the walking comparison, if the rate of replenishment is such that running out of magic is as uncommon as running out of food in our society then it becomes essentially non-functional as a story element and therefore raises questions as to why it is included in the first place.

If a spell by Voldemort can quantify magic, then canon has quantifiable magic, no matter how the magical power is composed. And apparently, in canon, there are upper limits for magical power so a spell can detect whether two wizards are present or just one by detecting their power. The consequences of that little tidbit are quite far-reaching - especially if you assume that "Magical Power" is composed of skill, experience, and other factors, since it pretty well means that Dumbledore is not even twice as "powerful" as an average wizard.

This is a circular argument.

"The USA is more powerful than San Marino". I think this is a statement which everyone would say is true. It is a fact that the USA and San Marino both have power, and that the USA's is much greater. But that doesn't mean that the USA has a literal pool of power. Nor does it mean that, because we can say that the USA's power is greater, we can precisely pin down the exact amount of power the USA has. The ability to order power does not imply that there exists a precise quantity.

It is perfectly possible to talk about relative power, and even to come up with rankings, without committing to a specific ontology of measurable power. It all depends on the type of power you're talking about: geopolitical power for example is not itself a base attribute which states possess but rather is something composed of innumerable contributing factors.

So to say that talk of power levels necessitates quantifiable power is to assume that the type of power in question is like physical energy rather than something else. But of course that is exactly the conclusion you are trying to prove. And assuming your conclusion is a circular argument.

It seems to me that magical power in HP, while very much a real existing thing - just like the USA's power - is somewhat more esoteric than you are attempting to portray. Events have power. Motivations have power. A person can be extremely powerful in some contexts (e.g. Lockhart's Obliviation charm) but useless in others (Lockhart's everything else). Wizards just as frequently refer to themselves has having powers plural as power, singular. Magical power in HP is clearly context-dependent, multi-faceted, and composed of many contributing factors such as understanding of magic, emotional state, character and personality, natural predispositions, etc. This complexity to me bears a closer resemblance to how we talk about political power than physical energy (though obviously it is not a 1-to-1 analogy, nor would I want it to be).

I also think you are placing over-reliance on the single passage in the cave. Not only should you be trying to consider canon as a whole, I think that passage in particular is bad as the sole foundation for any general magical theory, given its ambiguity - see below.

I don't think you have read this section correctly. Dumbledore states that Harry's powers will not /register/ next to his own because he is under 17. If something is not registered it is not noted at all. It is not that the enchantment is measuring Harry + Dumbledore and coming to the conclusion that there is still fewer than 2 wizards. Rather it is ignoring Harry completely and just noticing Dumbledore.

This seems to imply that the spell is simply an adult wizard counting spell: "I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.".

I'm not saying it's impossible for items of magic to compare individuals' magical power. The Goblet of Fire would be a strong contender for magic which does exactly that (among other things). I just don't think that this enchantment is an example of such a spell. Yes, Dumbledore initially says it's about the amount of magical power that crosses - but he then goes on to explain further. His initial statement - which can easily be seen as idiom, or figurative language - has to be interpreted in light of his elaboration, not in isolation.

********** What would it mean in your opinion for magic to be quantifiable? That a wizard has a specific capacity for magic that they cannot exceed? That there is a unit for magic, and you can say, yeah Dumbledore is a 1.6 power wizard, and Harry is just a 0.3, so 1.9<2.

It makes the whole premise of "magic" feel wrong. The entire problem with that is that it sets limits on people; actual physical limitations. Even if it's like you could "grow" or excercise and become more powerful, it goes against how magic should work, emotionally driven and not limited or honestly, quantifiable.

As to the boat, how does it work? How would it judge whether there is just one wizard or more? Looking at some of the other different kinds of magic we've seen, let's say age lines. How does an age line judge age? It isn't physical age, aging potions don't work against it. The problem with either case is magic seems, in a way being able to judge, (also seen with the goblet of fire choosing the most worthy competitor by a piece of paper alone), in a way "sentinent".

So, looking at that, I agree that magic can be sensed, in a way, but "quantifiable" is not the word I'd use for it, as it implies that it's more scientific in nature, or actual physical quantities that can be judged. I would say it's more like being in a class of students and judging who the best people are. If you go only by marks, sure it's quantifiable, but if you want to see what their general knowledge, their responses to different situations, their personalities, it becomes a whole different issue. So you could say that one kind, helpful, intelligent gal that stands first in class is the "best", but how much better is she than the others?

****** Pretty sure the exhaustion aspect is more to do with physical exhaustion and not magical exhaustion, otherwise magical ability would just be muted once someone has used too much magic and the wizard would be physically able to defend themselves or try to run away. I don't think that's a thing otherwise we would have seen a spell that could mute magical ability (or drain it away) as a standard DADA spell instead of all the physically disruptive spells like /Full-Body Bind Curse/, /Stunning Spell/, /Disarming Charm/. Wizards have very little concept of combat outside of magic (I can't recall any punching or hitting from anyone but wizards who have lived among muggles) so I doubt there is any way to be out of magic from use in any aspect unless you're unconscious.

Magical power (which is cannon) has nothing to do with magical endurance. I don't think there is such thing as a magical endurance because you would see kids being unable to have classes back to back when they are just starting out. If a kid can't get a spell to cast, resulting in it to just fizzle out or not happen at all, repeatedly trying to cast it would just deplete said magical capacity again and again instead of allowing it to build up to a sufficient level to cast it. That's not the case

Despite, the amount of magic one has at his disposal may very well not be correlated (or completely correlated) with one's power, for all we know.

Despite, maybe everyone has the same amount of magic or close, and it just grows throughout childhood until being 'mature' when one reaches adulthood, and one's power depends on something else entirely.

Dumbledore could very well be more powerful than most, not because he can wield a higher amount of magic, but because his magic itself has become more powerful for a variety of reasons.

** Its a concept that if implemented correctly can lead to very good magical system. However as others have said most times magical cores are used to show that that guy is naturally more powerful as that one.

In my opinion magical cores should be used to determine natural talent and magical reserves. The more powerful your core is the more talented you are and MAY get tired not as easily. However talent doesn't make you stronger than others. You do get a small boost but you have to properly take advantage of that.

It also would make sense if older lines had a stronger magical core on average than say muggleborns. Why? Cause unless a muggleborn is the offspring of a squib from a powerful magical family, then their line has no connection with magic save from themselves. On the other hand pureblood families have been in contact with magic for eons, thus making the magic more... Connected with them.

TL/DR: Magical cores are a hit or miss concept. Personally the best way to use them is to measure innate talent, not power.

For instance, linkffn(2636963) Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past uses the idea in a couple of ways that work pretty well. On the other hand, I recall one story where there was a spell that made actual numbers showing the strength of someone's core appear: that one didn't make it on to my favourites list so I can't link it.

In my headcanon, something like a core does exist. They're what determines a witch or wizard's magical power. They grow over time, but not infinitely, and this increases the witch/wizards power. They never "run out" of magic.

I can understand those who don't like cores because nothing in canon mentions them. If you want things to be 100% canon-compatible then that's fine, but I happen to think there's a lot of things just wrong in canon, and a lot of things that can be added to it to make the landscape richer.

The whole HP magic is unscientific, but parallels can be made with medieval alchemy (proto-science) and some parts of social sciences. An interesting fact : the definitive separation between magicals and non-magicals happened in 1692, only 5 years after Newton's Principia which is considered a founding point of the scientific method; it can be seen as the moment where magicals and non-magicals understanding of the world definitively diverged, where the gap in the way these populations understand the world became a chasm too wide to be bridged.

That's a problem with the author, though, not with magic.\\
You don't need magical cores to make magic consistent, usually, they're used to merely restrict it. What you need is a coherent magic system, known by the author who sticks to it.

** I like magical cores because, despite the seemingly illogical nature of magic, the idea that there is a central well of power and it is both observable and measurable is a step towards [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic][Sufficiently Analyzed Magic!]]

Also, why does everyone stick with the "Internal Battery" metaphor? Why not compare it to our natural "chemical cores" - more commonly known as our stomachs? The core (perhaps your soul?) "gathers", "processes", and/or "energizes" you with magic collected from the world itself? Or what if it's a /well/ - an access point to a global reservoir of magic?

IDK, that's just my 2-cents.

** My thought is that they don't really do anything for a story that couldn't be done in other ways. So, then it's a just a prop. And then I ask, if that's the case, why even bother? The answer is that some authors need crutches since they lack originality or creativity and the best they can do is take bits and pieces from a hundred other stories and combine them into one "new" conglomeration. They saw them used in a story they liked, so therefore they use it in their story.

People always try to do the whole "cliches done right" thing, but this is one of them that I can't think of any stories that have actually benefited from having magical cores. It's just a cop out.

For example in that story Bill Weasley's core has a wooden aura and manifests in the colours of the forest, or as a tree. It's then said that Bill is skilled in dendromancy and wards of protective and offensive nature.

Same way Harry's core is a hell of fire and his ace in the hole is pyromancy.

** The idea, in my case. There are good stories that include magical cores, so I don't dismiss a fic for just that, but even those stories would be better with a more subtle magical system.

Magical cores remove the 'magic' from magic. Suddenly, it's not as marvelous and mysterious anymore. I like the idea of magic being something entirely different from the functioning of the universe.\\
Magic should be this mysterious force that you barely understand but allows you to break the laws of physics. The concepts of magical cores, magical energy and power levels (at least in that form) hinder that.

And frankly, magical cores just can't compete with the way magic is shown in canon. It seems lazy, too.

I do agree though that you don't need magical cores to avoid energiser bunny wizards - I personally don't use the concept. However, having some "Inner magic" you can connect to, and sense, is not a bad concept, and used in many works of fiction, to good effect.

****** It all depends on what you put into those terms. Magical cores usually imply magical reservoirs of some kind, and also that a specific part of yourself is some sort of battery and is what makes you a wizard.\\
Inner magic simply means that you have magic in yourself and are able to use it or connect to it. It doesn't have the same connotations.

What I don't like about magical cores is everything that comes with it. If it were used just as a way to reference someone's magic, or as a way to model it while not actually being the real thing (I remember a fic like that, though I can't recall which one it was), I wouldn't care much about it.

** The idea is disliked because there's not much that it can bring that cannot be brought by simply having magic be, and none of the people actually using it as a story element do so for the sake of using them to introduce those elements that need magical cores and instead use them either to power-wank (“oh wetness, hi's power level i's the greatestestest” or to introduce an unreasonable handicap and enemies out of nowhere (“oh noe's, Dumbledore binded Harry's magical core's (and is stealing the Potter fortune and also sends money to Durseleyis to make them abuse poor Harry) to make him hi's toy because his manipulative dark wizard”), and often enough even for both of those things at once.

Magical cores aren't an intrinsically bad idea, but the average level of execution is ... about on the level of the stuff in the brackets, meaning very very very low (and that's understating it, since I tried to make the stuff in brackets eye-searingly horrible). This ... hmm, constant level of unreasonable shoddiness, did over time translate to some people disliking the plot element that the magical cores are itself, because when you see an idea that is /never/ implemented well it can be easy to just treat it as crud by default.

** Another good concept is that magical cores determine one's base attributes on certain "stats". Look at it like a game. A roleplaying one:

Every character must have a magical core.

Different magical cores have different sizes (not literally, rather than physically think of a value called size). Some are stronger, some weaker. Magical cores also have different appearances. No wizard or witch can have a magical core identical to another person.

Now those three attributes of a core can be used as variables that determine:

a) One's magical reserves, aka mana. That'd be based on the size of one's magical core.

b) One's innate magical prowess, aka magical damage. Based on the core's power/strength.

c) One's affinity about certain branches of magic. For example: your magical core looks like a giant flaming ball of fire, ergo you are naturaly inclined towards pyromancy.

Granted the first two stats (a and b) can be increased or decreased based on certain actions one takes.

For example: Wands have their own magical core. That means they MUST be able of storing at least a small amount of magical energy (mana) inside them (according to the concept I created above). That is thus added to a witch or wizard's magical reserves.

TL/DR: Think of it like a game. Magical cores determine your amount of mana and magical damage, as well as what skills would most suit you. Not which fields you will most excel in, rather waht subjects come naturally "easier" to you. (Like saying I am good at calculus, people freak out)

Additionally mana reserves and magical damage can be changed by outside influences. So the stats your core gives you don't define you throughout your life. They act as a guidance.
