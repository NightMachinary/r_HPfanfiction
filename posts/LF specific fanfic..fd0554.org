:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry sees Hermione with her parents in flourish and blotts and she has a bunch of books in her basket & he says that they are too advanced for her at this time. Her parents agreed. She wants revenge on Harry, ends up cheating at Hogwarts, and gets caught. She has been stealing other students work and giving them in as her own and leaving them to hand in hers. (she also steals and writes all over people's work with the wrong answers when 'helping' them)

I'm not certain if it is a time travel fix it or not.
