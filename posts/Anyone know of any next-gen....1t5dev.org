I'm having a hard time finding good next-gen stories that aren't exclusively focused on Scorrose. As much as I love them, there are like fifteen characters in this generation to play around with, so I'm kinda bored of that. Anything goes, as long as it has most of the cousins at least in it. Also, cousincest is fine, if you know of anything good. Especially Rose/Albus. But mostly I'm just looking for next-gen in general that is quality writing and isn't Lily/Scorpius and is more than one romance.


** Inverarity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] is Teddy-centric and quite good. (Novel-length, complete).

Bad Mum's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199992/1/A-Strictly-Legal-Matter][A Strictly Legal Affair]] is a Rose/Draco one-shot (and surprisingly good for an otherwise squicky pairing).

Deadwoodpecker's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4337434/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-II-The-Book-of-Albus][Backward with Purpose II: The Book of Albus]] is one of my favorite stories (Albus-centric, novel-length, complete), but you probably need to read BWP I to make much sense of it.

** The Albus Potter Series by NoahPhantom. There will be 7 total books, as well as a prequel to the series, however the prequel isn't too important, just back-story. Author is just finishing up book 4 now. Here is the first one.

** I read all kinds of next gen! Two questions: are you looking specifically for romance and do you mind if there are OCs?

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=325749][Clash]] is a Rose and Albus story and deliciously intense and no-holds barred--I haven't had the time to properly read this, but what I have seen is very very good.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309592][All The Abstract Nouns]] is a gen Molly II fic about growing up in her teen years--a common premise, but this fic makes it amazing. She's relatable and though her experiences are familiar, they feel fresh.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] is narrated by Rose but is Weasley-family centric and gives backstory to just about every next gen character. It's my favorite-ever family fic.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]] is a Victoire/Teddy/Molly II and my favorite romance story. It's a love triangle that actually matters, with stakes and mistakes that don't necessarily heal cleanly.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] is Hugo-centric, an adorable adventure story with the best bromance between him, Scorpius, and Neville.
- If you don't mind a fic that is unfinished but one of the best grown-up rom-coms while it lasts, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=286886][After Hours]] is great. It rotates between Rose, Molly, Lily, and Lucy's love lives.
- Similarly for [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][The Morning Waffle]] which is a great humor story even if it isn't complete. It's narrated by Fred II, and also has James, Albus, and others in a radio show.

I tried to give a variety; I still have more, if you'd like! :)

*** Not specifically for romance, anything that's good. I'll check those out. If you have more, post them.

**** - I'd recommend any of [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet's]] stories. She writes a lot of Scorpius stories (either gen or paired with Lucy), and they tend to melancholy with a wry humor. Counting Daisy Roots is a really original take, with Scorpius dealing with the consequences of being sort-of resurrected.
- GubraithianFire has great writing style (complete opposite of JKR's though). [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327575][Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends]] is a dark, Hogwarts-political Albus/OC currently being updated, but is pre-completed. Something lighter but with a similar cynical flair is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=300442][The Horror!]]
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=297210][Out of Time]] is a Lucy/Moody time-travel romance with a noir-like atmosphere.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][I write next gen too!]]

** This is the best next gen I've ever read. I've always loved the concept of next gen fics, and then always felt disappointed because they're too heavy on the romance side - that may appeal to some, but not to me personally, I'm afraid. But this... Oh my merlin, this is a fantastic story. There is romance (I know you said no scorose, but this is seriously worth a read, and they're not a couple for most of it), loads of suspense, some fantastic action scenes, a well developed host of characters, including canon next gen kids, and some brilliant Ocs... It's just... Wow. It's called Ignite, and is by Slide, and is superb. I cannot recommend it highly enough. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613]]

*** I'll check it out. It's not that I want no Scorose, it's that I don't want it to be only Scorose, in the sense of only focusing on them, because I feel like that's what most of next-gen fics are.
