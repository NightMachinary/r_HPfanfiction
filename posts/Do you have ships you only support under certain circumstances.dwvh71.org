I like Snape and Lily, but I can only really ship it if he changes while they're in school because he feels like he's gone too far down the wrong path once they're adults.

Do you all have ships like that? If so, what's the ship and what are the circumstances under which you ship it?


** Yes, I only accept pairing Harry and Hermione (and Ginny) with Death Eaters in extreme AUs and time travels.

With respect to canon Hermione and Draco, there needs to be a significant passage of time, and Draco's actions postwar must be convincing enough for me.

I don't think that there is much for him to do where he could redeem himself after the war. Unless you make up a new villain where he leads the resistance, I don't see many avenues where he could do enough to make up for 6 years of blatant racism, sadism (eg Hagrid and Buckbeak) and outright war crimes. Well, unless you believe in punitive justice and consider him spending a few decades behind bars (or a few years in canon Azkaban) sufficient to pay for his mistakes.

The two big issues with Draco redemptions are that you either redeem him early enough so that he can have an impact on the war (which would not be in line with his character until way too late) or you redeem him in a fashion which would make him almost unrecognisable compared to canon. The one way I can see Dramione happen would be the second option, where you have him think differently after the first book and have a gradual change of heart over the next few books. But the result would be nothing like his canon self. And that would not please his fans.

That's the issue with Bellatrix in fanfics as well. I know that I am somewhat infamous for advocating the possibility of shipping her with Harry or Hermione, but I can only see it happen in ONE specific way which most of the Bellatrix/Bellamione fans do not want to see. Namely, Bellatrix defecting before the DoM showdown (or preventing it in some other way) as that would be the only way to avoid the complications of Sirius' death and her torturing Hermione. Because that is one big oof I don't think time travel can fix.

But the Bellamione crowd is really into that dynamic, and the only fic I can think of which manages the flood under the bridge is "Passageways", because it has Harry travel into the 70s at the start of his 5th year.

**** Don't know why you were downvoted when you're speaking the truth. Draco was a villain and I don't understand why so many people overlook his actions. The same goes for Bellatrix really. I can understand if some authors are attracted to the actors which played them, but their characters were despicable. Pairing them in any sort of consensual scenario with the good guys is a no-no for me. There are some nice fics with time travel and a young Bella, though.

But Harry and Hermione would still remember her killing Sirius, even if she hasn't technically done it yet. Same for her torturing Hermione. On an intellectual basis, you might be able to separate past Bellatrix from that, but not in your heart.

Actually, that's the issue with Dramione and Drarry as well.

***** Draco was a more comic relief villain in the early books - the rich bully that exists for Harry to outdo and humiliate. He's not likeable, but he's not a monster - and it's very easy to see he's just been raised that way.

In later books, he does some despicable things. But the writing makes his hesitation and apparent coercion very easy to see, making the reader more sympathetic to Draco. And, at least for me, books 5-7 inform my view of characters and canon much less than 1-4 emotionally

**** The "6 years" bit is a bit much - not only was Draco a minor for most of that time, being a bully/racist in secondary school is bad, but not something that ought to ruin you for life. Particularly with the way he was raised, really.

That really means his actions in the earlier books aren't a huge deal in the postwar aspect, imo. It's only the last 2ish books that have the actual real problems. And we don't really know how he acted after the war - he could have collaborated in a purge of death eaters, spilled the beans on everything he knew, claimed he was being forced into it, etc.

As for redemption afterwards, it really wouldn't be hard to pull off. The writer just needs to focus on the right aspects and how to frame things - if you've read the stormlight archives, Dalinar is a great example of how what a character did in the past doesn't have to inform the reader's opinion

****** I believe that in canon, the battle of Hogwarts takes place when Harry/Malfoy are still underage (close to turning 18). We don't treat minors the same way as we do adults, particularly if they've been indoctrinated.

Like I said, Dracos early years are irrelevant. You can make the argument about the last 1-3 books, sure, but starting year 1 is ridiculous imo. You don't use someone's jerkishness as a 12 year old to justify life in prison/execution. Stick to the later aspects if you want to make Draco iredeemable, though I don't see the appeal of holding to that view in fanfiction

I am not, I use that to justify Hermione not wanting to bang the guy she remembers calling for the extermination of people like her at 12.

You get him out of the picture with an offhand line how he has been executed or thrown into prison for the shit he did in HBP. The less Malfoy appears in fanfics, the better.

**** The good guys didn't raise the Hood - she was raised by a spell a head of the DoM had cast in the 19th century, after he heard a prophecy he didn't quite get. And yes, the Hood alone wouldn't have ben a match for the Bismarck. So, the good guys worked hard on understanding how to raise such ships - while the Bismarck raised the Kriegsmarine.

The Iowa-class ships would have been useless against the Bismarck here - they never sank so couldn't have been raised as shipgirls, and they would have had a very hard time hitting a man-sized target moving at 30 knots with their main guns - the good guys had the RN test that against the Hood.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** There's a large assortment of DE ships that I don't care for no matter what, because I don't care for the Death Eater at all in question. The rest are conditional -- Severus (I prefer to avoid 1978-1981 becase at this point he's firmly a Death Eater with nothing redeeming about him), Draco (if removed from Lucius' influence OR several years post-war) and Bellatrix (during the period she's still at school and presumably not yet firmly a mad Voldemort supporter).

Snily is my personal favorite ship, but I prefer to avoid the 1978-1981 and post-Halloween fics -- I've probably read them all anyway due to how few longer fics with the ship actually exist, but with the exception of Puzzle, I wouldn't have missed anything if I had skipped them -- the fact that he was a fully fledged Death Eater for most of the recent period makes me uncomfortable with the setting, especially since he gave the Prophecy. However, I don't mind post-war (and post-school!) SSHG, or the occasional SSOC outside the 1978-1981 period. In fact, I avoid SS-centric fics within the 1978-1981 period alltogether, ship or not (apart from AUs where he never joined the Death Eaters), because I detest reading about the inevitable angst that would arise for this period, nor do I care for reading fics from a true DE's point of view.

I don't read Drarry because I don't read slash, but in the rare case where I decide to read Dramione, I much prefer post-war years later when he has presumably redeemed himself offscreen. Still, it's not a ship I like particurly much, but unlike basically every other DE ship, not one I avoid unconditionally. I don't read any other Draco ship.

There's the occasional Harry/Bellatrix fic I see recommended, the only fics of this ship that I don't outright ignore are those where she's still in school and presumably sane. I did like Delenda Est, for example.
