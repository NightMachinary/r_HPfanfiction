And I don't mean modifying existing ships/weaponry/etc already existing like we see in most sci-fi series crossover fanfics with HP. But for the purposes of this discussion lets mainly focus on ship building.

No, I'm talking about if HP wizards, who managed to learn about and master (or at least have a good working knowledge of) Star Wars technologies and general starship design (or at least works with someone who does know) and build their own starship classes from scratch while taking into account the uses of incorporating HP magics into how they are designed and operated.

I've always had this thought in the back of my head about what HP Wizards could truly come up with if they ever tried to build their own Space Navy, that truly incorporates all the advantages of HP Magic into the design while improving on the SW Tech.

I'd like to here everyone's thoughts on this. Just as long as it's the Wizards building the Starships, Ground Vehicles, Medicine, etc while ultilizing knowledge of SW Technological and scientific principles to improve, or even invent new, technologies. Basically, SW-based magitek.

Also, take into account the limitations of HP Magic as sometime people forget that it has those limitations and just say "They have no need for starships just use Apparition" as that's just lazy, as since for example, say Apparition has it's own limitations: like the fact it has certain range-limit and becomes increasingly difficult with the distance to be traveled (It's stated that Inter-continental Apparition alone should only be attempted by the most highly skilled of wizards, otherwise risking Splinching, severe injury, and even death.), Another is that while Apparition can be used by Wizards to go to places they've never been or can't visualize as long as they have a name to go off of (Example, Harry and Hermione going to Godric's Hollow) but due to lack of clear visualization when dealing with new destinations, they can't choose exactly where they would appear. Also, apparently not all Wizards are capable of Apparating, which is why a lot of them use other methods instead. See what I'm getting at here? With these magical limitations in mind, it would make sense that they would probably build starships for interstellar travel if they found themselves in such a setting. With a little help, if they didn't know how.

Perhaps either by having some tech-savy Wizards learn up about it OR since they are in a new world commission a shipwright to help them design these new vessels while using their magic to help with it's construction and adding the ships magical features.

Another thing I'd like to see if someone could come up with their own unique ship classes that utilize HP Magic in addition to improved SW tech.

NOTE: Assume that for the purposes of this discussion that the Force and Magic are equated with each other in some manner and that they have someone helping them that know and/or have mastered the technological principles of the SW universe and is collaborating with them to design and build these ships.


** I'm picturing actual ships like in treasure planet - sails, oars, the whole bit. They'd be built using similar methods as broomsticks with large scale bubble head charms, expanded spaces, and some AI aspects like the Weasley's car develops. Wizards in space would be a lot like the MCU Asgardians visually.

** They'd probably be steampunk-ish in design and nature, no?

If they're still stuck in the Victorian era of design and infrastructure, they wouldn't have much else to go on. Though, this question is under the assumption that they've advanced enough to have knowledge of Star Wars type ships. So they'd probably look like literally anything. If they advanced enough to that level, they'd either look like any other muggle ship that's out there, or they'd look similar.

Outside of portkeys, we have don't really have much to go on for how they travel super long distances. They'd either borrow from Muggle design or whichever era they're currently in.

*** Assume there are Muggleborns who have some idea what their doing OR they hire someone who does like say Blissex-Wessex family, whose members are notable for creating the Victory-class & Republic-class Star Destroyers, the Venator, Imperial, and Executor-class Star Destroyers, Delta-7 Aetherspite-class light interceptor and Alpha-3 interceptor, and RZ-1 A-wing interceptor to help them with the designing and building of these ships to take advantage of their Magic's various practical applications.

Basically, assume they have someone helping them that does know and is collaborating with them to design and build these ships.

**** I'm trying to be magical and creative about thinking this through, but I honestly don't think they'd be different or special in regards to other starships. JKR tried to make everything seem magical, but when you get down to it, none of the architecture was inspiring or creative. It was Medieval to Victorian and Gothic. I don't think they're nearly creative enough to come up with something that differs much, even with Muggleborns. The Muggleborns would base their designs more on Muggle designs, and the Purebloods would base them on whatever their society's current design standards are at.

If we're saying that magic is the same as the Force, then they couldn't really do anything weird. We never hear of spells that make things unbreakable, unless we're talking Fanfiction, so they couldn't have glass yachts flying around. I stand by thinking that they'd either be Steampunk in design, or whatever the rest of the universe is using at that time.

***** Actually, you'd be wrong about that unbreakable part. Hermione makes the jar holding Rita Skeeter unbreakable in Book 4.

HP (canon) magic has shown all sorts of avenues for magic improving SW ship design. For example, they can design small freighters with cargo space matching that of huge freighters using space expansion charms, in addition to being lighter due to feather-weight charms that save on fuel due to having to moves less mass, and that's not even bringing shrinking charms into account to make for even more room on a ship. Or make even Starfighter Carriers that are small but capable of great carrying capacity. And that's just canon charms applications.

You got to think more outside the box.

** For warships I think a reasonable idea is to build the ships on the conventional Star Wars manner, but make them unplottable. It's also reasonable to mount systems of surfaces spelled to be unbreakable on the outer hull.

I imagine combat looking like this: You detect a starship, or a tiny fighter, or something. Unfortunately targeting systems are malfunctioning. Something is suddenly visible on light telescopes. You try to export targeting co-ordinates to the guns, but the telescope output is giving malformed co-ordinates. You're suddenly hit by cannon-fire, rattling your shields.

Imagine having to deal with an ordinary bomber aircraft which had been treated in this way.

** 1. Use space mass expansion charms, time turners and portkeys to build the TARDIS.
2. Take whatever vessel they find visually appealing and add featherlight, space expansion, modified bubblehead and unbreakable charms, insert engines and go. I like the idea of the Rook taking flight, personally. We would see a lot of weird ship design. Treasure planet is definitely an option here too, if that Durmstrang ship was any indication. I don't think they would go for boring old muggle ship design if they don't have to and if wizarding tents or the Beauxbatons carriage are any indication...
3. Create something slapped together from various modules like the Weasley's house, held together by magic alone.
4. Weapons systems are where it gets interesting. Portkey bombs, potions, magical plants or creatures onto enemy ships? Unbreakable hulls with perfect, magical shields? Standard duelling spells are not very useful here, but anything that improves guns definitely would be. Internally extended barrels and such are only the more mundane application here. A front-mounted Basilisk with a bubblehead charm might be terrifyingly effective, even if all it does is petrify.
