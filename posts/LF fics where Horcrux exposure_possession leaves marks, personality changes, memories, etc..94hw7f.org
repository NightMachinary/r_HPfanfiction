One good example is in linkffn(Itachi, Is That A Baby?) what what happens to Ginny with the Diary, but fics where this heavily spiritual magical object leaves marks for exposure would be nice.

Like, beyond Harry gaining Parseltongue he starts getting memories or starts having his personality take on some of Riddle's traits from the scarcrux, or Ginny being left with tangible marks from her long and repeated possessions instead of seeming fine for the rest of the series (anxiety and nightmares notwithstanding).


** Definitely Ginny in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), who began acting like Bellatrix (according to Harrymort), spoke parseltongue, and could perform legilimency.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

*** Barely spoke Parseltongue to be honest.

Thanks,\\

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
