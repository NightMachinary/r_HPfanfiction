Preferably I'd like one where Harry goes and talks to Ginny about the valentine's day letter she sent him, but that's a very specific request, so at the very least I'd like one that starts in Harry's second year.


** It seems to me that the ideal starting point for this would be after CoS. If fighting a troll together can bond people, fighting a basilisk must do - and Hermione was just a as useless as Ginny was in the equivalent scenario.

  This story will be a series of unrelated chapters. All will be based on different moments in the JKR books where Harry and Ginny could have gotten together before they did in the Canon Story. Though the first is in the CoS they will be posted at random.

** linkffn(Down the Rabbit Hole by Accusatrix) is excellent. It was meant to be a Dark!Harry/Dark!Ginny story, but it was abandoned before it reached that stage. The set up is excellent though.

Book II of the Grey Maiden series has Harry befriending Ginny. Also, both Ginny and Harry are in Slytherin. linkffn(Gey Maiden II: Slytherin's Heir)

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) has Harrymort befriending Ginny in year 2. For a certain value of friendship, at least.

linkffn(Unspeakable Things) by Darth Marrs has both Harry and Ginny trained together by the DoM. Like all DM stories, it is entertaining in parts, but falls apart towards the end.

link(The amplitude, frequency and Resistance of the Soul bond) is a guilty pleasure of mine.

Sovran's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=11833&chapter=all][Meaning of One]] puts them together in Harry's first year. Never read it though.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore!

** Most of the fics that have them become friends after the CoS are already posted in this thread, so here are two fics that has Harry and Ginny become friends during GoF, when Ron's being a prat:

linkffn(A Friend Indeed): Not too long, nice story that follows the happenings of GoF.

linkffn(The Thorny Rose): starts duing GoF, the trilogy spans the next few years. Has a kind of different and slightly manipulative Ginny. Well written and very enjoyable, though!

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny!

He starts writing her in his first year as well. It's a very funny story, together with the sequel, since Harry sees himself as a Kneazle. Ginny's a whirlwind as well.

**** In my opinion, Harry is very well done - often thinking more like a Kneazle than a human. I also think the changes to the canon plot resulting from his change are well-thought out. Dumbledore's handling the changes well, and Arabella Figg and her brother Sebastian are nicely-crafted characters. Most of all though it's very funny to read, with nice little touches and jokes. This Harry, for example, wants to enter the TWT since he thinks that's the best way to impress a female.

*** There was one part where Harry starts talking about sex to McGonagall, and I just couldn't read it anymore. It's meant to be funny, but it was so strange and awkward I had to put it aside after that. I just can't handle humor that has a character unknowingly making a fool of himself. Combine that with the fact that Harry ran through the Burrow starkers at one point made me not pick it up anymore. To each their own.
