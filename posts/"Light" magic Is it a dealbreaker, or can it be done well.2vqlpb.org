It's no secret that 'the (L)ight' in HP is essentially a fanon invention, but I sometimes struggle to understand the kneejerk reactions that some in the community (including myself, oddly) exhibit when it features in a fic - especially when one considers that the nature of magic in general is often handled clumsily.

Many Dark Arts-heavy stories on FF rely on a profile of magic that is unsupported by canon (i.e. negative emotions such as hate and anger when only the Cruciatus Curse has been confirmed to require such), but there are several fics out there that handle the subject well. On the flipside, I can't think of many (if any) stories where "Light Arts" are actually used or even addressed: it's just a term used by wizards who hate the Dark Arts.

I can only think of one fanfic off of the top of my head which explores the idea in an interesting context, and that's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][Sitra Ahra]]. Otherwise, it's a red-trimmed amber flag for me when reading a new story.

So how do you all prefer your "Light" in HP fics? Not at all, by compounding on existing concepts within canon or just an altogether original approach?


** It's funny you mention explorations of Light Magic, I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6939995/1/The-Crown-of-M%C3%A8tis][The Crown of Metis]] the other day. I don't recall how I found it though.

Summary for the curious:

#+begin_quote
  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

*** Just finished reading this. The concepts of self-sacrifice and pacifism among others were expected, though it was well-reasoned to the last paragraph. Especially interesting were the White Arts' reputation for being unattainable in contrast to Dark magic being an easy route to power.

Thanks for recommending it!

** It doesnt matter personally to me. I've seen stories where basically all magic that isnt "Dark" is Light.

Most fics only have the Patronus that is in my opinion "Light Magic"

Now that i think about it. I rather not go into any more detail than this spell is Light and this one is Dark. Unless its crucial to the fic for whatever reason and i cant think of any reason why "Light" would need to be described as anything other than opposite of "Dark"

** There's various reasons to dislike it.

Firstly, it's a clichéd fantasy trope that crops up again and again in fantasy lit. For me the main attraction of HP is that JKR doesn't come from the mainstream fantasy tradition. She hasn't read all the fantasy classics, she doesn't play RPGs, etc. That gives her world a unique flavour that's completely refreshing compared to the fantasy canon. Incorporating elements of that fantasy canon just undermines it.

Secondly, it leads to overly simplistic morality that removes interesting complexity from the story. If good and bad are easily identifiable and objectively determined by the universe itself then there's no room for interesting moral dilemmas and grey areas.

Thirdly, it leads to overly simplistic magic. Canon is wonderfully ambiguous about what dark magic is, and that's good, because in real life the fundamental workings of the universe are a mystery to us too. Wizards /shouldn't/ be able to neatly explain everything in their world.

Finally, it undermines the moral core of HP, which is that evil is an aberration. Having dark magic and light magic as separate bodies, with "neutral" magic in the middle, makes being good as much of an aberration from the norm as being evil. This is rather against the moral tone of HP, where people are good until they choose evil.

*** Agreed, for the most part. I'm somewhat optimistic that there's scope to redeem the concept, though.

1. It's definitely a cliché - no real arguments there. But it can be refreshing to find a trope with a twist, or even one that's executed properly, which is seldom the case in fanon.

2. In the vast majority of fanfics and a lot of fantasy lit, yes. That being said, it depends on how one views the relationship between magic and morality in HP. Can one inform the other, and if so, to what degree? Not every Dark Arts practitioner in canon was fundamentally evil, so the reverse doesn't need to be true for a hypothetical branch of light magic.

3. Again, agreed. But what if the inclusion of a positive or "lighter" branch of magic is just as, if not more ambiguous in nature than that of the Dark Arts? Lily's (and subsequently Harry's) sacrificial protection was a fundamentally good act, but exactly how it works is anyone's guess - hence the Love Room in the Department of Mysteries.

4. Absolutely - except when it isn't portrayed as an aberration as such. The Crown of Metis posted above is a great case study here, in that light magic/White Arts become increasingly difficult to attain, similar to the inferred trouble some Dark wizards and witches have when attempting to cast the Patronus Charm. We all do questionable things from time to time, so one could argue that we're deviating from the norm with every step.

** Light and Dark I can live with, having spells that require emotional components is fairly easy to believe, as is referring to positive emotions as 'Light' and negative ones 'Dark'. Grey is where I generally give up, while moral and emotional grey areas certainly exist having it be it's own separate branch of magic is just daft.

The other use of Light and Dark actually bothers me more. Describing characters as 'Light' or 'Dark' as an absolute aspect is just absurd, and leaves no room for interesting character development in some cases. Similarly for describing 'sides' of the war.

I'll never stop reading just because things are described as light or dark but I've never seen it used in a way that benefits the story.

*** Pretty much this. When I think of a Dark wizard, I think of someone who happens to be a proficient or prolific Dark Arts practitioner. Grindelwald, Voldemort and Lucius Malfoy are three very different wizards, from what we know of them.

As for actual "Grey" magic, yeah. No idea what that's about.

** Maybe the Patronus counts, or the "True Patronus" from Methods of Rationality, but I don't know that I'm familiar with the convention beyond those implicit examples.

I don't like the idea. It does sound a bit overly simplistic in terms of morality.

** The issue I see is the cruciatus curse. Harry, who can cast the Patronus fully, has trouble casting the cruciatus curse. And not for a lack of trying nor reason.

So what does that mean? He's shown an aptitude for spell casting (powerfully or powerful spells).

So does the spell actually require some significant element of malice? Can only 'evil' characters use the spell properly? If HP magic isn't based on some morality scale how do the spells work?

Not that I want there to be a morality scale to base magic on. Just. How do we answer these questions?

*** Harry only has issues casting the cruciatus the first time. At the end of DH he is able to use it just fine and later goes to sacrifice himself. So I'd say this disproves that only evil characters can use the spell properly.

*** Bellatrix told Harry that "you have to mean it", and claimed that righteous anger wasn't enough, you had to /want/ to inflict /suffering/. That's why it barely worked the first time he cast it.
