:END:
So Harry at some point had learned how to induce visions, but the process was dangerous and Harry had little practice. At some point something happens to make Harry desperate and he does something (pretty sure he inhales some sort of fumes but it could be a potion or tea) and goes into a sort of coma and I'm pretty sure Dumbledore finds him. (I'm also pretty sure Dumbledore is the one who taught him how to)

Bonus: There's another story with a scene where Harry is watching some duelers and he notices that their poses represent something like stars in constellations, making their magic stronger


** Might be By the Divining Light linkffn(5201703) or its sequel for the first one.

No idea about the second one.
