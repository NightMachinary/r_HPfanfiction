This was a Slytherin Harry fic on ao3 and the basis was that Harry was incredibly anxious? And at one point Harry, Draco and another student end up in a potions cupboard while trying to find their way to the dungeons and Harry freaks out because Draco almost touched a poisonous flower and snape stopped him just in time? If anyone could point me in the direction of this fic I would be incredibly grateful.
