I keep seeing this rule - typically told to the firsties in the Slytherin Common Room by Snape after the feast - in fics which are presented from Slytherin's POV, and I'm genuinely curious as to where it came from.

Is the "we must keep all disagreements inside the house, because [insert bland 'the others will eat us alive' or 'they're all prejudiced against us' reason here]", just a contrived means to force Slytherin into the outwardly-villainous role they occupied in the books, in order to explain away the apparent uniform nastiness of its members presented in canon?

Or, is it actually canon? Has it been confirmed on /Pottermore/ (for instance) in the message you can read when you get sorted into your house? I got sorted into Hufflepuff so I wouldn't know what the Slytherin introductory message says.

Its presence in fanfiction vexes me, as I've rarely seen 'Slytherin unity' handled in any particularly interesting way (and it nearly always collapses due to the buffoonery of some of the house's members taking an antagonistic role to the main character), and to me just seems like a way to explain why so many Slytherins are horrible bastards to the rest of the school /rather/ than most of them being wizard racists or just genuinely unpleasant people.

Please, lend me your insight into this obscure phenomenon!


** I don't know if it started there, but Pottermore supports the idea. Here's a quote from the original Pottermore message to new Slytherins:

"For instance, we Slytherins look after our own -- which is more than you can say for Ravenclaw. Apart from being the biggest bunch of swots you ever met, Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas we Slytherins are brothers. The corridors of Hogwarts can throw up surprises for the unwary, and you'll be glad you've got the Serpents on your side as you move around the school. As far as we're concerned, once you've become a snake, you're one of ours -- one of the elite."

** Well the Sorting Hat says ""Or perhaps in Slytherin, You'll make your real friends," so there is evidence that there is some degree of loyalty and companionship within the house. Also the wikia page lists Fraternity as one of the Slytherin House traits so that could be where they get it from too. In Canon, we do see some examples of Slytherins being loyal only to people within their circle like the Malfoys with each other or even Snape helping Narcissa out. Those examples suggest that there is some unity in the house for them to look out for each other even years after school. I personally take it as a headcanon that they stick together, at least outwardly.

** I'm a Slytherin on Pottermore, and while I'm drawing this from memory, Slytherin is described as a "brotherhood". Combined with what the sorting hat says in the books about friendships, it definitely gives a certain vibe. (I literally just woke up, so the words I'm looking for are not quite here yet...) I've always viewed it as a group of people who, even if they didn't like each other, they felt obligated to cover each other's backs, if only because they were all apart of the same "brotherhood", and such a group watches out for their own. Now, combine that with the general hostilities at Hogwarts... does that kind of make sense?

EDIT: [[/u/OversizedBucket][u/OversizedBucket]] grabbed the quote from Pottermore and it pretty much sums up exactly what I was fumbling to say.

*** The problem with the "It's a brotherhood" approach is that such groups tend to lead to homogenised internal attitudes as well. Not many manage to cover each other's back all the time when "out in the field" yet keep detesting each other once they're in private. Facing a common enemy generally unites people, which is why that ploy is so often tried in politics.

Of course, people jockeying for positions does happen as well, especially when ambitious people work together, so Slytherin might have that kind of stuff as well.

**** That's exactly it, I think. (Second paragraph) They are all ambitious and jockeying for better positions, and it's likely they have a certain mindset from their parents if most of the Slytherins are coming from pure blood backgrounds.

That being said, for me, I can understand the mindset to a certain extent. Growing up, my sister and I were absolutely horrible to one another, and we would constantly throw each other under the bus. BUT, if any outside person said anything about one of us, we'd fight for them to the bitter end. (And then rib them about it later.)

I know not everyone is going to agree on this, and these are just my insights from Pottermore, the books, and just the impression I seem to get.

** Fanon does this because in general, all three houses, except Ravenclaw sometimes, hates their guts. It's a survival method in a hostile environment for them, given that they are first year students with little to no dueling ability. It's an easy way of writing that Harry's housemates won't hurt or humiliate him publicly, so he won't have to worry about them impeding in whatever plans he has.

It takes canon and blows up the animosity by quite a large factor.

*** Hm...while Harry is an imperfect lense that lets us peer into that world (and biased, too) that animosity isn't blown out of proportion that much IMHO (remember the other houses didn't protest when the House Cup was stolen from Slytherin by Dumbledore (who gave out points for what is basically rule breaking and should have points TAKEN - give them a reward for "Specials Services to the School" (which is a reward for a PERSON, not for a whole house, but don't give them points!)...hell, I don't know, but I seem to remember (it's been over a decade since I've read the original books!) that they were glad! So there's some truth there with that animosity!)

** Slytherin always seemed a lot like an entire house being a fraternity - And not the College Movie type. I'm talking stuff like the Germania, Cruxia, Rugia, Libertia,... Breeding grounds for nepotism and elitism, combined with a healthy dose of ideology and doctrine.

I always imagined them like that. Absolute and indestructible loyalty to the elite group they were told and trained to believe they are.

You've got the right of it in my opinion. It's there to explain why we never see "redeeming" character trait from any Slytherin student. Instead of them getting together and saying, "in public we're going to be decent human beings" they chose instead to be assholes.

*** No, suppose Slytherin X is genuinely an asshole. In order to present a unified front, Slytherin Y must, at minimum, not call X out on his behavior, and thus /seems/ like an asshole by proxy. People then start treating Y like an asshole because of X, and you can see where this is going. Basically, someone shit in the pool and ruined it for everyone.

***** Because the pool is always in public. They might or might not have gone “what the fjord, X” when in the common room, but if the person is resistant to learning and a genuine arsehole and from a privileged family (Draco much?), there simply isn't anything they can do. The pools can be cleaned but only after the person shitting in the pool stops doing it, and if they can't be forced to do that then /they/, not the rest of the slytherins, are still the problem.

** I believe it is used as a mechanism to give non-Malfoy Slytherins an excuse for apparently liking/tolerating him in the books. If you want Harry befriending Slytherins, you presumably want those Slytherins to be likeable, so you need to give them some reason to excuse their association with Malfoy. The idea that they all detest him but pretend to like him in public due to Slytherin rules is convenient.

--------------

Jokes aside, I think it's one of those things that Pottermore stated to show that, despite on how Slytherin is presented on the books (either because it's Harry's POV or because Rowling needed a "villain" inside the school), it's as good as a house as any of the others.

But I do agree that most of the fanfiction seem to use that very, very poorly. I do accept suggestions of some that might prove me wrong, though!
