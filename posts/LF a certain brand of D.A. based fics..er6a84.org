More specifically fics where there is focus on the acctuall aspect of Harry teaching DA, not so much of what D.A. does with that training (such as in amelio fortus protectrus, and Dumbledores Army by Bodmin356) Although if it has that, thats good to.


** Check out Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuinn, it encompasses 4th and 5th year and Harry is the de facto DADA professor for 5th year. It's also my #1 favorite fanfiction (of all fandoms, not just HP specific) of all time, so give it a shot; it's definately worth the read... and the reread... and the reread again. In fact, I'm gonna go reread it again myself right now.

** It's not quiet what your wanting but have you read the linkao3(say a prayer by mad_fairy) series? It's brilliant, a five part completed series that's focused on Harry and the DA learning spells and experimenting
