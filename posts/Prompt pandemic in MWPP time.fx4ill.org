So, the coronovirus spread has affected the fanfiction ideas in general I suppose. I have a general idea about a fic but no writing capability or imagination (I jump into God!Mary Sue tropes very easily so I refrain from writing). I am hoping it might inspire someone though.

The time period is Marauder's Era. There is a pandemic virus that takes over the magical world with a twist. The virus doesn't kill, instead it weakens & for some it destroys the magic inside the wizard/witch. You know who is immune to virus? Muggleborns. Half-bloods on the other hand gets affected but they do not lose their magic.

Purebloods are severely affected, and most begin to lose their magic. They are freaking out and trying to find a way to stop disease and get their magic back. Quarentines are implemented etc.

The rest is up to the imagination of the writer, it might be fun.


** That's super interesting. It might be fun to have it have been created by Voldemort in some kind of scheme to weaken the pure bloods so they will flock to him for protection against the Muggle borne who he would say are the spreaders. Great prompt

** This is a really interesting prompt since Sirius Black is a pureblood which means that the rest of the Marauders would have to help make sure he doesn't lose his magic. It really inspires me to write a fanfiction.

*** This sounds good and I would probebly love to read it, however Dramione is the one ship that I won't read. I'll try /everything/ else, but Dramione? No. I just can't do it.

**** I on the other hand am fine with Dramonie. But I am seeking for something hopefully less romance oriented. Thank you though, will add this to my list
