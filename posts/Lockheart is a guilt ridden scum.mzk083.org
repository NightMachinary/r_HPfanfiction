Basically he actually goes on each adventure in his books except he's accompanied by someone in all of them. His companions are the ones who do the daring things like drafting giant dragons or climbing an active volcano etc. (You get the picture) But they all die by either accidents or negligence. Now Lockheart knows if he reports it, it'll only stay on the paper one day and then forgotten the next. So he uses his writing skills to glorify them and make his books. Obviously he makes himself the main character and the dead ones side characters while telling himself that this is the compensation for not letting his companions and their adventures be just another article in news. He feels guilt doing it but is too much of a bastard to stop.


** He doesn't really seem capable of much guilt in the books. He would've happily have destroyed Harry and Ron's minds.

** This is a nice idea. I've never thought much about a Lockheart redemption idea as he's such a vain arse in the books but I could actually go along with this idea happily :)

I might try writing it when I finally have time in life :P but who knows? I'll probably just end up day dreaming about it and never actually doing anything with it because ya know... time :(

It could even be a cool set of mini stories that can be used as a base to further expand the wizarding world globally (since this fandom has done so brilliantly exploring the idea of other countries and branches of magic)

Thanks for this though!

** Gilderoy paced the DADA office. He had been trying to get his friends' actions to be remembered forever and had ended up being a vain attention seeker. He had taken up this job to prepare the future generations and because he had heard of the Curse on this job, but the day he had taken the job, he had started having nightmares.

The nightmares always showed his friends dying and his mental health was as bad as could be expected. He was turning into a Malfoy-like being just because of this Curse.

Gilderoy blacked out again as another shot of pain coursed through his veins and . . .
