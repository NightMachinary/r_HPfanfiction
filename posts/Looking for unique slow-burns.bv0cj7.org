I just finished reading Grow Young With Me linkao3(16405130) and it's a story and genre that I never knew I needed in my life. Can anyone else recommend a story in a similar style? The fact that everything was... new, and unpredictable really drew me in, and her writing is incredible.

Looking at the dates on ffn (the author started to publish it in 2015), I'm probably not going to see the next chapter anytime soon so. What else would you suggest?

No slash, please.


** If by “similar style” you mean a muggle/magical romance from an author who updates irregularly, I'll recommend mine:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418]])

It's a work-in-progress. So far, the romantic leads barely tolerate each other.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

*** Love this story! Haven't caught up with the most recent chapter though. But I really like the pacing and character development so far.

**** Thanks! Writing this is teaching me a lot about pacing. I have to find the right cliffhanger to end each chapter, and build tension in one plot line whenever I resolve it in another.

*** Did you just tag it with "slow burn" ?

I think that is a fair recommendation (from someone who loves both stories).

**** Nah, that tag's been there for a while. I'll take suggestions for other tags that would help people find this. A whole lot of readers have commented, “I've never read anything like this,” but that isn't really a tag.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Depending on exactly what you like about Grow Young With Me... linkffn(Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss) might interest you. It's complete and relatively short, anyway.
