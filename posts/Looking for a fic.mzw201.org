cant remember anything about it except for harry and the twins get lost in the school and end up finding a bunch of secret passages, pretty sure there was a super dangerous hufflepuff house obstacle course


** Yes! You've just loosened a memory but I can't remember which story it was. Was it the one where he lives in the paintings? It was it fantastic elves and where to find them? I honestly can't remember but I can't remember the scene you're talking about

** I don't remember the name either, but I think in the same story Harry gets scared of Hufflepuffs because he thinks they train using the immensely difficult obstacle course he stumbled on.

  Point of deviation: Harry's primary school taught Home Economics. Harry's not going to let the wonders of magic take away his common sense, and if he can get a good deal, he's going to take it. Meanwhile, money is fun, but magic is funner.

  It's not all fun and games being a wealthy orphan. I mean, yeah, Harry didn't have to deal with the Dursleys any longer, and lots of pocket money was great, but if someone could hold his hand while a monster was apparently on the loose? That'd be even better.
