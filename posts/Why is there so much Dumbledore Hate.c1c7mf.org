When I first started reading HP as a 12 yo, I remember that my two most fav characters were Dumbledore and Harry. This opinion stayed with me though my adulthood, even as I continued to reread the books. So, imagine my surprise when I came across 'Dumbledore Bashing' fics, when I got into world of Fanfics (Which, I admit, was only last year). I don't hate Dumbledore bashing fics, in fact, I find them hilarious and fun to read. However, I do have trouble interpreting Dumbledore as a Villain. As in, HP books were written for Children, and as such I never delved into so-called manipulations of Dumbledore, as I imagine, Rowling wrote HP books with a bit of 'Fairy Tales'que elements .Therefore, as I interpret it, the events that unfolded in books, were not because of Dumbledore's manipulations, but because of way Children Fantasy novels were supposed to unfold with surprises and turns.. anyway enough of my ramblings, my question is, do you guys dislike Dumbledore? Do you think it's justified that he's purported as a Villain in many fics, or do you like me, just like the alternative depiction of Dumbledore Character, which is NOT True when it comes to Canon.


** The reason is pretty obvious; the plots of the books make little sense. As a result, if we go by the assumption that Dumbledore really is powerful and wise, then the fact that he keeps doing ridiculously stupid things and often fails to give Harry important information starts to seem incongruous. At the meta-level, the reason for this is simple: J.K. Rowling is an amazing writer but absolutely terrible at plotting. But, in-universe, there's little explanation.

One way to reconcile the problem "in-universe" is to assume that Dumbledore isn't actually being stupid --- that he had to recognize that the petrifications had to be a basilisk, that he had to know that the protections on the Philosopher's Stone were weak enough that children could get past them, etc., etc., etc. But if that's true, then one has to start assuming that he's not telling the truth most of the time, and from there one goes down the Evil Dumbledore rabbit hole.

*** Well, the information needed weren't always good.\\
-He probably didn't intend to die as he did. He probably intended to reach the castle, the chair and get the horcrux with the sword. Harry would have known then.\\
-He withheld the information on the Horcrux in Harry so that Harry may continue.\\
-He withheld that he didn't have to die so that Harry actually goes there with the intend for sacrifice, ensuring his life. I am not a fan of fictions where his scar is simply healed with some goblins or spells. Horcrux magic is far too dangerous and strong.

Basilisk sightings were very rare, breeding was gone. He may have had an idea but why should he know? he wasn't omnificent and allwise. He was probably never an expert on creatures (he taught transfiguration). He neither had proof.

The protections on the stone were quite good. But we have been told that a) Hermione is incredibly logic and most people aren't - Snapes riddle passed. b) Ron is a whiz at chess - McG. c) Harry is the most gifted flyer - Flitwick. Sprout was a lucky shot, I hardly think that many people would have made it past Sprout and the Troll was quite a character too.

** Because JK Rowling wrote a hyper powerful, intelligent character who is good hearted and compassionate, and then proceeded to make him take an endless string of poor decisions which can easily be viewed as indicating either excessive manipulation and/or excessive secrecy which causes harm.

For example:

Putting Harry with the Dursleys despite there definitely being options at least equal in safety, especially given that he chose to put Harry there before Sirius went to Azkaban, meaning he overruled James and Lily without a 2nd thought

Not making sure Harry's godfather gets a trial with the literal fucking truth potion involved

Leaving Harry at the Dursleys with just a letter. No face-to-face conversation, no money for upkeep, no contact info for problems, just "hey raise this kid for 11 years and then I'll take him away but you'll still have to feed and clothe him in the summers till he's 17"

Leaving only Arabella Figg to check on Harry, banning anyone like Remus or McGonagall from seeing him, despite the fact that Arabella Figg knows Harry is treated like shit, to the point that she admits to deliberately making his visits boring so the Dursleys don't punish him for being happy, but says nothing to Dumbledore (or he ignores it when she does)

Putting the Philosopher's Stone in a school, behind traps an 11 year old can bypass, with the only real protection being added later (after letting an 11 year old find it in a classroom despite its danger) and letting a servant of Voldemort attempt to subvert them

Letting Voldemort's servant teach DADA even after he tries to murder Harry and releases a Troll into the school.

Flying to the Ministry instead of Flooing, Apparating, Portkeying, Phoenix Travelling or using a House Elf, meaning that he could only arrive to stop Voldemort after an 11 year old was already hospitalised.

Being unable or unwilling to figure out that Slytherin's monster is a snake despite 12 year old Hermione getting it mid way through term, and unable or unwilling to locate the Chamber despite (again) a 12 year old figuring it out, and despite having been there when Myrtle was killed (and just doing fuck all for 50 years after)

Finding proof of the Dark Lord's horcruxes and sharing it with NOBODY. Not the DMLE or Unspeakables, not Harry, not Moody or Snape or Lupin, not one soul, meaning that nobody can help find and destroy them.

After finding the horcrux and telling nobody, proceeding to do nothing for 3+ years (or trying to find the horcruxes and failing despite 17 year olds managing to figure out where the cup and diadem are)

Going after the ring horcrux alone, telling nobody anything, resulting in your impending death.

Still telling nobody about the horcruxes apart from some 17 year olds, and even then telling them barely anything (not even, hey use the sword to destroy them) and telling them not to seek help from the dozen trustworthy people they know.

Having your spy kill you and telling absolutely nobody of the plan, leaving a huge amount of risk in play (what if Harry's Sectumsempra had landed when Snape ran away at the end of HBP?) for no real reason.

Among other things. Now, some of these decisions can be justified. Flying to the Ministry is just down to JK not realising that you can't hinge a plot on travel taking ages and then proceed to invent dozens of new better travel methods that would have been better, for example.

Leaving Harry with the Dursleys for the Blood Wards is justified if you believe that he was in genuine danger once all the loyal Death Eaters were in Azkaban and the others had denounced Voldemort, and that this danger was so significant that nobody (not even Dumbledore) could visit and he had to stay there for 11 solid years BUT that he wasn't in so much danger that he needed to be taken to Diagon Alley by a wizard who took their OWLs or not left in a shop while his escort has a pint down the road.

But when you actually sit and look at a full list (I made one the other day and had about 60 mistakes off the top of my head), you realise that you have to accept one of a few things.

Either

a) Dumbledore is overly manipulative, and puts people in serious danger of harm by his puppeteering in pursuit of his Greater Good

b) Dumbledore is arrogant, believing he can fix everything himself without telling anyone what he's doing or letting them help

c) Dumbledore is stupid, not thinking of very basic things like "why have a locked door and then put the key in the room flying about, and then leave a broom so someone can catch the key?"

d) Dumbledore is evil, actively trying to hurt others for his own sake

e) JK Rowling is a flawed writer who prefers to tell us characters are wise or compassionate or clever than show us, and has a tendency to ignore things like logic or character traits when the plot demands it

Or some combination of these. But I honestly don't think you can logically appraise the 7 canon books and come out of it thinking Dumbledore proved he was a wise, powerful, compassionate and humble man. Frankly, he (and other characters, whose actions are less influential given Dumbledore's status) makes a succession of utterly moronic choices and then plot armour and random chance make everything work out.

*** While I agree with some of your point, and the fact that Rowling often used her characters as litteral plot devises (sometimes making them act OOC for this), I think some of your pont can ba at least partially explained (even if I don't believe it's interesting to "explain" a world like the one of Harry Potter) :

- The Dursley : Dumbledore "knew" Harry would not have a good childhood, but we have to keep in mind that fanon often "worsen" the Dursleys. I will not say they were good people (far from it), or that their actions isn't classified as "abuse", but the Dursley never hit Harry to the brink of Death, or starved him so bad that he only survived thanks to Magic.\\
  During his childhood, Harry was not loved, but his profil is more the one of a neglected kid that a beaten one. They never bought him anything they weren't forced to (so just his glasses I guess), but they fed him (not 100% sure it's canon, but I remember reading that the Dursley never stopped him to eat, but he rarely ate his favourite food because Dudley pounced on it). The only "violent" part of his childhood was Dudley, which is another kid, and I doubt Harry ever been hit by anything worse than a slap (which was perfectly acceptable in the 90's). Figg was only there to raise the alarm if Harry was in danger of death, which never happened.
- Hagrid : some say that Hagrid was not an acceptable escort for Harry because he didn't even pass his NEWT. But even with his limited Magic education, he is still an Half Giant. We saw him fighting 5 Auror in OotP, and still being able to leave (not without knocking at least one out), he is a dangerous opponent and this is why he was also being selected as an escort in HBP (when they were in full civil war).\\
  Also, it's not like taking Harry to Diagon Alley was "really" dangerous. Once the worst of the war passed (so the first month after Voldemort's fall) and the most loyal followers in jail, Dumbledore was not really afraid about someone cursing Harry in the Street the moment he saw him, but more about organised attack by ex Death Eater. There is a difference between keeping Harry safe for a day, and keeping him safe for 10 years.
- The Stone protection : I am personally a firm believer of the theory that the stone was a bait. All the "obstacles " were not there to truly stop a Dark Lord, but only to slow him down and make him lower his guard before facing the miror, maybe in the hope that Voldemort loose himself in his own dream (he never did watch in the mirror). The obstacles also had to not be "too" dangerous in order to not kill the curious students (even if I have some doubts about it, especially from Fluffy, the Devil Snare, and the Troll).
- Dumbledore's love for secrecy : Personally, I think Dumbledore was right to keep secret. One of the main aspect of the magical world is that you can't really trust anyone. The Potters trusted one of their best friend, and he betrayed them to Voldemort. Harry trusted someone once (Lovegood), and he betrayed him because they kept his daughter hostage. And it's without even taking into account all the magical mean Voldemort had to extract a secret (from Legilimency to Veritaserum). His plan only needed one leak to become useless, and Dumbledore could not take this risk, even if it made the task harder for Harry. The only man he ever totally trusted with his plan was Snape, the best Occlumens in the country (potentially the world), and someone without any attach to be used against him, who only lived to end Voldemort.\\
  I also think it is for this reason and never told anyone about his plan to be killed by Snape. He had nothing to gain from divulging this secret, and it would just mean more risk of being discovered (it's easier to have Miverva hating Snape than having Minerva trying to act like she hates Snape). And since Snape accepted the idea to be hated without any problem, there is no reason to take more risk.
- Sirius' trial : There is absolutely no proof that Sirius didn't have a trial. Death Eater trials could happen without them being present (the Lestrange and Barty Jr for example, were only present to hear their verdict, and we don't know if Sirius didn't receive the same treatment).\\
  Also, people in fanon like the throw "Veritaserum", but it's really not a fullproof method. Rowling herself said that wizards have a lot of way to escape Veritaserum, from the most difficult (like transfiguring the potion into water just before drinking it, or use self transfiguration to seal his own throat), to the most easily realisable (drinking the antitode beforehand, and having someone memory charm him before the trials so he truly belived he was innocent). Sirius was in hiding for some times before the 31st of October, and only been caught the 5th of November if I remember well, he had more than enough time to take measure against Veritaserum, so it's not like it was a perfect solution to proove his innocence.

​

In the end, I always saw Dumbledore as a good but flawed man, who "as someone more intelligent than most, did less mistake, but his mistakes tended to have more dire consequences".

**** Yes, Fanon sometimes makes the Dursleys worse (Vernon the pedophile rapist for example!), but they were pretty bad in canon!

Their behaviour was abusive (Trying to hit kids with frying pans and encouraging other kids to bully a kid is abuse! Sorry, the Dursleys truly are not nice people and saying that they weren't so bad is a truly awful thing to say!), not to mention the neglect and starvation (Harry was seriously under-sized, so I don't doubt that they stunted his growth)

They should be glad that Harry didn't air their behaviour to the media! Wizards would have probably assaulted them for harming their saviour (Harry kind of is wizard-Jesus after all!)

***** Ok people need to stop talking about the frying pan. Petunia vaguely swung it once in his direction after he menaced Dudley to use magic. Harry easily dodged and she did no effort to hit him again after he left the room. Harry really annoyed her and she tried to hit with whatever was in her hand, could have been a broom or a TV remote controler just as easily. And even if she had reached him, he would have had a bump, not died from brain damage. Encouraging abuse : when ? The Dursley are entilted parents that refuse to believe Dudley could do anything bad. Including being a bully. The only time that some what work is when Vernon tells Dudley to hit Harry with his stick. It happened exactly one time and just after an exposition scene that explain the boys in this school hit each other with their cane all the time and it harden them. Neglect and starvation ? I won t deny neglect but Harry clearly say he always had food on the time even if Dudley always rushed on his favourite plates. Harry was skinny as a child, but normally tiny, not seriously undersized. He seemed like this because he wears second hand clothes from Baby Whale Dudley. The only time Harry was really hungry was in 4th year when they all starved for Dudley diet. And maybe after the dementor attack in 5th year where they gave him food but maybe not enough.

Once again, the Dursleys are bad people and parents (for both Harry and Dudley ), but fanon make it way worse than canon. And yes they would have suffered if Harry talked to the medias. But said medias make him deranged half the time, and wizards sent trapped letters to Hermione after one article where she allegedly seduce Harry and Krump so lets try to not kill the Dursleys alright ?

******** I view Dumbledore as slowly giving up on Harry living, even though he knew about the soul piece. He's legitimately regretful and doesn't have the time to take care of Harry.

That's why he didn't reign in the Dursleys. He needed Harry to sacrifice himself to kill Voldemort.

That's why in goblet of fire he's triumphant, because a possible solution opened up.

********* I don't know about it. I mean canon seem to indicate that Dumbledore only link Voldemort survival to Horcruxe (at least with certainty ) after CoS and examining the diary. And only later (GoF ) did he link Horcruxes to Harry scar. So why would he forsake Harry before ?

One of the problems of canon is the continuity of events. The narrative seem to say that Hagrid took Harry from the ruins of Godric Hollow, and diectly brought it to Privet Drive. Yet at the same time a full day of celebrations happen. So we can either consider Rowling suck with timeline and Harry was directly brought to Privet Drive, so Dumbledore don't know anything about the scare. Or Harry spent a full day being examined by someone (Pomfrey ? ) and Dumbledore has a lot more of informations about the scare. I personally dont like this hypothese since it fall too close to a manipulative Dumbledore.

Finally, I think he is regret full because he can see Harry life suck (hard to protect his childhood when he is in 1st place on a Dark Lord shit list and almost die every year ). And didn't reign the Dursley because of the blood protection. They were not happy about him and didn't treat him well, but they took Harry in, activating the protection. Any tentative of intervention may have backfired with the Dursleys throwing him out. Why take the risk since he is some how taken care of ?

*** I have to go with e) on this one. Maybe I'm biased, when I read the books, I always looked up to Dumbledore as an all-pure, all-powerful character. (Dumbledore does accept that he has flaws in DH(?).. doesn't he?)

The other points such as putting Harry with Dursleys, Sirius not getting a Trial (As for that matter, Sirius running off, or Remus not checking on Harry even once.. etc) are all essentially plot devices in my opinion.. I mean Dumbledore putting Harry at Dursley's door step, is the prologue of Book 1.. I think JKR wanted a very catchy chapter to pull in readers. (I remember as a 12 yo, it definitely made the book more interesting). As is, Magical Hagrid introducing Harry to the Wizarding world, or Quirrel letting out the Troll. As the other commenter put it, if you introduce "in-universe" aspects for the sake of Fanfiction, I admit Dumbledore does come across as Selfish (Definitely not evil , but Utilitarian). But, which Adult isn't selfish, in HP series ? :

1.Sirius running off and insanely Laughing in streets (after muggles and Peter were reportedly killed), he definitely didn't think of Harry.

1. Remus who never checked up on Harry..

2. Severus Snape though redeemed, was a not a good person to Harry throughout the series, even he was a bit selfishly motivated, due to his Obsessive love of Lily..

3. J+ames and Lily not having a better plan.+ (Not selfish but could have had a better plan than trusting ' Friends', as Voldy put it)

Dumbledore is definitely selfish but so are these peeps. (I would have expected to see more Sirius Bashing, Remus Bashing fics etc. but..)

Coming to Bashing aspects, the only decent adults in Harry's life I can think of, are the Weasleys, ironic though, I see tons of Weasley Bashing fics..

​

Lastly, Dumbledore being secretive is justified in my opinion, due to Harry being a Kid.

*** Can't quite agree with you:\\
-Dursleys: He wanted Harry to have the strongest protection there was, blood magic. It saved Harry before. The protection had to be renewed every year, otherwise it would have failed him and might not have worked for Quirrell. Harry wasn't downright abused either (many fanfics go for belting) but not loved. Bad as it is, he was safe there. I am not saying that he shouldn't have intervened but he surely checked on him. Harry wasn't in danger at the Dursleys. Considering everything, he was safest there in the entire series.\\
-Dumbledore is strong but he is not almighty. And it looked as if Sirius was guilty. He was known to be the secret keeper. It looked as if he cast the spell. He mumbled and laughed "I killed them". And it wasn't his decision, it was Crouch's. We all know the close-mindedness of the wizarding world, even Dumbledore would probably not have been able to get the suspected 2nd hand of Voldemort a trial.

-Veritaserum can be tricked with plus I truly think Rowling developed it in 4th year, because I think that if there was Veritaserum, Malfoy and others couldn't have so easily tricked the ministry like they did. 3 drops and they spill. For every magic, we have seen a counter magic: Love vs death, memory distortion... why not Veritaserum?

-Those traps were quite good. I doubt many people would have reacted calm about devil's snare. Harry was the gifted flyer - I doubt an average flyer could have pulled it off. Ron is a chess progidity, was said again and again. Harry or Hermione or 99% of people wouldn't have made it though. The troll, I don't think they would have survived, so wouldn't have most others. And the logic riddle of Snape required intellect that only Hermione possessed. It was group work. But the last thing was the mirror, Voldemort couldn't have gotten it out. It would have revealed him. And if pupils would have listened.... So don't pin it just on Dumbledore.

-Transportation: In book 5, Hagrid mentions that Dumbledore sometimes takes Thestrals for the liking. Imagine; exams are over, nothing to do, good weather... There was no need for hurry. Plus, he could have returned immediately as soon as he realised.

​

-You forget things. Harry heard the snake, that was Hermione's final clue. Dumbledore wasn't told and knowledge about basilisks is limited as they are exceedingly rare. Dumbledore didn't have the info. It was also said that the castle had been searched and searched for but nobody found it. It could be found by a parselmouth. And I think that Dumbledore evaluated the Myrtle case. But we know Myrtle, she helped him for she had a crush on him.

-Horcruxes:\\
1. He hadn't had proof with the diary. He suspected it but no proof.\\
2. The ministry had been compromised from the top. Hence why the Phoenix order was founded. And in the\\
Order, there had been spies and who knows who could have spilled or been forced (Legilimency, Crucio...)\\
It was just safer to keep knowledge limited. Imagine the Desaster if Moody double had been informed.\\
3. He was not anticipating it. He managed to pass all curses but then saw the ring. In a human moment of\\
weakness, he put it on. Dumb move but understandable with all his guilt and now a chance to say things.\\
4. I think he meant to destroy the horcrux and explain the sword situation and possibly the Snape situation.\\
It wasn't anticipated that Draco succeeded, so he was cut short. He left the sword in his will, giving the clue,\\
concealed again.

-Blood warts: I just say Crabbe, Malfoy, McNair, Nott and those others who remained free. I name Frank and Alice Longbottom as an example if you let your guard down.

And for your a - e:\\
I think that Rowling had those many ideas over the course of her writing. It explains many holes in the stories. She was gifted with imagination but her writing and planning is mediocre. She succeeded with the magical world she created and not with the story; that would have been GRRM. He took his time.\\
As for Dumbledore; PlusMortgage probably sums it up:\\
He was a man with flaws who meant well, made few mistakes but with great impact. His visit in DH just shows us that he waited for Harry in Limbo to give him answers. He answered him his questions and often he had his reasons. And greater good Dumbledore, what is so bad about it? If sacrifices had to be made, do so with the minimum. And as he said, he never wished to burden him.

I think in the world created he makes for a more interesting villain than Voldemort because of the position he is in, but also because Voldemort kinda became cartoonishly evil and i prefer the clever calculated ones. Voldemort was sneaky and charismatic Once but most of those qualities show up in flashbacks not for events in the main timeline. Not that he's bad as a villain. But since fanfics play around with canon anyway that whole concept of this trusted archetypical wise good teacher being your true enemy just is a interesting story for me.

** Yeah Dumbledore was very clearly intended to be a good guy, not some manipulative prick. But he also essentially wasn't a real character with agency when he wasn't directly involved in something, or sometimes even when he was but when some fairy tale trope was being set up(like evil step parents), or some important plot point was being lead too.

I'm fine with accepting that's just how JKR wrote, especially considering the books were originally children's books. It's not unusual for childrens books to have things happen that don't make logical sense, in order to hit the themes the author wants to hit. Others aren't willing to accept that, and instead fill the plot holes in with Dumbledore being evil, which would also explain some of them. But it's very clearly not what JKR intended imo.

*** "Yeah Dumbledore was very clearly intended to be a good guy..."

You and a couple of others say that he was a "plot device" and didn't have "agency." If that's true, he can't be good any more than he can be bad - or any more than a plotted plant can be "good".

"I'm fine with accepting that's just how JKR wrote, especially considering the books were originally children's books."

This is actually the key, though not in the way you seem to intend it.

The first three or so books were kids' books. The first is practically a fairy tale.

And you know what happens in fairy tales? All kinds of horrible things that we'd never accept in the regular world. Of course infants are left in baskets on porches. Of course the future "chosen one" is abused. No one called Child Services on the Dursleys? Of course not, and that's no more remarkable than the fact that no one called the equivalent on Cinderella's evil stepmother.

Something else key to children's literature is that the child protagonists must have agency. They must be the ones making decisions and driving the story forward. If the adults actually do their job and act rationally, then there would be nothing for the kids to do - no adventures, no mysteries, etc. And that's exactly what we have in the first books.

But then things change.

By book five, we aren't reading children's literature anymore. By book five, we're now reading YA literature, a genre which demands a bit more realism in terms of how adults and teens behave. Teen readers aren't looking for fairy tales, they are looking for stories that reflect something about their lives. And guess what? The adults are asserting themselves (finally!). They are trying to do the right thing, like keep the kids out of the war (much to their consternation, especially in light of the previous years when they pretty much ran their own lives regardless of all the dangers).

And then we get to the end of the book, where Dumbledore admits to Harry some of the things he did wrong. And here's where we have a problem. If we limit ourselves to the first couple of books, Harry being left on a doorstep and having to fight monsters is the realm of fairy tales. We have nothing to complain about. But when Dumbledore admits to all of this in a YA novel, he's voluntarily taking on the culpability of what must now be regarded as rather heinous actions. Had he not mentioned it, perhaps we could ignore it and pretend it wasn't an issue, but by bringing it up himself, he invites us to review his decisions in the context of YA standards rather than just Fairy Tale standards.

This is not Rowling's fault, not really. She's a victim of her own success. Rowling's genre grew up with her readers, something that was wonderful for the public but which created a flaw in her series. It was probably unavoidable unless all of the stories had remained in the realm of children's fairy tales, but then the series wouldn't have been nearly so popular, would it? Would we even still be talking about it, if Rowling hadn't made the smart decision to have the series grow up like the characters and the readers?

I also need to add that we should be thankful for this. Although I'm sure she didn't intend it in this way, the fact that Dumbledore can be both praised and blamed make him a much more complex character, and that in turn makes fanfiction possible (not to mention more interesting). How much poorer would the Harry Potter fanfiction community be if characters like Dumbledore and Snape could only be read one way?

TL/DR: In the context of fairy tales, Dumbledore's choices are unremarkable; in the context of YA lit (which the later books are), his choices demand judgment, and it's precisely the fact that we can judge him (and other characters) which fuels so much fanfiction.

** I think that Dumbledore clearly had good intentions, but the memories from Snape in DH really makes you question whether or not he had really been doing things the right way. When you also take into account the fact that Dumbledore, the /most powerful wizard/, manages to have voldemort in his school for a year, a death eater polyjuiced as his friend teaching without him realising at any point that something was strange, and allows Snape to bully students the entire time, bashing him becomes pretty easy to justify.

In addition to this he's supposed to be in a position where he could just ask for the minister of magic position and get it, but he lets the nation become woefully unprepared under Fudge's government once he knows voldemort is back? I know he was slandered but surely the /greatest wizard since Merlin/ could have predicted that and removed Fudge before it was too late.

All the things in Harry's life just seem to have been fixed and manipulated. If three first years can get to the philosopher's stone then it was never safe from voldemort. If Hermione could figure out it was a basilisk then surely so could Dumbledore.

TL;DR, Dumbledore is way too easy to bash because he never uses his supposedly god like powers

Notice usually the most trustworthy persons in the canon (Dumbledore, Weasleys, Hermione sometimes, McGonagall) are the most willified, and most suspicious ones (Snape, Draco Malfoy, even Tom Riddle and Bellatrix) somethow turn into the positive characters.

Mind, he probably didn't know the depth of Harry's treatment in canon until it was late. But I would love a fic where when confronted with Harry's ill treatment he promptly threatens the Dursleys and installs safeguards for Harry if he wants Harry kept there or fosters him with someone who isn't Snape. Or a fic where he takes Snape to task.

Dumbledore is easy to bash, but in spirit of how Rowling wanted him, have him grow as a character by learning to delegate and trust.

** Well... this is just speculation, but I think it has to do with Dumbledore being presented as the Big Good character but turning out to be a lot more complex and fallible than his initial reputation. The biggest haters of Dumbledore, from what I can see, are often the ones with the biggest black and white morality. They might forgive complexity in a villain, because villains are SUPPOSED to be untrustworthy and "maybe he wasn't all bad" is just a more positive idea than "maybe he wasn't all good." But if the Big Good turns out to not be 100% good and infallible, then he's denounced as utter scum.

The HP series is in many ways about human fallacy. EVERYBODY in the series is a failure at something, or in some ways don't live up to expectations. There is no hyper-competent, always correct, always certain of the right thing, always justified person. Everyone makes mistakes, and a lot of them make really BIG mistakes that are exploited by other people... who in their turn make DIFFERENT mistakes that are exploited by OTHER people, and so on.

Dumbledore is the one with the biggest expectations placed on him, so when he falls from the reader's grace he tends to fall harder. Human fallacy isn't accepted in this case; the fans simply can't handle the thought that the Great and Powerful Wizard was in the end just a man who did his best but made mistakes... so they have to make it so that he's either an incompetent moron, or claim that he was evil all along. Because both those things are easier to accept than the actual implications here: Sometimes even the greatest of us can honestly try their best and STILL fail horribly.

I see a lot of people making the "Dumbledore should have known this" or "Dumbledore should have done this" arguments, even though a vast majority of these things aren't really Dumbledore's fault or responsibility. But since Dumbledore isn't everywhere at all times to fix everything, it's easier to start condemning than accepting the possibility that the expectations built up might have been too high. And so you get people insisting that Dumbledore is an incompetent moron, or an evil villain... or, as is getting increasingly popular as a claim, because JKR is a shitty writer who writes shitty characters and shitty plots.

(To this last part I'll just say one thing: The HP books have their flaws, but I have yet to read a SINGLE fanfic that was actually BETTER than canon. And the fanfics written by the loudest complainers are usually hugely annoying, self-righteous power fantasies far more concerned about dishing punishment out to the characters the author doesn't like than actually telling a good story. Even JKR at her worst is far better than these stories.)

****** I disagree about oneshots AND about the dumbing down of Harry, I'm afraid...

In my experience one-shots seem to be either nonsubstantial fluff or crackfics, with perhaps the odd lapse into melodrama and angst. Neither of those things are really anything I enjoy.

As for Harry being dumbed down, I don't really see it. He remains a very consistent, if not very interesting, character throughout. The Harry of the latter series isn't really any dumber than the Harry of the early series... granted, he was never a genius by any definition, but I kind of prefer that he isn't. The overpowered "smart" Harry you see in too many fanfics tends to be insufferable.

I don't think "passive sacrifice is okay" is the message of the series. Self-sacrifice wins the day, yes, but Harry isn't passive about it. He actively and willingly goes to the final fight with Voldemort, even though he thinks he won't survive. It's not about being passive, it's about being willing to put others above yourself... or, if you will, being willing to die for a cause; having the choice between saving others and saving yourself, and choosing to sacrifice yourself so that others might live.

I know a lot of people hate that attitude, and a lot of people have been really angry with JKR for "advocating that lying down to die is the most heroic thing," but the thing is... I LIKE the fact that the reason why Harry wins is that he's willing to put others above himself, and the reason Voldemort loses is that he isn't. To me, it makes the victory a little more meaningful than if Harry had just trained and become super-powerful and blasted Voldemort with a super-special Killing Curse or whatever. That would just have been a "might makes right" story if Harry won because he had more powerful magic.

** Have you red the same books?

​

It's not "manipulative Dumbledore" that is the problem, it's "I know better than everybody else and I keep secrets, too Dumbledore" who is the problem! Placing a kid with abusive muggles is bad enough, but sending the kid back there year after year? Hell, Dumbledore could have had all the captured DEs executed if he had pushed for it, but he didn't and they were broken out later on to torture (probably rape) and kill again!
