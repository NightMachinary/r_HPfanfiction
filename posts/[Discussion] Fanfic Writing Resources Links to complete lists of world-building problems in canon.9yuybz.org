** Haven't come across anything like what you're asking for but I'll try to help you out with my own knowledge, at least with what you asked about.

The Wizarding Currency to Muggle Currency issue is due to JKR's horrendous mathematical abilities. However, the Weasleys are rather poor, but are able to do secondhand school supplies shopping using a small amount of Sickles and Knuts (maybe a few Galleons in there too), so it's quite possible that WC is worth quite a lot in terms of MC. Some people like to use a real-life gold/silver/bronze to pounds exchange rate, but I don't think that's how it would actually be set up, as the money is exchanged between the humans and the goblins, not with a Muggle jewler or something. It's also possible to make it so the coins are iron or steel and are simply coated in their designated material. There's no basis for that but it would allow you to come up with a lower exchange rate. Like you can make Galleons equal £20, Sickles are £5, and Knuts are £1, rather than a Galleon (let's say it's half an ounce of gold) being worth £500, and a Sickle (let's say it's a quarter of an ounce of silver) being worth £3 (based on a quick google search on the price of gold and silver per ounce in British pounds). Whatever the case, I would find a basis for the exchange rate in your fic and keep it consistent and realistic. If you want, that is.

I don't think the books really go into the size of wizarding Britain, or other schooling options. I believe Draco mentions that he almost went to Durmstrang in GoF, which means that they can certainly choose to go to schools outside of Britain (or he was lying to brag). They also seem to have an option to decline going to Hogwarts in their acceptance letter, so it seems likely that other, smaller schools exist, or that private tutoring/homeschool would be an option. I don't follow Pottermore so I don't know if JKR expanded on either of those ideas. Again, in your fic I'd suggest coming up with an idea of how you want it to be presented and stay consistent with it.

In regards to Hogwarts itself, it seems that the students are on a rotating schedule, having each class two or three times a week, on different days. This would allow the one teacher per subject system to work out. They probably have a standard 6 hour schedule, one hour per class, with a lunch break. Sometimes they have 2 classes back to back (ex. Double Potions). They also break up the students into groups of 2 houses. So from a teacher's perspective their class might look like this:

Monday:

0800: G/S first years

0900: H/R first years

1000: G/S second years

1100: H/R second years

1200: Lunch

1300: G/S third years

1400: H/R third years

Tuesday:

0800: G/S fourth years

0900: H/R fourth years

1000: G/S fifth years

1100: H/R fifth years

1200: Lunch

1300: G/S sixth years

1400: H/R sixth years

Wednesday:

0800: G/S seventh years

0900: H/R seventh years

And then back to first years

Obviously the scheduling might not be that rotational and each teacher would have a different schedule, but since students don't seem to have every class every day it could work similarly.

About how many students actually go there, in Harry's year there's about 20 kids (approxinately 5 per house if I'm remembering right), which would mean there's 140 kids in the whole school. That's tiny compared to the vast majority of high schools. I think JKR once claimed there were 1000 kids attending Hogwarts, but again she's shite at math and never really showed that in the books. A common theory (don't know if it's canon but it makes sense) is that Harry's class size is smaller than average due to them being born during the First War, and, due to the deaths of many wizards and the fear of raising a family in that environment, there weren't a lot of kids. So there likely would have been a boom in children within a few years after Harry's class. So we could assume that the higher years had significantly more students, and that the years following Harry's would have more students as well.

As for kids who don't get into Hogwarts, see my thoughts on alterbative schooling about. And the ones who get kicked out are more than likely expelled (wands snapped, unable to do magic. How that's regulated, I have no idea).

Hope that helped you out in figuring out how to go about fixing the world-building issues. Ultimately when writing a fic you're making it your own world, so you can follow the canon guidelines or make your own set of rules to follow that plug up some of the holes JKR set. Something I'd reccomend doing is actually writing up a world-building reference sheet, explaining the exchange rates, alternative schooling, how the government works, etc. and keep it as a guide for when you're writing your fic. You don't need to include all the details in your story, but it would be handy to ensure you're consistent in your writing when referencing background details in-story.

I think I've rambled on enough, hope somebody gets something good out of it. Good luck in your writing.

Edit: Fixed the formatting on the schedule I made.

Edit 2: The gold/silver exchange rate was for modern day, I've since seen that back in the 1990s gold had a peak of about £250 per oz, and silver peaked around £3.50 per oz. Considering the fact that Galleons are larger than Sickles, and Galleons are more likely at least 1 oz (1oz gold coins look to be smaller than the Galleons shown in the films), that's still fairly ridiculous for everyday currency. And definitely doesn't match up with "17 Sickles equals a Galleon," as last time I checked 17x3 is 51, not 250.
