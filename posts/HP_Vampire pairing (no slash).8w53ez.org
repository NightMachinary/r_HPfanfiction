Hi,

As said in title I'm looking for HP/Vampire pairing. I read recently "Valeriana Natassa" linkffn(11552218) and I'm finding myself wanting more.

I would prefer completed or ongoing (as in not abandoned) fics but there is one that is too good to pass well put it anyway.

Thanks all

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

** If you're okay with an existing character getting turned into a vampire (instead of an OC vampire), then [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185]]. It's Harry/vampire!Hermione
