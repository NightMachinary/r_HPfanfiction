People often compare the two characters (Muggleborn, smart, precocious, strong-willed) but I don't know if I've ever read a fic (EDIT: actually, there was one - 'Hero Harry') where Lily and Hermione interact or wherein Hermione expresses admiration for Lily. Which is surprising, given the obvious connections someone like Hermione could make.

If Lily Potter had lived and her son befriended Hermione I can see Lily reaching out to become a mentor or a helper, or at least wanting to meet her. Or the other way around; Hermione finding out that Harry's (alive) mother is Muggleborn and teachers compare her to her, and she finds it encouraging.

Would be a good idea for a fanfic if there aren't any kicking about!


** Arsinoe de Blassenville's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1875189/1/The-Prefect-s-Portrait][The Prefect's Portrait]] is the first that comes to mind, though in it Hermione and Lily are the same age. 94k words, complete.

  Hermione's quest for a quiet place to read leads to the discovery of a remarkable portrait. CHAPTER 18:The Order of Merlin. The living are celebrated, the dead remembered, and it is a new day for the wizarding world.

** Hermione being compared to Lily is something I always hate in fics tbh.
