So I'm not very clear about the concept of warding exactly, but

Would it be possible to ward yourself? So like if there's anyone with bad intentions near you, the ward can detect it and automatically the person gets hexed or somethings. Or just protect you against minor hexes and stuff like that

Or

Say human warding isnt possible, if you ward an object, like an jacket and wear it, causing the same effects

Do you think that's possible? Or is it covered somewhere that it isn't or too much of a deus ex machina or OP


** I think warding is strictly fanfic, so it would be author's choice.

** Warding is almost complete fanon (there are some mentionings of “protective enchantments” few times, but that's it), so you can set up any rules you wish. From the author's point of view, I would see the problem in moving rapidly, too rapidly, towards the Uncanny Valley from the realistic side, but it is up to you.

*** This is true, and also not. The word “ward” as a verb means “to keep someone or something away” which is what protective enchantments do (which, canonically, has quite a few spells under this category). While it is not used specifically in the books, it is essentially synonymous with “protective enchantments” and is often used as a much easier way to describe the spells used to protect a location or to designate a place is protected (ie, Hogwarts is warded against Muggles vs. Hogwarts is protectively enchanted against Muggles).

*** Hogwarts has protection spells and spells that let muggles see an old ruine were the castle stands. There was also the memory charm around the Quidditch Cup that let Muggles think about things they have to do so they didn't find the stadium. There is also the blood protection at the dursleys. The Weasley twins invented shield-hats if I remember correctly and there were spells that let only open you things if you know how (Voldemorts locket, the chamber of secrets). There is as well a spell on the mokeskin pouch he got from Hagrid so only he could open it. Hermione, Harry and Ron set protection charms so they are save from the DE when they are on the run. And let's not forget the alarm spell that triggers the moment Harry, Ron and Hermione came to Hogsmead. Not sure but all of that sounds like wards to me, even if it isn't called that canonically.

Edit: Just saw that many points I made were already mentioned. Somehow the side didn't show the comments when I loaded it first.

*** Ah, ok, thx!

Although it would be pretty convenient for ppl to just ward themselves from hexes

**** Shield Hats are canon, so we know enchanted protective clothing is possible.

** I agree that it's fanon, but I don't think it's OP. My favorite example is this chapter, where Sirius is seen tattooing runes into himself to help with his sanity/survival in Azkaban.

Harry gets into some serious blood magic/runing here, but it's more intense. Like legit carving large runes into his flesh.

And I started another fic where Dumbledore transferred the blood wards into a stone/crystal and buried it in privet drive but I never finished it. It was too bashy for me.

*** I'll have to check that out, I have some interesting ideas for explanations of some of Sirius' tattoos that I keep meaning to use...
