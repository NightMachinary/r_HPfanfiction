** One afternoon when Draco Malfoy came by for his typical taunting of one Ron Weasley, esquire...it happened.\\
"You know, you shouldn't talk," Ron responded with an airy tone, "In all likelyhood, you're technically a Weasley too."\\
Draco blinked; that was /not/ a response he expected, "...That's ridiculous." he eventually managed, "Weasleys have red hair, Malfoys have blonde. You can't expect us to be closely related."\\
"I really could," Ron continued in that same airy tone, "My dad's dad, Septimus, he had something like six siblings. 'Breeding like rabbits', as you called it, runs in the family. Ask /Lucy/, he can tell you about your great-grandfather."\\
"It's /Lucius/, not Lucy." Draco snarled as he stalked away.

Later...\\
Draco's eyes lit up with glee as he jotted down a quick note, taking care not to spill any ink on the genealogy grimoire he had sitting open on his desk.\\
He had found it. Not only had he proved that no Malfoys were descendants of Weasleys, he had discovered, over a thousand years ago where the Weasleys were just poor servants...\\
"A house elf! Milton Weasel married a house-elf! And they had kids! The Weasleys have elf-blood!" he cackled aloud.

After that...\\
That next afternoon, Draco Malfoy came by for his typical taunting of Ron Weasley...as usual.\\
"Good morning Potter, good morning Granger," he said surprisingly courteously, before turning a gleeful grin on Ron, "Good morning, Weasley, clamouring to shine Potter's boots as usual I see."\\
Ron opened his mouth...then closed it and thought about it, "...I don't get that one." he admitted. Harry and Hermione shook their heads showing a lack of comprehension as well.\\
Draco's grin widened, then he thrust forward a sheet of parchment at Ron, "I was double-checking to confirm that I don't have any filthy Weasley blood in my veins, and look what I found, /Ronny/."\\
Ron took it and read up and down the parchment with a raised eyebrow, Hermione peering over his shoulder; there, his name at the top, then Arthur, Septimus..."This is my family tree. Nice research, but what's the problem you have with it?" he asked.\\
"Read to the bottom. Milton Weasel." Draco answered, still smiling gleefully.\\
Ron read to the bottom. Then he raised his eyebrows, "Blimey! Harry, Hermione, I'm descended from a house-elf!" he exclaimed.\\
"And not just any house-elf," Draco added, "a house-elf serving the Potter family! Nice to know you're upholding the family tradition, weasel."\\
Another pause. "I don't get that one either." Ron admitted again.\\
Draco grumbled before dramatically throwing up his hands and stalking away, muttering about "These incompetents" and "waste of my intellect".

After the blonde ponce had left, Ron turned and looked questioningly at Harry, "D'you think it's true? That there's a house-elf far up in my family tree that served your family?"\\
Harry just shrugged, "Who knows? Hagrid's half-giant, Flitwick's quarter-goblin, Fluer's quarter-Veela, so it's possible."\\
Ron returned the shrug, before looking at the direction Draco had retreated, "But what was with the crack about 'family tradition' and shining your shoes?"\\
Hermione looked thoughtful, "I read when I was working on S.P.E.W.," (Ron mimed vomiting) "that when a female house-elf is enslaved to a family, any children they have are magically bound to serve that same family as well. I think there was a precedent involving a half-elf..."\\
Ron shook his head, "That couldn't carry down...what, 15 or 16 generations" ("17 generations, from the looks of this" Hermione interjected) "of my family, though, could it? We're humans."\\
Harry shrugged yet again, "It would explain why you keep following me into trouble."\\
"And why Fred and George went to that trouble with the car, and they shared a Quidditch World Cup seat for you." Hermione added.\\
Ron was starting to look a bit worried. "But...when I said I wanted a house-elf at the Burrow, way back when, that didn't mean I wanted to be one." he said nervously.\\
"There's an easy way to test it." Harry said with a grin, "Ron, I order you to give Hermione a hug."\\
Ron blinked, before he turned to Hermione and held out his arms with a big smile.\\
"Oh, honestly Harry..." Hermione sighed before she stepped over and embraced Ron, "I don't think this is helping."\\
"Yeah, I don't think ordering me to do something I want to do is a proper test." Ron agreed.\\
"Ron, kiss Hermione."\\
"Harry Potter..." Hermione growled warningly, before she rolled her eyes and moved to connect her lips with Ron's.

** For 17 generations the Weasley Clan has been the protectors of the Potters. That all ends today. The debt that we owe no longer binds us. 17 generations, four hundred years of servitude and fealty, all this we have done without complaint. 400 years slaves to the Potters. My name is Benjamin Weasley and today my family will know freedom.

Our time of servitude began with a debt, the saving of a life done by one Harry Potter. Ginevra Molly Weasley, the seventh child and first Weasley daughter in generations was rescued from the clutches of Tom Riddle. Magic decreed our debt, binding us to the Potters. Although Harry Potter ended up wedding Ginevra, the debt remained unpaid. It is only now, after the actions of my father Steven that we now branch out on our own.

The descendants of Harry Potter are not like the man himself. They are selfish, they are perverse, they have abused the loyalty that we have shown them. The servitude to them was first in gladness, now it is out of obligation and poorly disguised hatred. Today we wreak Vengeance upon those we swore to serve and protect. Today we regain our pride, today we strike at them. Today we are Weasleys.

** "Mum," Ron said, "I have a question about our family history."

"Oh? Do you want to know why we protect the Potters?"

Ron scratched his head. "No, not that. It's just... we live in Devon. Why do we call ourselves a clan? That's a Scottish thing."
