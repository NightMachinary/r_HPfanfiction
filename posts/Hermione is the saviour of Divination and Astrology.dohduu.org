Disclaimer: I saw this as a post on Instagram and I'm fairly certain the post itself was from Tumblr.

Basically, Hermione presents the fact that Pluto is not, in fact, a planet and uses this as proof for Divination all being codswallop. However this has been throwing off predictions for a long time and now Divination becomes an actual thing and Hermione is worshipped as the Saviour of Divination.

Please read the disclaimer if you skipped it.


** But, the books happen in the 90's. Pluto was classified as a planet till 2006.

Or is this supposed to be a post- Hogwarts story where Hermione kept up with muggle science and also is invested enough in discrediting divination for some reason ( when her best friend was the object of a prophecy and said proohecy came to pass...)?

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15760_Albion][15760 Albion]] (!) is a 1992 discovery. IAU made their resolution in 2006, but the journey there picks up much earlier.

Between that, and the facts about Pluto itself, which don't depend on what anyone calls it, it's workable.

Pluto's wikipedia page captures much of the history, so a dedicated writer could take care to use 1990s approximations, e.g. for Pluto's radius and mass.

**** I /could/ seee Hermione keeping up with Muggle sciences and also argue that "Pluto cannot be a planet. Or, if if was, there at least should be other objects in our solar system that right now are not called planets but should be defined as planets too. Otherwise we are inconsistent with definitions and how they are used."

I wonder, was Pluto ever used in divination in canon? The centaurs seem to use stars and planets that are visible with the naked eye to make their divinations, and Trelawney seems to be more into things like tea leaves and dreams.

***** Trelawney says something about having to be careful around red-haired men due to the angle of Saturn at some point, so there's definitely planetary involvement in divination

****** That wasn't the question, though. The question is whether Divination uses planets that aren't visible to the naked eye. Offhand the only thing I can think of is the Uranus gag.

******* She asks something about Neville's grandmother being unwell during the tea leaves section, which isn't ever substantiated

******** Her thing is that she's always wrong about the time of her predictions. Her vague suggestion that Neville's grandmother might not be as well as he thinks could either be A) a vision of the future where she dies of natural causes; B) a comment about his /maternal/ grandmother, who we never see; or C) a vision of Neville's boggart causing him trouble with Snape.
