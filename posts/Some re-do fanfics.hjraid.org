I already read a few like Xerosis, Full circle, Eternal Hilarity, etc. I would like complete fic, but WIP and Abandon fics are alright.


** The classic is linkffn(oh god not again)

But my favorite is still linkffn(again and again) Harry is already tired of redo after several times, so this time he try to do something different. Slash and abandoned. But the story is so good

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

** - /Oh God Not Again!/ by Sarah1281 - A parody of do-over fics. It does not take itself remotely seriously. Neville's boggart is Harry Potter as Minister of Magic.

- [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry_potter_and_the_nightmares_of_futures_past/index/][/Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past/]] - Harry comes from a bad future, and goes back in time after losing literally everyone he ever cared about. I don't know if it'll ever be finished, due to it being removed from FFN over a bogus copyright violation and the staff being entirely MIA and just never responding to inquiries.

- /Amalgum: Lockhart's Folly/ - Harry becomes Master of Death and is offered a chance to change things for the better, only Death tricks Harry, and he winds up sharing a body with Gilderoy Lockhart.

- /Death's Champion/ - It's in my favorites on FFN, but honestly I don't remember much about it, but it's also a time travel fic with Harry traveling through time..

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

Linkffn(The Red Dragon)

It's got Gryffindor Draco and Harry/Luna! Also Harry's pretty badass later on. It's currently on hiatus, the author said they would never abandon it last time I checked, but it hasn't updated in a while do to things in the authors life. There's also a misguided-but-genuinely-good and not bashed Dumbledore :D

Also, there's another fic I can't remember the name of in which Snape, Voldie, and Harry are the three brothers reincarnated, and they all die and then get sent back as triplets to be Potters. It's sorta short and I don't know if it's updated since last time I read it, but it was intriguing and it had a good start.
