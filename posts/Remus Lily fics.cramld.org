I've read a one shot called Amortentia and a couple of fics that have these two but which involve infidelity. I know britanimus has written a fic with this paring, but I was unable to get into it. Could anyone recommend a fic with this paring? Preferably one that has no infidelity in it.


** Stages of Hope has this but it's not the main focus of the fic. Linkffn(6892925) It's still a super good fic and I would highly recommend it.
