******** Birth for any given cohort at Hogwarts starts on the 2nd of September and ends on the 1st. So Fred, if he was born on the first, would be part of cohort x, while if George was born some minutes later into 2nd of September, would be part of cohort y. The criteria is that you have to have magic and be eleven by the time term starts on the first of September. In this hypothetical case, Fred fills the criteria, but George doesn't.
