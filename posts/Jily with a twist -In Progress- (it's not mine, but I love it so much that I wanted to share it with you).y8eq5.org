** I love L/J and I love L/J fluff... but this isn't a great example of how to go about writing it. The author's literary style isn't awful... it's just... I dunno... /mundane?/

Like, I wouldn't mind having virtually zero exposition if the dialogue was emotional and realistic. But it isn't. It's flat and sounds like it was written by a prepubescent fangirl that doesn't have experience with what she's writing about. Ugh... that letter from James to Lily was cringeworthy.

To be fair, compared to much of the crap pervading FF.net, this doesn't make me want to back arrow as soon as I start reading.
