** I'm a competitive epee fencer and, for a time, was ranked among the top in my country in my age group. I can imagine few sports more applicable to HP magical combat than fencing: it has footwork, speed, balance, speed, point control (aim), speed, stamina, speed, courage, speed, ruthlessness, speed, hard-nosed competitiveness, speed, and the chess match of taking apart one's opponent. Oh, and it's fast too. Fencing is the closest analogue to what my mind-canon makes of the helter-skelter of magical dueling.

Fencing is for those with 120% fast-twitch muscle composition with nitrous in their veins and reflexes bordering on the preternatural. Table tennis is slow to fencers.

Yeah, to me it's totally natural for fencing to be emphasized in HP fanfiction.

** I would argue that fencing/martial arts could be quite useful, in that we have seen from the movies/read from the books that spell fire is so slow that it can be dodged, or (movies only perhaps) parried.

Further, given the nature of short projectile weapons held in a single hand, we can extrapolate an effective range of perhaps thirty yards, for those with cool nerves and steady hands.

Now, consider that in the American LEO community it is holy writ that an assailant armed with a blade, within seven yards, is considered an immediate and deadly threat. From this point it varies, however within a single yard, drawing/firing your sidearm isn't recommended, and hand to hand combat is.

So, taking that all together, having the physical fortitude and practice to dodge incoming fire/parry it, as you close the range, before engaging an unskilled enemy with a blade, seems like a worthwhile skill to have.

Or offhand a pistol, but that is another conversation.

** Martial arts are cool, interesting, fun, a social exercise, a way to stay healthy, a way to burn off extra energy, stress relief, and have the obvious practical application of keeping you dangerous even after you're disarmed (and likely helping you dodge harmful spells). It's also a way for Muggle-raised kids to show off that they're good at something to their magical friends - Harry lucks out by being the Chosen One and a natural flying prodigy, and Hermione is a genius. How does the average Muggleborn build up their self-esteem?

Honestly, if you knew an evil mass murderer was still alive and after you, specifically, why the hell would you not learn to throw a punch?

Fencing is also fun, but requires specialty equipment to learn as well as, you know, having a sword handy if you want to use it in the real world. On the other hand, it's pretty similar to magical dueling, so...

*** No, it's a stupid combo. First, he disarms them, then he stuns or kills them with another spell. Faster. Safer. More effective. Or he goes straight to Stunning/killing them.

Outside cultural reasons, or "this enemy can only be killed with (this) sword(s)" gizmos, the only reason to learn fencing is because you want to, not because it's effective. Martial arts might have uses in some situations - grappled, or close combat - so might learn the basics, but any time spent learning how to fall and leg sweep and punching is time not spent learning how to cast spells.

**** Learning material arts is alot more than just kicking the shit outta the other guy, its hones long endurance muscles and reflexes, it teaches discipline and patience, it teaches you how to take a fall should you be tripped or, idk, have an explosive sent in your general direction that throws you. I get what you mean that it's used wrong most of the time, but it's not JUST "nah I'm going to stab the shit out of him". And the whole bit with "not learning to cast spells if hes learning to fall," we still teach military how to take a fall and how to fight with or without a weapon, it's not all just learning how to shoot a gun or launch a rocket. In the fics I've seen learning martial arts done well, it was a training process used to have an exuse as to why a 13 year old can be in the middle of a firefight and come out of it alive be other than divine intervention.

That concidering also that it's not like spells are bullets in terms of speed, you could theoretically dodge a spell, a bullet not so much.

That's why he learns wandless summoning charms and/or carries a backup wand.

And no, someone running at you only works if he has surprise on your side - generally by starting the fight. And if, instead of running at you, he had cast a spell, you'd already be done for.

****** Having another wand is like a drag queen having a backup wig---it's been done to death and Mama is not here for it. This all makes it very “a wizard did it” and removes the human struggle from a fight. I'll give you the wandless aspect, but a backup wand? Meh. That really lowers the stakes if there's no real risk if Harry loses his primary way of casting spells. I mean, you could just as easily have him Apparate away from the fight as it's not clear that Apparating needs a wand. Therein lies the problem with writing and making things interesting in JKR's world---it's far too easy to magic away things and I feel like it makes the characters harder to identify with.

**** It doesn't have to be realistic or effective. It really all depends on how you prefer your fantasy, rather than any sense of practicality. I grew up on sword and sorcery fantasy and so magic swords and staves were the fantasy norm for me, rather than a wand, and that can totally be translated into an HP fic if you want it to. Sure, the general weebery that surrounds the sword fighting trope with Harry suddenly turning into a latter day ronin can be cringe as fuck, but there's really no logic to Harry running around parry/riposting and shooting lethal moonbeams out of a magic greatsword like a Dark Souls character beyond "yo I think that's cool."

All of that would probably be really useful in a duel, and being able to surprise an enemy in close quarters by attacking them in hand to hand also can't hurt in a pinch.

There is also the factor of being able to take on people like Crabbe or Goyle without violating corridor rules or underage magic restrictions.

Honestly, I can think of a lot of skills that would be far less useful to Harry than learning martial arts.

** Personally i adore these types of stories but im also infatuated with d&d and the swordsmage archetype. And the vast amount of these types of fics should tell you that a wide variety of readers/writers ALSO adore these tropes and themes, despite it not fitting the original setting.

Sometime a fic doesn't have to be based on realism/verisimilitude or rational planning. It can just be a way to explore a specific type of fantasy.

The HP world as shown to us has little use for melee weaponry beyond a very rare instance of using a powerful ancient relic. But fanfiction doesn't have to be confined by the canon. Sometimes i want to enjoy a martial artist Harry who learns to duel better by learning to fight like a muggle. Or an AU where the wizarding world is more like a traditional fantasy world next to the modern one where adventuring is still a viable profession. Hell to this day i still adore warrior!Harry crossover fics where Harry shows up one day with the skills of another series' characters and gets a chance to use them. Which will often include a bladed weapon or a bit of hand to hand combat.

Fanfiction is in a unique position where you can freely interpret, twist and change parts of the original work to suit whatever story you want to tell no matter how much it clashes with the original setting. I say lets take full advantage of that. and if you dont like that type of story move on and accept that not all fics will be written with you in mind.

Dragons can fly which makes any form of melee combat even harder (because they can just stay airborn and cook you), though they might not be smart enough to use such tactics.\\

Running seems like the best idea either way, but if I have to defend my house from a giant, I'd rather try to do that with a .50 cal machine gun than with a sword (the summoning charm solves the logistics here).

*** If you can't aim and cast before you get hit, you can't draw a weapon in the time before you get hit either. Unless you walk around with a drawn knife or sword, instead of a wand. Which would be rather bad for all the situations where you can cast, but the enemy is out of range of your blade.

**** You can go from holstered gun to firing within 1.5 seconds (aforementioned Tueller drill) . Now take a stick and try to do that when you have to do wand movements and say/think the incantation and possibly the visualization of the spell.

***** Indeed, you can learn to do this. And it'll take you a damn long time to learn how to quick-draw and shoot well enough for it to be worth a damn in close quarter combat.

Harry isn't some RPG character who can learn skills with a click - he has to spend time learning everything, and time practising so he keeps his skills sharp. And he needs magic more than anything else. He might be forced into close combat or lose his wand - but he will be forced into magic combat.

It's a matter of priorities.

*** *Tueller Drill*

The Tueller Drill is a self-defense training exercise to prepare against a short-range knife attack when armed only with a holstered handgun.

Sergeant Dennis Tueller, of the Salt Lake City, Utah Police Department wondered how quickly an attacker with a knife could cover 21 feet (6.4 m), so he timed volunteers as they raced to stab the target. He determined that it could be done in 1.5 seconds. These results were first published as an article in SWAT magazine in 1983 and in a police training video by the same title, "How Close is Too Close?"A defender with a gun has a dilemma.

** Muggle means could be pretty effective, it's just they need to be modern muggle means, explosives and sniper rifles could offer ways to kill Voldermort without actually engaging in a duel, just lure him to a preset location and blow the whole place to bits or shoot him from a roof half a mile away. I don't think they'd be all that much use in an actual fight of course, magical shields seem to exert some physical force so could probably stop them.

*** The age old question of how effective magical shields are against firearms. And even if they would hold, I doubt that the Death Eaters would have reached the walls of Hogwarts if it was defended by machine guns, mortars and RPGs. Especially since magical shields would not be effective against explosions.

** Because sometimes you just want to stab a bitch and feel the blood flow.

​

That aside, well, considering that Harry does get the Sword of Gryffindor, to be honest if I got a relic that is imbued with the strongest poison known, and comes whenever I summon it, well, I would learn to use it, not because I'll win by using it, but because it gives me versatility.

And again, we are talking that one of the most influential wizards in the UK (Gryffindor) had a sword and used it, so overall I think it's a good idea.

Now, I don't advocate learning it above magic, but I like the idea of not leaving a powerful artifact as a doorstop.

​

Then again, I pose the follow up question to your post, that I find equally infuriating, neither Voldemort or his deatheathers have a mean to stop a bullet if fired without warning, due to the need to react to it to cast a shield, yet I haven't found a fic where Harry or someone else decides "Well, the muggles have all this nice long distance rifles, why don't we go and buy a Remington 700 , some bullets, and get working with our runes professor in a way to enchant the fuck out of a bullet" ?

There you go. Not entirely serious and dismissive of postwar weaponry, but the overall idea of shooting Death Eaters is the same.

** Wands and spells are heavily biased towards long distance attacks. If Harry were written to be smarter or more strategic then he would logically train in some sort of close combat as that is what any smart fighter/soldier would do.

** Sword fighting: because Draco can do it, coming from an aristocratic family, and offers to teach Harry (Draco Veritas trilogy).

Martial arts: because it teaches focus and self restraint and concentration (HP and the Fifth Element; The Next Dance.)
