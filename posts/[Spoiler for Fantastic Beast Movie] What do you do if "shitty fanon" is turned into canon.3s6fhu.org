According to this

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_(film)]]

the movie features a "magically expanded briefcase which houses a number of dangerous creatures and their habitats". Now we already had Barty Crouch Jr.'s expanded trunk, but this seems far, far bigger on the inside - we're talking habitats, not even cages.

Is this enough to get people to stop about "shitty fanon" as soon as the thing is mentioned, and instead start talking about whether or not expanded suitcases and trunks are used well in a story or not?


** Magic is magic. The first time I encountered stuff like Harry hiding away in his trunk for an entire summer I thought it was neat, but now I hate it just because it's overused (and usually one of many signs of lazy and unoriginal writing)

** I don't think magical trunks and people living in them were ever labeled as "shitty fanon" --- or at least not in the same way as magical cores or swearing on the motes were. Most of the condemnation that I've seen is about how it's an overused cliché indicative of a bad fanfic. (Well, it wasn't always a cliché, but you get the idea.) Call me when some official source mentions a magical core or someone swears on their motes.

Magical trunks are also a plot device that tends to /isolate/ a character from his or her physical and social environment, which is almost never a good thing. Also, if nothing else, few fics consider the disadvantages of such a living arrangement. linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) is the only one I know of that deals with the problem of people knocking the darned thing over by accident or picking it up and carrying it off with the protagonist still inside.

*** as an avid player of RPG and strategy games, wildly OP mechanics in written fiction trigger me.

Seriously - every Ramsey scene in Game of Thrones TV show put together, has caused me less emotional turmoil than reading any one chapter of:

'I spent the first days of summer creating a pocket universe... actually it was a bunch of them - one for me and one for each of my new friends. Linked them all together like Legos too... I hope to do well on my OWLs next year as I look out from the windows of my new palace at the England-sized mini-Earth I now carry in my luggage.

Reading ahead I know we are going to cover turning couches into donkeys in Transfiguration this year and am worried that it will impact my marks - never quite managed to get the assholes correctly in my furniture to animal Transfigurations."

*** Getting isolated from the Dursleys is almost always a good thing. And with magic, I do not think those dangers you mention are that big. Sticking charms would prevent most of the dangers, and anyone getting around them would probably do something worse if he caught you in your bed instead your trunk. The expansion charms failing is another thing, but wizard tents seem very common, after all, and also use expansion charms.

I should've been more clear: good/bad for the story, not for the character.

Regarding the practicalities, I know, but, well, it was an opportunity to plug /Seventh Horcrux/, and the idea of serious!indy!protagonist being constantly annoyed by people and house-elves tripping over his trunk or picking it up and moving it it out of the way (and blocking the exit half the time, because they don't realize he's in there, since he's too paranoid to tell them) hilarious.

***** Getting isolated from the Dursleys is generally good for a story too - having them abuse Harry is a stupid contrived plot device that harms Dumbledore's characterization as a benevolent and capable wizard for letting that happen.

** A lot of things are stupid in canon, but that's ok it's a children's book. I remember reading deathly hallows and thinking instead of freezing their ass off in a forest why not get a magical tent or a crouch jr. Trunk. Instead of eating crappy food call dobby winky or kreacher. Canon is littered with inconsistencies and just plain bad plot. But it's still a good book and we love it. I think most people hold canon as some sort of gospel especially the books. Truth is jo barely laid out ny rules on the magic system in hp. Gramps laws are cool but Harry's apparating from some crazy beach cliff all the way to northern Scotland is crazy far. I don't remember did he apperate into hogwarts or outside of it but it's still far. So I guess living in a time portal super trunk with golf courses isnt that far out of the realm of hp verse jk created.

*** Harry apparated himself and Dumbledore from the cave into Hogsmeade- a distance of several hundred miles but still within the confines of the UK. They had to borrow brooms from Rosemerta in order to speed their way up to Hogwarts. That's why they landed in the Astronomy tower.

As for the super trunk, the movie verse operates under slightly different rules than the book verse, so whatever Newt does in the upcoming film doesn't have to jive with book-canon.

*** That's not what she meant. She meant she'd spent so long being poor that it was still hard for her to believe that she was rich and she still felt it could be taken away from her.

I hate the accusation that she's greedy/cash grabbing. She pays all her taxes. She's come off the billionaires list because of all the money she's given to charity. She's set aside 100 seats for every Cursed Child showing for disadvantaged children in London. She's given away a huge amount of free content through Pottermore and on Twitter. She's written books for charity. What on earth could this woman do to convince you that she's not greedy? She can apparently do nothing right.
