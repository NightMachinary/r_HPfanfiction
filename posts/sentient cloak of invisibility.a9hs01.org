The cloak had some sentience and Harry wore it everywhere, he was eventually sent to Azkaban for a reason I don't recall and he ended up a demigod or god with the help of death. If anyone can help me out that'd be very nice. Yes this is a repost, i'll add more details that may help though. the cloak isn't fully sentient, it can move a bit but not float or speak, and after the ending harry visits hermione, i believe it hermiones pov for the final bit but i'm not entirely positive


** It's not the one you're after, but all three of the Hallows have an unclear degree of sentience in linkffn(Blindness).

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
