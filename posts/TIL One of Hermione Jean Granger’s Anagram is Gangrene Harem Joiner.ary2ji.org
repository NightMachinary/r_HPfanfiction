** I used [[https://wordsmith.org/anagram/][this site]] to generate these anagrams.

After fine tuning that must includes "harem", I got [[https://new.wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=hermione+jean+granger&language=english&t=1000&d=&include=harem&exclude=&n=&m=&a=n&l=n&q=n&k=1&source=adv][this result]]. There are far better ones than the title:

Harem Jargon Engineer

Harem Enrage Gore Jinn

Harem Range Green Join

Harem Nag Green Joiner

--------------

Harry James Potter has a bunch [[https://new.wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=harry+james+potter&language=english&t=1000&d=&include=harem&exclude=&n=&m=&a=n&l=n&q=n&k=1&source=adv][Harem related anagrams]] too:

Harem Arty Jest Pro

Harem Portrays Jet

Harem Rape Jots Try

Harem Tart Rep Joys

--------------

Tom Marvolo Riddle has [[https://new.wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=tom+marvolo+riddle&language=english&t=1000&d=&include=dildo&exclude=&n=&m=&a=n&l=n&q=n&k=1&source=adv][469 anagrams based on Dildo]]:

Dildo Marvel Motor

Dildo Rear Volt Mom

Dildo Armor Mole TV

Dildo Ram Lover Tom

--------------

Ginevra Molly Weasley has some interesting words in [[https://new.wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=ginevra+molly+weasley&language=english&t=1000&d=&include=&exclude=&n=&m=&a=n&l=n&q=n&k=1&source=adv][her anagrams]]: "Legalese", "Evangelism", "Revealing", "Avenger", and "Menage".

--------------

Ronald Billius Weasley has quite a few bad words in [[https://new.wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=ronald+billius+weasley&language=english&t=1000&d=&include=&exclude=&n=&m=&a=n&l=n&q=n&k=1&source=adv][his anagrams]]: "Bad", "Dab", "Unwisely", "Sillies", "Senile", and "Sullenly".

--------------

Albus Brian Wulfric Percival Dumbledore has too many anagrams. It overloads the software.

Anybody else having a full name? As far as I know, the Books didn't show Luna and Neville's middle names.

*** On the subject of Ron Weasley anagrams, I reread one of my old snippets recently, one where Ronald Bilius anagrams to I, Droll Anubis.\\
I wonder if anyone's done anything with that before? Ron goes to Egypt as per canon, gets shut in a pyramid courtesy of Fred & George (when they were, per canon, trying to get Percy), and comes out with a new friend.
