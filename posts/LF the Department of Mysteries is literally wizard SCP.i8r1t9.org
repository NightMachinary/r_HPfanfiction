*** SCP Foundation is a creepypasta-ish fictional organization dedicated to catching and researching anything too weird for normal humans to cope with (mostly eldritch horrors, but also things like a tomato plant that throws high-velocity tomatoes whenever it hears a bad joke).

*** Imagine every kind of nightmare you can. The SCP-verse has atleast two of all of them. The SCP Foundation (Secure. Contain. Protect.) is dedicated to doing as the name suggests to all of them, while trying to keep regular people out of it.

For instance, SCP-087, 093, 173, 303, 342, 835, 993, 1177, 1981, and 2998. To name only ten. Many a Horror WARNING.

It's a collection of a few thousand stories, mostly written by anyone that wants to write, and can pass muster; though for the most part you have to subscribe to the ‘creepy-pasta' category, with elements of Horror or Mystery.

SCP-1230 is an example of an actually good SCP to be exposed to, as few and far between as they are; but even it has a nightmare element to it. “Be careful what you wish for, you may just get it, and then you'll never be able to go back to how you were.”
