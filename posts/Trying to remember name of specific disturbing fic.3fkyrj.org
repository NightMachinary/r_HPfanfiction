I think Harry messes with time or something and he needs for everything to come out exactly as is does in canon. So he's forced to become Lord Voldemort, playing the part exactly, tortures and murder included.

Thanks in advance.

***** Reading the description this probably isn't a story I would normally read--what is it that makes it a great fic?
