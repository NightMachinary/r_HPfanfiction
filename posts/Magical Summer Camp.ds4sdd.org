[Alternatively: No1 Biggest Missed Opportunity] Have Harry hear about it in 2nd and/or 3rd year and he KNOWS the Dursley's would never pay for OR sign the permission slip for it. But Sirius damn well would!

Fuck the Quidditch world cup, Harry spends his 3rd-4th year summer in a cabin by a lake somewhere in the Peak District with a bunch of other wizarding kids (he loves it, they're all miserable).

Force Harry to socialise with kids his age other than Ron and Hermione. Let the BWL fall for a girl he'll never see again, like a real teenager. See the magical worlds take on a summer get away with kids. Force Harry to see kids from Hogwarts in other houses in a new light (perhaps kids like: Susan, Hannah, Cho, Blaise, Justin, Romilda, Neville etc.)

And, in true Harry Potter/Murphy's Law fashion... Death Eater attack at the end of the summer. No Auror's are coming, they're busy with the World Cup... Harry and Co. will obviously escape but people will be injured, kids may die, let Harry see the true ruthlessness and evil of the Death Eaters (who would march on and massacre a camp full of innocent children). Send his ass into 4th year with some nice experiences, new friends and enemies and as a changed kid...


** I mean this is a really fun idea! I can see it making an interesting story, but I've got to point out that summer camps like this really american idea. Cabins by a lake, summer getaways, camp romances... this just /isn't/ a thing in England. (And the peak district is stunningly beautiful, but really isn't particularly warm...)

Of course just because muggle culture doesn't have them doesn't mean that /wizarding/ culture doesn't, but it would feel like an odd departure from the very english tone of the books. If anything, I think I'd write him specifically going to an international camp in america.

*** I mean I get you're point, but PGL and Camp Beaumont were a massive part of my childhood (in the UK) and there were always so many kids there. It's not as big of a thing here as it is in the US I'm sure but it's not unheard of

**** But they are definitely an expensive luxury. No one I know has been, I've never met anyone who said they went. And I can't see the Dursleys paying for it, can you?

***** I did say that in the first sentence, my guy. I know it's a luxury but it was all the rage when I was a kid (in the sense that everyone wanted to go), so I can imagine Harry getting swept up in the other kids excitement but not daring to ask the Dursley's (for obvious reasons). But Sirius catches wind of this and, because he can't actually spend time with his godson, decides he's going to give him this summer because it would make him happy. I'm sure he can afford it AND can pay for it if he can buy Harry a brand new Firebolt for Christmas fresh outta Azkaban.

** aight so I have to recommend you Engineer4Evers fanfiction crossover on percy Jackson/Harry Potter. They take place mostly in the PJO world and have that summer campy feel to them. Hes got 3 series. 1 for each of the Big Three gods. I recommend The unrelenting Frozen sea. All of them are really good high quality stuff.

** Linkffn(2856856) has a quidditch summer camp, but the story is a bit cringey.

Also the idea of a quidditch summer camp is explored in linkffn(3661577). This one is a bit better written but is still that independent Harry trope.

  Set right after 5th year. Harry becomes independent. No pairings, lots of Quidditch and some Ron&Ginny&Dumbledore&Etc bashing.
