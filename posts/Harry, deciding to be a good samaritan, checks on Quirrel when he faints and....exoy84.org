Ends up killing him in front of the entire school.


** "Professor Quirrel; are you alright?" Harry asked as he put his hand on the professor's neck to see if his pulse was steady. As soon as he touched the professor's skin he retrieved his hand as if burned.

Quirrel neck started to turn to ash as he screamed from the pain. Another scream joined the first one but this was one of rage.

"Kill him fool! What are you doing?" A high pitched voice came from under the turban. "I will kill you myself Potter." Quirrel's hand reached for his wand as Harry kicked his hand to stop it from happening.

As his vessel's body started to continue to crumble Voldemort abandoned it and appeared as a wraith. "Harry Potter I will make you suffer as I have suffered this past decade. And when you beg me to let you die I will grant you the privilege to be killed by me, Lord Voldemort." The wraith screamed as it fled away from Dumbledore who was quickly approaching with his wand drawn.

There was silence in the great hall as Harry turned around and saw everyone staring at him. He gulped as he saw the teachers coming closer. He turned on his heels and ran as fast as he could. He did not mean for this to happen. He did not want to kill him. They were going to send him to jail or worse expel him from school and make him live with the Drusleys. He could not let that happen. He will not let this happen. He had to run away but how?

*** "I killed him." Harry replies faintly, about to pass out from the fear so intense that he did not even notice the Headmaster come close to him.

"It was love, my boy. Your mother's love which protected you from Voldemort all those years ago continues to keep you safe."

Harry blinks. "Love?" He asked with faint disbelief? He looked down at what once used to be a body but was now no more than a pile of ash. "I think I need to spread some of this love to the Dursley-! I mean, I don't think I'm feeling to well headmaster, is it alright if I went home for a few days?"

Harry tried to put off the flames using his hands, which only resulted in spreading the fire.

** It was only Harry's second die of Hogwarts and he was still very nervous. He was in an entire new world after all. Of course his luck came about when he left for the bathroom during Charms.

Hogwarts is a castle full of corners and it was bound to happen that he run into someone as he quickly walked to the bathroom. How unfortunate that it had to be a professor.

"I'm so sorry sir, are you okay?" Harry asked the turban wearing professor. Harry was only small and the crash hadn't been big yet here the professor was screaming in pain.

Harry tried to help him up, he gently grabbed the mans hand and shoulder to guide him to his feet. Yet the only response was more screaming. Harry felt more than saw the mans hamd turn to ash in his grip. The professor screamed louder and pushed Harry away.

The day couldn't have gotten worse Harry thought but he was very wrong. It was never a good idea to get stuck on a wall when Dudley was beating you up. Instincts made Harry bounce off the wall and trip over the professor on the ground. Harry tumbled over and landed on top of the screaming man. In a small struggle for Harry to get off the man and stand up which took about ten seconds when you factor strange new robes Harry had never worn before into the equation.

When he finally stood again the screaming had stopped. Now all that remained of the unknown professor was a pile of ash, it seemed his clothes had burnt too. Harry stared at his hands in amazement and no small amount of fear.

Foot steps fell loudly as Professor Mcgonogall walked very quickly around the corner, she would never run. She stopped when she found Harry stood still and slowed her pace.

"Mr Potter, what on earth was that screaming?" She asked, her accent thick in the stressful situation.

"Came from around the corner professor." Harry replied as he continued to stare at his hands.

*** Ah, you've been watching the movies. Turning Quirrell to ash is weird and non-canonical. Quirrell was /blistered/ by Harry's touch.
