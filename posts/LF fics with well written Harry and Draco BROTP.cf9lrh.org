Normally I love me some drarry, but I just finished reading Epistles by DrSallySparrow and olivieblake and the bromance between the two in it had me teary eyed and grinning like a fool. So now I need to fill my waking hours with more harry/malfoy brotp. Any recommendations that might be similar to Epistles? Thanks.

Not quite bromance but has a really interesting slow friendship between the two. It's honestly one of my favorite fics.
