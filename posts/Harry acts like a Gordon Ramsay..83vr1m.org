Any fics where Harry acts like Gordon Ramsay where he just insults people for the slightest thing and just blows his lid.


** Ramsay's insults aren't for little things. They're all valid reasons.

*** Look at Gordon Ramsey when teaching kids, then compare to his shows.

He has a lot of tolerance for when people are learning, but none when the person should know better.

Just look at the prompt "If Gordon Ramsey was the Potions Professor".

**** Even in the shows, there's a huge difference between the british & the american versions. Sure, there are explosions in the brit version, but in the american one the aggression is artificially inflated up to 11.

***** I don't even think he'd be that bad to the 7th years, unless -he- had been teaching them the entire time. Gordon Ramsey does okay with people who want to learn to cook but had been taught very badly too. It's intent that matters for him.

****** I agree with this sentiment and I'm not even a huge Gordon Ramsay fan. But from what I've seen, he only ever flips out when he feels like whomever he's working with isn't interested in putting in the time or effort. He will go to great lengths to help people who are trying to better themselves.

A lot of people see him yelling on TV on things like Kitchen Nightmares. Well, I'm sure some of it is staged, but when the people are utterly disinterested in his help, and the kitchen has mold growing in it, he should be screaming at them.

Sounds like he'd make an excellent wizard!

He'd definitely be kind, but also crack down hard on anything stupid, like flicking volatile ingredients into someone else's cauldron.
