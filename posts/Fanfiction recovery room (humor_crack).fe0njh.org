Harry groaned as his body healed after this latest fanfiction. This one had been especially bad. Hermione didn't have it so bad this time but he'd just endured several months of bruises and broken bones. Ron, however, was curled up into a ball crying, a discarded shirt beside him with his face on it.

"Oh snap out of it, we've all had it worse than this"

Ron looked up with a tear-streaked face

"But why, Harry? Why was I spiders?"
