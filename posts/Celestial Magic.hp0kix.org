Hey!

I was wondering if anyone knew any fics where the magic manifested celestially or cosmically (stars) or something similar. I'm interested in magic, characteristics, and writing etc. that is more ethereal rather than simple mentions of astronomy. For example:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435][October]] has Azrael with a crown of literal stars.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17946929][Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis]] has Holly become a star with stars all over her body.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9000477/Easy-as-Falling][Easy as Falling]] has a powerful Harry where his power manifests little stars around him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11673086/Apathy][Apathy]] has an cosmic Hariel Potter who gifts someone a star as a present.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2655016/Comes-Out-of-Darkness-Morn][Comes Out of Darkness Morn]] has a celestial burial rite where you become a part of the stars.

I just really love the beauty and idea surrounding magic manifesting cosmically. So anything similar to where the character is otherworldly in their ethereality or manipulates the cosmos is something I'd probably love to read!

Thanks!
