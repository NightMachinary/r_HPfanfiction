:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't really remember much about this fic I read some time ago, but what I do remember is that Hermione calls the marauders out about their bully ways (I think maybe Sirius or one of them tried to defend themselves saying they were just having a bit of fun) by showing them her scar on her arm, saying something like the person who wrote that was also having fun at that moment.

It was, obviously, a time travel fic to the marauders era, Sirimione (I think) and I think I first read it on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]].


** I want to say that it's probably Debt of Time, but I feel like this has happened in multiple fics. Warning: this is a pretty polarizing story with some problematic aspects regarding age.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

*** Despite the age issue, I've noticed that this is one of the more popular Sirius/Hermione, time-travel fanfic. I really liked it.

** I read one where that happened and it was a Snape/Granger fic (because I only read those).

Pretty sure it was Aurette who wrote it and it is called An unwritten future.
