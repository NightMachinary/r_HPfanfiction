Just out of curiosity: what keeps you going? Because too many times have I read a fic like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/][Against the Moon]] that has consumed my life and it is incomplete. It leaves me vowing to never again read a WIP. So why do YOU read them?

Stories like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]], HPMOR, [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]...

** If you only read Complete stories there just isn't enough fics to go around, simple as that. And there's a lot of great stories that are incomplete.

Also, as a note, reading a story in progress is great. Brings back the feelings of waiting for the next HP book, even if its instead just a chapter every odd month D:

** Whilst its not ideal, its the best of a bad situation. Some of the completed stories I've read have been sheer brilliance up to the last 2-3 chapters where it gets rushed and there are holes, loose ends.

As much as i hate it, some of the best stories I've read have been unfinished. It keeps me awake at night unless i make up my own ending.

***** Nothing wrong with asking and it can't hurt to ask! Just be polite and stress that you'll be be upfront about crediting them, noting who wrote which chapters, and linking to the original. If you're thinking of working on a story with an author who hasn't updated their account/fics in a long time, I'd still email them and wait a month just to try before starting.

** I tend to read in progress fics more than incomplete, abandoned ones. I have a preference for complete stories generally but to not read incomplete or WIPs would make me a hypocrite since I have two WIP fanfics on the go *right now* and I love my readers.

They're fantastic and basically guilt me into writing more whenever there's a lull. So for that reason I read incomplete WIPs. Gives the authors a boost, reminds them they aren't just writing for nobody... and I've read other stuff. I also like receiving feedback as I go, and it can be really helpful to receive. So sometimes I like to do the same thing for other people.

** For me its my mood. sometimes I want to read an incomplete fic. Those fics are normally the ones with great concepts, they just arent completely hashed out. So maybe on Sunday I felt that I wanted a little bit of change... so I found me a good sized fic, hasnt been updated in two years, but the writing is sound and everything. Then there are times for me I want to read a story that is 400k and finish it and be happy for the adventure I just took. Its the same concept as me reading a book series, and a book in a book series. Sometimes, I just want to check it out, other times I want the satisfaction of reading the entire work.

** 1) Fanfics often exist to make a point or to showcase an idea (aka a plot bunny). A fic doesn't need to be complete to do that successfully. Indeed, I'd say that's why so many are abandoned: once the author has covered the material they really wanted to show, there's no reason to continue.

2) Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.

** Not only is there an absurd (but understandable) amount of incomplete works, which means if I turned off from it, I'd be losing a rather substantial number of fics to choose from. Personally, I prefer if it hasn't been updated in several months so there's no constantly checking my email daily to see if it updated. And yes, I know that feeling. That utter frustration, I usually have another fic waiting in the wings to be read so the frustration can dissolve.

1) it's extremely long and the author has recently said they were almost done (as happened when I was reading the Living With Danger series)

2) it's the last story in a series and hasn't been touched in five years but dammit I want some kind of closure with this character I've gotten attached to

3) I've literally run out of things to read in the genre/pairing I'm in the mood for and I don't feel like going to the library.
