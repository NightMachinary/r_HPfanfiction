  “Master!” he shrieked, “Master, forgive me! Forgive us all!”

  Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.

  “Crucio!”

  The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. ... Let the police come, he thought desperately ... anyone ... anything ...

  Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping.

  “Get up, Avery,” said Voldemort softly. “Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget.

**** I'd lean more toward the whole "guerrilla campaign of violence and terror" thing being a factor.

An old guy with no nose saying that just sounds laughable.

An old guy with no nose who is fully capable of curbstomping everyone in the clearing? Slightly different story there.

Really, quotes like that have mostly to do with a sense of scale; schoolchildren just don't inspire.

*** Yeah you have to be someone who's willing to torture and kill, or at least utterly ruin someone's life, to get away with that.

To be fair though, I'm pretty sure that later in the fic Harry cringes at the memory of it.

Can you say that you've never said anything that was cringey in hindsight?
