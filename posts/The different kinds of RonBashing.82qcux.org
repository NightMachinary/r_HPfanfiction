So, I'm planning to make a fic. For this fic, I need a wide array of different types of Ron!Bashing.

From the most subtle to the most ridiculous types of bashing, if you've seen it, I want to hear about it. Preferably with links (whether the fic is readable or burns your eyes doesn't matter).

Edit(s):

Disclaimer: I don't hate Ron. I'm not planning to bash him. In my fic, however, Ron gets transported to some Ron!Bashing worlds, and I can't resist the chance to do some fanfic commentary.

I'm also curious.

I've read some nice discussions about HP fanfics here over time, let's have one here.

Some questions for you to answer for discussion purposes:\\
-What is the strangest bashing you've read?\\
-What is the subtlest bashing you've read?\\
-What kind of bashing do you dislike the least?\\
-What kind of bashing do you dislike the most? (Personally, I dislike the bashing done in the Red Knight by Violet and Hermione. I get that the point of that bashing is that it's not okay and it succeeded in that extremely well in my opinion. So it had the intended effect on me. I'm not sure whether to congratulate the author or not, but I'll settle for congratulations.)

(I've flaired this as a discussion for now, but it's also a request where needed.)


** There is no limit to Ron bashing. I've seen a fic where he joins Voldemort and begans raping toddlers. One where he literally helps Dumbledore bring the destruction of Earth just so Harry can't have Hermione.

*** As despicable as both are, both are useful for my plans. I'm just wondering about what the people from this subreddit have seen, because try as I might, I won't find more types of bashing than a whole subreddit has found over the years.

Disclaimer: I don't hate Ron, and I'm not planning to bash him actively. I'm just planning to make a fic in which Ron is, at some point, transported to some bashed!Ron worlds, and I can't resist the chance to do some fanfic commentary.

***** Will do!

The intention is to have it be weird and more humourish at the beginning, after which it will slowly get to the actual plot.

I still have to do some more preparation before I start though: It's been ages since I read anything Harry Potter other than fanfics, so I will reread at least one book, for example, to get a better grip on canon!Ron. I also have to plan out the fic a bit more, and, of course, take notes on the bashing which I see while reading fics and the bashing which is mentioned here.

What you described is very close to what I intend to do, but not quite. I'll leave it as a surprise.

You can ask questions if you have any, though.

** Interesting question! Let's see, there's plenty of subtle forms of bashing for Ron. -Exaggerating his love of eating until it's his most notable trait,

-Ron completely obsessed with fame to the extent that that's the only reason he befriended Harry.

-Complete Hatred of Slytherins such that their exclusively called slimy snakes and he'll warn Harry against talking to them.

-There's post-seventh year fics that will often make him a bit of a womaniser with a drinking problem and cheats on Hermione. (Recent thing I just read had that happen and sometime after Hermione breaks up with him, two different (nameless) women appear both pregnant from Ron and- and they agree to a triad relationship somehow. It doesn't explain how he managed that arrangement. It was the strangest thing as it otherwise was a subtly bashing story.)

-Idiot Ron who is terrible at magic and incompetent at basically everything.

-Bullyish Ron who's rude and does name-calling mostly, like he's Malfoy but in Gryffindor.

-Ron who works for a manipulative!Dumbledore and has been pretending to be Harry's friend all along.

-Completely shallow Ron who will appear to make Fleur uncomfortable and probably date an airhead Lavender.

*** Thanks! This will be most helpful! I have read a few of these, I'm sure. It's a good list.

Most of the time, whenever I see one if these subtle bashings, it's often Harry who dismisses Ron absurdly fast.

Just today, I read Broken by Battousai (I'll link fic later), and while the fic is interesting, it doesn't add up how fast everyone accepts Voldemort as their new ruler. The only one who acts realisticly and openly doesn't accept him immediately is Ron, and he gets portrayed as a disloyal friend.

A bit ago, I read Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, which is actually mostly bash-free... except of course for Ron Bashing. In this fic, Harry is just a dick to Ron with no real reason, and it grates, especially because we are supposed to agree with him.

What is your opinion?

**** Yeah, Harry is often quick to dismiss Ron in any story where Ron is being bashed. He's also always portrayed as right for doing so, that's because a bashed Ron is always what he appears to be, he won't have any hidden depths justifying his actions. It's a shame because making Ron interesting, even if he can't get along with Harry for whatever flaws he has, actually tends to make a story more interesting. I haven't read Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived but I wouldn't appreciate that portrayal of Ron. Sadly, even many good fics can't help but demonise Ron.

***** I agree completely with your last post. The sad case with Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived was that Ron was basically Canon Ron.

One instance of a Ron which was really interesting to read, even if it focused only on certain aspects of Ron as a character (in this case, making him a fame loving territorial ruthless kid), was the Ron in Harry Potter: The Last Avatar. (I could be wrong, I haven't read it for a long time, but I remember the Ron being both charismatic and off-putting: a 3D character, even if it wasn't quite Canon Ron.)

In short: Yes, it was technically bashing, but it was the interesting kind.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

Harry froze as his foot landed on the last stair leading to the Gryffindor common room; there, Ron was sitting on the couch and quietly reading the latest issue of Martin Miggs...

~Squeak!~ "You just want to bang Hermione and will turn against her and call her a mudblood the second she's no longer interested in you."

"Uh...Ron?" Harry questioned confusedly, "Why is...what is that?"

~Squeak!~ "You hate 'slimy' Slytherins despite, as above, sharing their views on muggleborns."

Ron looked up, "Oh, hey Harry. Don't mind the dragon...dragonet? It's just a representation of the author."

Harry raised an eyebrow at that last one, "...And, uh, why is it hitting you with a toy hammer and saying that stuff?"

~Squeak!~ "And you're conspiring with Dumbledore to steal all his money and inheritances (Harry's money, I mean)."

Ron shrugged, "I think it's called 'Ron-bashing', or something like that?"

~Squeak!~ "You instantly turn against Harry (but are also against him from the start) when he accidentally reveals he's a Parseltongue."

"Parselmouth." Ron corrected, without looking up, "Parseltongue is the language, Parselmouth is someone who can speak Parseltongue."

The dragonet paused, "Uh, right, that's what I meant," it muttered, before resuming repeatedly bashing Ron over the head with its little hammer.

** I've just finished reading Harry Crow (linkffn(8186071)), and while there is /some/ Ran!bashing, it's not necessarily initiated by Harry. It's because Ron has been raised with certain prejudices and needs to grow up/mature, and eventually does (spoiler, but it's a 700k word fic!) It does focus a lot on his eating habits, which irks me a little, but fits in line with what the author was portraying.

**** Totally understand! It took me several weeks to get through it!

The general TL;DR for Ron's character is that he's immature and lazy and always trusted what the adults have told him, therefore forming his own prejudices based from that i.e. Dumbledore = amazing and unfallable, Slytherins = evil (no leeway) etc.

It takes him a few years, and a suspension/almost expulsion from Hogwarts, but he realises that he needs to work for things that he wants, and grows from there.

** I dislike fics that feature a Ron who expects Hermione to be his "slave" (do the dishes, cook, do the laundry, etc.) because that's his definition of how a woman should be. This is probably an exaggeration of Ron's complaint in the 7th book about the food the trio were eating while they were camping.

Variations of this have Hermione turning into a shade of her former self, Hermione getting divorce, Hermione ending up with Harry who should have been her true love after all.

I have read a fic, though that was the complete opposite of this. Hermione focuses so much on her work and has an affair with Snape while it's Ron who ends up being the house-husband.

His Mother's Son (iulia-linnea.livejournal.com/523403.html)

The subtle bashing here is how Ron isn't Hermione's intellectual equal.

  Laufey never abandoned Loki, he left him in the temple for protection. When Thor and his friends march into Jotunheim Laufey recognizes his son and demands his return. Odin agrees but has plans, and so Loki begins a new life in Jotunheim. Thor wants Loki back, & when they're reunited feelings begin to grow. Will there be peace in the realms, or will Thor be forced to let Loki go?
