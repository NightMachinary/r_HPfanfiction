  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

Well the point of my original (flippant) comment is that, as a reader of much of your work, it feels like the /vast, vast/ majority of purebloods in your world are bigots and support the status quo that keeps non-purebloods subservient to purebloods. Therefore it's pretty safe to say purebloods are the bad guys because pureblood is basically synonymous with bigot.

If that was your intention, cool, you did a great job. But if it wasn't, then consider writing more OC purebloods (beyond Sirius' interchangeable French wife characters) that either join with your protagonists or are shown speaking up against the antagonists, maybe?

************ I don't think that will help if people ignore or dismiss the actual pureblood OCs I did use so far as "not counting". And it also runs the risk of turning the stories into "purebloods fight purebloods for the poor oppressed half-bloods and muggleborns who can't do anything themselves - and that is not a narrative I like.

I focus on the trio and usually Sirius as well anyway, which means good purebloods are the majority already.

With regards to the majority of purebloods supporting the status quo: If they wouldn't support the status quo, muggleborns wouldn't be discriminated against in the first place. So, yes, it was my intention to show that there's a lot of bigotry, albeit not on a violent level, common among purebloods - like racist tendencies are found among many in Europe and the USA. If that weren't the case, people wouldn't drown in the Mediterrannean and wouldn't rot in dirty camps in the USA because we'd have kicked the scumbags doing this out of office long ago.

** I think there's a fic where there is a group of Celtic magic users I think. I can't remember the name though. The magic was sacrificial and had been lost before it had been rediscovered. Wand magic didn't work right half the time.

  Sequel to The Denarian Renegade: Harry, the new and reluctant Knight of the Cross, finds himself fighting against new enemies as he is dragged into conflict. He will have to use all of his power to overcome new obstacles, some more surprising than others.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her.

harry would demand Dumbledore give him training at the end of OOTP but Dumbledore would tell him "you aren't Eminem, you honkey. you'll never know how to rap" and that would be that.
