I'm reading linkffn(Worthy of Magic by Sage Ra), and it has a lovely dynamic. Harry is stupidly broken compared to the other 11 year olds, yet Dumbledore is more than capable of taking him on. McGonagall does magic he can't even comprehend. Hagrid being a giant is very near immune to him. I haven't finished it, but the idea is very solid to me. It feels very genuine almost. I'm certain it is temporary, but the fact that it exists at all is eye opening.

Harry is strong, but that doesn't suddenly make the normally powerful characters around him weak. It's a classic "If Frodo has a light saber, then Sauron gets the Death Star." situation. What stories like this are you aware of? Where yea, the story has a character being strong, but he wouldn't even register as a serious threat to the bigger leagues.

The realization that Harry is only a threat to those who aren't a threat to begin with is a very amusing concept that does loads towards making the story enjoyable.


** I mean.. I feel like that's just how most decent/good powerful Harry fics are. They don't have /stupid/ OP Harry. He's really strong for his age, but he's not pummeling Dumbledore at 11 years old. I can't say I've heard of many even half decent fics where he's capable of that.

Many of these are a something of a threat, but that's because they're older.

*** I've found that the best powerful Harry stories never actually say it. They dance around the topic. They never show Harry displaying his power. At best, there will be a comment about it from another character that is immediately passed over.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** What you mean is a powerful Harry, not an OP Harry. Sure maybe he's OP compared to the students of Hogwarts, but that does not make him OP in the setting of the story, because there are plenty of people who can offer him a challenge. He is powerful, not OP. Please learn the difference, one can be challenged, the other cannot.

**** But he's clearly not. To be overpowered is to not be balanced, what you said is a literal oxymoron. You cannot have a balanced overpowered character, because to be overpowered means he has no equal. That's why it's a powerful Harry story, and not an overpowered Harry story. Just look up the definition of overpowered.

****** Simple. You cannot be overpowered if you can be overpowered. What I mean is if ther are multiple beings in a setting that can beat said overpowered character, than he cannot be overpowered. Powerful, sure. But if someone has more power than him than he's not overpowered. Superman is a good amount of the time overpowered in his stories, because other beings have to use trickery, or underhanded tactics, but Harry has many people in that story that can beat him. Not even only top tier, but most adult wizards can beat him at the point you seem to be referring to. So in every possible way you can think of he's not overpowered. Prove me wrong, go on I dare you to tell me how he's overpowered in that story.

******* Overpowered means your power is over that which would be expected. A two year old who can bench 100 pounds is overpowered while a 25 year old body builder lifting 100 pounds isn't overpowered.

Harry is overpowered because... His has power that you wouldn't expect an eleven year old to have! /Drops mic/

******** Yes, but he's not overpowered in the setting of the story. He is a boy of above average power for his age, but he's not overpowered in terms of the story which makes this a powerful!Harry story, not OP!Harry story. Read your post.

****** Also to be more powerful then should be reasonably expected means he's more powerful not over powered. You say it yourself, he's more powerful not overpowered.

*********** As the creator of this discussion, I maintain the right to dictate that this very casual post on the internet is in no way an intellectual discussion. Your beliefs don't change reality, and before you say it: beliefs do in fact change the definitions of words in a discussion where the definitions haven't been laid down. Just don't respond to salvage whatever dignity you can.

************* The definition is not the arbiter of definitions. It only speaks for common usage. There are words that exist that aren't in dictionaries and words with completely different meanings that the dictionary fails to catch. Does a word not found in the dictionary suddenly lose all meaning because it isn't there? If all dictionaries vanished tomorrow, would language collapse? The answer to both is no.

It saddens me to see someone attempting to be intellectual to fall for such a simple mistake.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.
