Hi!

I'm looking for self-insert as Harry himself or just as male OC (please don't make it an SI as an existing character "Draco maybe be acceptable, but not other characters). Or if there are any reincarnation fics, like someone from other universes like naruto or DB reincarnates in Harry Potter universe.


** I don't have any recommendations, but I'm curious about how audiences know if a character is a self-interest versus just an original character? I've heard the trope referenced a bunch on this Reddit and have always wondered what makes a self-interest apparent.

*** Self-insert is someone, who is from our modern world, who gets to be reborn in Harry Potter universe. OC (Original Character) is a new character which doesn't exist in the original work who is made by the fic author but it is originally a part of Harry Potter universe.

**** Oh so it's literally like “one day I woke up as Harry Potter and had to figure out how to navigate life” and not when Harry Potter is himself but is characterized more by the writer's traits than his canon personality? That's pretty cool; I've never seen that concept.

****** One more Q - do the books usually exist in the self-insert's world, or is it an alternate reality where they exist in the muggle world that has no idea that wizards exist? I'd assume it's the former because that sounds really cool, walking around like, “No fckin way it's Hogwarts!!” Are any of them inserted into a time where they know the end of the series but Harry's timeline is still living it? I'm so intrigued; I'll definitely check some out this weekend.

******* The former. It is being reborn in a completely different world.

***** Yeah, but SIs are usually more like OCs anyway. It's like the ideal version of the writer. Sometimes there isn't any book knowledge, just the personality.

****** Okay, so that's where I get confused. What is the different between that and an OC or an OOC version of a canon character (if they're using a canon character's body)? Is it just because the writer explicitly says that it's a SI? Or is it because someone who was formerly a muggle is suddenly in a wizard's body?

The idea of someone waking up in a wizard's body with knowledge of canon makes sense to me as a trope, but if they don't have that background, then it seems like it's just an OC?

******* An OC is like a character you made up. So a psychopath, someone with social anxiety, anything, as long as it's a character the writer made up and isn't part of canon. An SI is like someone that has the writer's personality. There might be slight changes or big changes due to plot, but basically it is the writer's personality at least at the start. I've read SIs where the writer was born in the HP verse and had no outside knowledge, but reacted the way the writer would have.

******** Hm, I do get it, but I don't see how it would (in the situation where they have no outside knowledge) be more interesting to the reader than just any OC. I get why it's fun for the writer, which is really what matters, but I don't know the writer and would just see an OC. I write second gen, so I create a bunch of OCs to flesh out the world because most of the canon characters are just the Weasley fam (often personality not included), but I'd never consider just putting myself in the world. It's really just an SI (usually the main character, probably) who the writer advertises as being based on their personality? I don't want to be jaded, but to me, that's a gateway to a Mary Sue. I bet lots of people have done it very well though.

EDIT: Thank you for answering this, by the way. I really just am super interested in tropes and hope none of this comes off as harsh. I love people enjoying what they enjoy, and I love understanding why they enjoy that specifically.
