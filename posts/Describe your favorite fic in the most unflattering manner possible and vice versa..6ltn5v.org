There was a lot to enjoy in the series. I especially liked the train and the secret behind how it worked. But the "plucky" protagonist made the story impossible to enjoy. Making the same bad choices time and again. There was a time when she was challenged to a duel in school and she starts to reflect on how she keeps getting into trouble with this sort of thing. I get my hopes up and think she is learning from her mistakes. Nope.

Does he learn in HPB when Dumbledore warns him about all of this? Nope, he still runs after Snape and still gets his ass kicked and was almost killed by several Death Eaters because of his recklessness.

Well, does he learn in DH when the Dark Lord is finally stepping up his game? Nope, once again, he doesn't think things through, he fights a battle that gets everyone killed, runs into a forest on the whim that he has to die to save the Wizarding World (despite not killing the last Horcrux to make sure the job is fully done with his death). It's all reliant on many chances and luck, Voldemort lost due to sheer incompetence, how was he ever considered more powerful and more cunning than Grindelwald?

Alright, c'mon, he must have learned by Cursed Child? He got to being Head of The Aurors somehow. *Nope, think again, buddy. He's still the same Hot Head who only shows maturity for a singular second, and that's when he could have actually saved his parents from being murdered.*

So is at least 90% of all fanfiction. Harry Crow is the second HP fanfiction story I ever read, after the then-incomplete HPMoR. I enjoyed it while I read it, but my tastes have changed in the last few years.

Does it have its flaws? Absolutely yes. However, if that story (or some other story that's widely reviled here) is what gets someone hooked on reading HP fanfiction, then I think that's not bad. If it grows the fandom, and starts someone on a path where they might eventually enjoy some of the widely acclaimed stories here, I can't get /too/ upset about that.

It's not a well-written book and I am thankful that it introduced me to my favorite genre, but I am not going to say I still like it because it's not up to my standards these days. Saying you like something means that you still, at the present, would enjoy reading it again.

On the other hand, if the person said they used to like it or liked it, then that would make sense as it specifies that they enjoyed it in the past and now recognize that the story is a complete shit show.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6991):

A confusing tale about an alcoholic, overpowered, antihero-wannabe, Harry-Dresden-copycat time traveler who uses his knowledge of the future to trick girls into sleeping with him and break into ancient, nonsensical, fairy-tale-knockoff magical realms just to defeat an equally overpowered, stereo-typically-evil dark lord no matter the collateral damage to everyone he comes in contact with and the innocent bystanders within a 100 mile radius.

******* Well, this is describing it as unflattering as possible, and clearly based on reaction everyone aware of it considers it to be at best incest-adjacent. And much as it's played for laughs, Remus literally says "You are raping me right now." At the very least there was no informed consent the first night they encountered each other. Though Remus certainly doesn't get points even with consent for sleeping with a member of the group who made his daughter an orphan. (I love ABC too, but this is fun :). And we both missed on the obvious "robbing people of all their Earthly possessions is wrong, even from assholes")

*** I gave up partway through book 2. I can't pinpoint one particular reason, but it was a combination of the older generation being ineffective despite being in power(okay in book one, not so much in two), yet another high level threat having to be stopped by children, people in love hating each other initially(it was done better than most, but this trope still gets on my nerves), and killing off Mordin Solus in book 1.

Really liked some other parts though, especially the house elves. Each character also felt unique and interesting, and age appropriate.

** 1) Set after GoF. Harry combines with Voldemort's soul after dementor makes him a Partially Kissed Hero. He gets a personally crafted, basilisk-venom-cored, super wand. Then Indy!Harry trains with fem!Hogwarts to become dueling expert. Icy Daphne Greengrass is the focus of his affections but Tracey Davis is interested too, moreso after Harry single handedly stops Luna's bullying with an explosive announcement in the great hall. Some Dimension Travel, bit of Harry/Bellatrix, possibly Harry/Pansy. He watches Tonks (who he's shagged) die. Merlin's portrait's alive and Harry's collected all the founders' portraits which he keeps in the trunk where he lives with his surrogate mother Narcissa Black (previously Malfoy) who worries about him when he goes out on his missions with the Aurors. He's an animagus too.

2) Harry bonds with not only Hermione but with Fleur and Gabrielle too! With that much love no-one can stand in their way.

*** Wow. Good Job on the Merging. You actually managed to make me completely hate one of my favorite stories just from that short summary.

As For the Price of Being Noble...I think Dumbledore actually used the term "overabundance of love" or something similar in one of the first few chapters; as if love was somehow quantifiable and Harry is just so amazing that he has more of it than anyone else.

I wish there were some Veela Bond stories that just turn the whole trope in its head. Harry and Fleur falling in love but then someone saves Fleur's life and now she's bonded to some random guy while Harry and Fleur want to kill themselves. ( I mean this has to happen sometimes right? What happens if a middle-aged married veela gets her life saved by a 10 year old?)

I know there's that short story with Gabby that kind of did something similar but i'd like a novel length story about it.
