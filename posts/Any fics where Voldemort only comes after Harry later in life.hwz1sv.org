Ideally Harry only had a few misadventures at school. Say only chamber of secrets and prisoner of Azkaban? I'm not counting diary as â€˜main Voldemort'.

Would be cool to see a better trained and more well adjusted Harry face down Voldemort. One who perhaps lived with Sirius for a few years and has had a proper girlfriend without being in mortal peril for a solid 7 years.
