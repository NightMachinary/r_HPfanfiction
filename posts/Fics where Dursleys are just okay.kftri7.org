Not canon level abusive, or insanely abusive like in some fics. Not ideal parents like in other fics. Just okayish adoptive parents who still favor their own son and are quite flawed, but actually do basic things like celebrating Harry's birthday. It doesn't have to be main focus of the fic. Yesterday it came to my mind, and now I just want to read AU with this twist for some reason.

#+begin_quote
  A sleeping child with her sister's eyes left in her care forces Petunia to make a choice, hold on to her bitterness and resentment for her sister, or work to make things right with someone who no longer was around to be able to forgive her. As challenging and heartbreaking of a circumstance she was put in, Petunia manages to become a mother to two boys, with some help along the way from another lost and grieving soul.

  Lily and James left Harry a muggle trust fund with a muggleborn trustee. This will impact Harry's childhood, leading to a more grounded Harry going to Hogwarts.This starts in Novemeber 1981, quickly covers Harry's pre-Hogwarts days, and Chp. 3 is when Harry's letter arrives.Anything recognizable belongs to JKR.

  The life of one Petunia Marie Evans had never been easy, and it hadn't been particularly pleasant for a long time either. In another world, one much different than this, Petunia was alone. Jealousy turned into bitterness turned into hatred - and hatred marks the soul like nothing else.This time was different. Petunia found a family, one that cared for her and loved her, when she was on the brink of loosing herself to her anger and it saved not only her life, but Harry's too.

Just wanted to make a note for any readers, that in Very Big Dursley Family, I distinctly remember a pregnant thirteenth year old watching over all the kids, at one point. I also seem to remember an uncomfortable amount of child nudity, or near-nudity.

**** Perhaps, but the story is not pregnant-child oriented (or even lemon), it is more part of the environment where the number of children and mothers is a bit overwhelming. And child nudity (or any nudity) is really culturally given thing ... I have never had a problem with it when I was a child, and I questioned it only when my ten year or so old friend (a girl) went swimming in nude. When I have protested it with my parents, they told me it was OK. We are not Germans, but Germany with FKK beaches is just next door from us.

  What if Dudley wasn't an only child. What if a gift of Lily to her sister, along with the wards protecting Harry resulted lots of children in a household full of love instead of resentment. What if the wards were more powerful the more family that lived under them, What if the protection imparted by Lily to her son, also was imparted to those new magical children

Exactly what you are asking for. The Dursleys are OK. The whole thing is very wholesome and low drama and that's incredibly rare in HP FF.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

**** Good to hear!! When I heard about it, I didn't think the premise "Harry is a polite and thoughtful dragon" would be so good. But it is! It's still being written and Harry is in seventh year at the moment.

You're also only supposed to have one speaker per paragraph. There's also a lot of rough spelling/grammar/word choice mistakes.
