I ask that I want to find one person in the world who would care about the death of Colin Creevey.

This child idolized Harry, and his heart was always with him. He supported him in the Goblet of Fire. He modified these damn badges for Harry to show that he was always for him. He saved him from the tyranny of Snape, sneaking into the room.

He the hell went for him against the whole school and supported Harry when everyone turned away from him. He was a child. As a child, because he always, always believed that Harry was good, that Harry was a hero.

But how did Harry repay him for such loyalty? He treated him like garbage and did not want to talk, and Colin always smiled at him. Hell, he didn't feel anything when Colin died.

He died as a child, never wanting anyone evil and not applying a single dark or deadly spell. And Harry .. it was all the same, and nothing trembled in his callous heart when Oliver and Wood carried him in their arms, like a child. You can only imagine how much grief his brother Dennis suffered, because they always had one heart for two.

I ask, if there is at least one person among you who wants to resurrect Colin Creevey, write to me. I write a fan fiction where Harry feels guilty and sorry for him. And he wants to resurrect. I really need a co-author. Please people, answer me !!

*** Harry was so heartless! When after the battle he recalled the dead, he recalled Fred, Remus and Tonks !! He did not grieve for the child who loved him more than anything else!
