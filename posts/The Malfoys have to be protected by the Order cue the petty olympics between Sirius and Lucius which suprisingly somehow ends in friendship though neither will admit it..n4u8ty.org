** *Before I see comments about how Lucius doesn't act like this, I might need to remind you that we've only seen Lucius in an antagonistic way, so I can hc Lucius as a kid to whatever I want, in this case a prankster because he had a Snape-like teacher when he was younger and this was his only way for revenge.*

Sirius harrumphed indignantly as he walked by the door to Malfoy's room. Stupid blonde pureblood supremacist prick and stupid Voldemort. The blonde ferret just had to go get himself in trouble with Voldemort of all people and seek help from the Order.

And they got the help they didn't deserve!

Fine, if that is the case, then they need to get the punishment they deserve. The plan started hatching in his mind as he sat down for breakfast, and by the time he finished 15 minutes later, Sirius had a foolproof revenge plan, Marauder style.

The plan, of course, didn't go as expected at all. Sirius didn't count on Malfoy somehow predicting his plan by day two.

Nor did he count on the revenge prank that was just not Malfoy's style.

But whatever, if the blonde ponce insists on this, then he will get his payback.

Sirius hummed lightly as he charmed the hair product Malfoy uses to turn his hair bright red before slipping out of the room.

Lucius Malfoy was a prankster, although few people knew that fact.

Of course, the few that did were either dead, in Azkaban, or simply forgot as time passed.

He knew a prank when he saw it, and even though he no longer did such childish behaviors, Sirius Black would be an exception. That annoying blood traitor had somehow set a prank and made him wake up to find all his outfits dyed in Gryffindor colors! Even worse than that, not a single spell he cast would change it back, and he was forced to admit defeat on that day.

But the war was on. Tricks that he haven't used since the days of the worst teacher he ever had was coming back.

Two weeks.

Sirius was pissed, and strangely impressed.

It has been two weeks since he declared the prank war, as he now thought of things. And for two WHOLE weeks, Malfoy has been able to keep up with him.

Yes, himself! Sirius Orion Black, in all his glory, was tying with a bloody Malfoy. Over a prank war!

He glared at the Malfoy door, almost wishing that Lucius wasn't so good at pranks, or even better, would just admit defeat to the brilliant pranking god. Namely one Sirius Black.

As he set up his next prank, Sirius ruthlessly squashed the thought of asking Malfoy about his pranks. That was even worse than admitting defeat, and that was never happening. Ever.

Lucius haven't acted like a teenager in so long. With the role of the Head of Malfoy House and all the social calls he had to attend to, there was simply no time for him to have fun-irritate Black.

But now, as he charmed the bed to turn Black's outfit and hair completely green and silver, Lucius let a semi blissful smile slip onto his face.

Black was going to be asking for defeat and begging for mercy in a week, and he was going to be laughing at his win.

Lucius hummed happily as he went back to his room, only to barely hide a shriek of surprise as the carpet seemed to buck underneath him and launch him onto the bed, also stripping him naked in the process.

Oh this was it, he was bringing his all now.
