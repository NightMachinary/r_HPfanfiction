I'm looking for a story with a female Harry as the main character or one of the main ones. Any story will do, even smut, as long as it isn't horrible.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** linkffn(The Never-ending Road) I really enjoy Harry's character in this one. Also note that while the summary does say that there is future Snape/Harriet, there is currently no romance at this point.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

** Linkao3(future's past by darkseraphina)

Female Harry who time-travels and merges with a previous incarnation. Temper and snarkiness intact. Unique point of departure for time-travel making changes. The entire first chapter is author notes, so skip to chap 2 if you just want story. It does explain the dates being shifted, though, and is kind of a tell-not-show prologue.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

  She may look like her father. Hell she may even have a certain lack in regards to rules, she even got his Quidditch talent. Harianna Potter however inherited more from her mother than just her eyes. Smart, caring and kind attracting the attention of a certain red headed twin. George/ fem Harry

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
