Any Hermione centric fics where she is not friends with Harry and Ron, but also not on the dark side?


** Linkffn(New Blood) mostly friends with Blaise, a ton of other Slytherins, Snape, Cedric, Susan, other Hufflepuffs, Luna and other Ravenclaws, Harry (mostly in the background). Slytherin but not doing anything dark (she's got Tracy for that). Also convinces everyone including Quirrelmort and Tom that she's really on their side.

** linkffn(9238861) has Hermione sorted into Slytherin and making friends with Daphne and Blaise. She does do some questionable things but I think it's made plausible as a development of her canon character.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) she's friends with Harry and Ron but those are less important, she's also friends with a ton of others including the Hogwarts elves. Most importantly she's constantly inventing things.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Hermione's friendship with Ron and Harry takes a hit when bigotry against muggleborns worsens. Then she gets expelled and has to rely on her new muggleborn friends to fight back. Unlike fiendfyre, gemino-cursed Napalm isn't dark, right?

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
