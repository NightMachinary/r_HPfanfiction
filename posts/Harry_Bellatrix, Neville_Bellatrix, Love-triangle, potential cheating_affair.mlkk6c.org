i would like to know, if fics exist that contain Bellatrix being a "normal" person and Harry and Neville are good friends. When they meet her, they grow attractive to her over time, possibly she teases and flirts with them.

I would like if both men sleep with her, but they dont mind sharing, neither does she. However, i also would like if atleast Neville would be in a Relationship or married. No requirement, but i think i think it would give some tension to the Story. Neville is torn between his loving Wife (Hannah) and his atraction and lust for the mysterious and Dark Bellatrix. At one point he gives in and Harry finds out.

How these 3 are connected with each other.....maybe Bella is just a (Noble) civilian (i dont want to eliminate her noble roots here) or she is a effective Auror and the form a Team. Maybe other reasons, i leave that to the fic.

I could imagine a scenario that has Harry and Neville in a built-up tension or conflict about Bella, but she intervenes and declares, that no one "has to be left" as she dont mind to have both Men. Although this scene would just fit, if Both Men arent bond to partners, i think.

â€‹

Well, to make it short: Harry and Neville meet bellatrix and over time find her attractive (possibly Neville more than Harry) and both Men do sleep with her, all 3 know about it and they dont mind sharing. Optionally, Atleast Neville would be married and as mentioned, is torned between both Women.


** this is a great prompt! totally crazy and exactly what I want now lol
