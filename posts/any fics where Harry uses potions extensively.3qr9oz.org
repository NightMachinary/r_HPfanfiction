I got the idea from Runemaster [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster]]

the general idea is fics where harry is really good at potions, and makes good use of that skill.

not slash is prefered


** Interestingly there's a couple LOTR crossovers that look into potion making. Fair warning both are very incomplete.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Harry sacrifices himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest expecting to die. Instead he wakes up in the Third Age of Middle Earth, lost and confused. Realistic crossover with canon Harry. No power-ups, elfling Harry or tenth walker. No slash.

*** Came in to recommend this one, though I was going to specify the caveats that its extremely AU and that harry is harriett, since that could turn some people off despite it being very good.

**** Don't think the harriet part is that big of a turn off, the worst part is that she is way too strong. She has already founded 2 new schools of magic and is only in her third year. If her writer made her a bit weaker and made her rely on her potion skills to even be able to compete in school I think you would've gotten a more intresting take on this story.

***** I don't find either of the things I pointed out to be turn offs, just some people seem to not like those types of changes, so just wanted to point it out incase OP was one of them.

I also don't mind overpowered protagonists so her being so strong doesn't really bother me either. The actual confrontations all still seem to have enough danger and difficulty. But I can see where you are coming from. [[/spoiler][Presumably both riddle and diarymort are at a similar power level though and her achievements make sense with her being lord level power wise combined with how hard she studies imo. I can see that the decision to make her that powerful could be a turn off. I'm more annoyed by her not embracing it and figuring out how to handle the power.]]

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
