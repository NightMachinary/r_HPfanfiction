Where Ron is more then just jealous, or just hungry, or more then just insensitive.

Where Hermione is more then her trusting adults and books.

Where Harry is more then just moody and brooding all the time.

Where Snape isn't just a complete asshole or just a complete angel.

Where Luna is more then her theories and magical creatures but isn't a seer.

Where Dumbledore is more then a manipulative old man.

Et cetra, et cetra. One of the reasons I love the books is because the characters have different feelings and ideas, they feel like real people, in their own world, with their own problems. But so many stories focus on the characters more one note ideals or problems or perfections, and it can be disappointing. Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing). Can be Canon or AU. Anyone can be the main character, can be on ANY site, can have any warnings.

No Weasley bashing.

No OP Harry, no Harem Harry, no Lord Potter. Harry slightly smarter or slightly stronger then in canon, but I'd like for it to be relatively believable.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** This one is more Hermione focused - so it might not fit your criteria, but I love it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt. In it, Hermione is totally badass and so smart. It is complete and has a sequel.

I've been reading this story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]], about Remus Lupin being thrust back in time as a way to understand his character better. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to his characterization. Harry isn't so prominent at first, but later he is more developed. It is a WIP and updated regularly.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.*time travel*

  A re-imagining of Harry's life where he applies himself a little bit more, works a little harder, and gets closer to more people than just Ron and Hermione. Smartish!Harry, Grey!Harry, Multi!Harry, Good!Dumbledore, Draco!Bashing. Adult content later

** This is a new fic I am recently enamored of. It's a gen fic involving Snape and Luna (gen, not romance!) and it's a wonderful Luna characterization. It's a little fluffy, funny, slightly bittersweet and leaves you with good feels.

linkao3(23446936)

This author writes a ton of Snape, and he is very three dimensional. Most of her Snape stuff is Snape/OC romance, which may or may not be something you're into, but I always enjoy her depictions of him. I'd recommend checking out her other stuff. She also has some great fics featuring minor characters, and she has more stuff posted over at HPFanficTalk than she does on AO3 (same pen name; but her big projects are all on AO3). Every characterization I have ever read in any of her work is thoughtful and well-rounded.

  Luna Lovegood is a most curious child. This story was written as part of the 2019 Severus Snape BigBang on Tumblr. In it, authors were asked to write a story starring Severus Snape, and then were paired with artists who created a work inspired by the story. I was very fortunate to be paired with the wonderful Cameron/owlswithfins. You can see her absolutely perfect artwork here: Poppies+

** There's a lot of depth given to various characters in linkffn(Innocent by Marauderlover7), especially Sirius. It's very long, though, and only the first book in a series.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
