It seems pretty widely accepted that JKR sort of /abused/ House Slytherin as "House Evil". I want to go a bit deeper into why it makes very little sense for the House of the ambitious and cunning to follow a mad wannabe dictator/tyrant so devotedly.

Of course there are many different directions for ambition and very different personal goals (maybe someone just wants to be recognized as the best Potion Master [*]), but I'll try to put it into broad categories.

[*] But then, is entering a terrorist organization and possibly becoming a murderer really the best career choice?

1. Ambition to become powerful: This can be either Minister for Magic or some other form of behind the scenes influencer ("Grand Vizier"-type). The underlying thought is that your ideas and ideals get implemented into policy in some form or another. Of course Voldemort himself is the perfect example for this in a very obvious Hammer and Nail kind of way. But why would you devote yourself to him if gaining power is your own ambition? Surely as Voldemort's lackey you would be unable to execute anything but his vision (seems more like Hufflepuff loyalty). Wouldn't it be smarter to oppose him? Purebloods already have relatively strong control over the government and a cunning Slytherin has a good chance of realizing his goals in that regard. Destabilizing the existing government hardly seems helpful. In some ways it makes more sense for Muggleborns to support Voldemort than Purebloods (aside from the fact that Voldemort wants to kill all the Mudbloods of course). The whole idea makes even less sense considering that Voldemort was defeated before... it's not like he's exactly a safe bet.

2. Ambition to become rich: Amassing wealth sometimes relates to power, but some people just grave luxury and high societal status. Clearly a high societal status as a Pureblood is already status quo in Wizarding Britain so the only obstacle would be the accumulation of wealth. I can't possibly imagine how supporting a terorrist organization and possibly being required to funnel moneys into their coffers could help in that regard. Obviously you wouldn't want to support anyone who could destabilize the economy? Unless you are in the arms-industry (which doesn't seem to be a thing in Wizarding Britain), war doesn't seem to be something you would strive for. Where are all the rich businessmen and -women in Slyterhin who are deeply afraid of another war? Who may even foster international business relationships that would be ruined by him? What about those who also deal with the Muggle-world? A savvy person wouldn't ignore that source of income entirely just because of prejudice [as an aside: wouldn't ambitious people be less affected by prejudice? Wouldn't they be more interested in results? Who cares if they are a Muggleborn if they help them achieve their ambitions].

3. Ambition to become prominent, recognized and popular: We see this a little bit in Slughorn. It can be another avenue towards power, but it can also be a goal in itself. It must be pretty neat to be in a respected position like Dumbledore's where everyone looks towards you for guidance, even if you don't hold any political power. Anyway, even here it seems pretty dumb to become a terrorist and dark wizard. Most people seem to despise those. Of course if you have no morals you might be interested in assassinating obstacles (this also goes for ambition 1), but how does the murder and torture of Muggleborns help you there? It seems weird to me that we see no Slytherins who admire Dumbledore for his success. Why would you want to alienate such an influential figure?

Of course in all these cases of ambition "death" is the most obvious hiccup in the realization of your goals. Why join an organization - the Death Eaters - that continually forces you to risk your life (for someone elses' ambitions nonetheless)?

In conclusion: Aside from the Pureblood dogma (a common enemy and ideology can admittedly be helpful to get things done) it makes very little sense that the House of the cunning and ambitious is portrayed as the one most likely to follow Voldemort. There should have been much more opposition from the Slytherin side and it would have made canon much more interesting. Of course Slytherins wouldn't want to defy the Dark Lord openly, but there's so much room for intrigue here, especially by a House in part defined by its guile.

Edit: Lucius Malfoy in particular doesn't seem to make any sense. He's doing extremely well for himself: He's rich and has the minister in his pocket. I mean, I get it, he doesn't want to be murdered by Voldemort for defying him, but he wouldn't actually want him to succeed would he? Wouldn't he secretly want to work against him? The return of the Dark Lord can only make things worse for him... I guess there's only incest to blame for this kind of stupidity.


** The whole idea that purebloods are superiour makes no sense either (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Harry, Hermione, Snape, Lily - most of the exceptionally talented wizards and witches in the series were half-bloods or muggleborns) and yet many Slytherins believed it.

I've got no problem with having a "House Evil" - it's quite common for such "fraternities" or "clubs" to develop such an attitude among their members. Not everone might be on board, but the majority either spreading it, or going along with it? That I can easily see.

*** Do you believe in a way its a self fulfilling thing? From the first book we see that free will and choice has a large part in the sorting. Now I'm not saying that an eleven year old has the same characteristics and personality they will always have but the hat doesn't sort on traits but on wishes. Do have to have a trait to believe you have it? I frequently see comments about how Malfoy doesn't deserve to be Slytherin but he would say he is the definitive Slytherin regardless of where he should go were the Hat to sort him on personality alone.

What I'm asking is do you think that where parent's went etc, the wishes of the children have corrupted the Slytherin house so its full of people who think they belong there and really don't? With the way Slytherin is presented by many its easy to see an us vs them siege mentality forming and being passed down to their children.

The only thing I have to contribute with regards to Slytherin house ideals and Voldemort is cunning ambitious people are often pragmatic. They'd wait and then join the winning side regardless of their views. By all accounts Voldemort was winning before Halloween 81. Its why Harry was so famous, he was a miracle who snatched victory from the jaw's of defeat.

But there wouldn't be a 'side' without his Slytherin supporters. Without them Voldemort is just a (admittedly very strong) lone Dark Wizard. What could he offer them that they don't already have or have a better shot at gaining without subjugating themselves to him (and being branded like a farm-animal)? This is not a rhetorical question... after the defeat of the Dark Lord Lucius Malfoy becomes one of the most respected and influential Wizards. He's an evil bastard, but he could easily become Minister for Magic one day if he plays his cards right (and then he can even persecute all the Muggleborns as much as he wants). Why the fuck would he serve Voldemort? He has nowhere to go but down.

No, the only way it works is if Slytherin is House Evil and the Hat just sorts all the bigots and Dark Wizards into that house, regardless of ambition and cunning. I like your musings on that the Hat sorts them there just because they believe they belong there (clearly Draco Malfoy has neither ambition nor cunning).

***** Its said power is the ultimate aphrodisiac. Tom Riddle was always talented and powerful. We know little for the history of the house before his rise outside of Hagrid's statement of 'There wasn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin." Personally I don't take that as evidence. Some seek power for gaining more power. Tom Riddle had power and was likely to gain more. A small share of a lot is a lot more than everything of nothing. We don't really know enough about the world before Riddle, what allowed him to rise. Nobby Leach or was a muggleborn Minister (1962-8 according to a quick search), its not hard to imagine he might have made moves to remove power from the older families. We don't know what would have happened without Voldemort. Now if you say the Hufflepuffs are all about fairness then they might not protest even if some of them lose power. Gryffindors don't really care, of their sense of Nobility should oppose the unfairness. Ravenclaw I have always considered a bit detached from the comings and goings and wouldn't really care either way. If you took power away Slytherin would oppose you. People dedicate their lives to the pursuit of power all while struggling to define it. It Voldemort gave a clear opposition, a path to more power then some of the more extreme would join him quickly. The more power he gets the more would join.

If there was a muggleborn minister in the sixties and Voldermort emerged late 60s early 70s and the war lasted a decade then without the war we don't know what would have happened. There is evidence that before Voldemort muggleborns had some power. Who knows what Malfoy would have become if Voldemort never gave them a banner to rally around.

Hm yes, maybe. Lots of speculation. But there always seemed to be a very strong Pureblood foundation. Wasn't there a recent Black who was Hogwarts Headmaster? It just seems to me that a politically savvy person like Malfoy could achieve much more from his privileged position - especially if he is morally bankrupt - than by becoming a common brute/solider for some vague idea of a new order in society that may or may not be better for him in the long run.

******* Assuming you were talking about Professor Phineas Nigellus Black he died in 1925 (according to the wiki) and Sirius describes him as the least popular headmaster ever.

We know the Blacks and several others always had pro-pureblood beliefs. We also don't know if the elections in the Wizarding world are open or decided in the Wizengamot which I have seen in several stories. I think Scrimegeour's election was too quick for a true general election but I can't be sure. Either way we have seen that those in power pre Voldemort were willing to work with a muggleborn. Who knows what Malfoy would have become but I think having what might have appeared as a share of certain power (Voldemort crushed all before him other than Dumbledore so it might seem like he was guaranteed victory) would be more attractive than a gamble in a changing world.

Well if it's in any way like the Prime Minister in the UK (or most similar positions in governments across Europe) he is not elected directly.

I'm not so sure about canon... is the Wizengamot elected? Do we know anything about it? Either way, even if there currently is some form of democratic elections, the current state of affairs already appears quite totalitarian. Fudge already seems like he can do whatever the fuck he wants and he's not even being particularly smart about it. I don't want to say "Sure thing", but I see very little - except Dumbledore who is old - that could stand in Malfoys why in a grab for power and then slowly erode any kind of oposition.

Yeah I get it, he hates Muggles, but maybe he'd read a history book for once and see that that's usually how it's done (i.e. it works).

I agree in regards to clubs or fraternities. But they are smaller and can filter their own members. Slytherin is a quarter of the population and it's way too radical for people to go along with it - especially if mindlessly being compliant seems contrary to most ambitions. I can see a House like Gryffindor going along with a radical ideology much easier (in terms of character, of course there's still the problem with quarter of the population)...

***** In other words, anti-muggleborn sentiment is high among purebloods, and Slytherin advertises that it approves of anti-muggleborn sentiment. It has a large population to draw from in perpetuating its status, and the Sorting Hat somehow takes that into account (perhaps, for instance, it sorts people into the house they most desire that won't murder them).

This rather cements its status as a haven for people amenable to Voldemort's politics.

***** Racial prejudice yes...lynchings finding large societal approval? No. Even in Nazi Germany people preferred to remain blissfully ignorant about the realities and even Hitler was less overt about his genocidal tendencies (at least until the later years of his dictatorship). I do not believe he would have been elected if he openly tortured and murdered Jews (this is the kind of person that Slytherin supports, it is on it's face ludicrous).

Edit: this is really off track though... I didn't want to discuss the accuracy of JKRs allegory. It doesn't make sense that the evil is confined to a house that doesn't really fit the bill when you think about it objectively.

With regards to lynchings not finding large society approval, lynchings generally found solid approval - as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States][the wiki article]] shows. (Warning: Drastic Pictures!). in some cases, thousands of people watched a man get tortured to death, and took pictures, even postcards, from the event. And yes, it was often about "teaching the blacks their place".

I have absolutely no problem believing that many purebloods approve of lynchings in a society where slavery is still legal.

******* It's still neither cunning nor ambitious. I assume that most people involved in such lynchings were mostly uneducated... they happened more in rural areas right? Also it carried the veneer of of "justice"... In regards to Harry Potter I found the whole Umbridge Muggleborn registration stuff very plausible, which may come close to something like it.

American history isn't my forte and I want to be careful because it also isn't my cultural heritage, but I think treatment of slaves was pretty complicated and I'm pretty sure that the mainstream still found lynchings... distasteful - at the least? Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'd be interested in contemporary newspaper articles, etc here.

Worst (physical) treatment of slaves usually happened AFAIK away from the public eye (remote cotton farms, etc.). In more populated urban areas it was for the most part constrained to segregation and "blacks knowing their place" in deference to whites.

IMHO it's a very large step from seeing someone as lower caste (like the portrayal of the Malfoys towards Muggleborns) and actually murdering/torturing them. Even if you see them as animals (which I'm not sure is entirely the case), most people wouldn't needlessly murder or torture dogs.

******** Read the article. It was wide-spread. The Southern Democrats in the congress spent decades blocking anti-lynching laws. And the crimes people were lynched for included whistling at a white woman.

A text quoted in the article sums it up nicely: "The photographs stretch our credulity, even numb our minds and senses to the full extent of the horror, but they must be examined if we are to understand how normal men and women could live with, participate in, and defend such atrocities, even reinterpret them so they would not see themselves or be perceived as less than civilized. The men and women who tortured, dismembered, and murdered in this fashion understood perfectly well what they were doing and thought of themselves as perfectly normal human beings. Few had any ethical qualms about their actions. This was not the outburst of crazed men or uncontrolled barbarians but the triumph of a belief system that defined one people as less human than another. For the men and women who composed these mobs, as for those who remained silent and indifferent or who provided scholarly or scientific explanations, this was the highest idealism in the service of their race. One has only to view the self-satisfied expressions on their faces as they posed beneath black people hanging from a rope or next to the charred remains of a Negro who had been burned to death. What is most disturbing about these scenes is the discovery that the perpetrators of the crimes were ordinary people, not so different from ourselves -- merchants, farmers, laborers, machine operators, teachers, doctors, lawyers, policemen, students; they were family men and women, good churchgoing folk who came to believe that keeping black people in their place was nothing less than pest control, a way of combating an epidemic or virus that if not checked would be detrimental to the health and security of the community."

It fits pureblood bigots perfectly. And, with regards to being cunning and ambitious: If society approves of bigotry, many ambitious people will adhere to such bigotry. A number of presidents and other politicians didn't oppose lynchings to keep the Southern Votes, for example.

Rather, I'm saying that, because Rowling consistently chose to portray Slytherins as evil, the obvious message from the story is that Slytherins are evil. We should expect most people who read the stories to associate Slytherin with evil. When we write fanfiction, if we want Slytherin not to be evil, we must explain that it isn't and also explain how a non-evil Slytherin relates to canon Slytherin.

And for a discussion like this, we are trying to retroactively insert justification into a story that doesn't necessarily have it.

Why should it be different with House Slytherin? It is led by a man posing as a Death Eater, who is also a bully and a despicable human being, and no one in the house thought it was a good idea to rein in Draco and Co., not even when they were stupid little firsties.

And no, "They were afraid of his father" doesn't really mean that Slytherin was good - it just means that the odds of the house following blood purity are even higer if they can't even stand up to one family.

Sorry to butt in, but the HJ is actually a good example in regards to something that we talked about earlier. Before the actual takeover the HJ was actually pretty small. Wikipedia mentions about 80k members before 1932. Only after membership became more or less compulsory later it became such a large organization. This just relates to our earlier argument about percentage of radical people.

Of course your point about racism still stands, but anti-semetic attitudes were pretty common place all over Europe in that era. The HJ was AFAIK more focused on encouraging nationalism, national-pride, discipline, etc. Of course ideological purity in regards to racial dogma played a certain role, but for the most part (I think) they wanted to create soldiers, not people who eradicate Jews (which requires a very special psychopath and is still quite ugly for most normal people). If the HJ occasionally went out and murdered or tortured Jews parents would have probably quite outraged. Voldemort though seems to be overt on such a level, which I don't think most would accept.

I'm not quite sure what my overall point about this was, just wanted to mention a few things.

  Hufflepuff doesn't even get a useful metal, they're just Yellow and Black.

This isn't intentional, but it's what I'm working off of.

There's a process to harden steel called case hardening. You add carbon to the steel surface, creating an outer layer of harder metal. In the old days, you'd do this by covering it in charcoal (see where I'm going with this), heating it up, then quenching it like normal. This would transfer some of the carbon to the steel and make it much more durable for some applications. Naturally, we didn't understand why for quite a long time, but we still managed to get it to work.

Also, proper charcoal makes a sort of tinny, metallic sound when struck. If you don't have much in the way of a science education, and 10th century wizards are as far away from a science education as you can get, you might attribute some metallic properties to charcoal.

Depending on how you produce it, crushed charcoal can also be used to fertilize soil. There's soil in the Amazon that's still very fertile, was created intentionally, and one of the primary ingredients was charcoal. If there was anyone in Europe who would have figured that out, it would have been wizards experimenting with odd rituals and such. This would probably look even more like actual magic. Of course, Hufflepuff is connected to growing things in the earth.

Canonically, the colors supposedly represented aspects of the elements of each house (in fact, the black represents soil), and those other three just "happened" to get metals as colors. I don't think that's quite good enough though. As weird as it is, I've basically decided that the black in the house colors was inspired by charcoal.

** The Death Eaters are the equivalent of fascists, white supremacists or if you like, what we currently call the 'Alt-Right.' They were a once niche movement that hijacked the mainstream of 'Slytherin thought' - if you like - when concerns began to arise about muggle-born influence in magical society. You get plenty of rich, influential people backing these sort of movements - why? Because they either genuinely believe in what the movement espouses or because they think they can get even richer from it and use the movement to their advantage - or both. That's Lucius Malfoy in a nutshell. The Nazis never had a problem getting support from Big Business and Rich Capitalists. Now imagine if Hitler was a walking super-wizard that can kill you as soon as look at you with a flick of his hand. Malfoy and others of his ilk - the already rich and influential - get in over their heads and soon it's too late to do anything else but gamble on a Voldemort victory because otherwise they and their families are dead and all their assets are almost certainly going to one Tom Marvolo Riddle.

There's also the fact that Voldemort didn't always present himself as a homicidal maniac. Just look at him in the GOF scene where he returns. He's charming and charismatic - and that's after 13 years stewing in some Albanian forest. At first he would have seemed a radical but still acceptable option for people. And given that Slytherins are impressed by power and talent, the fact that he's also so magically gifted helps. He's essentially a God among Mortals, with everything that implies. And whether he believes in Pureblood supremacy or not, he's using everything in his power to advance that cause. That creates sudden momentum and opportunities for those people who delude themselves into thinking they can exploit it. Again, it's not that unlikely. Look at the current administration in DC.

Even then, look at Voldemort's Death-Eaters. We sometimes get the impression that pretty much all the major Slytherins supported him. But the elder Blacks didn't become Death-Eaters, though they certainly seemed to have cautiously supported his aims. I'm willing to wager that, in actual fact, very few of the older establishment took the mark at all. Look at who Voldemort chooses as his followers - the young and impressionable. He gets them by twisting their minds with a far more radical ideology that nevertheless affirms the beliefs they've latently accepted their entire lives. It's not like we don't have equivalents of /that/ in the real world. He stole the children of the 'Slytherin establishment' and took them as his own. He hijacked Slytherin House, in a nutshell. Slytherin is like a church of religionists that suffers a hostile takeover from fundamentalists.

Which is why one of the thing's that missing from the series that absolutely should have been included was the redemption of Slytherin House. There should have been Slytherins who chose to noticeably resist Voldemort exactly for the reasons highlighted in the op - because in the end it wasn't clever, or cunning, or useful for anyone's ambitions to bow down to a genocidal dictator. Who would look at Voldemort in his dying days and see anything but a ticking time bomb? If I could change one thing about the books, it'd be that.

** I actually wrote about this in one of the chapters of the story I'm currently writing on how the intrinsic 'values' of each house don't really mean anything in the grand scheme of things. As expressed in the books, where you are sorted really depends on the choices that you wish to make as there is tons of crossover between what can be considered the 'traits' of each house. It takes ambition to gain knowledge for example, and sometimes it takes tremendous bravery to loyal being two key examples /pointed out in the text/ (those being Voldemort and Neville). In addition to that, wisdom is the byproduct of hard work for many, and the especially brave also need to have a certain merit of cunning about them. Wisdom could make you act brave in your actions, and ambition could lead you to great loyalty towards those that support your ambitions.

So to me, saying that someone is "ambitious" or "cunning" doesn't really mean anything when those traits automatically will begat more diversified traits. What this is saying is that any fanfic writer who automatically lumps /all/ of one house into only having /X/ trait is being incredibly superficial. So why does JKR get a pass on this in the books? Because they're from the POV of Harry Potter. With few exceptions we see the entire story through his eyes and his worldview. To him, the only Slytherin's he pays attention to feed into "ambition/cunning = evil."

But Harry is not reliable, of course.

It's just such a stupid thought to me. In my opinion Hermione is extremely ambitious (freeing the elves, her academic aspirations, her thrive to keep Harry alive), yet there is absolutely no reason to relate that particular trait to being evil.

For Tom Riddle, his ambition led to him to seek out knowledge in a way that it wouldn't for someone like, say, Hermione. Those base traits are just that, base traits. Something that a person's personality is built on and by themselves are somewhat meaningless.

In real life, someone like Edward Teller was an incredibly smart person, yet his intelligence was buttressed by other traits that led to him considering the use of nuclear weapons as the go to answer for /literally anything./ Yet his base personality trait of intelligence would make him an ideal Ravenclaw. Someone like Curtis Lemay was an incredibly loyal and brave person - but that loyalty and bravery also led to him being a heavy proponent for advocating bombing enemies (to include civilian populations), "back to the stone age."

Neville would fit into Hufflepuff as well as Gryffindor. Luna, who wanted and needed friends so badly, would have also been a good Hufflepuff - she certainly wouldn't have complained about work.

And I maintain that for the ambitious, being a bigot is smart when the society - or the part of it calling the shots - is bigoted.

Nah, the smart thing is to pretend to be a bigot and take the cheap labour that no-one else wants because of their idiotic bigotry (since the difference between Muggleborns and Purebloods is completely made up). Oh and of course you'd treat them as well as possible while maintaining your facade, so they'd be in your debt. You certainly wouldn't believe in the bigotry. Pretty ruthless, but not stupidly evil.

But that only makes sense if the whole regime is already in place. I have no idea why you'd want to make it worse, these kinds of societies don't work very well and are doomed to collapse.

Sure, which totally works with my assumption that Slytherin is House Evil and not House of the Ambitious and Cunning.

Again... what does it mean to "take over"? They give up all their political control under Voldemort, he will not suffer any dissent. Whether you will get rich in such a totalitarian society is highly dubious as well, especially if all you want to rule over gets destroyed in your grab for 'power'. I think North Korea is a particularly great example.

Sure, if you want to eradicate all the Muggleborns Voldemort is your best bet, but he offers nothing else. Sorry for starting another historical meandering, but even Hitler - a maniacal genocidal mass murderer - had more to offer for his followers. Just look at the incredible architecture that people like Speer were able to indulge in because of his regime.
