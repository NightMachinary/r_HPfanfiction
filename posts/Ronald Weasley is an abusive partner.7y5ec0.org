Edit: You can't seriously believe in that conspiracy theory that you just linked. Literally, everything in it is grasping at straws.

Example from the thing you linked:

/"Excellent!" yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it "...Leprechauns!" said Mr. Weasley. "There you go, Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry's hand, for the Omniculars!"Now you've got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!"/

/In GoF Ron is just beginning to show a tendency to expect others to provide easy magical answers to his problems. He also shows a tendency to want to control Harry./

How in the fuck is Ron showing a tendency to control Harry by paying him back with what he thinks is gold? Also, how is he showing a tendency to expect others to provide easy magical answers for him? This post is complete and utter BS.

** Strong case? Hilarious. Those quotes ignored any context and normal human behavior.

** The post you linked is taking lines out of context of the general story and making connections that are tenuous at best to an article on abuse. Furthermore, the majority of the lines you quoted are fairly normal interactions people would have as awkward and moody teenagers madly in love with other awkward teenagers. I mean, have you ever met a teenager in love? They are some of the weirdest fucking souls you will ever come across. I agree with the post above, the article is bullshit.

** This is stupid. Not only are all those examples taken out of context, interpreted in the worst possible way, and as Twoeyedqueen says, ignores normal human behaviour... but it also mischaracterises Hermione by trying to sell her as someone who would let anyone abuse her. Hermione is a lot of things, but she is not a victim.

Really, if I wanted to I could make an equal list to show how HERMIONE is the abusive partner. I could point out all the times she insults and belittles Ron, or her own frequent bursts of jealousy if Ron shows an interest in any other girl, her attempts at manipulating him...

....oh yeah, and let's not forget this scene from DH:

#+begin_quote
  Ron gave a weak, hopeful smile and half-raised his arms. Hermione launched herself forwards and started punching every inch of him that she could reach.

  ‘Ouch -- ow -- gerroff! What the --? Hermione -- OW!'

  You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!'

  She punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shielding his head as Hermione advanced. ‘You -- crawl -- back -- here -- after -- weeks -- and -- weeks -- oh, where's my wand?'

  She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry's hands and he reacted instinctively.

  ‘Protego!'

  The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione: the force of it knocked her backwards on to the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she leapt up again.

  ‘Hermione!' said Harry.

  ‘Calm --'

  ‘I will not calm down!' she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; she looked quite demented. ‘Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!'
#+end_quote

Who's the one hitting who here? Not only hitting but attacking so severely that Harry has to use magic to physically stop her?

It's not even the first time she's deliberately and willfully caused physical harm to Ron. Check this scene from HBP:

#+begin_quote
  Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.
#+end_quote

Again, who's the one getting violent, and who's the one who just stands and takes it? And this article in all seriousness tries to claim that RON would be the abusive one?

See how easy it is to turn a character into a villain by ignoring all context and willfully interpreting everything in the worst possible way?

** You do realise that almost all of those "abuse" criteria can be applied on Hermione? She is jealous when it comes to grades, she is controlling and can't bare that Harry has any secrets, she want Ron and Harry to be perfect, and have the best grades (as long as it isn't as good as hers), she blame other for her mistake, like when she made McGonagall confiscate Harry's broom or when she blamed Ron for his pets "death". She does a great deal of verbal abuse against Ron, and sometimes Harry. Etc... Etc...
