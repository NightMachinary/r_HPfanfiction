A rather disheveled wizard stumbled into the office.

"It's Wonka. Again," he gasped out. "He gave a bunch of muggle children a tour of his factory and even turned one of them into a blueberry!"

***** Not according to The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy: "...each individual Ministry or Council is responsible for hiding the presence of the magical community in their own country. Each Ministry is held responsible for, among other things, the control of magical beasts, curbing public displays of underage magic, and ensuring that magical games and sports are played without risk of discovery."

So either a MACUSA or ICW court would hold trial over the Frizz. The Wizengamot is just Britain's High Court of Law and Parliament. Unless they cought the Magic School Bus activity disregarding The Statue of Secrecy within UK territory they wouldn't have any jurisdiction.

TL;DR Ms Frizzle and her Magic School Bus are somebody else's monkeys in a completely different circus and not Wizengamot's problem.

****** Maybe she did a lesson on Britain's monarchy. The Americans long since gave up trying to prosecute her, but the British wizards are stubborn beyond the point of idiocy with regards to anyone they view as flouting their authority, so when she committed a breach of the Statute of Secrecy on British soil, they apprehended her.

******* Maybe, but I do believe that MoM doesn't care too much for the crown... since the crown would not protect them hence the need for the the Statutes to begin with.

Or it could be that MoM has realize that Ms Frizzle isn't really a Witch, but a Time Lady (dun dun DUN). We all know that the Wizengamot has an even bigger hate boner for The Doctor and Time Lords in general than they did for Harry Potter in 1994...

******** I never suggested the crown was involved. Just that she committed a violation on British soil, so the Wizengamot attempted to come down on her like the wrath of Merlin, and didn't get why the Americans never brought her to heel.

********* Sorry I read it as in the past she had done a lesson on the British Monarchy and now every time she's in the UK the Wizengamot attempts to charge with a new offense.

It would make sense then that the Americans couldn't rein her in if she's not a witch....

********** Which isn't actually too far from what I said. My supposition wasn't that it was that they care about the crown at all, but that they care that she was violating the statute on /British/ soil. I just used the idea of the lesson on the British Monarchy as a reason she might end up violating the Statute of Secrecy within the jurisdiction of the British Ministry of Magic.
