While James and Lily, who aren't seen as normal by the Dursley's, named their son Harry; a normal name.

Kind of has it backwards; huh? I started to really think about the names and stuff, and I just found that really interesting/funny.


** "Dudley" is a classic British name, and that is something I can imagine being important to a xenophobe like Vernon. It fits in with people of his social circle, who name their children "Piers".

What's unforgivable is pairing "Dudley" to the surname "Dursley".

*** Huh, interesting. Learn something new every day!

But yeah, naming him Dudley while his last name is Dursley, is a bit overkill, lol.

***** It definitely had at least one S in it and... it's a name I've never seen anywhere else - which is probably why I assumed it was canon, AKA one of those names fairly common in the UK that I've never seen here in the States. You know, like Dudley.

But it made his initials DUD which... has always cracked me up. Had to make sure the kid knew his name.

... it's probably Dangerverse, it's probably the only fic I've read enough times for something that small to stick with me.

** I think the Dursleys want to be both normal and exceptional at the same time. They want to stand out among their peers (other suburbanites) but they want to be envied, not ostracized. i.e. Petunia refers to "Harry" as a "nasty, common name." So they don't want to be seen as commoners, but they want to fit in to their social circles.

** One of the recurring jokes around Petunia, common in British literature, is that she is an upper-working-class/lower-middle-class snob desperate to be read as ‘posh' but blind to the signals and shibboleths of the middle classes above her, applying the opposite of the upper/upper-middle rules.

Hence, ‘Dudley' and ‘Vernon' as respectable names, but ‘Harry' as nasty and common.

It's the same sort of thing as the Dursleys' obsession with being normal despite them being very clearly abnormal (including in their obsession with normality).

*** I wonder what it says about the Malfoys then, when they picked the name "Draco" for their son. I'm pretty sure his name was the most "out there" among his classmates, even among his pureblood classmates.

Come to think of it, I've read that the way that Lucius is portrayed as throwing money around is inconsistent with how truly wealthy people from truly venerable families behave. Money talks, wealth whispers, and all that jazz. Maybe saddling their kid with such a name is one more sign that the Malfoys are just putting on pretentions of being venerable purebloods?

**** I think Draco was conceived as a character long before his parents.

"Draco" refers to the Dragon Constellation. A dragon or a snake.

"Malfoy" could mean "malicious."

So Draco Malfoy is a malicious dragon or serpent.

***** Euphemia is not as bad a name as Fleamont is though, as it's a real name, meaning "well spoken" in Greek, and is the name of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemia][Saint]] in the three major branches of Christianity. So right now I'm deciding that my headcanon for Euphemia Potter is that she is of Greek origin.
