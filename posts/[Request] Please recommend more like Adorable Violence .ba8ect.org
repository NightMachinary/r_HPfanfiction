Adorable Violence is a romance, slapstick violence story. The main premise is an extremely possessive girlfriend over reacting to others hitting on, or taking up time her boyfriend could be spending with her. The boyfriend spends much of his time trying to get her to calm down in her reactions.

Basically , are there more humorous yandere stories ? Reading the ones with real yandere is horrific as it should be.
