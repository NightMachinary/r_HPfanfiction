** Kekkaishi, where it's canon that plenty of different styles of magic exist and are used simultaneously. We only ever really explore Eastern magic, so Potterverse magic would fit right in, and give consistent challenges in the forms of Ayakashi and the corrupt elements of the Shadow Organization.

Zero no Tsukaima, which is basically a more elemental-focused Harry Potter as it is.

The various Fate/Nasuverse properties, where magic is clearly defined.

** It's a book series, not a cartoon/anime/movie, but the Incarnations of Immortality series. Specifically the first book, On A Pale Horse. I think there's a lot of potential in the idea of 'Death's Tools/Implements.'

I'm facf, I liked the idea so much I wrote a one shot about it! If you don't mind a bit of shameless self promotion, the shorty story I wrote about it is called Quietus Ascends.

** Not obscure: Kim Possible

Obscure(?): The Seventh Tower series. Brief rundown: Fantasy world covered by the Veil, which blocks all sunlight, so the world is frozen over. Nomadic viking tribes roam the icy wastes in sled-boats, hunting and being hunted by fierce monsters. However there is a giant castle on a giant mountain, so tall it pierces the Veil. The people in this castle live in a stratified society (by the colours of the rainbow, red lowest, violet highest), nominally a meritocracy. They have magic gems that can do various light powered spells. They can also travel to another world, the spirit world Aenir, which is full of crazy creatures and beings. It's the type of place where hills get up and wander away, or you have to riddle with a tree to get its fruit. The Castle people bind the beings of Aenir to them, and when they return to the regular world, the Aenir spirit takes the place of their shadow and becomes a shadow creature (light is needed to define them, but too much overwhelms them iirc). The strength and prestige of the bound spirit effects the binder's caste level (for example, the Empress, the highest Violet level, bound a dragon to win the throne).

** Not sure how obscure it should be considered, but I've long thought a full Shadowrun(including Shadowrun's own canonical internal links/crossover with Earthdawn) crossover could work well.

The canon timelines don't have any significant direct conflicts to resolve, and the magic systems are similar enough that you don't have try to merge or explain having two vastly different types of magic.

*** There is an outline of a story out there somewhere that had an older, jaded, court-martialed Johnny Rico being hauled out of prison and teamed with an ancient Harry Potter freshly pulled from Azkaban to fight bugs.

​

It turns out that Tom wasn't quite the idiot of canon and actually made his Horcruxes hard to find. Including the one he affixed to the golden record on Voyager 1.

​

It seems that a Bug patrol found the spacecraft and upon attempting to read the record in search of intelligence against the human empire, ends up with Horcrux-Tom possessing the brain caste.

​

Johnny is pulled from prison due to an advanced prototype Mobile Suit only working effectively for him, and Harry due to being Harry. Neither are too happy about it. The Federal Government slaughtered the Magicals, leaving only Harry because only Tom can kill him (the Feds kept trying, but Harry kept getting better) and Johnny is pissed because of what was allowed to happen to his unit.

​

Don't remember who was working it, but I don't think it ever got past the outline.
