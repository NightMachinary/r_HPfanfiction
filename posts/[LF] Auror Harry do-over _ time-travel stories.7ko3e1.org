So I feel like I've read all the popular ones, and I can't get enough of this genre its my secret pleasure. Although one pet peeve is alot of them are incomplete which is gurr.. Any-whoo hopefully there are still some I haven't read yet. -finger crossed-


** Not sure if it's entirely what you're looking for, but [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][turn]] has Auror Harry being given a glimpse of what could have been, and it's complete.

  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old. It should not surprise anyone that things in Magical Britain immediately become rather strange.

I don't think I'd exactly call it a do-over, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal][/The Dark Lord's Equal/]] is an Auror!Harry time travel back to kick ass and take names fic. It's a lot of fun.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED
