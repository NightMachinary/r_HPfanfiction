Stories where Neville and/or Ron are shown to be capable of some truly impressive feats of magic, or at the very least on par with Harry or Hermione. I liked their portrayal in The Sum of Their Parts a lot, especially when Harry is apprehensive at the thought of being opposed to Neville and Ron is absolutely central to Harry's plans rather than being relegated to sidekick as he often is in other fics. Bonus points for fics that showcase just how much of a leader Neville is during the war or Ron's strategic mind at its best.


** In linkffn(Divided and Entwined) Ron is getting trained by Moody and is about as good as Harry in battle. Neville isn't that badass though.

Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) has Ron, Neville and Ginny fight in the european revolutionary wars while Harry and Hermione stay in Britain as chief warlock and minister.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) has Ron as an undercover spy, not much Neville though.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
