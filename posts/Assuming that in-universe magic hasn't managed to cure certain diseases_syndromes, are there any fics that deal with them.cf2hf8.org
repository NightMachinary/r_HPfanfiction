morbid curiosity more than anything else...

Maybe characters dealing with Down syndrome, or any other kind of genetic disorder. +No, gingers do not count+

In a broader term, I'd like to read fics where magic, while powerful enough is just unable to "fix" some issues, and how the characters deal with it.


** I enjoyed reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11707455/][The Outliers]]. linkao3(11707455)

It's an OC fic set in the 1940s. The main character struggles to help her sister cope with intense anxiety attacks +that cause obscurial-like uncontrollable bursts of magic+ (edit: I misremembered; the uncontrollable magic was in a different fic by the same author). In that time period 'female hysteria' was still considered a viable diagnosis, and St. Mungo's was taking inspiration from a recent Muggle innovation: 'electroshock therapy'. This was considered a promising alternative to the usual regimen of Draught of Peace (which tended to leave patients near catatonic after prolonged use).

  It is 1945 and the staff and students at Hogwarts are anticipating Gellert Grindelwald's rule extending to the UK. Whether they are celebrating or panicking usually depends on their blood status. Usually - but not always.

** I don't know if it is mentioned in anywhere else but in Fantastic Beasts, Newt says that wizards and Muggles have different physiologies. So maybe they don't get "Muggle diseases".

** There's a fic called Succorbentis, if I remember that right, where Harry is dying from a rare magical disease and despite all healers doing their best, nothing can be done, pretty much. It's a Drarry, though, and unfinished if I recall. I thought it was very well written when I read it.
