Wands in Black Clover are seen as weakness.

I want someone incredibly powerful from Harry Potter to get transported to Black Clover and throw that misconception out the window.

Like Dumbledore, Grindelwald, or an actually powerful Harry. They show up, pull out a wand, and absolutely wreck them.

It would be awesome.

Although it would need a lot of fanon magic for it to work. We all know how... not weak, but not exactly strong, canon magic is.

Also, if you haven't seen Black Clover, I highly recommend it!


** Black clover stomps the Harry Potter verse, hell asta could solo the verse in seconds.
