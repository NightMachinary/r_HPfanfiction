I don't know if this exists or not. I hope it does though. I really want some good [[http://i.imgur.com/5J3cK.png][YOU DARE GAZE UPON ME MONGREL?!]] action and I can't get the image of an 11 year old ranting incoherently about rabid dogs when he's asked to wear the sorting hat out of my head.


** I thought this was going [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh][somewhere else entirely]].

*** That's what I was assuming too. I kinda want to see the Assyrian!GiglaPotter more than OP's one. Kind of a bro to Enikdu, but also kind of a jackass hero. So he'd be a proactive Harry Potter, actively trying to get stuff sorted, probably pretty loyal to his buds, but not one to take stuff lightly. Kind of a moody bugger, but who isn't in the hero business?

I'd dump him in /Hufflepuff/ with slight /Gryffindor/ leanings... Probably prefer to stick him in with the puffs though. more buddies. Brings out his better side.

**** Fate/zero and fate/stay night are animes in which mages summon heroes from history/legend to fight for the holy grail. One of the heroes summoned in zero is Gilgamesh, from the epic of Gilgamesh.

** I couldn't read that- Gilgamesh's personality is like nails on a chalkboard! I'm surprised there are 104 Fate/Stay night x Harry Potter crossovers.

** I'm assuming you are not referring to the Messopotamian warlord? Otherwise thatd be quite specific...
