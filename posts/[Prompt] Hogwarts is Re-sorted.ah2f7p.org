It's a fact of life that people change over time. What your personality is like and what you value at eleven could be wildly different than what you act like and value at sixteen, so having one moment at age eleven determine the rest of your schooling fate is a bit silly.

I'd like to see the consequences of the Hogwarts cast being re-sorted after spending a few years in their original house. It's a good chance to throw the characters we know and love into different situations to see how they would react, and it allows for interactions between characters that wouldn't normally spend much time together due to being in different houses. Maybe Hermione ends up in Ravenclaw. How about Ron and Draco both being re-sorted into Hufflepuff together? Maybe Harry is secretly a Slytherin after all, and as a result gets to know his new housemate Daphne "Ice Queen" Greengrass better, falls in love with her, and then goes on to save the world, get the girl, and have two-and-a-half kids. Go wild with your ideas. Your new placements might follow some logical sense, or maybe both the Sorting Hat and your fic are on crack and everybody just gets placed randomly.

The reason for this re-sorting doesn't matter. Maybe this is a regular occurrence that has been happening for ages, maybe the ministry has just passed a decree, maybe a long string of coincidental events has led Dumbledore to instate this policy.


** why is this a prompt? re-sorting stories exist.
