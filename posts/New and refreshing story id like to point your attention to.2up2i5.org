Hi guys,

Id like to point your attention to a new story by Hermione Prime called Father of Lies (Link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10933555/1/Father-of-Lies]] )

Its only got two chapters so far but oh my gosh its so refreshing to read something new! I've been reading fanfiction for quite a while now and so far I haven't come across anyone else who has wrote this kind of fic (if im wrong please link it to me :D!).

Heres the description:

Tom Riddle leads a double life, famous politician by day and Lord Voldemort by night. Harry Potter is about to disrupt his life by convincing the world that he is Tom's mistake of a son, the by-product of one night the young Dark Lord was drunk and sixteen. Thus follows one of the biggest scandals of all time. Oh, Harry is going to enjoy messing things up for Riddle. AU.


** Why would someone want a politician's autograph?

This isn't that great. It's not completely horrible, though.

*** I've got a friend who collects politicians' autographs.

She's kind of sad though, so I guess I see your point.

Maybe politicians are a bigger deal in Wizarding Britain?

** I read the first chapter and was confused. Then I read the second. Didn't help. Is the Tom Riddle /persona/ only 30? Because...otherwise the dates don't line up. Was he, dare I say it, /lying/? The authors notes don't...seem to suggest any intrigue there. And Tom's internal thoughts show him worried what his Death Eaters will think.

The same Death Eaters /Lord Voldemort/ commanded when he killed Harry's parents, at age *55*.

Because Tom Riddle was born in 1926.

This smells like some high school AU bullshit but it isn't listed as a crackfic. Unimpressed, unless there is some sort of masterful turn somewhere, in which case consider me equally positive about the idea.

I'm posting as much in a review, if no one has any points to bring up that I missed.

*edit read sloppy fast the first time through, missed Harry saying to himself it was some sort of time travel. Still doesn't exactly add up.

*** I read it and got the impression that it's a time travel fic. Harry is sent back in time with instructions from Dumbledore.

**** Grraaaahhh, maybe? Some things, like the Skeeter reference, sort of fit that theory. But 4k+ words without any good hints at the payoff seems...bad. Could be alt-dimension, too. Maybe I'll roll with it. Most likely not.

(spends way too much time looking things up even after saying that)

Ah HA! It does have anacronisms. Check this: someone who would be period uses the term [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi][paparazzi]].

#+begin_quote
  The word "paparazzi" is an eponym originating in the 1960 film La Dolce Vita directed by Federico Fellini.
#+end_quote

That person uses it about four years too early, as Riddle says he's exactly 30 making it 1956-57.

In any case, Tom Riddle was never in this position as politician in canon, so it isn't a straightforward history piece. He went from top student, to asking for a Defense position from Dippet, to odd jobs gaining him knowledge power and artifacts, back to Dumbledore this time, on to secret power brokering with Purebloods and Dark creatures, then into the public eye under an assumed name in open insurrection.

There was no legitimate political pitstop, and none of the most relevant inconsistencies have been even acknowledged in this fic. I'm still rather unimpressed. It seems to be playing with comedic ideas, but is listed as a drauma. It /might/ be time travel, but it doesn't say so or introduce any known historic figures in dramatic ways. I'm mostly interested for how stumped I am at what they author is playing at. I'm all for teasing readers, but it seems a bit much.

***** The word paparazzi threw me a bit too. Even if I didn't know its exact background, it just didn't seem right. Maybe because it's also never mentioned in the HP books - I think JKR speaks of reporters and photographers, never paparazzi.

I don't have a problem with Tom Riddle being a politician, its an AU obviously, and in canon he was one of the top students and one of Slughorn's favourites. So it's not completely absurd that he could have been a politician, had he wanted to.

It's only 4000 words so far, and I think that is too short to judge. For now it seems like it's going to be a fun little story.

I can see that. But to me, that's a lot of words in which *not* to try and sell a primary premise and background for a story. It's just someone named Tom not doing canon Voldemort things and someone named Harry not acting /at all/ like Harry Potter.

No mainstream author would dare be this slow, and I think it is bad form for fanfic to abuse the trust it often gets by default like this. Fanfic already has a reputation for being long winded when it gets beyond oneshot stories. Dragging things out like this doesn't help.

******* Yes, I think I know what you mean. Maybe she tries a bit too hard to create suspense. I don't like the slow update rate and short chapters combined with the approach she took. Fanfic authors mostly are no professional writers though, so I think it's not a matter of "daring" but simply of trying out different things and not knowing better.

******** I've been there.

I read it really fast the first time, which is why I almost entirely missed the very critical Harry Internal Monologue moment. Too fast, it seems. But I reread it again and hopefully got a better idea of what it was about.

I left a detailed but supportive review. Hope it helps and they ignore most of it.
