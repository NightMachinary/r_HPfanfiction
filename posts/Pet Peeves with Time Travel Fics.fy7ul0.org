As the title suggests, I want to know what everyone dislikes about time travel fics in particular. I've noticed that many enjoy the first part of most of the fics, but the last part always disappoints. What about it makes it disappointing? What could authors do to make their time travel stories better?


** I usually have problems with the pairing. I find it creepy when a 50 or however years old character travels back and gets together with their future partner when said partner is in their teens. It just rubs me the wrong way.

Another is no one noticing the change in personality and ability of said person.

I once came across a fic in which Hermione tries to time travel and Harry hitches a ride. They both end up in third year. It had an interesting premise of Harry and Hermione being enemies in the future after Hermione left with Ron in DH leaving Harry to literally eat rats to keep alive but was awfully executed. Like Harry trusting Hermione still, helping her, Hermione hating him despite it all. It was really weird. Anyway by the time of Shrieking Shack encounter everyone present but Ron and Pettigrew knew about the two being time travelers and Pettigrew still escaped. What is point of having the leader of the resistance and the greatest bounty hunter back in time if all the events are going to stay the same.

** "Preserving the timeline". If there won't be any changes to the timeline, why bother with time travel at all? If you want to wait until a certain point to make changes, start the story there.

"Adult in a kid's body". Having a time traveller in a child's body palling around with 11 year olds (either to "keep the cover" or for shit and giggles) is creepy, and that's without going into shipping.

"I can't trust anyone, certainly not Dumbledore". Usually, bashing is the only reason Dumbledore isn't allowed to get the advanced knowledge and deal with Voldemort easily.

Because Dumbledore would interrogate you and obliviate the ever loving shit out of you because /he/ doesn't trust that you know what's best. Or not fuck everything up. Or just obliviate you because "You shouldn't mess with time".

Dumbledore may be on the side of good, but he only trusts /his/ plans, is a manipulator at heart , and thinks highly of himself.

-

As for Harry? It also depends on when he traveled back from. Right after the final battle? That harry would be bitter and hate Dumbledore to no end. You know, raising the pig for slaughter? Yeah, if you tell me you wouldn't be mad and bitter about that, I would call you a liar.

You can sure as hell bet that canon Harry would never go back to the Dursleys. Nope. That's another reason Dumbledore wouldn't stand for it.

I do love the potential for 'Parent!Friend' tropes here though - eg. Harry goes off to do something stupid and Hermione approaches it like she's admonishing her children and not her friends.

Shipping at that age is definitely weird though. Don't know if it's weirder when it happens in real life or when it happens in fiction, but either way - weird.

***** Oh, travelling with their actual body could (and most likely would) be better - I'm just saying that it can be amusing despite the creepy.

Overlap it with a more active version of the 'Must preserve the timeline' time travel fics, for example - Hermione travels and decides that, due to the butterfly effect of her even being in the past at all, the only way to prevent any change at all would mean she'd have to kill herself in a way that would leave no trace whatsoever, so she'd be better off working towards maintaining the timeline, meaning she'd try to actively manipulate events and people into the same positions they were before. Because she's Hermione and she can justify it to herself with the fact they were happy and prosperous before, so she's just doing it for their own good. Can't risk a new timeline where something might go wrong, after all. The last run worked, and the people who matter to her lived.

Some growth, some mistakes, some blow-up where Harry and Ron get pissed off at the strange girl trying to be their friend but being awkward and weird as fuck about it, and then she realises her timeline is gone and she'll have to let things change because she can't get it back. Still creepy, but that way the creepy becomes part of the story. Everything's got potential to be a good story, if done right, right? :)

*** I feel like ‘preserving timeline' fics receive much undeserving hate. What if the time-travel was accidental and the future is good? Obviously one wouldn't want to ruin that. The thing I love the most about preserving timeline, however, is MC's moral struggle that comes with the knowledge of people's deaths and having to still let them happen. It's especially nice with time travel to marauders time.

And in another one Arthur died before Ron and Ginny were born. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, after all.

And even if the new future is better, it wouldn't be your future anymore. In quite a few accidental time travel fics MC hopes to find a way back to their time (and often that way is found). Changing something would mean being thrust in the midst of a world you don't know anymore.

***** *Butterfly effect*

In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.

The term, closely associated with the work of Edward Lorenz, is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant butterfly several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his weather model with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.The idea that small causes may have large effects in general and in weather specifically was earlier recognized by French mathematician and engineer Henri Poincaré and American mathematician and philosopher Norbert Wiener.

** Hmm...

Time travel (and dimensional travel) is probably my favorite subgenre of fics, mostly for the disconnect it can give between Harry (or whoever is traveling) and with the time they're in.

However, there are always pet peeves, like you mention! My first one is instant acceptance - all too often, the character who travels doesn't even seem to panic, take some time to consider what happened, etc, and just moves in with gusto down the author's checklist. They never seem to think about any friends that they lost, the future that they knew that's now different, etc - or only for a little bit.

Adult in a kid's body is another big one. While some degree of it is /fine/, the older they get, the less acceptable I think it should be to put it that way - and the more differences in the relationships there should be. A 50 year old Harry would /not/ be able to maintain his relationships like he did as a 12 year old in canon - and anything romantic is a big yikes. A 18 year old, maybe I could see - but anything past that starts to get a bit far. Same as using it for a power fantasy of having all the girls fall over themselves for him.

Trusting people too little or too much is also one I can find jarring - part of the appeal of many of these fics is that, at least for a decent chunk of time, the traveler can only rely on themselves. Revealing their status too quickly can be jarring - but at the same time, completely refusing to reveal what happened to anyone, even their closest friend/allies, is also annoying.

Lack of changes to the timeline is another, of course. Having some justification behind it can make it work.. but it still seems to be avoiding the point of time travel, which is to change the timeline. Particularly when it comes to people the time traveler loves who die or get into heavy pain - doesn't make sense to just cold heartedly let them suffer. This should lead into a butterfly effect.

Oh, and the super OP, offscreenly powerful protagonists are very annoying. That is, when Harry goes back through time equipped with a ton of super powerful and special abilities (eg, phoenix travel) that conveniently get brought up chapters into the story, with the """backstory""" dumped into a few paragraphs of the previous timeline's story. If you're going to make Harry (or whoever) powerful, make it on screen please - or keep it somewhat believable. At least, that's my preference - I prefer to still see struggling and improving from Harry, so one who time travels with a decent level - but still well below Voldemort/Dumbledore - is usually my preference.

Edit - oh, and as to your point about people liking the start, usually there's a lot of great possibilities in time travel, and the start is what the author has most mapped out - or scenes that they most wanted to write. Then, as it goes along, the possibilities narrow down to whatever the plot is - which might be fairly contrived.

** Most of my pet peeves have already been mentioned by other commenters so I won't repeat them.

I'd like to see more dimensional time travels in which time traveler's advance knowledge is not useful or even counterproductive in their new world. That can significantly increase the challenge level and make the story more interesting. Unfortunately, such fics are exceedingly rare. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12972342/1/][A Step to the Right]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/][The Red Knight]], linkffn(12972342;12141684), are the only two I know of, but both are incomplete.

That reminds of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4849382/1/Inverted][Inverted]], linkffn(4849382), IMO megamatt's best fic. In this one, Ariana never died so Dumbledore becomes the big bad, along with the Weasleys and Hermione. Tom, Bellatrix, and Potters are good guys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), could actually be a dimensional time travel too, considering what's happening in its incomplete sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483). Here, Harry time travels to 1975, with INCOMPLETE knowledge about the future. Bellatrix is definitely the most interesting character in both fics.

Speaking of INCOMPLETE future knowledge, it's also a concept that appeals to me. For example, Snape time travel to Marauder Era often comes without knowledge about Horcruxes and their locations, thus raising the challenge level. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]], linkffn(3735743), is such an example.

** The world the time traveler is from is in a total state of disrepair. Maybe the death eaters won. Maybe the good guys won. Either way, so much is lost that the only choice is to time travel. If I read time travel stories, I'm there for the humor. I want to see the protagonist go a bit crazy. Maybe that's why I like "Oh God, Not Again!" so much (It's a good fic, you should read it).

** Violating the established rules of how time travel works within their own story.

Not grasping how time turners work canonically. (Mainly the fact that you can't use them to change events)

The idiotic notion of “time wants to fix itself” to excuse writers not being creative enough to diverge from the main plotline despite the massive changes they make.

Edit: Oh, and a huge one for me personally, sort of related to the last one: When individuals are still born the exact same after the time travel has occurred, when even a mere second's difference in timing or a few millimetres in positioning could completely change a conception, and produce an individual as different from the original as a sibling would be.

** Most of the times the stories (some like Dodging Prison Stealing witches) start really interesting because of their unique take on the time travel. But then the problem becomes to keep this Interest of the reader stable. Most of the times the fanfics are either rushed towards the end or use like seven chapters for something that could use one sentence... that is something that doesn't suit very well with me. I like stories like „Reboot“, „Harry Potter and the shadowed light“ or something like them better. Also the Dumbledore bashing with the not being able to get his knowledge is also a big part that i sometimes don't like. It fits really well if old Dumbles did something that makes him able to be hated but if the only reason is „he tricked me my whole life“ it doesn't really suit the story. Yes, Albus is manipulativ but to make some trickery the only reason isn't good enough for a bashing of a character. So use the death of a soulmate at the indirect hands of Dumbledore to get a good reason for a bashing or something or leave it out completely. Also that whole stuff with Harry having control over like 12 Ancient and Noble Houses and nearly infinite money is all bullshit. Maximum is 3 Houses (Potter, Black and one other idc). That does look good

** I have read many time travel stories, but I'm still looking for the right one. The adult in child's body ones are creepy as a concept. I haven't found one yet with what seems to me a really intelligent and realistic interpretation of how time travel might affect future events.

**** Technically no but I see it most in time travel fics so I equate the two. A specific time travel fix would probably be no one questioning harry knowing advanced magic
