** Of the top of my head, linkffn(Basilisk-Born by Ebenbild). [[/spoiler][His grandfather is a phoenix, his grandmother a basilisk, through his father, Merlin (trust me, that gets explained). And somehow, through his parents James and Lily, he is descendant of a thunderbird, dementor, grim and something else, maybe?]]

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** No need to be so vitrolic against a genre you dislike reading about.

Anyways, I have three recommendations. None I have personally read, but they are in my friend's favorites and she /generally/ has a good taste in fics. I hope one of them suit your tastes.

Linkffn(5490079) and Linkffn(9527368) and Linkffn(4386931)

Edit: Not sure if the two Veela fics have Harry as part creature, but I figured they would be worth it to link anyways.

*** Sorry about the vitriol, but I just spent about an hour sorting through at least a few dozen HarryxTom HarryxDraco HarryxLucius HarryxLV and HarryxBlaise which sometimes had mpreg and sometimes not. They were all trash and it really annoyed me that I wasted my time reading a couple of chapters of each of them to check if they were as bad as the description made them sound.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

  A slightly different look at the veela using only stated facts; such as Fleur being a half veela is assumed but never confirmed in the books. Harry, Hermione and a few others have an educational adventure. As in all of my story's Harry will be happy.
