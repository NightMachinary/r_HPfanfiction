There are stories where Hermione time travel to the past and fell in love with one of the marauders or Severus or Regulus etc. But I can't help but wonder... Is there any story about someone from next generation (it doesn't have to be James Sirius - it could be Teddy or Albus Severus or Scorp?) going back in time and fell in love with Hermione? Preferably with happy ending ;D
