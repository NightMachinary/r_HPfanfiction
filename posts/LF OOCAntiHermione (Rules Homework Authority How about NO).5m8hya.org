I'm looking for a premise similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068][The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House]]. It could be Hermione or any muggleborn witch that takes the place of canon Hermione in the golden trio. It could even be a self insert or OC. What has to be there is innovative thinking and initiative that aren't restricted by the guidelines of books, teachers, rules or general sense of righteousness. A Hermione type of character that is just as brilliant as the original and takes the position of the smart one in Harry's group, but is far more practical and thinks out of the box, her muggle culture actually inspiring her with its works of fiction instead of leaving her ostracized because of a narrow world view of what's right and how the wizarding society has it all wrong.

Just to be clear it can be both an OOC Hermione or an SI or OC that takes her place.


** I don't have a recommendation unfortunately, but I will see if I can find something.

Until I do, I am trying to get a better image of what you are requesting. So essentially Book Hermione who is more inspired by fantasy then she was normally? Hermione barely paid attention to the rules in the series, I can barely think of a time when she cared that much about them outside of Book 1.

Are you looking for a parody Hermione substitute that is the complete opposite of Book Hermione? Anti-Authority, doesn't care about homework, and then when the going gets tough folds and conforms?

I am trying to avoid Mary-sue suggestions that you see often with Harry goes to America tropes. Where he gets an american girlfriend who teaches him about how he is controlled by the man, and how to dress emo.

*** I'm aware she broke the rules after she grouped up with Ron and Harry. But she tried to stop them going to the midnight duel and her argument was loss of points and getting expelled. Unfortunately in fanfiction the bossy attitude and respect for authority gets blown out of proportion even if Hermione breaks out of that mold when she covers for Harry and Ron during the troll incident. But while she does constantly break the rules she still is guided by a strong moral compass on what's right (S.P.E.W. , Buckbeek and Harry's trial), so in a way her own beliefs and mindset of what's allowed hold her back.

What I'm looking for is a Hermione or another muggleborn that substitutes in her place (as in Hermione doesn't exist or her core character is different) that is raised in such circumstances that she is skeptical of everything she reads instead of quoting it as fact (Hogwarts a History), doesn't trust in authority figures so easily (Lockheart), is even more daring than the original Hermione (more cases such as deciding to brew polyjuice, abusing the time turner instead of exhausting herself to abide by the rules), doesn't care about house elves that aren't even abused, that doesn't get jealous when Harry gets to have the H/B-Prince book and doesn't care if Ron is snogging Lavender, that views homework and exams as a necessity not a top priority (more cases of learning to use Essence of Dittany and the Undetectable Extension Charm, useful magic instead of Lockheart's favorite color).

Place yourself as a muggleborn in her position and with her talents. Canon Hermione has the drive and talent to be great, but when there aren't any life threatening events her focus is on putting so much effort into pointless things like S.P.E.W., color coded schedules and Ron, that she herself limits her own potential by wasting her time. She didn't even get to go in the CoS until they needed a basilisk fang for the horcrux.

This is getting far too detailed.

**** Beautiful!

Describes all my gripes with canon Hermione (ok: Not all, but most! There's still the fact that this intelligent independent woman thinks Ron would make a great husband...sorry, but NO WAY!) and shows how she (or somebody like her!) could be truly great in a world of magic (that's one of the things about Hogwarts: You get trained in certain skills in class, but others aren't actually taught like say warding or curse breaking, so I guess that self-study is the only way to get those skills!)...it's what I think the current generation of wizards in the HP-Books lack: Ingenuity and the drive to learn outside of class stuff (the only people who do a little more are Hermione - so she can show off in class - and Neville who just loves his plants!)...the marauders are a great example of this (sure they didn't use what they learned wisely but at least they learned extra stuff and even made a great magical artifact: The Marauders Map!)

** I don't have anything that matches this, but if out of character Hermione is what you desire, linkffn(Wit of a Raven) will piss you off (because it's abandoned).

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

** Black Knight, Hermione is swapped with 'Valeria' a far more self interested character.

On ff.net you can't find the full version, it is on Spacebattles and still a WIP

** The Brightest Witch series isn't actually an Anti!Hermione, more of a Hermione character with a different set of morals.

Hermione is different/more awesome fics:

Linkffn(the arithmancer) Hermione thinks way out of the box and is naturally skilled and works hard at Arithmancy/math. In the sequel she has multiple disagreements with Dumbledore about morality and she is inspired by her muggleborn background and muggle science (especially chemistry).

Linkffn(Hermione granger and the perfectly reasonable explanation) Hermione doesn't think she can rely on anyone else for help with her maybe-split personality. Sort of a mystery fic. She's a brilliant 11-year-old in it, and I'm trying not to spoil it.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr
