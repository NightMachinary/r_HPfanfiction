Something good to read and maybe review. Interesting plot. I prefer stuff set in canon or singe point of divergence or interesting what if premises but without a bunch of people OCC. No bashing. Based on that I usually read canon pairings, but can take others if it's a valid what-if scenario (except Snape/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, Harry/Hermione.... because... come on!).

I am not against romance but hope to have more to the plot than that. It's valid if it's a lovepotion or romanticspell thingy that is not an isolated sphere of romance and actually interacts with Voldemort and the main plot. (Just no Dark!Someone... or OP guys please)

I am not asking for the best written masterpieces in the world, but somewhat decent writing is appreciated. Can be a thing you recommend or a fic of yours. I am open to WIP.

â€‹

Edit: I'm open to funny stories and cracks. OPs and darkharrys and green orbs and pet snakes are valid in cracks.


** If you're willing, I'd love for you to read and hopefully review my WIP. It's my best yet, but it has limited traffic compared to my older, less polished fics :\

  Fueled by curiosity and tempted by power, Iris Potter delves into magic far older and sinister than the kind they teach at Hogwarts. When she stumbles into a world filled with dark gods and primordial entities, she realizes that she's gambling with so much more than just her life. Eventually powerful Fem!Harry. Fifth Year AU.

** Hey! My fic focuses an OC, but is as canon-compliant as I could make it (I feel the same way as you do about divergences!). It's also romance-but-with-plot. If you'd like to check it out, it's here:

  The epic tale of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, from their first meeting until their happily ever after.A young werewolf who hasn't experienced human touch for six years meets a young pure-blood who's never known how it feels to be loved. The story follows Remus and Sirius through Hogwarts and beyond. Slightly AU in the beginning (mainly Remus believing he can infect people through skin contact), but goes major AU after the events of Halloween 1981.

*** Honestly, I've never been a fan of Sirius/Remus thing. Not because of gay reasons, but because of canon reasons. (I mean there's Tonks, and Sirius had bikini girls in his room, I think it is more likely that they weren't gay... ) Thanks either way. I'll see if I can bring myself to give it a look once I go through my current read list.

**** No worries. If it's not to your taste then it's not to your taste. I'm going to argue your points though, in this story Remus is bi (which explains Tonks), and Sirius has to hide that he's gay from his family so puts the posters up to piss off his mum while also maintaining his cover. :)

** This might be a bit of a stretch in regards to how much canon-divergence you want, but I'll go ahead and drop my own fic down below. The main divergence would be a different upbringing for Harry (a magical one), along with many other nuances that come into play later on.

Anyhow, I'll let you be the judge of its quality:

*** Harry raised by magical folk? It's a big change but you say is canon divergence? Was it canon up to 1981?

I'll put it in my read list either way. Thnx. Will give it a look and see how it goes.

To answer some of your questions;

Harry is adopted, yes, though his parents are still alive after the attack. I'd say the canon divergence begins in 1979 (or 1999, considering I'm using a shifted timeline) with the birth of Harry's older sister. Everything before that should be canon or canon-compliant.

Cheers!
