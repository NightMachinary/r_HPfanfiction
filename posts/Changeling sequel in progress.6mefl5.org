** As someone who is a fan of both H/G fics and the Changeling, I'm both really excited and nervous for this sequel. The Changeling was fantastic, but the epilogue's brief mention of the pair as a couple left me worried that the sequel would really put them through the ringer. I could absolutely see Annerb breaking them up in some awful angsty way and just never getting them back together.

**** Hate to say it since overall the story was great, but I agree. Much like the actual Harry Potter epilogue skipped over some really juicy storylines, so do The Changeling. Bringing it back to Harry and Ginny, it left me really confused as to the nature of their relationship, especially considering she definitively got them together in the chapter before.

***** I would hope that given that this is starting supposedly where the last one left off, as after the war would be year 7, we could get more information on those hangers.

I would say that her relationship with Harry wasn't important to the whole story so I can see why there wasn't anything given to it at the end. Was it the best, possibly not, but I understand the choice.

I for one look forward to my redheaded overlord once more.

****** That's a true point, that the story really wasn't Harry/Ginny. But it definitely went strongly in that direction at a certain point. And I've always said that the big story post-battle is Harry's relationship with Ginny. Be interesting to see it with Ginny as a slytherin.

***** I'll argue the other side of this, which Tinyozora is also arguing below. Nothing in the epilogue left me at all confused about the relationship, honestly - fit with the story as far as I'm concerned. It's not a H/G fic at all. Yes, that relationship exists in the story, but it's not just a lesser part; it's really not particularly relevant at all. They haven't really /built/ a relationship yet in the way that H/G fics normally do. Based on the description, feels like that's what this is about - which thrills me because Changeling Ginny's relationship with Harry was barely explored in the fic.

Knowing annerb's other writing I would be really surprised if this comes to pass... Always a possibility, I guess.

****** I agree H/G is a relatively small part of the story. I guess the way I read it, annerb was building them up, with the culmination of them actually getting together. I think this is an important development in Ginny's story. Up until then there is this difficult divide between Ginny and her family, as well as the people we as fans of Harry Potter have long identified with in part because the story is so Gryyindor-centric. She is a Slytherin, and perhaps even her efforts in the war don't truly change this dynamic. But being with Harry could have implications beyond just being with him.

As far as the epilogue's references to them fitting/not fitting with the story, you are right that it is just a minor reference and that does fit. My point is simply that it was left ambiguous as to what they are. Considering that Harry is a small but important part to the overall story, and them getting together can be viewed as part of the climax of the story, it was a little too ambiguous.

And just confusing. He goes off with Ron and Hermione to find the Grangers, and Ginny says that she might actually believe he will come back. Is this really expected to be an adventure he wouldn't come back from? It just confused me is all.

******* I guess here's the thing, you see they getting together as part of the culmination/climax of the story, and I see it as an almost irrelevant sidecar to the story.

And please understand I'm a H/G shipper and am not saying that because I'm not interested in that, I'm saying that because I just didn't really feel like any meaningful part of the story was annerb building that relationship up.

Either way, irrelevant quibbles. I agree it's left ambiguous but I actually prefer that know that we know there's a sequel coming. More fertile ground for exploration :)

******** I half agree with you regarding its relevance compared to the bigger themes going on. I do think it is relevant and an important part of her development. Ginny's relationship with the other boy was mostly irrelevant, but I have to imagine her thing with Harry is more important. I always saw the Changeling partly as a re-tell of the original series, but from her POV and with her in Slytherin. Based on this, the relationship with Harry /is/ important. But like the original series, it was brought to light very late in the overall story and took a back seat to the bigger story at hand.

But my big point as it relates to the sequel is I think, now that the war is over, that their relationship would take a much larger role in a potential story. Much like, if Rowling chose to write something set right after the battle, then the relationship would play a much larger role.

********** Me too! But it's also why I'm nervous. I have some pet peeves about fics that will make me not read them, even if I admit they are objectively good. I could easily see annerb making some choices, based on the epilogue and your astute observations about the real point of the Changeling, that would turn me off to the story.

** That should be fun.

For those who haven't read it yet, seriously go read The Changeling linkffn(6919395). It's a very good story which I think does a great job of personifying Slytherins and showing what their strengths could possibly be.

**** It's a canon rehash told from the PoV of Slytherin Ginny. The characterization is good, of Ginny and as a whole, but the story telling is not.

It's definitely worth reading.

**** Sure. So it starts off right at her sorting and she gets popped into Slytherin. And the way it starts out, it's really shorter, a more concise story with little detail. I think the author was just fleshing out this basic idea of Ginny in Slytherin, so there is not a lot of detail for her Year One, which is obviously a huge year because of the Diary. Starting in her second year, it really fleshes out her relationships with her fellow housemates, how being in Slytherin has certainly affected her relationship with her family, especially Ron. As predicted, she's a bit of an outsider to her house because she's a Weasley and to the rest of the school because she's a Slytherin. It keeps going like that and the largest part of the story is her Sixth Year, which is broken out into 5 big chapters.

Don't want to ruin too much but it's just a much different Ginny, and it does a good job highlighting how Ginny would grow up to be different if she had been put into Slytherin, and also how her being in Slytherin would affect the others in the story.

Edit: and I just love the detail it goes into regarding how the Slytherin house operates and its traditions and how its members view themselves.
