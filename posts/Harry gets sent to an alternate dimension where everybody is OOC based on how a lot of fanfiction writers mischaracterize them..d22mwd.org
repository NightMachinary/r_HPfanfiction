Harry is terrified at how everyone is acting:

Hermione looks way better than she did before and she is this perfect Mary Sue who is somehow still extremely insecure about herself.

Ron becomes this huge, jealous cunt to Harry out of nowhere. Harry is very confused.

Ginny is walking around the castle with a two-piece bikini and is kissing every guy she sees.

Draco smirks a lot now apparently and everyone secretly fancies him. Also, his magical prowess becomes on par with Harry's and is now suave, not whiny.

Luna is Luna Plus.

Sirius is suddenly very popular amongst the women around his age. They're protesting to pardon him for his crimes because they remembered how good of a shag he was.

Dumbledore is more “DID YOU PUT YOR NEYM IN DA GOBLET OF FIYA??” rather than “he said calmly”

Fred and George can't formulate a sentence without alternating words with each other.

Harry is the heir to hundreds of old houses and his real name turns out to be Hadrian.

etc

Of course, these are just one of the common ways people mischaracterize these characters.


** And Snape is all so loving and such a good person who can do no harm. He's also fair, just, and such an angel, really...

*** This is officially canon, as of Cursed Child.

*ACT III, SCENE IX*

#+begin_quote
  *SNAPE looks at him, every inch a hero, he softly smiles.*

  *SNAPE:* Tell Albus --- tell Albus Severus --- I'm proud he carries my name. Now go. Go.
#+end_quote

.

And for some reason, he gets weirdly flirty with Professor Hermione from an alternate universe. What the fuck, the more I re-read, the worse it gets. I guess Snamione is canon, too.

*ACT II SCENE VII*

#+begin_quote
  *HERMIONE:* And --- Snape? What does Snape do in this other world?

  *SNAPE:* I'm dead, presumably.

  *HERMIONE:* I'm sorry, Severus.

  *SNAPE looks at her, and then swallows the pain. He indicates RON with a flick of his head.*

  *SNAPE:* Well, at least I'm not married to him.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  *SNAPE:* Sometimes costs are made to be borne.

  *The two look at each other, SNAPE nods, HERMIONE nods back, SNAPE's face crumbles slightly.*

  *SNAPE:* I didn't just quote Dumbledore, did I?

  *HERMIONE (with a smile):* No, I'm pretty sure that's pure Severus Snape.

You have a massive harem due to your inheritance that you need to produce heirs with, but you're /also/ Draco's destined Veela-bonded mate, and he'll die if you ever have sex with someone else. Both are binding magical contracts, and if Draco dies, that counts as murder. So, basically, your choices are to lose your magic and go back to the Dursleys, or go directly to Azkaban forever."

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

“Er,” Harry said, furtively examining the twins before him, “You could always try the goblins, I hear in this world if you say ‘please' and ‘thank you' they'll be falling over themselves to help you out. They have some crazy powerful goblin magic that can do pretty much anything that they never used to conquer the wizardinh world, for some reason. Plus you get a complementary ‘Heir of the Founders' house ring and compulsory long-winded explanation of wizard marriage law that nobody talks about anywhere else.”

I could see him getting there maybe, but decades out at least), but he does have some impressive magical feats like his fending off dozens of Dementors(not sure what the average adult wizard can do, but it certaintly seems impressive), and I remember reading about Fred & George adding shield charms to hats, because the average wizard/witch is crap at it.

******* How? I'll give you the Animagus transformation, but that's on a similar level to a bunch of teenagers learning the Patronus charm, and let's be honest, the stuff that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to pull on the Horcrux hunt was damn impressive for underage wizards. Also there was Hermione having enough skill to brew the Polyjuice potion in her second year. I mean looking at their skills, they picked them up due to circumstance, I wouldn't call one generation more skilled than the other, unless you can back up your reasoning?

What average wizard survives Voldemort that many times, kills a Basilisk, chases away a horde of Dementors, competes and survives the Triwizard tournament at 14, trained people in DADA that are older, teaches them the Patronas, one of the hardest spells to master, fights against fully trained wizards and lives long enough for support to arrive.

If Harry is average, what the hell is every one else? Do you really think Harry is at the same level as Lavender, Nott, McMillan or Boot?

So when the plot demands it he's talented and driven enough to learn the Patronus Charm at age 13 and drive off 100 dementors when most adults can't cast it, and the rest of the time he's average and somewhat lazy in his studies and magic-usage.

****** I can see him being lazy up until 3rd year. That's when he learns the Patronus because he's highly motivated. A post-Newt level charm most adult wizards can't cast. The next year he's entered into the Tournament, and clearly starts learning post fourth-year spells, then he's involved in Voldemort's necromantic ritual. Fifth year he starts the DA and teaches other students Defense, including the Patronus. Then he has the fight in the DoM and sees how outclassed he is in terms of Dumbledore and Voldemort, Sirius ends up dead, everyone else ends up wounded, and he's almost possessed by Voldemort.

All of this provides a shit ton of motivation, and he's shown to not be lazy when properly motivated. Yet we don't see anything significant in regards to him really dedicating himself to be a more powerful or skillful wizard. He just seems pretty average with a few exceptions.
