Either Dumbledore realised Harry would have bad vision if he kept his current eyes and needed to see better to stand a chance against Voldemort, the Killing curse damaged his eyes, or Harry awoke the Mangekyou Sharingan and he took Lily's eyes to get the Eternal Light, whatever reason, but a Magical Eyetransplant occurs, and what the Wizarding public don't know is that when they tell Harry "You have your Mother's eyes" it turns out he actually does, literally. (A more wild way for Harry to not have glasses than "Random Eye correcting magic!" or "Magical Contact Lenses")


** "You look just like your father, but you have your mother's eyes."

"Thanks! His skin is a lot more comfortable than my own was. But, how did you know I keep mum's eyes in my pocket?"

** "You have to /mean/ it, boy, you have to truly hate a person for it to work, and you Harry Potter, lacks hatred"

Harry looked at Bellatrix, still on the ground laughing at his pitiful attempt at the torture curse. He looked at her, and with the memory of Sirius on his mind, the green of his eyes bled crimson. The same crimson he saw every time a dementor came near, but not the same one as Voldermort's, no this was the comforting one of his mother's and Harry truly inherited his mother's eyes

Bellatrix frowned at it.

"Amaterasu" and then she burned.
