So oc here is a muggleborn, but with her friends she successfully spreads the rumor about her being a half blood. She's a budding alchemist and is later offered to study under Flamel by flitwick and dumbledore. Reluctantly gets involved in the war later on if I remember correctly. I think it was titled “Axiom” or “Axioms”, but I think the author moved it from ff.net, so if anyone know where I can find it again, I'll be grateful. Thank you!!


** From what I can see, it was deleted off of FFN. [[https://Fanfiction.ws][Fanfiction.ws]] still has it but I don't know if it is fully available. [[https://www.fanfiction.ws/s/13431577/1/Axioms][Axioms by hayatin]]

*** I am not sure if this the fic you are looking for. If it is, the author seems to be moving to ao3, but I can't find any sign of the story on there.
