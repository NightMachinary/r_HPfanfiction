** AO3 is good for slash. You can search for m/m or certain pairings. If you want smut, just select Mature and above fics.

** For PWP (or at least very little plot) here are some recs:

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/388303][The Ties that Bind Us]] - A really well written 8th year smut fic where Draco and Harry are accidentally bound together by ropes. There was enough plot and character development to keep it really interesting. For what it is (porn with a little plot) it is awesome. This is probably my favorite pwp of all time.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2234118][The Critiquer]] is a PWP with a little bit of plot still. Draco is a cock critiquer for a magazine(?) and Harry sends his in. The premise is dumb but the smut was good and the Harry and Draco in this were funny and cute.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3703509][The Residue of Design]] - a well done PWP.
- [Big Dick Come Quick]() - a suuuuper long Drarry PWP. There really is barely any plot in this at all and for the length (over 100K words!) I gave it up after a few chapters. But the smut it great.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/106154][Draco Malfoy is NOT Attractive]]- 8th year PWP. The first part is from Harry's POV in the quidditch locker rooms and the second is from Dracos POV in the dorms. It's well written and has great nsfw artwork in the second part.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/196512][The Page Eleven Wars]]- Well written Drarry PWP
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6668308][Higher and Higher (Temptation)]] - This is a pseudo bdsm Harry/Draco where Harry accidentally puts on a collar that gives him pleasure when he follows Draco's orders. It's pretty well written and good smut with some plot.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1389856][In the Interest of Interhouse Cooperation]] - basically a room of requirement traps Draco and Harry until they hook up fic.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/70003][Don't Think Twice]] - Harry accidentally sees Draco in the prefects bathroom and they start a secret fuck-buddy relationship. An 8th year PWP that is well written and actually has a little bit of plot. For a smutty fic without substance, this series is really good.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/28842][The Enemy Series]] - this series is some really hot 8th year drinking game debauchery.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/392041][Who Shagged Harry Potter]] - 8th year fic with really good smut.

** Assuming you want a good plot with your smut, here are my recommendations:

- Both [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8185892][Owned]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/714361][Cambiare Podentes]] by Jordan Grant are great. CP is Snarry and Owned is Drarry and both are incredibly long and incredibly well done magical slavery fics. CP is the better of the two imo though.
- [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewuser.php?uid=53][If You Are Prepared Series]] is another long Snarry series with a lot of ridiculously good smut. Snape feels really in-character (and a lot is told from his first-person POV), but the downside is that Harry does not feel that in-character when you consider the later books (this was written pre-OOTP).
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2780708][Another Mask Behind You]] is a Drarry where Harry hires an escort service and it is Draco using polyjuice/a glamour. The premise sounds dumb but this fic is actually really good - the sex is really hot and the writing is great.
- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5762449/1/It-s-Not-A-Love-Potion][It's Not a Love Potion]] is a "potions accident" fic done a little differently than i've seen before. The basic premise is that Draco gets hit with a lust potion and he has to touch (kiss etc.) Harry every day until the antidote can be brewed. Harry, being a nice guy, goes along with it (with some conditions) but eventually starts to catch feelings.
- [[http://remusxsirius.livejournal.com/3156196.html][It Was Only a Kiss]] is a Remus/Sirius get-together fic that starts off with Sirius and Remus getting drunk and talking about what it would be like to kiss another guy and then just spirals from there.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2779298][Once Bitten]] - a rare James/Sirius fic. This was angsty, had a good slow build, and the smut was great.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/100820][It Started in the Shower]] - this fic begins with some seriously dirty bdsm/non-con Drarry PWP but takes a turn part way through and has some really interesting plot.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3178065][Right Hand Red]] - 8th year fic with Drinking games and Harry and Draco get dared to kiss and things start escalating from there. It is really well done and the writing is great.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/42058][The Potter Malfoy Problem]] - a troupy fic where the Room of Requirement keeps forcing Harry and Draco together and not letting them leave until they hug, kiss etc. But this fic is really really well done. There is a believable build up to the smut and it is really angsty and hot.

  "Now, lust potions develop feelings of desire in the taker without the affection that a love potion gives, so Malfoy, you will find that you continue to see Potter as the insufferable twit that he is." Slash. Not HBP/DH compliant.

  The room of requirement's gone mad --- at least, that's what Harry thinks. There's no way that Draco Malfoy 'requires' him, of all people, but why does it keep dragging Harry there like he's some kind of furniture, every time Malfoy enters it? Throw in Pansy the pervert and a clipboard-wielding Hermione, and things can only go from bad to worse. And that's not even mentioning the pirates . . .

  Draco is a high-end prostitute who hides his identity. Harry unknowingly hires him. And then there is porn, questions about identity, domestic bliss, more porn, and truth as seen through a web of lies. (And then more porn. Seriously, if you don't want sex scene after sex scene you probably shouldn't read this. And please read the warnings.)

  Harry felt Malfoy's breath on his lips as they came together over the bottle, hands firmly planted on the floor as though they each needed their familiar soil, refusing to cross into enemy territory.   Except that Malfoy no longer felt like his enemy.   Malfoy felt inevitable.

  A new prophecy comes to light, one that promises death for Harry Potter and enslavement for the wizarding world, unless Harry himself consents to being sexually enslaved--irrevocably and for life--to Severus Snape.

  Sirius's feelings for James were wrong, so wrong, and they only got worse when James started ambushing him with sex.
