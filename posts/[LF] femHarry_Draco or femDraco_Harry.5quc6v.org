Hey fellow potterheads, I'm looking for fanfiction that deals with the Harry/Draco ship, only with one of them (pref) Draco being female. Ideally it's novel-length and starts at their first year, maybe but not necessarily with one of them sorted into the other's house. Smut is optional. Someone know a fanfiction like that?

  "Unfortunately, the first magical child young Harry Potter met in Diagon Alley was a Malfoy. Draconica Malfoy to be exact..." Harry/Draconica Harry/fem-Draco. This IS HET! will eventually contain Intelligent!dark-medic!strong!Harry, likeable!Draconica and some bashing for others.

**** I'm sorry. I'm here looking for Harry/Draco fanfic, so it's not like I'm holier-than-thou. But Draconica? We, as a species, can do better than this.

** If you're looking for heterosexual 'enemies' pairings, why not Hermione/Snape?

*** Because Snape is a dick and over twice her age? Also Hermione and Snape are very different characters from Harry and Draco, so their relationship would be entirely different.

*** Simple answer is OP wants Harry/Draco.

Not everyone is into interchangeable romances. They like a certain pairing for whatever reason, and switching that pairing doesn't scratch the itch that they have.

Example: Person A: I want a taco. Waiter: Here's some spaghetti. Person A: But I wanted a taco...

*** because honestly, most Snape/Hermione fanfiction that I have read thus far worked on quite a creepy "Snape sees Lily in Hermione and projects his lost lenore onto a young girl". And much as I like both characters, that's just a nope.

**** Fair enough. Sorry. Pretty much all the het!Drarry fics I've read are rife with OOC sexist cliches and the whole thing has left a bad taste in my mouth.

Read this one recently, though. Fairly in character for a tropey unintended pregnancy. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4576104]])
