As the title says I'm in the mood four some stories where Bellatrix and/or Narcissa are involved in a major way. No other real requirements, so harry can be dark, light, whatever

  Harry Potter and the Problem with Life Debts
#+end_quote

This is one of the most tedious fics I've read in a while. The author looses herself in long winded descriptions of characters and places that slow the fic down so much, its not even funny. Also, if one wants to read something with Bellatrix, this does it in name only. Bellatrix Potter is an OC and not in any way even close to the original Bellatrix. She's also not even a good OC at that.

  Harry Potter A/U. What if Harry was raised by Bellatrix Black? What if, while attending the Quidditch World Cup, Harry saved a young woman from a fate worse than death, incurring a life debt?

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

**** It's certainly not bad. It has a couple great Luna scenes but the 90s Dumbledore scenes suck and are seriously confusing. The 70s timeline is much better but sadly they make Harry and Bella way too OP. And instead of playing to the established strengths of the characters (both are superb and feared fighters) the story invents its own OP magic that is rather boring. The characters are good but compared to other timetravel stories like "What's a little death between friends" they fall flat.

The plot had a lot of potential and great ideas like an conspiracy in the past that usurped the ancestors of Lily and an Big borther/little sister relationship between Harry and his mum but the implementation fell flat.

Tl;dr: It starts out meh, becomes goof before falling off rather steeply

  Inspired by the movie "Easy A" & Severus in the staring role. Hogwarts Rumor Mill starts working overtime & Severus is no longer shunned by those of the female persuasion. Warnings for teenage type humor and bizarre ways of offing Death Eaters and Horcruxes.
