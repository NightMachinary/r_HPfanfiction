** You don't need to spice it up. You just need to focus on them being kids with not much else to compete over. Each house plays three quidditch matches a year. The house cup is a constant competition and the only regular way they can compete. Bragging rights are absolutely a thing amongst kids and teenagers. Hogwarts being a boarding school only multiplies that. Anyone who says it doesn't matter doesn't understand people and/or is just being edgy.

*** That only meaningfully applied because of how bareboned the Hogwarts culture is. They have virtually no other clubs of sports for people to compete in, so yes it would result in them caring a fair amount about the House Cup.

But I went to a school with Houses and a House Cup and I can /guarantee/ you that 80% if not more of us didn't really care because we had other things to compete about (grades, countless sports, countless clubs, external competitions and sports, internal subject based competitions).

As it is, it makes sense for people to care about the House Cup as much they seem to, but I'd like it for more stories to try and give Hogwarts depth beyond the one competition and sport.

*** I get that and what you're saying. But emphasis is put on the house points themselves in fanon, with absolutely nothing following. Hell, we don't even see the bragging rights. 'just because it isn't stated doesn't mean it doesn't happen,' that's fair, but as you said, they kids and teenagers. They'll want to brag, especially Draco or Ron.

Harry loses 50 points to Snape? A bit of inner monologue about Snape being a bastard and then silence. What about even in cannon, at the end of book 1, Gryffindor wins cause of points given by Dumbledore. Theres some complaint from the slytherins (iirc) and nothing else. Sure doesn't seem like a competition if the only ones complaining to an unfair loss right at the end is the should've been winners.

I'm probably barking up the wrong tree here, but usually winning a competition grants something of material gain, other than the aformentioned bragging rights.

Everyone else was happy to celebrate because at that point, Slytherin had been on a winning streak for several years, and everyone wanted someone else to win, even if it wasn't their own house.

In PS, after they rescue Norbert, they're docked 50 points each and the entire House stops talking to them, Slytherins pat them on the back to congratulate them for basically ensuring a Slytherin win. Harry even contemplates quitting Quidditch, but Oliver reminds him that that's one of the few ways they can get points back easily.

** The House cup is not something JKR made up.

#+begin_quote
  The house system is a traditional feature of schools in England, originating in England. The school is divided into subunits called "houses" and each student is allocated to one house at the moment of enrollment. Houses may compete with one another at sports and maybe in other ways, thus providing a focus for group loyalty.

  Merit points for behaviour and academic achievement may also be totalled up for comparison between houses.

  Some schools have a year-long programme of inter-house events, in which each house "hosts" an event at which all houses compete, with points contributing to the award of the House Cup at the end of the year.
#+end_quote

It's really just a way to cement group loyalty and enforce rules. By being punished, you punish your whole House with you. Most people don't like being responsible for something that affects a whole group. It's just an easy way for a relatively small staff to keep a large student body in check. It's not meant to be more than that.

*** As I mentioned in my reply to the other person, I may be barking up the wrong tree here. However this is a story about a world of magic, surely something mundane can be changed to be more interesting. Where there is actual benefits on the line when losing house points.

**** Well, I like your idea. Being served full-course meals on Hogwarts Express seems quite wizarding-like (considering even the Knight Bus has some kind of service), and given magic it's trivially easy to do.

*** I feel like attaching more stuff to the house cup would make it more efficient though. Like bragging rights aren't as a big a deal as something bigger like has been said previously.

** Humans will compete over whose toenails look the best if you put them in an empty room without socks. Competition is inherent in humanity. That alone is enough for the House Cup if you want it to play a role in your story.

** Why? Seriously, what does the cup give the winning house - other than a few hours of pride at their "accomplishment" at the end of the year (which isn't all that great, considering that in the pre-Harry Era Slytherin was probably winning a LOT!)...seriously, I'd tell my house that they can censure me etc. but I will not pay attention to the cup because it is not worth it!
