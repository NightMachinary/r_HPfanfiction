Like, what stops a dedicated first-year from mastering the Stunning Spell or the Summoning Charm but not the Disarming Charm. On a similar note, why learn the Disarming Charm but not the Revulsion Jinx when the later has a similar effect and has a shorter incantation (the latter being useful for fights/duels). I'm asking this because I want to find a way to do proper power-scaling but it's kind of complicated when a literal child has the same potential of an adult except for spells which require either an emotional aspect for it to work (i.e. Crucio/Patronus) or loads of control (Fiendfyre).


** There is more to magic than saying funny words and waving your wand, you need to understand the theory of the magic behind the spells. For example we know that before they started practicing the summoning charm in class they were assigned to read three books about it and when Harry and Neville struggled with it they were assigned additional reading materials.

** Theory. A lot of theory. There's no reason an 11 year old can't synthesize an explosive from household items following instructions. However, in Harry Potter, an 11 year old can't cast any spell without knowledge of theory, practice, and age (or power depending on your interpretation of the Voldemort boat thing).

** Remember in canon that it took a couple of weeks of theory before they even attempted the Levitation charm

During his fifth year (I think) Harry talked about how he exited the classroom confused and head filled with advance spell theory and “spell models”, etc

Basically this means that magic is more than just wand movement and words.
