** It's been a long while since I've printed anything, but if memory serves, that's in your print options. It's nothing to do with the file format, word processors change the format to whatever you want for printing.

*** Yeah but you have to subscribed to word to actually get two pages on one page landscape And I'm not going to use enough to warrant actually subscribing so I want to know if anyone else has it downloaded somewhere I can just print off

**** It works for any word processor, I should think. If you've got a copy of the book in PDF, you should be able to print it like that through adobe as well.

If you don't have a PDF copy, you can download one through Calibre and Fanficfare, or you can use the 'FF2Ebook' site to download a PDF directly. Either way, just plug in the URL of the story you want to download and it'll give you a copy of it.

**** And this is why I use an older version of Word, from back in the day when you actually got installation disks for your several hundred dollars.
