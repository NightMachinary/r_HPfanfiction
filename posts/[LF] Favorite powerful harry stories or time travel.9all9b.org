** Limpieza de Sangre linkffn(11752324)

Powerful harry curtesy of a meddling female Voldemort. Harry only becomes more skilled towards the end of the story, but it feels properly earned which is rare for HP fan fiction.

​

I'm still here, linkffn(9704180)

Powerful Harry and Dimensional Travel. Needs an editor badly, but the story is pretty good at managing the increase in Harry's skill and power and keeping the sense of danger and challenge for him.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

That's a good fic, agreed about the editing, but... Wow I just found an amazing review there, by HoosYourDaddy (of "A Boy and his cloak" and "It could only happen to Harry" fame), that I feel compelled to reprint in full here:

#+begin_quote
  Just re-read this after reading the DLP threads on your stories.

  First of all, ignore DLP. The site has the emotional depth of 4-chan. They give 5 stars to stories about Harry raping his mother. They sometimes offer good advice, but they /will/ kill the joy of writing. You only have yourself to please. Don't forget that their site was started by teenagers who like wanking to indie!Dresden!Harry. Their ideal fics are embarrassingly adolescent fantasies. Joe and Shezza and Silens are absolutely terrible at what they do, and they're worshiped like gods there. It would be hilarious if it weren't so sad. Only nonjon has produced great fiction for DLP.

  Second of all, don't stop writing. You are an excellent writer. Yes, you sometimes go into excessive detail. But you're not Ernest Hemingway. You're writing fanfiction, and your goal is to delight yourself and your readers with a fun, immersive story. Just know that there are a great many people out there who appreciate your hard work and would love to see more of what you can do.

  tl; dr: Fuck DLP and the adolescent horse they rode in on. Keep writing what you love.

**** TheSanti also wrote a great fic through DLP, though. I don't feel this analysis of DLP is entirely fair, feels like whoever wrote it got burned by them and is holding a grudge lol. I can vaguely remember other good fics where the author referenced getting help from DLP.

***** Yeah, TheSantis' fic is great too. Nontheless, lots of things said in that review resonates extremely with my experience with most of the fics that are loved by DLP.

And I think he admitted in his review that they offer some useful advice, they have standards which other communities lack. But I agree with the whole "adolescent fantasy" (Dresden!Harry) notion and how Harry just has to rape his mother to be praised by them.

**** People on that retarded site praise Silens for Renegade Cause.

I can agree that the characters are brilliantly written. You really do feel the hate for Kemester, but...fuck, did it throw all realism down the drain. Absolutely nuts.

** I have to say Prince of Slytherin is good and the next chapter (like 107 or something) is going to be out in a month and a half. Passageways is pretty good but it's either on massive hiatus or has been abandoned on chapter 37. Like InquisitorCOC said, Delenda Est is amazing and kind of shows a Harry that's using his knowledge to his advantage.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
