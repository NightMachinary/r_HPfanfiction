:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I haven't been able to find this particular fanfiction and hope that someone else knows the title.

Details I remember:

Death eaters, including Peter Pettigrew, watch over Harry at Privet Dr.

Neither Harry or the death eaters speak to one another until an instance when they see Harry speaking Parseltongue.

Harry is able to use magic with a wand he creates himself.

After the Parseltongue incident the death eaters start training Harry.

The death eaters basically view Harry as a new Dark Lord.

Harry is not as dark as Voldemort and debates many of the death eater's view.

Harry rebrands some of the death eaters.

Thanks for any assistance!


** Use the “what's that fic” flair. Sorry I can't help

  A six year old Harry encounters Lord Voldemort in his hour of despair. The Wizarding World will never be the same. No Slash. Features a Sarcastic Harry, cause I love him.
