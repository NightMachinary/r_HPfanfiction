ok so I'm looking for fanfiction where the sorting hat gets sick of bending to peoples wishes and so it sorts people where it thinks they should go rather than where they want to go

Enjoy.

**** That's not the Hat giving a shit what they think, that's them demonstrating that they have the audacity to argue with the ancient artefact deciding their fate, which is why it chose to put them in Gryffindor. When Neville did the same thing to try and get into Hufflepuff instead of Gryffindor, the Hat ignored his protests specifically because his protests demonstrated bravery.

The Sorting Hat has never made a mistake. That wouldn't happen if it just did whatever the small children wanted.

***** This so much!

I'm still baffled how people can read the sorting as anything but the hat teasing and testing responses to make his call, not listening to the kids

***** I know JK says that it's never made a mistake, but of all the hat's dodgy choices I really can't understand how Peter Pettigrew ended up as a Gryffindor.

****** Not cunning or ambitious enough for Slitherin, Not studious or intelligent enough for Ravenclaw and to lazy for Hufflepuff?

Beside I don't remember if it was ever explizit stated that he was a Griff.

******* Not loyal enough for Hufflepuff, more like. Becoming an animagus as a teen takes a lot of work, even when assisted by a pair of prodigies.

****** Peter is plenty brave. He was a spy for Voldemort for at least as long as Snape was for Dumbledore in the first war, that takes balls. He just wasn't loyal. Loyalty is inherent to Hufflepuffs, not Gryffindors.

******* I guess it depends how you look at it. My view is that he must have begged the Sorting Hat to put him in Gryffindor, and I think he did it because he wanted protectors and was willing to openly admire James and Sirius in return for them being on his side. But then when they left school he needed more powerful protection, thus he became a Death Eater. I agree he wasn't loyal, to either side.

******* Well Slitherin is the house of cunning and guile. and where in the books shows Malfoy cunning and guile? I think if the hat'd ignore legencies and student wishes then Draco would be dead ringer for Gryffindor. And the Twins would be excellent Slitherins. On the other hand no true Slitherin would be in Slitherin, right ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜œ

******** Malfoy is plenty conniving, and definitely ambitious.

Demonstrating traits of other houses doesn't mean they belong there. The archetypes each exist within all of us. The twins are ballsy as hell.
