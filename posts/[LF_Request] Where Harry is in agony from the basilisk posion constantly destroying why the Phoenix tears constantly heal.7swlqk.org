  Harry had such great hopes for the wizarding world, but all that comes tumbling down when the Basilisk Venom can't be stopped by Phoenix tears. Now Harry's life is running out of time, will he find a cure? Or will the Wizarding world lose their only hope of surviving. Did I mention that it's Tri-wizard year? (First story cut me some slack please)
