I love Remus Lupin. He's one of my favorite characters in the series and my favorite Marauder. I was wondering if there were any well written Remus centered stories, or at the very least Remus playing a bigger role then he did in canon.

Would rather it be when he's an adult; since the Marauders in Hogwarts years can be pretty repetitive in my opinion. But if there's any really good Marauders in Hogwarts stories that you think are exceptionally good is fine with me.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed though if it has a bunch of chapters it's fine.

** A request for a Remus centered fic and nobody recommends Against the Moon? Shocking! Hands down, one of the best Lupin stories ever...probably one of the best Marauder stories out there. It's not complete, but the author posts a chapter every other day or so! He's a kid, so probably not EXACTLY what you wanted...but still amazing! linkffn(7305052)

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.
