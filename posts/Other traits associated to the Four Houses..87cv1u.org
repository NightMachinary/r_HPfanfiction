So, I was thinking about other traits associated to the four houses and came up with thus:

- Gryffindor: Conviction
- Hufflepuff: Dedication
- Ravenclaw: Insight
- Slytherin: Survivability/Adaptability

I also came up with an wonderful addition to Ravenclaw's : /Wit without measure is man's greatest treasure~/

*Because Intelligence without Wit is worse than shit.*

I like my Rowena a bit crude, you see, I came up with that when considering that Hermione might not have enough Wit and that's why she ended up in Gryffindor instead of Ravenclaw. And that the reason for that was that she had more Conviction than Wit.

Basically I want to add more traits to the houses and see if doing that changes how we look at certain characters.


** well, hufflepuffs are incredible finders

** Here's some notes I took a while back- take them for whatever works for you.

The Sorting Hat examines the eleven-year-old's brain and tries to figure out where they'd develop best. This is typically a value judgement- what do they think is important.

- Gryffindors value popularity and accolades- they want to be righteous, but really it's about glory. Boldness is one avenue

- Slytherins value power- over oneself and over others. This is the House of bullies and powerbrokers, who naturally bond in a symbiotic relationship

- Hufflepuffs value inclusion- they want to be a part of the greater whole. Good citizenship is the goal, thus they put in their time but want none of the praise if it isn't given to all those who are deserving

- Ravenclaws value being right. It's usually an intellectual thing, but they have their share of visionaries as well. Loners and free-thinkers are placed there, which means this is actually the House of left-overs just as much as Hufflepuff. Hermione would be in Ravenclaw except that she isn't satisfied to know that she's right- she needs others to acknowledge it as well

*** I actually have an theory that The Sorting Hat examines their minds and looks at both the Nurture and Nature aspects of a Kid to figure out where to place them and help them grow. I mean, Nevile was constantly put down for his lack of magical... presence(?) but deep inside there was that Gryffindor courage, hidden behind all that he had been put through and he was placed there.

Looking at Harry for a more concrete look at this, he was more or less abused and was quiet and couscous and more focused on self-preservation. A common Slytherin Trait. But after hearing everything about how bad things where he went against that even though that was more in line with how he was raised and turned out. If he hadn't have heard anything negative and been exposed to Malfoy I'm sure he would have been in Slytherin hands down. In going against the traits that allowed him to survive, the Hat had to take a look at his inner Nature which was Gryfindor, even though he was Slytherin by the Nurture aspect.

**** If you want to look at it as "The Sorting Hat tries to put you in the house you'll grow in best", then it's actually pretty clear why Harry went to Gryffindor. He chose to.

An abused boy, growing up without parents or any real guidance? Suggest the literal worst house possible for him so that you can force him to make that independent choice of his own to go to Gryffindor.

Maybe I'm overthinking it, but at the end of the day Harry gained a /lot/ by being where he belongs because he /chose/ to be there. That's kind of why I dislike a lot of stories where Harry keeps trotting out the "I could have been Slytherin" card to gain Slytherin allies. It wasn't a /real/ choice, just the choice the Hat knew he needed to make.

**** I always thought the Sorting Hat wanted to put Harry in Slytherin because it could feel the horcruxe and without really understanding what it was, he just knew it belonged in Slytherin.

*** I was going to argue and say that Harry wouldn't fit int your Griffindor because he didn't want fame, but then I remembered he actually wanted to be popular. Not in the sense of being super well known, but he wanted /friends/, something he never could have had before.

And it would make sense for the hat to consider Slytherin too, since at the Dursleys he always felt powerless.

*** You'd think the types would sort out like the classic D&D roles:

- Gryffindor = fighter - sporty/star pupil

- Hufflepuff = cleric - average joe

- Ravenclaw = magic-user - geek

- Slytherin = thief - bad boys

Except it's more like:

- Gryffindor = cleric - I'm telling you what we fight for

- Hufflepuff = fighter - I'm just doing the job

- Ravenclaw = thief - I'm in for the quick win and not to suffer needlessly

- Slytherin = magic-user - I'm willing to suffer in the early stages for greater power later

** Gryffindors seem to have a pranking/humor streak the size of the Great Staircases. Consider the Twins. Consider Harry's humor. Consider the Marauders. Consider Dumbledore. Consider even McGonagall trying to get the letters to the Dursleys /already/ and going wackier each time.
