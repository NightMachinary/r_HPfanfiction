What's the best way to write the twins? A common criticism I think is valid is that their pranking can be read as bullying (I occasionally see them painted as bullies in stories as well). With that in mind, what's an alternative that keeps them similar to canon? Class clowns?


** Avoid “Twin Talk” unless you can do it right. They should be doing banter and setting eachother up for jokes, not forming a normal sentence two words at a time

** Keep them confident and there to keep it light-hearted. They seem to appear whenever Harry needs a laugh, whether he thinks so or not. For example, when everyone thought Harry was the heir, they would constantly move people out of the way and shout “watch out! Here comes the heir of slytherin to kill you all!”... something like that

** Understand that yes, they are identical twins, but they are /NOT/ the same person. Sometimes they would even have those rare disagreements despite having a lot of things in common. Make sure you define those differences that makes them either Fred or George. At the same time, show their similarities.

I'm give you a quote from a fic where the author did a wonderful job in characterizing the Twins' interaction with Filch. I also highly suggest reading this series as well considering this author written these stories from the Twins' point of view, It would be very helpful observing how other authors characterize the Twins.

  “Every year I get them," he mumbled, "spot the trouble makers a mile off I can. Thought you could just go wandering the halls whenever you felt like it eh?" he glared back at the twins, Fred went to answer him but George elbowed him in the ribs and shook his head.

  Eventually Filch led them into a small room, which they assumed correctly was his office; he opened on of the large cabinets and pulled out two fresh files.

  "Name?" he asked pointing at Fred.

  "George Weasley," Fred responded smirking a little.

  "Oh think this is all a game eh?" asked Filch as he wrote on the file before turning to George, "and you?"

  "It's Fred," George managed to control his smile much better then Fred did, as Filch scribbled this onto the top of the file.

  "Every time you do something wrong," Filched lifted up the files and waved them, "it goes in here. Every punishment you receive, every detention you do, it all goes in here."

  "So it's a bit like a diary?" asked Fred innocently.

  "What...no, it's nothing like a diary," Filch stammered, he wasn't use to first years asking questions, usually the students were too busy being afraid of him to even speak, "it is a record of your misbehaviour for the duration of your time here at Hogwarts."

  "Ahh..." said George sagely, "you mean it's more like a journal."

  "What's the difference?" asked Fred turning to his brother.

  "Oh well a diary would be more of a fact based log," explained George, "you know, what you did and where you went on each day. Where as a journal is more a collection of your thoughts that you write down."

  "So I was right?" pointed out Fred, "this is much more like a diary then a journal."

  Filch stood, mouth open, looking back and forth between the two twins, "No! It isn't a diary and it isn't a journal," he shouted his face turning red with annoyance, "it's a record, a file, a way of keeping track of your crimes."

  "Oh, that's a good idea," admitted George.

  "It is?" said Fred frowning as Filch's face contorted into a look of complete confusion.

  "Well we wouldn't want to do the same thing twice would we?" concluded George.

  "True, very true," mused Fred scratching his chin, "we have to keep our idea's fresh."

  "...original," added George.

  "... and groundbreaking," concluded Fred, "it's very kind of you to help us out like this Mr Filch."

  "What..." Filch blustered pointing his finger at the twins who were both standing there with looks of complete innocence plastered across their faces, luckily before he could manage to get out his words Professor McGonagallstepped into the doorway with a tartan dressing gown wrapped tightly around her, Filch's old looking cat slinked into the room slipping past her legs.

** A good prank keeps your world a little more surreal, does not hurt or scare anyone, and at most provides a temporary, moderate inconvenience.

For instance, they might put up a table at the front of the Great Hall, start an eating competition, and have Lee Jordan serve as a referee. Complete with fouling, yellow cards, and faked injuries.
