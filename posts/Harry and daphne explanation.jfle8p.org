I don't know where the Harry and dapper relationship started from and how it became so popular. Can someone please explain it to me? I don't remember them interacting in the books, so I don't know what could have caused their relationship.


** They didn't interact. It's just a fanfic trope that took on a life of its own, probably because, unlike the other characters, Daphne Greengrass was a blank slate. JKR didn't write much about her, so it's easy for fanfics to turn her into whatever they want/need.

** Canonically, she is just a Slytherin girl in Harry's year who, as far as we know, is not awful (Pansy) or unattractive (Millicent Bulstrode). "Less canon" sources like Pottermore also tell us that the Greengrasses are one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight and that her sister Astoria eventually married Draco.

Beyond that, she's a completely blank slate for authors to work with. And the idea of Harry getting together with a Slytherin is one a lot of people are interested in for a variety of reasons. And she is usually the best option for those stories.

Actually we don't know anything like that. She is mentioned in whole heptalogy just once (Order of the Phoenix, chap. 30, O.W.L.S.):

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and /Daphne Greengrass/. Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.
#+end_quote

That's it. She is never mentioned anywhere else. Nobody ever mentioned her looks or behaviour. Yes, she is never mentioned among the Draco Malfoy's group, but that's all we can say.

**** That's why I said "as far as we know." But maybe it would have been more accurate to say that she's the Slytherin girl in Harry's year who isn't known to be awful or unattractive. I didn't realize that the fact that she was in Slytherin didn't come from the books though. Although I think the fact that she was never mentioned in the DA does make it reasonable, though not guaranteed, to assume she was in Slytherin.

**** I believe the Slytherin part comes from a list JK showed in one of the earlier documentaries containing the names of the students she wanted to have in Harry's year in the early PS drafts.

***** Right, that's possible, but both Daphne in linkffn(3912184;4236594) (BTW awesome, highly recommended!) and in linkao3(22283053) (turtles!) are perfectly canonical.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship.
