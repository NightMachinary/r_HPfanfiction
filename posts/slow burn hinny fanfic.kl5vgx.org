Does anyone have a recommendation for a slow burn hinny fic. Preferably not rated anything over PG-13. Kind of like seeking ginny of you know that one.


** You might be interested in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]]" and its sequels by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/763509/Annerb][Annerb]]. The whole series is fantastic. Ginny is sorted into Slytherin where she eventually becomes the queen bee bad ass. The romantic interest begins in 5th year and is initiated by Harry and takes a looong time to get anywhere. To be clear, this is a Ginny fic with Harry appearing on occasion.

** I haven't read it, so I'd definitely look for more reviews before reading it, but I've heard good things about linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond)
