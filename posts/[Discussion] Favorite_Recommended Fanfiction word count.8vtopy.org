** I prefer things 100k+. But I also prefer things less than 500k or so.

Oneshots can be enjoyable, but for the most part I'll only read them if the idea really interests me. Off the top of my head, Cauterize is excellent, and so is With Nothing On My Tongue. That's about the only oneshots I like enough to remember. My main issue with oneshots is that they're oneshots, and I generally find even 50k fics to be too short to really be worth reading. Linkffn(4152700) [[https://snapecase.livejournal.com/50627.html][With Nothing On My Tongue]]

On the other hand, really long fics can be annoying as well. I find that in some longer fics the author just drags things out to a massive extent, and I'm really not a huge fan of that. I dropped Black Bond, for example, because I was really tired of the relationship denial, and I knew that by the end of the fic it wouldn't even be resolved. I do still enjoy some fics that are /longer/ than my preferences, though. Child Of The Storm(800k, with a 500k sequel) is still one of my favorite crossovers, and Eclipse Of The Sky(500k) is just outright one of my favorite fics. Linkffn(8897431; 2920229)

That doesn't at all mean I won't read stuff with less or more than my preferences, though.

*** Yeah, I completely agree with you there. Cauterize had a intriguing storyline, even now I go back to reread it sometimes. I've read I think the first half of Child of the Storm, but for some reason I took a "hiatus" on reading fanfictions and never really found the time to get back to it. I might continue reading it though. 2 fanfics that i read that were well over 500k that I actualy liked and finished were Vindico Atrum+The Black Heir, and The Rise of the Drackens

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

*** OMG I loved With Nothing On My Tongue!

I'm different in that I generally /only/ read shorter things and one-shots. :/ I feel like a lot of 100k things drag in the middle and lose my interest. That being said, my ideal length of one-shot is around 5-10k, on the higher end of the one-shot scale.

** I read fanfictions of any +length+ word count as long as the plot is good and the writing aint all that bad.

Whats important to me is that the story is not a bunch of cliches strapped to a stripper pole on which the MCs are rutting like some cheap slut in club near the airport.

Best fanfictions I have read until today were of smaller wordcounts 5k-20k.

Though, longer fanfictions are always welcome, its hard to find some that really works out well and isnt riddled with plotholes.

I think the longest fanfiction I have read up until today is Love of Magic by Noodlehammer with around 700-800k words.I binge read it the first time and it took me a day and a night, whereas the second read was slower and I took around 3 days. Reading that long fanfictions that have a structured storyline are really rare and always interesting to read.(btw. I wish more authors would learn to base their stories on the classic structures that have worked since forever: exposition, inciting incident, peripeteia, retarding action, resolution, denouement - especially those authors that have issues bringing structure into their stories!)

tl;drAny l+ength+ word count is good but I prefer medium sized fanfictions with a decent centered plot.

** There's no such thing as "best wordcount" but longfics do have a distinct advantage in that there's much less of them and it's easier to not get swamped

** That's hard to say and depends on a lot of things but I'll do my best to describe how I see it (i.e. non of this is absolute, exceptions prove the rule)

I very rarely read stories with less than 1k words, I feel like most of them are badly written or miss descriptions and plot points.\\
For short ideas something between 3-15k is optimal in my opinion, enough to explain everything properly and flesh the story out a little. I hate it when a story/one-shot ends directly after the main plot point/event. You have created this situation/AU, so show me what happens in it, how characters react, etc.

For novel style fics it depends a lot on quality and/or content. A lot of inexperienced writers will try to do 5 years canon rehash in 40k words and I just know that is not going to be a story for me. If the plot or ship interests me but I can tell it's not going to be a great story or somewhat badly written my limit seems to be somewhere around 150k words. For me to read a 200-300k story it has be decently written and interest me. 400k+ has to be well written and tick a few boxes at least or ok-ish written and tick *a lot* of my boxes. In addition to that, I'll most likely put of reading a 400k+ story until I'm really in the mood for it or on holiday.

Also interisting, stories I've stopped reading in the middle seem to be mostly under 50k or above 300k words. I don't think I've finished more than ten 500k+ fics (out of an estimated 400-500 HP fanfics read total).\\
BTW this is all about the wordcount displayed online, I didn't combine stories and sequels or anything, that would get way to complicated
