I'm looking for recommendations for good fics with a Hermione and Regulus pairing. I tried to read A Good Life and also Oblivion but I didn't really enjoy the writing in either... preferably complete stories but if it's a really good WIP I'll take it!

Hoping someone else has a few suggestions.


** I have an as yet incomplete one linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18485104/chapters/43800589]]) just through the first mini arc, but the characterisation is ooc on purpose (she's supposed to be like Michelle from Spider-man) so it may not be what you're looking for.

but if you don't like Oblivion, I don't know what to tell you. I think that's kind of the primo fic in this pairing.

Is there a reason you don't like it? There's some fics with an older Regulus, one is linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23954185/chapters/57610930]]) it's not my favourite because it takes bad communication to the next level which I always find annoying as shit. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24339769/chapters/58689106]]) is awesome and a little sweet, so there's a couple for you

In the end the best bet with fair pairs to get something you want to read is to write one yourself, because I find people tend to have really solid ideas about things, and most of the time people are stoked that someone's writing something at all

  A new girl has appeared at Hogwarts and Regulus Black isn't the only person to find her frustratingly obtuse and incredibly strange. He is however, the only one she seems to pay any attention to in return Unfortunately that only seems to confuse him all the more

  An obscure form of death magic reveals information about not one but two long lost brothers. And Hermione wasn't prepared for the sudden intrusion of Regulus Black in her life.
