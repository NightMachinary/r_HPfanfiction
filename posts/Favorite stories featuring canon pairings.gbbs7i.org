The story itself can be canon or AU, but the pairings I'd like to be canon pairings.

Just looking for some of your favorite stories focused on canon pairings.

Can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings.

No Lord Potter, no Harem Harry, no OP Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** linkffn(The Hidden Hero) this is Hinny though its not the main main focus. I don't really like Hinny but it fits well in this context, if memory serves well. Hope this helped!

  AU What if Harry knew he was a wizard and about the prophecy before he went to Hogwarts? What if he was kicked out of the Dursleys and decided to attend Hogwarts disguised as a muggleborn? Harry Ginny

** LinkAo3(A Second Chance by Breanie) has all the canon pairings eventually (there's no love at first, all pairings have previous relationships) and the only fanon pairings are those who didn't in the books (ie Sirus, Theo Nott, etc).

** linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part 1: Always and Always) - First of a 3-fic series that uses canon pairings but has non-canon events prompting Harry, Ron, and Ginny (Hermione was killed) to go back in time and fix things. They're not the only ones time-traveling though, and not everything is exactly as they remember...
