It was a series of 2 or 3 stories. In one, Harry went back to relive his life as Alpha Lord of all creatures and helped Voldemort destroy the wizarding world so he could put creatures on top. Along the way he and Voldemort fall in love but Voldemort has to die for Harry to win so he kills himself and comes back as Death. In the sequel, Harry goes back (again) to focus on family (because a lot of people he liked died in his Creature Victorious crusade) and appeals to the sanity in Voldemort, convincing him to protect the children of anyone who surrenders to him. Obviously, Voldemort takes over the wizarding world. But Harry is still part werewolf which translates into being a squib although he's still MoD so he can use the Elder Wand.

I saw a post about Tomarry and remembered this but couldn't remember the name or author. Please help.


** Loved these. It's the /Like a Ghost in My Town/ series by Batsutousai. ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/260551]])

*** Yes it is. I love Batsutousai (even when I can't remember the name). I think I'm a sucker for dark yet hopeful stories.

Edit: Thanks!!

  Cursed against his will, Harry made the best of his life until he found himself, again, wandering in Death's realm. When Death offers him a second chance, a chance to right the wrongs he'd been blind to for too long, he can't possibly refuse.

  While Harry had been content with his second chance, that didn't keep him from thinking what he could have done different, how many people could have survived if he hadn't been set on the very specific path he'd walked. Third time is the charm, though, right?
