Generally browsing I've seen some people say they won't read a fic because of some formatting, such as page breaks, or use of italics/bold, or authors' notes (I find them annoying if they are super long like man I do not care what you have to say just get to the story).

My fic is going to have memories viewed in a pensieve, I was going to italicize them, only cause I know there will be readers who will complain about not being clear enough when it goes into the memory itself.

So what do you think? What are your formatting do's and don'ts and pet peeves?


** I don't get some of these pet peeves at all. Using page breaks? Using italics? I mean, those two are part of writing a story. A lot of writers use them. /Professional/ writers use them. JK Rowling uses them. If you're dropping a story because page breaks or italics are being used, you're basically dropping 90% of stories out there for no real reason. And a lot of them are good stories too.

*** I agree, there's this one fantabulous story on FF.net, it's extremely well-written, in-character Snape-Mentors-Harry fic, it's one of my favorites but FF itself messed up the formatting to make alot of things bold and italicized, but I am glad I read it because it's easily my favorite fanfic of all time.

**** Which fic is that?

I probably read it and never even noticed. But in general, as long as the writing is good and I am enjoying a fic the formatting doesn't really matter or register to me at all. I do generally stop reading for the smallest things, but it's usually in regards to how certain characters are written, the plot, the writing style or the dialogue. I do tend to get annoyed with fics that have lots and lots of boring flashbacks in italics every 2 paragraphs, but that's less formatting issue and more of an issue of the writing and plot.

** Author notes in the middle blow. Leave them at the end.

You're right that a lot of people will get irrationally angry with flashbacks/memories if it's not pointed out in triplicate even if the context makes it obvious.

One thing in this particular fandom is special characters, usually when depicting parÂ§eltongue. It tends to mess up my text-to-speech app, but it's a small thing.

*** Dont even bother with authors notes, if something from the fic needs explaining then put it in the fic otherwise its not a good fic. Answering reviews is a nice thing to do but thats what PMs are for, replying to them in the fic just strikes as showing off that you got reviews. Personal stuff goes in the Bio. 1 authors note at the very start of the fix and another at the very end should be by far enough for any fic.

**** I disagree. For my story "No longer alone" I changed the Black family tree so that it would fit the plot. Now I can either post an AN which explains the changes or get a shitton of reviews of people saying that I got things wrong because in canon Bellatrix is the oldest Black sister, not Andi. Or the area where I put the Tonks home. Because I had no data how that place looked in the 90s I had to make do with Google Maps/Stree View and the Kent habitat survey from 2012.

There's no way you can say certain things in the story. Just how can you make it clear that you are making AU changes at this point and instead of bad research?

#+begin_quote
  "I know Rowling said that Bellatrix is my older sister but secretly she was born 16 months after me."
#+end_quote

That is far worse than a short AN at the end of the fic.

***** There are still ways a for a good writer to weave them into the story, fanfiction is in no way different to real fiction such that if a reliable narrator such as Adi says shes older the audience should accept it as fact. A load of pedantic reviewers correcting an AU story,in my mind is not a valid reason to ruin the flow of a story.

****** In an original work you make the canon in fanfiction, you build an AU. If there are conflicts between your world and the original works then people get confused. You do not want that. ANs are at the end of the chapter. You can skip them without disturbing the reading flow. They are meant as a help for people who seek clarification, not tell additional information.

As an author, I want to tell stories. If no one listens (reads them) because there's a lot of bad reviews you lose your audience and end up talking to no one. And I want constructive feedback, not 10 reviews saying I got something wrong when I intended that change.

** Since no one has addressed it yet:

I wouldn't use italics for a pensieve memory. Usually when I see italics for something like a dream sequence, I assume the author/narrator is trying to convey that something is wrong on a fundamental level without spending a bunch of words that will bog the scene down. A pensieve doesn't have that effect, so it doesn't make sense to use formatting.

Generally speaking, formatting should be used to express something that's either impossible or extremely unwieldy to do in text. Quoting a character's internal monologue is by far the most common example, though I'm sure there are others. However, if a reader isn't paying enough attention to recognize that a character is yelling without bold text or in a pensieve memory without a wall of italics, that's on them and not on the writer.

On top of all that, in long stretches of italics and bold can be annoying to read and also draw the eye toward them before the reader actually gets there.

And a bit about author's notes: If the reader needs to know something, it should be in the story. For authors that have discussions with readers about the story, there are other places to do that. Fanfiction sometimes requires a preface to talk about what the story is and isn't regarding canon, character speculation, and other considerations, but it's a necessary evil and subsequent author's notes are completely avoidable.

** I'd say pick whatever you want, but be consistent. In my writing, I use italics to indicate a character's internal thoughts and I've used italics for flashbacks. In the case where the main prose is italicized, internal thoughts are non-italicized.

I use *** to indicate when things are going to change (character POV or mini-chapter break), but I recently found out that ff.net takes those out, so I use the horizontal line tool as a replacement.

For other things, I refer to the Chicago Manual of style. I have it in print, but I believe there is an online reference these days. Make sure to pay attention to your punctuation and quotation marks as well. For example:

"HARRY POTTER! DIDYA PUT YER NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FYAH!?" is correct.

"HARRY POTTER! DIDYA PUT YER NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FYAH"!? is not.

** Personally I kinda hate it when people turn on the italics/bold and DONT TURN THEM OFF AFTER THE RELEVANT SECTIONS! I mean really? Is it that hard to press the button again?

But I personally use italics for emphasis, thoughts and Parseltongue mostly. Don't use bold that often for the narrative, just for Authors Notes and general formatting-ey things like titles sometimes.

*** Yes! I get annoyed with it as well, especially when the author does it unintentionally, but upon seeing it after its posted you'd think they'd edit it wouldn't you? it shows a lack of care not to. But thats just my opinion.

Yeah I don't like the use of bold in narrative it is kind of cheap, I feel anyway, like when someone bolds AVADA KEDAVRA for emphasis, like a descriptive word could have been used, like:

His voice, dripping with disdain yet ice cold, shouted out venomously, "Avada Kedavra!"

You get the point through without relying on bold.

** I use italics for flashbacks - which a Pensieve qualifies as - and I haven't had any complaints about formatting. Page breaks (or scene breaks) are also no problem. I would use formatting to stress certain words very carefully and sparingly, though.

** While it wouldn't bother me to read a story where pensive memories are italicised, I don't think it is necessary. JKR didn't do it in canon, her writing conveyed clearly what was happening, and personally, this is the way I would try to do it too. If it is well written and obvious, I wouldn't let isolated complaints bother me. It's impossible to satisfy every reader, so you should do what you feel comfortable with. Of course, there is also valid criticism, and if a reader tells you it's unclear, it might be a good idea to go through the scene again, to see where they are coming from and if you can improve your writing to make it clearer.

** Something that lmost every fic I've read does, disclaimers. I mean it's fairly obvious that the story isn't by JK Rowling, it's on a fanfiction site, there's no need for disclaimers.

That and author notes where they basically give away the plot.
