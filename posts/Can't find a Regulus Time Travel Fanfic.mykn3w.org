:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I could have sworn it was on Ao3, but for the life of me i can't find it. It started with Regulus in the cave being dragged under by inferius, when he's (if I'm remembering right) waking up after falling off his broom during quidditch.

He finds out he's back at Hogwarts, but he still has the dark mark (Pomfrey mistakes it for a bad bruise). And slowly the bites and scratched he got from the cave are reappearing.

I know it was a WIP back when i first read it, but now i just cant find anything that even comes close. Any help would be greatly appreciated!


** You're talking about this fic! Still a WIP though
