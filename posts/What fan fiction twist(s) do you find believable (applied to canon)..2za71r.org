** That's supported by canon actually. IIRC dumbledore says something along the lines of him knowing that he was condemning harry to 10 dark and terrible years, but that it was worth it because reasons.

**** It's debatable and AFAIK there's no consensus within the community.

I can see both sides of the issue, but I think it comes down to the fact that JKR was probably grasping at straws to come up with a reason that covers why Dumbledore allowed Harry to be mistreated by the Dursleys for so long. For some people, Dumbledore's reasoning works and for others it falls short.

It's almost standard fanon for Dumbles bashing or manipulative Dumbles fics to focus on Harry's mistreatment at the hands of Vernon and Petunia as a reason for why Dumbledore is just as bad as Voldemort.

Personally, I really like the early canon Dursleys. They're neglectful and emotionally abusive, but they don't appear to be physically or sexually abusive. It works well for children's books, but falters as the series grows into young adult fiction. The later canon addition of Petunia showing regret or Dudley asking shockingly relevant questions about Harry's world are too little too late for me, but it works for lots of other people.

****** This is one of the best examples of how the Dursleys work in children's books but are hyperbolically awful in the later series. I think to compensate for this, JKR gave Petunia and Dudley consciences as they're leaving Privet Drive in the beginning of DH.

Didn't do enough to satisfy me either, but if Harry Potter had sought revenge for their early treatment of them, would he still be the same character?

******* I do agree with most of your points. They're not physically or sexually abusive, etc.

But I don't think their abuse of Harry can be glossed over or justified as being 'not that bad', and exonerate Dumbledore.

******** Yeah, attempting to parse Dumbledore's motives or moral equivalency is extraordinarily difficult to do.

I think there's a big disconnection between what JKR thinks was right for the headmaster to do and what a large base of her fans have decided was /actually/ the right thing to do.

I don't want to let the Dursleys off easily either, but it's really hard to figure out how to 'punish' them. Even if the most extreme methods of reciprocity are used, Harry has still had an abusive childhood and turned out to be a really good person. The moral balancing in that is really complicated.

**** To be fair, I am sure plenty of other places have excellent wards. Hogwarts for sure. Gringotts as well but its a bank, not a house.

I am sure people with money or magical prowess could make some pretty nice wards. Hermione does an excellent job considering the circumstances.

*** Mrs Weasleys "Whats the platform again?" is in my opinion actually a really strong indicator of this. She went to Hogwarts for seven years herself and brought her children to the platform for, what, 10 years already?

We've never had any reason to believe that there are more then one wizarding platform (and/or that the Hogwarts Express ever used a different one), that there was more then one line serviced or anything like that. It would be like her wondering "Whats the street again?" when going to Diagon Alley - completely unexpected.

As far as story devices go: She could've perfectly well said something to the effect of "Once we are on Platform 9¾, you have to hurry loading you trunks", or just anything like that...

No this is a strong indicator of a mother making sure her 10 year old knows where she's going. People do this with small children all the time "what note comes after £5 is it £10 or £20", it doesn't matter that she knows, what matters is that her child knows.

Your parents didn't play those games with you when you were young? "Which milk do we get? Do I turn here to get to Grandma's house? How do I do the laundry?" It's a teaching tool. It also keeps kids involved in what's going on, especially if you're the youngest sister watching everyone leave to go to magic school.

**** So you think the whole Weasley family hung around Kings Cross station waiting for Harry to turn up, and then pretended to be running late whilst also having a scripted conversation about the platform number, just so that Harry would go up to them first?

Yeah, it's possible, but it's not exactly a foolproof plan and imo it takes the whole manipulative Dumbledore/Weasleys thing to a ridiculous level.

***** Well, no. I didnt say it happened, and I don't actually think it did. I merely said that there are strong indicators to come to this conclusion. Which may or may not be reinterpretated into results of weak/lazy writing. Keep in mind, that Rowling probably never assumed that her books would become such an huge success, she - most likely - thought of herself as one of an multitude of mediocre to average fantasy authors. No reason at all to go over her texts and try to eleminate reasons for nit-picking of an huge community ;-)
