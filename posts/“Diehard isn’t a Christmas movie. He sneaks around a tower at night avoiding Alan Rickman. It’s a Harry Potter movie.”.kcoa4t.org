Shamelessly stolen from Jesse McLaren's twitter.

A cross-over fic would be fine. Or it could just be Harry (or Neville in 7th year) sneaking around. Or Snape leading terrorists.

*** Joe Leland, the main character of the book Die Hard was based on, was in his 70s during the events of the book. McGonagall is probably the closest to an age appropriate person to fill the role.

Of course, unlike McClane, Leland's roles in the story was to actively make things work out poorly and get a bunch of people killed with his stupidity, so maybe not the best comparison.

**** -Book 1 McGonnagal dismissing being told about the plot to steal the Stone

-Book 2 McGonnagal laughing and sending Lockhart as a joke when a student was in the process of being murdered

-Book 2 and 4 McGonnagal doing little-to-nothing to curb rampant bullying happening in front of literally the entire teaching staff/student body (Plus the guests in GoF)

I don't like the uberbashing but tbh if the Trio didn't have plot armor she'd have gotten four people killed directly (Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny), caused Voldemort to return twice (Getting the Stone, absorbing Ginny's life force), and generally just promoted an environment of harassment and bullying from the Student Body.

***** To be fair, in book 2 she had absolutely no ability to save Ginny. She didn't know what was in the chamber or where it was, she thought Ginny was a lost cause. It's a terrible position to be in, but she had over 200 other students to get to safety and had to make a hard choice. She wasn't laughing about sending Lockhart away or trying to do a funny prank, she just wanted him out of the way so she could focus on getting the rest of the students to safety.

Snape is given a mission by Voldemort that requires him going to america.

where he runs into John Potter mcClane.

His mother being a descended from a branch of the potter family that moved to america.

Snape is of course livid that no matter where he goes, a potter ends up annoying.
