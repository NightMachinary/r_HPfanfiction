** I don't remember the name of the fic. It was a pretty famous not-BWL fic with a neglected!Harry paired with Hermione. That one had a pretty good reveal when he fought his twin.

  AU What if Harry knew he was a wizard and about the prophecy before he went to Hogwarts? What if he was kicked out of the Dursleys and decided to attend Hogwarts disguised as a muggleborn? Harry Ginny

** Mirror of Maybe by Midnight Blue is really good, though it is also abandoned (cry). It's not on ff.net but a google search will bring it right up.
