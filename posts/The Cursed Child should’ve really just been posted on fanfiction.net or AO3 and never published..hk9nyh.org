It's truly a disgrace and there is SO much better next gen fanfiction out there that is closer to canon (including by characterization) that is way more deserving of publication than The Cursed Child.

Almost like someone talented wrote it, but they did so with a Quick Quotes Quill and intentionally didn't do any fact-checking. That /screams/ Rita Skeeter to me.

*** Without re reading Cursed Child to make sure (because let's be honest, it won't happen), there is a "Voldemort Day" in Cursed Child? I remember there is some sort of celebration day during the "Voldemort Won/ Death Eater Cedric" timeline, but they called it "Voldemort Day"?

I can totally accept the Death Eater having a day to celebrate their total Victory, but they should be afraid to say Voldemort, let alone giving this name to a holyday. These idiots had plenty of ways to name this day (Victory Day being the most freaking obvious) and they chose Voldemort.

Guess I have another thing to add to the list of reasons why CC sucks.

I'm not going to try to defend it, but a lot of people seem to love it even if objectively it's not great. It wasn't so bad as to completely turn me off - though perhaps me going in with low expectations (I was spoiled already) actually made me appreciate it more than I otherwise would have.

1 example of a weird/bad plot point is the often mentioned "crazy trolley witch scene". Yes it reads as really fucking weird, and the whole thing seems like a fever dream. However, it wasn't so offensive as to make me want to stop watching. It was just an odd, fantastical scene.

side note: personally I find most next gen fics to be quite bad. There's exceptions like the Hogwards House Divided (that Teddy L fic by the writer of Alexandra Quick) but I think it's a pretty difficult territory to explore.

A more interesting (and crowd pleasing) setting that could use expanding is post Hogwarts. You can still have your favorites of Harry Ron Hermione running around dealing with the Ministry rebuilding, pureblood remnants, or whatever you want. Instead of angsty bad dad Harry

Harry, actual Harry, the kid who grew up in a cupboard, would never have been a bad dad. I mean, are we meant to believe that after all the stuff he says to Albus Severus in the DH epilogue (not just the famous "you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts" bit, but also "if you go to Slytherin then Slytherin house will have gained a wonderful member" stuff) he's suddenly going to decide that maybe his son is evil bEcAuSe He SlYtHeRiN. It's just bizarre, Harry wanted a family more than anything else and the last thing he, who was judged all his childhood for things he couldn't help, would do is make another kid (especially his own kid) suffer through even a tiny bit of what he went through.

I've only read it once and a lot of the details of CC are lost to my memory (possibly on purpose!) but I vividly remember reading it and the main reaction in my brain being "Harry Potter wouldn't do that shit."

********** I honestly find it incredible that you imagine a dude whose most ready model of fatherhood is Vernon Dursley, whose major role model was Sirius Black and who was mentored by Albus "love is everything" Dumbledore so successfully that he completely forgives (the seriously unhealthy and generally mean) Severus Snape would be a bad father. Nothing in Harry's background says that he'd be a good dad even as pretty much everything suggests he would want to be both a father and a good one at that. Even the usual childhood experiences that he'd be able to empathise with his children over were robbed from him... Harry's practically a child soldier and these contexts ought to cast a shadow over every possible interaction with his children.

Even that line... that's what he knows he /should/ say but he's still Harry "investigate the Slytherins" Potter, he's still having /that/ conversation with Ron about Draco and he's just told his son that he can choose /not/ to be Slytherin... something we're specifically told he hasn't told his other children (perhaps even anyone else, I forget)... I don't think he's actually considering the possibility that Albus would be in Slytherin, but telling a child who's clearly internalised a lot of negativity towards Slytherin that he /doesn't/ have to be in Slytherin. And, indeed, I think most pre-CC fanfics /didn't/ put Albus in Slytherin.

#+begin_quote
  who was judged all his childhood for things he couldn't help,
#+end_quote

Exactly. He's just told Albus that one's house isn't a fait accompli but rather something he can actively choose.

It's a bit like Avatar. We learn in the sequel that Toph was a pretty terrible parent. She had terrible parents herself but in the /opposite/ fashion. We learn the same thing about Aang who, in some respects, is quite like Harry (just in addition to being an orphan there's a whole genocide angle). There's also a whole debate about whether Toph had a child by Sokka, which usually comes down to "look, I agree there are some similarities in appearance going on but I don't want to imagine their lives turn out so badly that their daughter doesn't know Sokka's her dad".

We don't want to imagine our favourite characters having ordinary or even unhappy lives after "the end" but they can.

To my mind, the Harry Potter books put a lot of weight on "nurture" or, at least,, the cumulative process of experience creates our personalities. The only real exception to this is love potion Voldemort... but I think that's actually more fanon than it first appears. CC leans into this idea /hard/ and most of the objections I recall about it (shrew Hermione, Death Eater Cedric, bad dad Harry) are logical extensions of this notion.

*********** Like I said in response to someone else, I can see him being a "crap" dad - I can see him making mistakes. Probably huge ones. Because yeah, he has no frame of reference. (I can also see Ginny providing him with a lot of guidance because she /does/ have the model of a healthy family relationship to fall back on, but that's another story).

What I can't see is Harry telling his own kid he wishes he wasn't his dad. That's cruel, spiteful, Dursley-style behaviour. And I don't think he would ever be deliberately cruel to a child, especially not his own child.

I know modern pop-psychology loves the "the abused always kick downwards" theory, but in reality the truth is that despite there being a truth in the idea that most people who hurt children were hurt as children themselves, most people who were hurt as children do not repeat that cycle because they remember how awful it was. Ultimately, most people do not hurt children. Harry is a good person. He makes an effort to ensure the Dursleys were hidden away from Voldemort (in his position, I would absolutely have let them take their chances without wizard help!) He recognises that how he was brought up wasn't normal or kind. I just cannot see Harry being one of the "repeat the cycle of abuse" people, and after he grew up being called a freak and treated as a nuisance or worse because he was different, I honestly can't see him treating his own son in any way that reflects that behaviour.

See, I'd say "you were named for two heads of Hogwarts and one was a Slytherin and he was the bravest man I knew" negates that point. He's literally given the kid a positive Slytherin role model there. I just cannot see Harry Potter being spiteful to a child based on their sorting or the fact they're "different." He's many things (bad tempered, idiotic, lazy, illogical), but he's not a bully.

************ That's the thing about scripts. They're... well, they're not entirely blank scripts (that's a whole different thing) but there's a lot of room for directors and, yes, actors to impose on the scene. All the script actually tells us is that Harry's /really/ angry ("sees red"... which suggests he's not consciously controlling his actions). And we see from the earlier part of the scene that Harry's given Albus what would have been the absolutely most perfect gift for Harry in the same situation to Albus. And it is completely the wrong gift for Albus.

From Harry's perspective... Albus is reacting with pretty much the exact same sentiment he got from Vernon and Snape. In fact, I would say Albus is being incredibly like Snape here with put downs at the expense of Harry's background. What is the real difference between "our new celebrity" and "I know it all, Dad. Blah blah blah"? And, in that light, what difference "there's no need to call me, sir" and "well, there are times I wish you weren't my son"? It's just another tit for tat, situationally devised response.

Ah, you say, Harry's much, much older now. And that's true. And, yeah, Albus is his son he's theoretically the one in charge. But Albus, whether wittingly or not, has just spent this entire conversation pulling at every foundation of Harry's identity, the way Harry relates to his children and throwing them in Harry's face. It's really, really cruel. Or it's just more sarcasm in a sarcastic series, if more than a little petulant.

I don't know how the play ran with that scene, but if I was in charge of that scene, I wouldn't be playing Albus as being in the right. It's this particular line where the morality of the scene should flip and we see Albus' perspective as being "better", but up until then I don't think... main character status and all... that we should be siding with Albus in that scene. And that's something we're free to impose upon the text in a way we can't do with a novel (most of 'em anyway).

To my mind, if you play Albus as the "bad guy" in that scene, Harry's less:

#+begin_quote
  "the abused always kick downwards"
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  cruel, spiteful, Dursley-style behaviour
#+end_quote

and more "your problem is that I, Harry Potter, am your father... I wish I could be your father, not Harry Potter, your father". Harry's never wanted to be Harry Potter, but that's pretty much /all/ Albus sees him as and all Albus allows Harry to relate to him as (and defines himself as, i.e. not Harry Potter). And Harry, the orphan with the cruel Dursleys as his "parents", is just fundamentally not equipped to handle that.

Just because Albus is a child (fourteen), doesn't excuse /his/ cruelty earlier in the scene and it's an important context to interpreting the reaction of someone the audience should remember as being quick to anger.

#+begin_quote
  I can also see Ginny providing him with a lot of guidance
#+end_quote

Ginny's pro-Harry to a fault. We see it in the sectumsempra issue and in this play itself. The next scene is immediately a dream Harry has about, lo, the Dursleys and the scene after that he learns that Ginny knows what he said to Albus. And it's similarly apparent that Harry has much bigger problems with it than Ginny does:

#+begin_quote
  And you're still talking to me

  #+begin_quote
    Because I know that when the time is right, you'll say sorry. That you didn't mean it. That what you said concealed -- other things
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Hell, there are more than a few fanfics which frame the whole breaking up and then getting back together issue in this "pro-Harry" context.

Don't get me wrong... Harry's wrong to say that, but I remember more that he regrets it as soon as he does say it and was actively trying to avoid the possibility of such an interaction in the lead up than that he said it. I am, in other words, taking Ginny's position while yours is more like how Harry treats it (fixating on that he said it at all rather than the context it was said in). Both are obviously reasonable readings from the raw text.

What I'm saying is that the full meaning of a scene in a script is... much more fluid than the meaning in the play or a scene in a novel. It's a script. When you read it, you're the director and the actors. And you have substantial power to make characters seem better or worse than someone else might when they read it.

************* I think that's partly my problem with this aspect of the play - Harry is an adult here. So is Ginny. Yet in many ways (and I absolutely get what you're saying about a script not having the wider "inner author monologue" to help the reader understand actions and decisions the characters take) the characters haven't matured from the sectumsempura incident. Harry is still a rash, brash, foot-in-mouth gobshite who speaks first and regrets almost immediately. Ginny is still, to an extent, a Harry Potter fangirl who spends her time making excuses for him. Yet they're meant to be, what, nearly forty?

Yep, Albus behaves like a brat in this scene. But he's fourteen. Harry is the adult. He's a grown man who is meant to be Head of Magical Law Enforcement. To work in any kind of law enforcement, you really should be a person who's able to be rational and mature and know how to choose your words. Yet he's still characterised in this particular bit of the play as someone who is happy to be absolutely spiteful to his own child. I mean, I'm sure criminals have said much worse to him than "yeah dad, I get it. You're /Harry Potter./" People of course make mistakes, and parents of teenagers moreso than anyone because teenagers are the damn worst and so hard to handle! But I just feel like Harry, the person we came to know intimately well over seven books, would not choose to be spiteful even though he could at times be crass. On top of that, I feel like "Harry Potter Head of Magical Law Enforcement" is still that nice kid at heart but also should have learnt to control his damn emotions!

I get what you're saying about Harry thinking he was saying "I wish I could /just/ be your dad, not your super famous dad who you and everyone else has an opinion on" and it perhaps can be interpreted as not spiteful. I guess I just think Harry, because of his experience with the Dursleys, knows how a cruel word to a child can last a lifetime, and, as he's a fundamentally decent person, wouldn't want to inflict that on his son. IMO, it pushes Harry's character development, and to an extent Ginny's, back to the angsty teen of books five and six.

There is, I feel, a very real issue confronting someone trying to do an X Years Later story where X is not a particularly small number: how to evolve the personalities of the cast? I mean, I can't stand angry Harry these days from OOTP but I've read how he got to that point.

While I agree that this is a reasonable concern, we're kind of still in the "it's a script, not a play and certainly not a novel" problem. I did drama at school and one of the things we'd have to do, so presumably actual actors do it too, is figure out the wider context for our characters. Like, I was the widower in [[https://www.derbytheatre.co.uk/two][this]] (class plays need large casts so we each had one character each even though it's meant to be two actors, fourteen roles), but the script (iirc) doesn't even give the dude a (sur)name. And that was definitely something I was supposed to come up with along with whatever else but it was also something that the audience would never see and, honestly, it'd be weird if the character's name did come up in the script.

With fanfics we're usually either cursed or blessed by the complete absence of editorial oversight or practical demands (no-one wants to watch a ten hour play). So, it's easy to get used to the idea seeing things play out and having enough time to reveal later on why a character is the way they are. And, of course, there's a certain amount of wish fulfilment... allowing Harry to have a happy ending, for example... so we're used to certain contexts that aren't text and may not even be subtext in the script being text in "other" fanfics. There's time enough to see them and the medium is better suited to showing it. Unless you're going to be having soliloquies, monologues, asides or whatever.

Now... if you've seen the play and still feel this way... I think that's a fairer criticism. I haven't seen the play so it's easy for me to think something like "well, I'm sure the performance and direction can sell the raw text of the script to me" (although I do, in fact, like the script anyway... hell, there's a very real possibility that I'd watch the play and go "it should be funnier, like the script").

That's sort of what I'm saying... they can't. What makes Albus' words so cruel is that he knows Harry and what makes them so hurtful is that he's someone that Harry not only knows, not only cares for and not only ostensibly loves Harry (being his son) but whom Harry actively loves himself.

Harry really is trying to not be the arsehole in that scene... he even says:

#+begin_quote
  I'm not going to rise to your bait, Albus Potter
#+end_quote

He just... fails. And says something that... there are less hurtful things that he might've said but, as I said, the structure of Harry's response is familiar from things he says in the novels.

If I'm being honest, I really don't think that is a job Harry should have taken and would be happy in. Head Auror, fine... a senior Auror, definitely, but he's practically the Home Secretary as the Head of the DMLE... he's like the early career Winston Churchill showing up at the Sidney Street Siege but then going and kicking the door in himself. Hermione should sack him ASAP and put him back in the Auror Office.

Similarly, I think Harry was more a "sweet kid" than a "nice kid".

Oh I agree and what's more I think CC!Harry agrees too, it's just that where you and I disagree is that I don't think Harry had much of a choice. That once Albus pushed him into a corner, this (or a comment very much like it) was always how he'd verbalise:

#+begin_quote
  "I wish I could just be your dad, not your super famous dad who you and everyone else has an opinion on"
#+end_quote

which is what he /means/.

#+begin_quote
  IMO, it pushes Harry's character development, and to an extent Ginny's, back to the angsty teen of books five and six.
#+end_quote

And that's a fair reading of the raw text.

But maybe if you see him as an ex-cop/soldier turned bureaucrat/politician who's inserted himself into a case about time travel that was threatening to dredge up the past /before/ Amos Diggory came knocking, has a son he struggles to relate to who, in turn, refuses to let Harry be "just Harry" and a support network that consists of an overly sympathetic wife, a best friend who is also his boss and another best friend who's thrown himself into his work at a joke shop, having long since quit the line of work Harry's made his entire life /because/ of that past his son won't ignore, despite befriending the son of Draco Malfoy, whose history with Harry is both deeply complicated and the only context in which they engage with each other... */maybe/* that Harry emerges from the Cursed Child a more understandable person.

Or, quite possibly, not.

All I'm saying is that I think it's not only possible to project many different interpretations of Harry onto the Cursed Child, but that the nature of plays and play scripts means it is by design that the audience's interpretation of both Cursed Child and CC!Harry depends on the specific projection.

*************** I think all this is true, and I do agree that in a play, 50% or more of what the audience get out of the story is via the actors and direction, not the script. So the /meaning/ behind Harry's words may very well be much better conveyed in a live showing of the play. But that's the problem with CC in a nutshell - most people didn't get to see it. We had to just read it. And I think for a franchise that's globally consumed such as HP, producing a sequel that the majority of fans wouldn't be able to consume in the /best way,/ well it wasn't fair firstly and secondly it explains why there's a huge difference in the reactions of those who have seen it and those who have only read it.

However, there is still an argument that Harry Potter, aged forty with a senior government job, should be able to not take out his feelings of "Slytherin bad, anything to do with Malfoy, bad" on his teenage son. I get he was trying to do the right thing, I can see that. I just felt making him an angsty, overworked, confused bureaucrat who snaps at his son made a lot of people think "dafuq?!" I also felt that the talk between Harry and Albus about Slytherin and the nodding between Harry and Draco in the epilogue showed some growth, which a few scenes in CC then put into reverse.

Coupled with all the totally weird stuff in the rest of the play, I think many people were disinclined to give that scene the benefit of the doubt because it just felt like yet another thing that's destroying canon (the trolley witch scene was the point where I really checked out tbh). It didn't /feel/ like a JKR work, and I don't just think that's to do with the format. I've read scripts for other plays I've never seen and found them enjoyable, but not this.

It's only the plot that people have a problem with, because it /really/ doesn't mesh with anything established in the Harry Potter canon - it's a great play as long as you completely disconnect it from said Potterverse canon.

The Tony awards (and a significant portion of the play's fans) go purely off of the play itself - ignoring books, films etc. And given that the /major/ complaint about Cursed Child requires that you take the books into account, by all means it'd deserve those awards.

******** It's brilliant as a piece of theatre and deserved all the awards it got. I geninuely believe that the vast majority of people slating it have never seen it in its intended medium.

(I'm not disputing that the script looks mental.)

I lived close enough to see one of the early shows and know in excess of 15 people irl (enough to HP events on a friendly basis, plus some casual fans - actually probably more) who saw the play in various clusters and every single one found it fantastic. A number of them are regular theatre go-ers.

Interestingly, almost everyone thought that the characterisation was perfect, for example - you really believe that these are the adult versions of the characters. Yes, including Harry struggling with parenthood and Hermione as the minister for magic.

Whereas it seems to be a major complaint from those who've only seen the script.

The lights and special effects also really bring magic to the stage.

Edit: Potentially it helped that we went when keeping it a secret/not spoiling it was the done thing. Some of us had read the script and thought it was odd, other's hadn't. The collective hatred hadn't built up at that point.

For what its worth, if you factor in advancement in magical research (think of the difference between the 1990s and two decades afterwards in the muggle world), I don't think it's THAT unbelieveable. Trolley witch aside.

As I said [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html][elsewhere]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g0hwbu/augurey_revisited/][yet elsewhere]], the idea of the story is interesting, but the delivery is so horrible. It feels like the exact opposite of CC: not McDonald's food in great environment, but a decent steak in the shack falling apart with some indescribable goo dripping on you from the ceiling.

To the question of Tom Riddle conceiving a child. No, I don't believe there was any love between him and Bellatrix, whatever sick Bellamort stories are out there. However, unfortunately kind and sane potterheads are just too normal to imagine another reasons for having sex than some kind of love. I actually don't think they had an sexual encounter in the normal sense of the word (remember, Tom Riddle didn't have true human body at that point, he was just an alchemist construct, and I wonder how well two most-likely virgins with their focus completely elsewhere even cared about making the bits in the proper shape and function). That doesn't exclude however a baby being conceived by some magical equivalent of the artificial insemination for some nefarious reasons.

She may not even be intended to exist: a baby may be just some by-product of a weird Dark ritual (which would explain her being completely neglected), or even worse, she may be produced just in order to be used in some Dark ritual. What about the ultimate Horcrux created by sacrificing your own child? And if you say ‚ÄúEwww‚Äù, I am right there with you. One pet peeve I have is how every other fanfiction tries to make Dark Magic nice and virtuous. No, it is not, you idiots, it is horrible and forbidden for reasons!

*** Hot for Teacher and the sequels in the series were really good I thought. It's Dramione, in case that's not your thing, but Scorpius & Albus are besties, and it was really funny. There were several times I laughed out loud. Just a warning though, it is marked ‚Äòmature', and has some pretty steamy scenes, in case that's also not your thing. The way the writer characterizes Albus & Scorpius was awesome though, IMO.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/674762/chapters/1234854]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/762738]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/90292/chapters/122722]] - warning for this one, infertility/pregnancy issues. It can be triggering and isn't in the story tags. I thought the story was excellent, amazing writing, and while it has a happy ending, it was a heartbreaking story. I cried, and just wish I had gone into it with at least a hint about that topic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/242815]]

This is just a few of my favorites, but if you're ever so inclined, you're welcome to look at my bookmarks on AO3; anything I've bookmarked I loved. I'm Gypsiewitch on there. Though, also fair warning, I read A LOT of Reylo too.

Edit: the one with the warning above is probably the most Slow Burn of the ones I recommended. Though I would count the first one with the funny Albus/Scorpius as kinda slow burn too. Just funny, not angsty at all.

I always feel weird recommending Dramione because some times people are very passionate in their dislike of it, but it's my favorite non-cannon ship.

** Yup! Totally agree! I can't image Voldemort ever willing putting hands on anyone. If he did it would've been r/pe for his own power/control, and sure he could've assaulted Bellatrix but considering she loved him, was insane, and also a masochist he *wouldn't/ have tried to assault her, because in her broken mind would've liked it and therefore would've consented. And if you say Voldemort loved her then obviously the whole ‚Äúconceived under a love potion unable to feel love‚Äù thing is now wrong. And I believe the ‚Äúconceived under a love potion unable to feel love‚Äù way way more than Voldemort was moonstruck with an insane madwoman.

Harry never ever would've been a bad father. Like that plot line makes me wanna beat someone up with a broomstick. Harry wanted a family probably more than anything, and yeah he's totally oblivious, but I never think in a million years he'd be a bad father. And like the Weasleys would've let him be a bad father?! You don't think GINNG fucking WEASLEY would have grabbed Harry by the ear and beat some sense into his ass then you're wrong.

And Cedric?! /REALLY?/ He's a Hufflepuff! And yes obviously anyone can be evil BUT NOT CEDRIC. He's like the show boy for Hufflepuff! He would've congratulated Harry and probably would've helped him kill Voldemort later on! Like REALLY?!

The entire CC is a fan fiction money grab that I refuse to accept as canon. JK can say it's canon all she wants all she wants; she's also against transgendered people all of a sudden, so I'm taking anything she says with a grain of salt. They all just wanted money, and they got it. I'm glad some fans can like it, but I prefer way better written, and way better designed fan fictions on AO3.

As a writer myself I thought it was awesome that JK was involved with the Harry Potter community and how cool it was but she's just turned it into a shit show. The fantastic beats would've been great until she got ahead of herself and ripped it from three short and sweet films to six. I'm just a bit done with her and her side projects.

** I have one major issue with Cursed Child... the Trolley Witch. I really don't care about the other stuff in it. But to the extent I do? I like them.

I've read... I wouldn't say plenty of play scripts, but enough that CC was far from the first and I do think its being a script is part of why people don't like it (and presumably why people like watching it, which I haven't done). I find it captures the overall tone of the books (i.e. hilarious) much better than... pretty much all fanfics (to be fair, quite a few I've read precisely because they're angsty or similar) and definitely more so than the movies (aside from the montage in OOTP), which are probably best described as a "I want this to be Harmony, but I've decided it has to be Romione because reasons" fanfic themselves.

That being said, I find it easiest to imagine that CC was written by Rita Skeeter based on actually true events. She presumably remembers the Trolley Witch from her own school days and has been trying to write a hit piece for years but never learnt anything interesting.

If it helps... it's probably not unusual to find Harry "wouldn't talk about his parents" Potter being a bad dad, Hermione "kept me in a jar" Granger being mean and Cedric "too morally upstanding to possibly be interesting to a gossip columnist" Diggory being a Death Eater in the Skeeterised account.

*** Personally (having seen the play) I think Harry as a struggling dad works. He's never actually had a consistent and trustworthy adult role model in any setting, ever plus there's no way he came out of the war without being highly traumatised.

5th book Harry, for example has a temper and struggles - yes, he's a teenager but he also never has the opportunity to learn emotional regulation. Harry consistently shuts other people out across the books when they don't agree with what he says or when he feels emotional (e.g., about the horcruxes). For all he cares about his friends and family, resolving conflict has never been a strong suit.

In the first book he has a nightmare about the Durlseys, in Cursed Child it's evident that he's still haunted by his childhood. If anything, I'd say that having children would bring up all those memories because, well, he loves his children and nieces and nephews so much, so how could they treat him that way.

The play gives the impression that Harry did a better job as a dad earlier on in Albus' life, but struggles as Albus grows up. He struggles when he's reminded of himself and doesn't know how to resolve conflict. Perhaps he's learnt in a professional setting, but with a child it's quite different.

In short, I think it's very likely that Harry would have struggled with parenthood. Loving your children/always wanting a family of your own doesn't mean that people have the skills to do it well, when it comes down to it. Then again, I thought that before CC came out - though I have always accepted that he could well have learnt those skills in the unseen gap.

It was more in the sense of "well, you'd definitely see that if Skeeter was writing" than "you'd need Skeeter to be writing to get that".

I can't tell you what I thought about Harry's parenting skills before CC, but after it I definitely see him as having difficulties. Actually, my headcanon is he had trouble with Lily as well and the interpretation I have of James is that he sort of coincidentally had the right personality so it worked out.

My thought is that Albus Severus with his general doom and gloom sees everyone else as having a better time than him, perhaps because he's a child or maybe because the other two cope better with just their mum's input but CC doesn't show it. (So James doesn't have too much trouble because he doesn't crave that emotional support and sees Harry as sort of a jokey-dad.)

** So I agree with just about everything that's being said here. Harry doesn't really have a great relationship with any male father figures in his life, so being father would probably be hard for him. But in my opinion, Harry would never be classified as a bad dad without CC. Yes I get it, people with issues will continue to have issues unless they learn a different way but Harry Potter? A bad dad? No. Maybe a lax dad or an overbearing dad or even a helicopter dad, but never cruel. The Harry that we grew up with wanted parents so bad, that given the opportunity, I believe he would have done everything in his power to be a great father. Again, just my opinion.

It still blows my mind that Hermione Granger, Minister for Magic is married to a dude that works in a joke shop...but that's another discussion entirely.

The only things I actually liked about the play itself was Scopius and Albus's friendship and Draco's personality after growing older and losing his wife. Not everyone can be solely black or solely white. The grey area is beautiful.

The trolley witch? Stupid. Voldemort having a child? Stupid. Bellatrix Lestrange having a bastard child and her husband not killing her for never giving him a hier but giving the Dark Lord a child? Stupid. With how Purebloods works, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. They get rid of squibs and blast people off family trees for less. Maybe I'm too Slytherin but that's just how I see that. I'd have Avada-ed her real quick.

** Firstly, I haven't seen it done live so maybe I am missing something, but by the same token I've never seen Macbeth live yet still found it enjoyable to read the script. Ditto other plays. It wasn't the format of CC I didn't like. It was the content.

There were two things I liked about CC.

Albus and Scorpius being mates. I liked that. I liked that it inverts Harry and Draco's canon relationship. Plus, Albus is half Weasley so it put a pin in the Malfoys and Weasleys hate each other balloon. Good on the kids for leaving pre war prejudices behind.

The scenes where Hermione and Severus were working together to bring down the remaining DEs. That ticked two of my boxes for things I love most in fic - Sev pulling his head out of his arse and actively fighting for the light, and Hermione being appreciated for her intellect and deduction skills by someone who actually understands them, rather than just Ron staring at her in amazement because she read and repeated something and the concept of reading and retaining info is alien to him. I love fics where Adult!Hermione and Severus have a good working relationship or friendship (or even a romance as long as she's a proper adult of around 25). But that's the thing, this is something I like /in fic./ Even I accept that, despite this ticking my fic buttons, it doesn't fit well with canon and shouldn't have been in something marketed as such.

Things I hated about CC:

Everything else, literally. But specifically: Bad Dad Harry (nope, fuck off, Harry would be an amazing dad because he would be so conscious of wanting his kids to have the love, affection and acceptance he didn't get as a child), Voldemorts secret child with Bellatrix (who was never remotely pregnant looking or acting at any point in canon), the trolley witch (just no), and Death Eater Cedric (how DARE they do that to Cedrics memory).

*** I do think Harry as a struggling father fits well with canon though. Unfortunately, irl wanting a family/kids to love doesn't mean someone has the coping skills to do it.

Canon Harry consistently struggles to share his emotions and resolve conflict, often getting angry or doing his own thing. He's kind and does his best, but when it comes down to it doesn't really know how to comfort or let people in. As much as he's a teenager, he's also pushed from traumatic event to traumatic event with no consistent trustworthy/reliable adults to rely on or provide a base for him.

So, in Cursed Child it's known he has nightmares about the Dursleys - I do believe that having children would have brought it all up. Harry does TRY to parent Albus but he doesn't know how. He is reluctant to talk about his weaknesses/similarities with Albus even though Ginny thinks it would do them good.

He manages to get along with his other two children who aren't struggling and out of his area of comfort.

So, I do think it follows on from canon - unless we take the view that he developed those skills somewhere in-between. Really, though - there's only 6 years between the end of DH and the birth of James Sirius. Added onto that, if wizard's do have therapy, who would such a famous person with bucketfuls of secrets go to?

It's just, perhaps, a different trajectory than other people imagined.

As for Cedric, I believe it highlights how different life could be in other circumstances. Most people are only a few cheques from homelessness irl - how easy would it be for many to fall into addiction, or alternatively with the right support avoid it completely. Circumstance absolutely pushes teens into extremism. It doesn't mean that canon Cedric was hiding a dark side, so much as a 'could have been'.

** Everyone I've heard from who has actually seen a performance of the play insisted that it was /fine/ on the big stage. It's a fun story, full of Harry Potter references, but the silliness levels exceed the earliest books by miles and are tonally completely removed from the last three books.

I'm pretty convinced that if you just read the script page-by-page and don't have a whole theater crew trying to sell you on the experience, it's hot garbage. Absolute flaming trashpile.

But my ear to the ground told me that if you have kids the right age, don't mind terribly about the tonal and plotty differences between the two works and have a decent troupe performing nearby it /can/ be a lot of fun.

Just don't bring any rabid fans old enough to do narrativistic analysis halfway through, but that could also ruin a lot of the plays I've seen.

** I'm of the firm belief that people who outright diss Cursed Child fall into two categories:

1. People who don't know how to read/understand scripts
2. People who haven't seen it live and as such, can't understand many of the creative decisions

Personally, Cursed Child is one of the most phenomenal pieces I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It is technologically very advanced - there were even some moments that genuinely felt magical as I couldn't figure out how they made it happen.

Having said all that, I'm usually one of the first to rush to its defense but having the trolley lady participate in a fight was a,, questionable choice at best and really doesn't contribute anything meaningful to the plot.

I completely understand that people who have not had the pleasure of seeing it live may make the assumption that the characters are characterized peculiarly but it truly does make sense when performed. You don't have to agree with someone's reaction for it to be a valid way to react.

**** hmm, I can agree with the general direction of the plot being odd but my opinion in regards to the characterization definitely changed once I saw it live VS reading the script.

In particular, I have heard many people call Harry's reactions towards Albus out of character. I can understand that train of thought because he is harsh but he is also two decades older than what he are used to. Personally, I believe his "out of character-ness" is articulated beautifully through his nightmare, furthering his development + justifying his actions.

** Meh. Almost everyone who has seen the play loved it. 99% of the criticism comes from people who don't like reading play scripts (basically the whole world) reading a play script and expecting the same level of enjoyment they would get from a novel.

There's not much wrong with it in general. It's just an object lesson in picking the right medium for the job.

*** I've seen the play! Saw it in London in 2016 and I like the staging of the play --- thought the bits with the water in the stage was clever--- but I think that the characterization of the canon characters and misaligned writing as a result of that doesn't work.

*** That would be a reasonable response if people were saying that the writing didn't flow smoothly, that the pacing was off or conversations felt forced. No doubt those all feel different when it's actually performed.

But it's not an answer to the claim that the characters did things - like Cedric joining Voldemort - that are incompatible with their personalities as established in prior canon.

**** It's not just that, they're completely different formats. When you're used to reading novels, you expect much more depth (of information) than is typically found in plays. Background stuff is explained, thoughts are elaborated on, the author can take more time to fill in all sorts of gaps. And these are exactly the sort of things that people complain about in Cursed Child. I maintain that almost none of the main complaints are incompatible with canon; the issue is that they are presented briefly, rather than walking the reader through them. This is especially jarring to readers of fanfiction, who are used to incredibly bloated writing as the norm. A play or movie script is strictly limited by time, and Cursed Child is already a very long play.

I've explained about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hddrwh/what_is_the_greatest_leap_in_logic_youve_ever/fvluv2c/][Cedric]] recently. It's entirely plausible. But the other issue is that people are so immersed in fanon, they've forgotten about canon. People see it as unthinkable because fanon put Cedric on a pedestal. Same with Harry, even though as an abused child you'd strongly expect him to have significant parenting issues. Or there's Voldemort's supposed asexuality, of which there isn't the slightest hint in the books. There's no more incompatibility between Cursed Child and the original books than there is between the original books.

***** Much more succinctly than I've been managing to put it, but I completely agree. Oddly, pretty much everyone I've spoken to whose seen in irl felt that the characterisation was fantastic as a continuation.

I thought that Harry would struggle with parenting before CC came off, just based on his canon relationships plus experience of with parents of neglected children (by and large, they absolutely adore their children but unfortunately that doesn't pan through to providing a suitable environment). Longing for children/family doesn't mean people have the skills or coping ability.
