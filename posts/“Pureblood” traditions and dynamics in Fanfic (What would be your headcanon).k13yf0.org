Earlier todaywhile I was looking for fics that had political scenarios, the history student in me led me to investigate more about the nobility titles (shout-out to u / Ermithecow for their post about Lordship and titles) and customs that the magical world would have and how those would be included in a fanfic. Based on facts from the region's real history and culture, what customs do you think the more “traditional” wizards would still follow?

There are many factors that could be taken into account to explain the why of things for a wizarding society that still retains traditional elements that go beyond just not possessing Muggle technology. For example, simple things like dressing the boys in pink robes, since in the past this was considered a more masculine color as it was derived from red, or even make the sleeves of formal robes longer to cover their hands, it was common in Asia for the sleeves to cover their hands if they appeared before a person of higher rank to show obedience and be in a certain way "defenseless", more in a society that puts so much weight on carrying their wands with them (Even having your wand with you or in a wand holder could be common curtesy...) You can't imagine the essay I could write about why I think it makes sense that high-ranking wizards use long wide sleeves, things like that previously excess fabric and even restricting movement were associated with the rich because they could afford the extra fabric and inappropriate attire for work.

The language, social cues and even holydays could be completely different if the wizarding world had retained more of these in their culture. In fact, it is just what happens in the series Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven, by BakenandEggs in AO3, where this "traditionalism" is part of their culture, albeit focused on social-economic status (Ahem, a little elitist but whatever).

What I mean is, what is your opinion about the use of these types of elements in fics? In what aspects have you seen that this is well managed? Do you have examples or recommendations?

In addition to that, with the noble titles, I do not know if they work equally well for wizards since it is read between the lines that lineage has more weight than land inheritance, because the canon suggests that around the time the Wizengamot was created the magical community was scattered or divided in more nomadic-like groups. A better alternative would indeed be to tie any title to their last name.

I assume it would work more like... this Noble and Most Ancient House of XXX is overseeing any magical families in XXX territory, but they are not the original owners of the land as the Muggles are more in number and the land has been already divided in fiefdoms that may or may not align with the area assigned of each house. So, because muggle nobility and wizarding nobility have different connotations, privileges and tasks, you could use a made up order of nobility; we know canon resembles to the parliamentary monarchy, as the Noble houses usually have at least one seat each in the Wizengamot (Or at least they do in fics...)

Example: Prince Lucius of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy, Lief Draco of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy (given his status of presumptive heir) and then you could have them have more specific titles or give those to the second are or the closest relative from the main / branch family (Your choice if you tie it with land, like Landgrave of Wiltshire, Palsgrave of Salisbury, etc ...) and give them specific rules about who can or cannot inherit the title, or if it is even an hereditary title. As the descendants of the first councilmen / rulers of the magical community it is worth something to explore the possibility of titles like Prince (Like Saudi Arabia uses for the descendants of the royal family although the numbers are already in the thousands ...)

ANYWAY, sorry for this non-sensical rant, I'm just a little obsessed in Nobleman!Au's as of lately...


** My version of Pureblood Culture:

- Strong emphasis on charmed clothing and outer appearance
- Heirlooms or enchanted items that protect against Obliviation and other forms of memory charms, with the exception of the Imperius Curse
- Witches have comparatively far greater influence than Muggle women. In fact, one major gripe of Purebloods against Muggles is their discrimination based on sex and skin colors
- "The past was better" as a predominant attitude, thus, emphasis on tradition and dislike changes
- Rejection of Aramaic monotheism because of its hostility toward magic
- Strong belief in "Might makes it right", where the individual is placed in the center and glorified rather than formalities, like /here's 55 thousand types of forks, better know exactly in which order to eat with them or you become a mockery in society/

** So I started writing this response and I got kind of carried away. My answer will be split into several comments: two on the historical context which informs my opinion and one on my actual opinion about ‘Pureblood' culture. If you don't care about the context, just go down to the TL;DR at the end of this.

⁂

To understand the culture of late twentieth-century ‘Pureblood' wizards, it is necessary to first examine the historical context of the separation of the magical and non-magical communities. Before the Separation, Magical and non-magical people presumably lived together, and thus their cultures influenced one another greatly, to the point that I contend there was no ‘Wizarding' or ‘Pureblood' culture.

In 1689 (Deathly Hallows, p. 318), the Statute of Secrecy was signed, separating the societies of Magical and Non-Magical peoples throughout the world. At this time, there was a cultural shift on the part of both sides; for Non-Magical people, a generation after the commonplace occurrence of magic (and presumably the deletion or confiscation of obvious documentary or physical evidence), the Enlightenment began, and Europe's intellectual elite became sceptical of the existence of magic. No such intellectual movement occurred in the Magical population.

However, it is worth noting that prior to the advent of the Statute, there were essentially three distinct varieties of magic in the mind of Europeans: Elite magic, Common, Folk or Village magic, and Witchcraft.

The most relevant for the discussion of the creation of the statute is Witchcraft. While by the late twentieth-century ‘Witch' had become (within the Magical world) a gendered term meaning ‘a female magic-user', this was not the case in pre-Statute Europe. A ‘witch' was not /necessarily/ a woman: although in many countries women were overrepresented in witchcraft accusations, this is not true universally. In Russia, for example, more men were accused of witchcraft than women. No, a ‘witch' was a magic-user who was performing /maleficent/ magic, and who had entered into a pact with the Devil in order to do so.

Folk magic is also quite relevant, as it is the sort to which most Magical people would belong in the eyes of their Non-Magical neighbours. ‘Cunning Folk' were individuals who performed magic for their neighbours. Healing, finding lost goods, divination, &c. These individuals were not /disproportionately/ accused of witchcraft, but they /were/ accused. These were people who their neighbours /knew/ did magic. And while compared to non-magical people accused of and executed for witchcraft, Cunning Folk were not overrepresented, they most likely /were/ overrepresented in comparison to the size of the magical population, which was only a small percentage of the overall population.

Elite magic was the magic which was studied by academics. Alchemy, Necromancy (that is, contacting spirits, usually for divination or to learn hidden knowledge; /not/ raising the dead), Kabbalah, &c. These were practised by such figures as John Dee, Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa, Giordano Bruno, Nicolaus Copernicus Isaac Newton, &c. The practitioners of this magic were the gentlemanly, the educated, the wealthy. It is /these/ wizards (and they were all men, as education was not available to women) from whom such ‘Pureblood' families as the Blacks or Malfoys would likely descend.

The claim in /A History of Magic/ that very few real ‘witches' were caught during the many witch hunts of “medieval times” (Prisoner of Azkaban, Ch. 1) is quite clearly the result of either poor historiography of the part of Bathilda Bagshot (and as a more Doylist explanation, on the part of Rowling), or of /intentional/ historical revisionism. Bagshot's description of the witch hunts poses several problems:

*** 1. The witch hunts did not occur during “medieval times”. While there were very occasional instances of witches being accused and executed, the ‘witch hunts' typically refers to the sudden boom of witch-hunting which occurred following the publication of the /Malleus Maleficarum/ in 1486. This boom of witch-hunting did not occur in what is commonly considered the ‘medieval' period, but in the ‘early modern' period.

2. The vast majority of witch hunts were /not/ the result of Non-Magical people being “particularly afraid of magic...but not very good at recognising it.” They were, in almost every case, the result of common folk who had experienced problems such as illness, crop or livestock failure, impotency, &c. blaming their problems on /maleficium/, what would come to be called “the Dark Arts” by Magical people by the twentieth century. But for their problems to be the result of /maleficium/, there had to be a maleficent mage. A ‘witch'. The individuals who were often accused were not people who did things which were mistaken for magic, but people who were disliked by the accusers. That old woman on the edge of the village who always berated your husband for crossing through her garden on his way back from the fields? She must be the witch who gave him consumption. That trollop you caught your husband flirting with last week? She's probably using some sort of love spell on him. The blacksmith who you argued with about over-charging you for the nails to fix your loose floorboards? Maybe he's the one who made your cow stop giving milk. Et cetera.

But when someone had a disagreement or antagonistic relationship with someone who was a cunning folk, they would almost certainly be blamed for witchcraft just as readily as anyone else. It had nothing to do with misidentification of magic.

1. Finally, Bagshot's claim that “burning had no effect whatsoever” and that “Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burnt so much that she allowed herself to be caught no fewer than forty-seven times in various disguises” have problems with them. Assuming that “Wendelin the Weird” is a British witch (as Bagshot is British, and her /History/ is likely one of British magic), she would not have been burnt. The vast majority of the 112 ‘witches' known to have been executed in Britain were hanged by the neck, not burnt. At Salem, there were /no/ burnings; every executed ‘witch' was hanged (and Giles Corey was pressed to death during interrogation). If “Wendelin the Weird” was German, then the possibility of her being burnt is more plausible, but “allowing herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times” is unlikely at best; if the executioner noticed that the flames were unsuccessful, he would likely just resort to an alternative means of execution, such as hanging or beheading. Moreover, she would have needed to either travel around the country instigating witch hunts in which to be caught, or have confessed to the names of her “disguises” during a large hunt before escaping and allowing herself to be “caught” again. Alas, either way, while “Wendelin the Weird” may have enjoyed the “tickling sensation” of the flame-freezing charm, it is /unlikely/ that she would have enjoyed the torture which preceded execution. I doubt there is a charm to prevent the pain of the rack or the witches' chair (a chair completely covered in nails, to which the ‘witch' would be bound and under which coals or fire would be applied to cause the nails to become unbearably hot). Regardless of the veracity of “Wendelin the Weird”, the fact that the flame-freezing charm would not have helped /British/ ‘witches' avoid death means that the British Magical community would likely have been hit exceptionally hard by the witch hunts.

⁂

Thus, we can determine how the culture of ‘Pureblood' magical people developed following the Separation by examining the new society created.

There are two groups of people in this new, all-magical society. There are the commoners who had magic, the ‘cunning folk' of the pre-Separation integrated society, and there are the elites, those magical people who had wealth, influence, and most importantly, /literacy/. These were the practitioners of elite magic, who were vastly /under/represented in the witch hunts. It is my opinion that before the Separation, Hogwarts attendance was not mandatory, but that it was, like the Universities which had been founded at near the same time, a privilege of the wealthy and elite. But now, Magical Britain is on its own. It needs to develop a new society from scratch, rather than simply being an occupation or academic interest. And thus, even while Non-Magical Europe has its Enlightenment and Age of Reason, Magical Britain has its own major societal change. The Magical government, now devolved from the British parliament (it had been a ministry within the Non-Magical government, hence /Ministry/ of Magic), began to create laws which would assist in creating a society which could sustain itself despite a rather low population. Mandatory education, the establishment of ministries within the government (‘departments'), the creation of all-magical communities (Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, almost certainly others), &c.

TL;DR: The Separation between Magical and Non-Magical culture occurred at the end of the 17th century, and thus the culture of ‘Pureblood' magical people likely diverged from elite Non-Magical peoples' at this time. Before the Separation, there was no mandatory Hogwarts education, but afterwards, there was, to help build a self-sufficient magical society.

**** The culture of ‘Pureblood' magical people is similar to that of elite non-magical people before the Separation, but with a few noteworthy distinctions.

The emphasis placed on property is reduced. Among elite non-magical people, the most elite were the Landed Gentry, that is, those members of the Noble class who held titles which were attached to land. But the Magical society was now separate. While some families of magical people no doubt held such positions, many most likely did not. As we are never introduced to any magical people who use titles (With the exception of Tom Riddle, but he is a pretender to the title of Lord), we can assume that none of the individuals to whom we are introduced hold titles (After all, if Lucius Malfoy was an Earl or Viscount, he would /definitely/ be the sort to insist on people using his title). However, we can assume from Tom Riddle's use of ‘Lord' in his name that there /are/ Lords within the magical society, given his relatively isolationist political opinions. The leader of an anti-‘Muggle' group would certainly not use a title which is an exclusively ‘Muggle' concept, as this would alienate his followers. Thus, there /are/ titled nobility within the magical society. It is also therefore likely that there are /untitled/ nobility, or gentry, much like there are in the non-magical society. It is likely that the ‘Pureblood' class in Magical Britain are primarily members of this nobility.

From this, we can infer several things about them.

1. It is quite likely that they value wealth, but that one can remain a member of the nobility even without it. The Malfoys, for example, are considered very elite members of the magical society, despite having no titles. They are also quite wealthy. It is likely that they are exceptionally influential /because/ of their wealth, and thus that they are a particularly wealthy family within Magical Britain. On the other hand, less wealthy families such as the Weasleys are /still/ considered ‘purebloods', and while the very wealthy (Malfoys) look down on them for their poverty, there is still a begrudging respect for them based on their blood status. The lack of respect the Weasleys are shown by the Malfoys is due not to the Weasley's being ‘commoners' or ‘plebians', but because they are ‘blood traitors'; that is, they ‘betrayed' the pureblood nobility by supporting a political party which seems to support egalitarian policies. It is likely that the disrespect of the Malfoys for this is an outlier, and that less radical families would continue to respect the Weasleys despite their lack of funds and liberal political views.

2. I suspect that the life of the average ‘pureblood' is quite similar to the life of the average lesser noble prior to the Separation: Many formal events with other ‘Purebloods', which no one actually enjoys, designed to allow for networking for the purposes of business, courtship, and gossip.

3. They would observe a code of etiquette packed with small niceties and formalities which must be memorised in order to prevent people from being able to lie about their blood status. This may be reduced in comparison to the non-magical nobility, since there are simply fewer magical families and thus it is less difficult to verify the pedigree of a stranger, but I doubt it would completely vanish from the society.

4. Given the smaller nature of the society, the descendance of ‘Pureblood' culture from educated elite culture, and the relatively large role of the government (the Ministry of Magic takes a surprisingly active role in education, and it seems that the majority of magical people work for the ministry in some capacity, assuming the population numbers Rowling suggests are accurate), ‘Pureblood' society likely places a large amount of importance on both civil service and legalism. I suspect that any interaction between families would be codified with contracts and other documents.

a. From this I consider that the Marriage Contracts so ubiquitous within this trope would be less likely to be like those seen in many fanfictions and more likely to be akin to pre-nuptial agreements, the negotiation of dowries and/or bride prices, &c. See my previous comment on this topic here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/j3esu5/most%5C_wtf%5C_plotdevices%5C_youve%5C_ever%5C_seen/g7cdxyl/?context=3][https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/j3esu5/most\_wtf\_plotdevices\_youve\_ever\_seen/g7cdxyl/?context=3]]

1. Given the likely disproportionate effect of the witch hunts on the British magical population (despite /A History of Magic/'s likely inaccurate claims to the contrary; see context), I suspect that magical culture would distance itself from the Protestant Christianity which had played a major part in the hunts. I see there being four possible outcomes of this:

5a. The first, the Magical British culture would associate the witch hunts with Protestantism specifically, given that the witch hunts throughout Europe and in Britain occurred almost entirely after the Reformation, and in Britain after Henry VIII's split from the Catholic Church.

5b. The second, the Magical British culture associates the witch hunts with Christianity as a whole, and the majority of its population becomes atheistic over several generations (it would almost certainly not be immediate).

5c. The third, the Magical British culture associates the witch hunts with Christianity as a whole, but rather than becoming atheist, creates a new sect of Christianity which is more progressive in its views on magic, and perhaps even creates new sacred texts which glorify historical magic users. I personally imagine a re-written Bible which casts various figures such as Moses, Solomon, and Jesus as having been wizards (their ‘miracles' becoming ‘spells'), and including new texts about more recent figures such as Merlin.

1. The fourth, the Magical British culture associates the witch hunts with Christianity as a whole, but rather than atheism or a new sect of Christianity, creates or revives a new religion based on pre-Christian beliefs, either specifically British beliefs (Druidism &c.) or another set of beliefs (Graeco-Roman, Nordic, &c.).

** What is my headcanon? Quite different to yours... the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black is a bit of a pretension, it's not "noble" as in "nobility" but instead "noble" as in "noble". For example, the House of Oldenburg is just that, there's no prefixes or anything. Nobility (and royalty, e.g. Oldenburg) don't typically need to tell you they're noble. Similarly, I do not see family seats as a feature of Wizengamot.

Rather, I would basically position "pure blood culture" as garden parties, balls, artefacts (such as Muriel's tiara), family estates (including the Burrow), inter-marriage, nepotism, weddings, funerals and patronage (although, possibly, you prefer the term bribery to describe Lucius' use of wealth). I mean, look at all the details that Draco knows about the Weasleys and, to a lesser extent, Yaxley's expectations of Malfoy's peacocks. I have a phrase to describe this "Being Known and Being Known to be Known".

So... here we have the interesting question... do the Weasleys put the Delacours up because they're foreign and they'd have to stay somewhere, or is it something that pure bloods do? What about the home wedding? Just because these are things you'd expect or do happen IRL, that doesn't necessarily mean that wizarding families don't usually get married at home and don't usually have the wife's family over. Because, when it comes down to it, the Weasleys do operate as pure bloods, it's why they're still pure bloods by the time we meet them, despite their (or, at least, Arthur's) politics.

Most of my views on pure blood culture, Voldemort's blood purity war and, particularly, how the Potters and Gaunts interacted within it can be found [[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/sort-of-a-harry-potter-fanfic-4327e9e0a821][here, as it happens.]]

** linkffn(The Long Game) is a no-voldemort AU that has the best pureblood culture world building. The MC follows a visibly different culture with Hermoine providing contrast with the muggle world. Everything from traditions to language (actual old English usage?) is seamlessly demonstrated.

Also see linkffn(All According To Plan) by same author. This one is a bit more plot focused. Demonstrates Wizarding festivals and actual magical deities. Even longer than TLG with 1M words of extensive AU elements.

** Not quite "a Pureblood tradition", but related: The Pureblood Pretense has an excellent proposal for what "blood-traitor" means. It's a family that's technically Pureblood, ie four magical grandparents, but has a habit of bringing in fresh blood every few generations, then intermarrying until it's legally Pureblood again. (Which goes some way toward explaining how the Weasleys can have seven children while hyper-pure families like the Malfoys only manage one; they're genetically much healthier.)
