From what I've seen (and from a far bit of personal experience):

*Anything Critical or Bashing Hermione

*Any Sort of Ron praise

*Mugglewank, because muggles are tools of course

Feel free to add your opinions!


** I always been a supporter of Ron and I don't remember ever being downvoted (at least downvoted enough to be in the negative). I think that, as long as you present constructed, solid arguments, if possible with quotes from canon, this subreddit is pretty open minded.

Same thing for being Critical of Hermione, there was a discussion about how she should have faced consequences for her actions just yesterday.

​

I guess bashing Hermione may get you downvoted, but honestly, bashing anyone should get you downvoted. Bashing is bad, you can put a character in bad light without having to make him a poor caricature of himself.

​

Depending of what you call Mugglewank, I guess you may be right. Though to be fair, there should be a balance between "/Muggles are tools of course/" and "*OMG MUGGLES ARE SO COOL, MAGIC SUCK YOU CAN JUST SNIPE WIZARDS 360 NO SCOPE. THE QUEEN IS ALSO THEIR QUEEN AND THEY HAVE TO OBEY US. WIZARD ARE RETARDED AND LIVE IN THE VICTORIAN ERA, SCIENCE BEAT EVERYTHING* ...".

I will admit that I would totally downvote someone making this kind of argument, same thing than bashing, you can make interesting Muggles without having to make Wizards retarded, who almost need magic to remember to breath. (Though since I dislike Mugglewank in general, I would just try to stay clear from this kind of discussion).

****** But is magic even a talent? Magic in the HP universe is something people are born with and is passed down through genetics. It's not something you can achieve by studying or training, unlike a dropout who wants to someday earn an engineering degree. I can see magical /proficiency/ as a talent, but magic itself is a matter of biology.

******** Yeah, but unless you're severely disabled, you are theoretically capable with sufficient training from a young enough age, of reaching a very high level of talent in any given sport. If you were trained by a professional coach in football/soccer for example, from age 5 and with a professional dietician and trainer and coach and manager etc, playing for several hours a day and doing the extra fitness/strategy training on the side, you could reach pro footballer level by 18. It's unlikely, but it's possible.

Meanwhile you could train a Muggle from birth, teaching them to memorise and perfect hundreds of incantations, wand movements, potions recipes, historical facts, magical theory etc, with the world's foremost masters in each and every field devoting 100% of their time to it and the Muggle working 12 hour days every day, and they'd never be able to cast a levitation charm or a lumos.

The two are fundamentally different.

***** Creating spells takes a lot of work, so wizards don't really have that many to counter muggle inventions.

Of course wizards can just hide so they easily win wizards vs muggles, but a combined force of muggles and a few wizards using both magic and guns could crush a much larger wizard only force by striking at the weaknesses of magic.

Guns have a higher range and speed than spells so if a few muggleborn wizards to counter the enemy shields a muggle army could probably obliterate a bunch of purebloods who have no experience with muggle weapons.

In my mind magic is a boundless unimaginable power and no mundane invention or defense could stand against it because magic makes what's impossible possible(Granted within it can't do very specific things like bringing some one from death and such but still) I respect that everyone does not agree with this point of view and I consider them unimaginative.

Some people just can't tolerate ambiguous characters. Rowling created a character too complex for them to understand, so they fight to fix canon by simplifying him. Some other ambiguous characters (Dumbledore, Draco) get the same treatment, where they're either idolized or bashed, but Snape gets it worst.

Snape saw a young Harry getting chased by Marge's dog as well as various other memories. Canon Snape sabotaged Harry's grade by dropping his potions once. He might be anti-Voldemort, he might not be a sociopathic killer, but good. No. He was an ally in the same way the USSR was our ally in world war 2.

The point being he kept Harry alive because he is his "dead love's" child. Then when he finds out he has a soul piece, he tells him he has to die. A caring person would have helped when confronted with the Dursley's canon abuse. He did not and in fact commended the dog.

From what I've seen on this sub, spouting insults is likely to result in downvotes regardless of topic. People tend to side with whichever person in the argument appears to maintain the moral high ground, which is usually the person who appears calm and polite despite provocation.

HPMOR in this context is an interesting example of in-group vs. out-group dynamics. I've noticed that comments containing negative generalizations against HPMOR fans are not as downvoted, even though this sub contains many more polite HPMOR fans than rude HPMOR fans.

***** I'll admit to my hypocrisy that I find Harry and the Sisters Black hawt - but only with sufficient justification, like time travel to younger, less crazy versions of Bella. Narcissa gets a lot more leeway since we never see her actively evil in canon; she's just kind of resting bitch face there until she saves Harry's life (and Unbreakable Vows Snape for love of her son).

My head canon on Bella is that she was merely mildly crazy until her marriage contract to Rodolphus lead her to being broken by Death Eaters and brainwashed into Voldemort's service. This is probably male chauvinism.

My observation says Bella and Ginny are similar in many aspects:

- aggressive and violent
- devoted and fanatic
- hero worshiping
- reasonably intelligent
- magically powerful

I highly doubt Bella was one sadistic genocidal maniac at age 17, but following Voldemort and then fighting a brutal 10 years civil war should do wonder to her state of mind.

Her wand is Walnut-Dragon Heartstring, a pretty dangerous combo. Ginny's wand is Yew-Unknown, but I highly suspect Dragon Heartstring too. This is another dangerous combo as Yew holder is likely to be either a great hero or a great villain.

If Harry Potter ever goes down the dark route, expect Ginny to be his fanatic and terrible enforcer.

I just dont like most of the slash pairings, there are some interesting Femslash pairs, but not so much with the guys.

  People are allowed to have preferences.
#+end_quote

Preferences are one thing, but there are /indisputably/ a not insignificant number of straight men in the community who aren't just not interested in gay romances/smut. They downvote anything slash related, they expound at length on how all slash fic is terrible (despite never reading any of it), etc.

And they get real mad when called out on it.

*** I like magical cores and downvote people when they complain about them. Like, I don't think they're canon or need them in every story but magic is almost totally unexplained, magical exhaustion is canon, and they're a totally reasonable extension to canon if you want to use them in your story.

** Liking the Fic-That-Must-Not-Be-Named

I personally experienced opposite regarding Ron and any arguments about him being worse in the 7th book than Marietta was in the 5th.

Hermione is either saint here or wonderfully devil.

Also any argument with a popular person here is a target for downvoting regardless of how good your arguments are.

[Edit]: thank you for proving it :-)
