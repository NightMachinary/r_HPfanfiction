  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

** Put that way you've made me realize I've never read a Dark Harry story where he tries to overthrow Voldemort. Seems like it could be an interesting story, Harry wants to kill him but only because he wants to be The Dark Lord.

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.
