Du you guys know any fics where Dumbledore takes up a more active role in the education and development of Harry? If possible spanning several years, as well as not being solely about that storyline but maybe also some personal drama?

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** Linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip by ZebJeb) has this. Not a bad fic, but the constant apologist of cannon events/situations had me dropping out after a bit.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
