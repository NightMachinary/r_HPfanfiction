I am looking for the last several chapters of Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council by Tenhawk. I have up to Chapter 113. I think there were 117 or 118 when the fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com went down. I am also looking for Harry Potter and the Technomage by Methos. I did find several of the stories I was looking for from fanfic.tenhawkpresents.ink but it doesn't have everything from fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com. I have tried archive.org but since the .com used javascript heavly the archive doesn't work well and several stories were not picked up. I did find SCAU-DC Stranger in a Strange Verse up to Chapter 11. I don't remember how many chapters there were in that story.
