Would like to have Hermione in Ravenclaw and Harry in a different house.

Thanks!


** Well, in my latest complete story, it takes them years to get together (post-Hogwarts, actually, and almost 50 chapters), though Hermione's not in Ravenclaw, but was expelled at the start.

***** Apparently some people think that that's an appropriate way of indicating that they didn't enjoy the story, and thus they're unintentionally [[https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette][rude]].

****** No, it's just some people not liking me recommending my own stories, and/or not liking me, and downvoting me. I don't think they have read my stories.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
