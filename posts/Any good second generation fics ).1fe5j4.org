** Check out [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]]. It starts slow but builds into a great story.

** I've rec'd a lot of (mostly) next/second gen fics [[http://oddhouredproductivity.tumblr.com/post/42049412559/hey-recommend-other-hpff-fics-like-with-awesome][here]], and they're primarily romance and/or humor and complete unless otherwise stated. If you have something more specific in mind, I can rec more specific fics, but if you're new to next gen, I'd just suggest you go through these!

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5724013/1/The-Magic-Word-Is-Sorry-Not-Please][The Magic Word is Sorry, Not Please]] is a really great story about the Weasleys and Potters in what is James' 7th year. It probably has the best family dynamics of any that I have read. The sequel ties up the loose ends and give a bit of insight into the character's respective futures.

** Another noteworthy set of stories is the Mercury Chronicles by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374597/respitechristopher][Respitechristopher]], which spans several installments. The series is told asynchronously starting with [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180032/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Misspent-Youth][Albus Potter and the Misspent Youth]].
