** First one that springs to mind is /If I Die Young/.

Harry's killed by Vernon before ever getting to Hogwarts.

There's another one that springs to mind where he dies in the middle of the story, but since it's a /BLEACH/ crossover, it barely affects the story.

  They never thought he would live after they killed him. They never thought ghosts were real, but Harry has never let that stop him from haunting them. Please Review! Warning: Abused!Harry Beware of unhappy ending.

**** I think it's /Harry Potter the Visored/, but as I said, the Death has very little impact on the story, since the /BLEACH/ universe has gigai.
