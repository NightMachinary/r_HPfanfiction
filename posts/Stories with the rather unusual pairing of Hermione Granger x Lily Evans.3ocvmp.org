I was reading some rather generic 'Hermione travels back in time'-story where the author desperately tried to ship Lily with Severus by having Hermione fix everything wrong with Snape's character, and all I could think was 'all characters in this story are horribly written, I would rather see Hermione seducing Lily than Severus /life-is-so-unfair/ Snape or James /being-an-asshole-is-the-way-to-a-womans-heart/ Potter ending up with her'.

That thought ended up being far more interesting than the fic itself, especially because Lily and Hermione are so similar to begin with.

So, any idea whether a story with this very unlikely pairing exists? Maybe time-travelling Hermione influencing Liky just a bit too much, maybe Lily having enough of both Severus and James having jealous hissy-fits and then choosing someone else, or maybe Voldemort never killed the Potters and Hermione simply decides to bang her best friend's mom (possibly using a lot of inappropriate 'your mom'-jokes in the presence of Harry afterwards).

Suggestions?


** Found one (not written by me): Crush by watchitstark. It's a one-shot and just sweet. No porny residue.

  Hermione has a big gay crush on her best friend's mum, who doesn't know about it, right? HG/LE really really AU what is canon. For the Mix and Match Pairing Competition.

** linkffn(Elysium by mortenavida) is readable. It's actually hard to find fics with this pairing where you don't cringe every third sentence.

Somehow I really dislike Lily paired with either James, Severus or Remus. Some Lily/Sirius are fine, but I really enjoy other uncommon pairings. I've probably read more Harry/Lily than I should, Lily/Narcissa somehow fits, failed to find non-smut Lily/Bellatrix (which I'm incredibly sad for) and I'm in process of looking for some Lily/OC.

I'm really glad these kind of threads pop out once in a while, always find one fic that slipped through my previous search.

*** Does "readable" mean Grammatically Correct, or does it mean Decent Pacing/Plot?

Also, what are some decent Lily/Narcissa fics?

**** Grammatically correct (mostly) that is neither bad nor good, one that won't make you want to claw your eyes out because it reads like work of 12 year old, but in the end is nothing special.

Most Lily/Narcissa fics I remember are one-shots:

linkffn(Memory by Pelageya)

linkffn(Through the Gates by Meredith Bronwen Mallory)

linkffn(Cruelty by glasssnake)

linkffn(Watchers of the Skies by Kelly Chambliss)

linkffn(If You Wish by Haileyfan1)

linkffn(Selfish Way to Save the World by Rynna)

Some are better then others, some are smuts, but I find them at least "readable".

I've got list of a few tad longer than one-shots, but I can't recall whether they are good, bad or even if I've read them all, you will have to weed through, no guarantees on quality:

linkffn(6787306; 5750929; 9095583; 7225624; 5968180; 2515560; 4359649; 8181134; 5780299; 9762328)

I remember reading few where Lily/Narcissa was not main pairing/plot point, but can't find any them on PC. I really liked one of them and suddenly want to reread it. I should have it on my Kindle, will link it when I find it.

Hope you like at least one of the fics I linked, have fun reading.
