I know most series have their own take on galleon exchange rates, but what over never understood is the conversion. Harrys wand is 7 galleons, and the weasleys seem to think this a massive expense and not worth it for their children. 7 galleons in many fics I've seen is 35 pounds. How is that a big expense when it is by far the most important purchase a wizard can ever make??? The 25 pounds to a galleon or 175 pounds for a wand still seems cheap to me.

Thoughts?


** £5 to the Galleon comes from a [[http://web.archive.org/web/20091023035038/http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm][webchat]] with JK Rowling although exchange rates obviously vary as she mentioned in the article and numbers throughout the series have been far from her strength.

It's also important to note that the biggest impact will be cost of living and wages rather than exchange rates. It's all very well and good saying that's only £35 and not a lot for an important tool in your life but how much is Mr Weasley (and all the other magical folk) earning? £35 an hour, day, month, year?

It's like if you go on holiday abroad, your £200 spending money will go a lot further in say India than Norway. I think it's probably also important to note that just because they live in Britain and that Hogsmeade is the only purely magical village, magical folk as a whole don't seem to have a lot of interactions with muggles and the muggle way of life so chances are there isn't a lot of currency conversion going on beyond the muggleborns.

*** Some interesting numbers: The Weasleys won 700 galleons from the Daily Prophet draw. That was enough to take them all to Egypt, buy Ron a wand, and who knows what else with the remains. Harry won 1000 galleons in the Tournament and that funded opening WWW and all that entails. It certainly seems like galleons pack a punch.

**** Definitely. And if they're actually made from gold I could see why. If they're not it's still an issue though. I prefer to ignore Rowling's exchange rate here, it just seems incredibly unrealistic, all things considered. It would also make just about any muggleborn rich, which obviously isn't the case and wouldn't make any sense in a lot of other ways either.

***** I always operated under the belief that the Daily Prophet was heavily subsidized by the Ministry and its donors. Which is why it was always so cheep and so willing to go along with the Ministry propaganda until it became obviously false.

***** Do we know if it's Ministry run or privately owned? I wonder. Now I'm also curious as to how it's delivered. We know Hagrid get's it by owl in Philosopher's Stone, but that'd take a whole bunch of owls if they deliver every paper like that!

** In my worldbuilding I tied the exchange rate to the value of gold. [[http://imgur.com/8rEeFKi][I even made a calculator.]] If the exchange rate were actually £5 to the galleon, enterprising muggleborns would be selling off galleons and getting rich in the muggle world.

Also, (in my AU) the muggle and magical economies are more closely tied, for example magic can't create food.. a lot of it is imported from the muggle world. I also increased the size of the magical population, so even if there were magical farmers it would be hard to hide enough farmland worked by witches and wizards to feed the whole magical population.

** Given that the wizarding and muggle economy seem to be almost completely separated, being able to exchange money at all doesn't really make sense. There needs to be trade between them for the money of one to be worth anything to the other.

What would wizards even want to buy from muggles? They have magical farms, can probably enchant tools to craft most non-magical items, and are seemingly uninterested in more technologically advanced stuff or electricity.

I also imagine it'd be quite easy and hard to detect to somehow get muggle money through magical means for criminals (just confound someone into giving you all their savings, or duplicate and exchange it with non-duplicated money, or divine the future of financial markets), which is another reason why allowing free exchange would be a bad idea.

Instead, I prefer to think that the exchange witnessed in CoS is actually a social program by the Ministry for Muggle-Borns with a strict limit on how much money can be 'exchanged'. The extremely low exchange rate would then be more of a fee than anything else; it could be a relic of the time the Wizarding World went into hiding, when wizards were actually part of the normal economy, never to be adjusted for inflation.

*** Couldn't the goblins be doing things with the Muggle money that's exchanged to them? Like investing, stock stuff, or whatever bankers and money-people do. Have a couple Muggleborns to do the face to face stuff.

**** Why would they want to, though? What could money buy in the muggle world that couldn't be gotten much more easily through magic?

Also, given that goblins literally bury huge amounts of money under the ground, I somehow doubt their financial prowess.

***** Well, what else would they do with it? We don't really know anything about Gringotts, so I don't think we can safely assume anything about goblin banking. We've only seen three vaults.

** I think caring about this is pointless, and fics that do almost /always/ end up as cliche.

But hey, if it really matters to you, lets just say Ollivanders gets subsidized by the Ministry. It could easily account for his popularity over other wandmakers.

** While world building I try to equate that a first wand for children is heavily subsidized (single ingredient costs 10 galleons) and comes out to be ('15) $250, a non trivial expense that the weasels would avoid if possible. Non subsidised that would be $1000, And the cost of an unreleased racing broom would be the equivalent of a small car $20,000.

From there we work backwards to '91 $ then the wand is $148/$575, Broom is $11,506.

[[http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/]]

So galleon = $21 ('91) and $36('15)

Harry's broom cost 547 galleons, and his triwizard winnings ($22.4k) allowed the twins to jumpstart their business instead of being mail-order.

Adults blowing out wands makes ollivanders is a sustainable business but snapping your wand is no more annoying then dropping your iphone, and Harry's broom is bullshit expensive.
