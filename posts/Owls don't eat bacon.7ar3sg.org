Unless someone can tell me otherwise, owls, Hedwig included, don't eat bacon and can even die from eating prepared and cooked food. So why does it seem that every single dammed fan fiction has hedwig eating bacon??

Probably because the actual books have hedwig eating bacon?

You are right about bacon not being good for owls though. In fact Rowling herself said it was a mistake on her part.

#+begin_quote
  I made a few elementary mistakes when it came to my depiction of Hedwig. Firstly, Snowy Owls are diurnal (ie, they fly by day). Secondly, they are virtually mute, so Hedwig's frequent hoots and chirrups of approval and comfort should be taken as signs of her magically enhanced abilities. Thirdly, as countless well-meaning owl-lovers and experts kept writing to me in the early days, owls do not eat bacon (Hedwig enjoys a bit of bacon rind when she delivers post at breakfast).

** Meanwhile at Hogwarts Familiar Anonymous:

The snowy owl flew in and settled in on her stand.

"You ok?" Asked the Toad.

"I don't want to talk about it" said the Owl

"Oh come on" replied the Toad. "It is better if you let it out. What did he do to you?"

The Owl shuttered. "They locked me in a room and feed me strips of foul little meat." The Owl paused and looked at the supportive looks on the others faces. "Every time I tried to get away they waved their stick and suddenly I was ravishingly hungry." The owl made a face. "It tasted like two week old rancid mouse.

The Toad nodded sagely. "One time they took me and used their stick to change my skin colors. You don't know horror till you see your leg an off shade of aqua.". The Toad sighed. "Mamma always said to stay away from the stick wielders. I should have listened. I don't think I have seen a pond for years."

"You think that is bad", said the Snake, "Last year the one with a beard locked me in a room and grafted skin over my eyes. Eye-Skin!!" The Snake batted his eyes. "You know how hard it is to shed with these things?"

  Suitable meat that you may have in the house is raw chicken, rabbit or lean beef, but this is only suitable in the short term. Raw lamb, pork and cooked meats, including pet food, are not suitable foods, if eaten they may make the owlet ill or even kill it.

***** This is a terrible argument.

I don't really care avout the bacon thing, but if you're a fantasy fan, you can't just wave away every complaint or inconsistency with "IT'S MAGIC"

Hedwig is an owl. She seems smarter than a regular owp, and can fly to people to deliver their mail.

Beyond that, there's nothing in the books to make assume she has any other non-owl characteristics. We can assume she flies silently, for instance.

If Hedwig, instead of hooting, made a random meowing sound in Book 7, people would be rightfully confused, because owls don't normally do that.

I literally just did. It's. Magic. There is very little internal consistency to the Harry Potter universe, and even less that makes sense when you examine things as they are in the real world. Just suspend your disbelief and let Hedwig have some bacon and be thankful she's not suddenly turning into a hot girl for Harry to screw.

** Fanfiction authors tend to take a single mention of something and then repeat it ad nauseam. The bacon is mentioned /once/ in the books, therefore owls eat nothing else.

#+begin_quote
  Harry pulled off Sirius' reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully. (GoF Ch. 15, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang)
#+end_quote

Bobmin used spinning portkeys as a plot point, so suddenly all the other authors use them casually.

#+begin_quote
  The other thing we've changed is the concept of the portkeys which we envision to be this whirling spinning thing. (The Power of the Press)
#+end_quote

Lupin's "furry little problem" is mentioned /once/ in the books. Now it's apparently the only acceptable way to refer to Lupin's lycanthropy, preferably several times per chapter. Once +is+ was cute, twice is too many. Here's a Galleon, buy yourself some imagination and write something original.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my “furry little problem” in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.' (HBP, Ch. 16, A Very Frosty Christmas)
#+end_quote

I'm sure there are plenty of other examples where a single instance of something in canon /infects/ fanfictions to the point of parody.

*** But the sentence you quoted seems at least to suggest that James referred to his curse as a "furry little problem" so often in the company of others that "many people were under the impression" that Remus had a rabbit. I would think that yes, this was an established means of talking about the secret in public.

**** Possibly, but James is dead, and nobody's heard the expression for more than a decade.

My biggest problem with "furry little problem" is that it's massively overused. It's "cute" which works as well as telling a joke twice. And I've never seen any other expression used.

"Monthly/periodic/recurring inconvenience/problem"

"He's grouchy now and then, you know, like a woman."

"He likes long walks in the moonlight. With his male friends. Naked."

"He can really clog the drain at times."

"He's a furry. I've seen him suited up."

"He's in touch with his inner animal."

"He's usually nice, but he can be a real beast."

"Sometimes he really hates people."
