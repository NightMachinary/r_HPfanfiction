So as the title stated im looking for reading Fics, however im not looking for the over-used "reading the books" stories, instead im looking for fanfics where hogwarts or a group of people read another fanfic. I have already read "Reading the Darkness within" and "The Dark Phoenix". I don't mind whether the fanfics are on FF or fictionhunt.

Thanks.
