This was a [[/r/Showerthoughts][r/Showerthoughts]] moment but I realised that in most fanfics, Poppy's personality is incredibly consistent with the canon characterisation. In a fandom where Slytherin Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass (despite said character only being mentioned a couple of times and having little to no personality) and Love-Potion Ginny and Molly Weasley (despite there being little to no proof of that ever happening) commonly exists, this is a rather fascinating discovery for me.

Note: This discovery was brought up from a currently sleep-deprived and numbingly-bored mind.

** I don't remember which one, +either Goblet or Phoenix,+ but Molly was talking about using love potions to Ginny and Hermione - wasn't amormentia, and it certainly wasn't used on Harry - but Molly using love potions is canon.

It never went anywhere, and was basically a throwaway line, but it's still there.

This also has nothing to do with the original topic, but I have nothing to really add to that, other than pointing out that thing about love Potion.

Did they actually brew love potions? I know Slughorn showed them /Amortentia/, which is a good thing coz students should know how to identify such Potions, but I don't recall actual brewing being ever stated.

I don't disagree with you on this but to add, it also shows how the author treats the subject of love potions especially when (maybe even /because/) the target is male. Romilda's assault on Ron (and yes, it is assault IMO) is treated very cavalierly by everyone around him, himself included. No action is taken against her that I can recall, and Harry, Hermione, Ginny or Lavender never mention it again. Then, there's Merope's rape of Riddle Sr where her fate is treated as sad but Riddle Sr is heartless for abandoning her.

Molly's mention of love potions can go either way based on how the author treats the topic /after/ this event. In canon, it is treated horribly badly. It says a lot about how the wizarding community treats the subject.

It could be done better though.

Imagine for example, Molly was preparing for her Potions NEWT and was working on a better love potion /antidote/. She needs to test how effective it is and her then boyfriend Arthur Weasley volunteered to be the test subject. They tested it in private, and Molly, ever the prankster, let Arthur make a fool of himself for a while (cue giggling), before giving him the antidote. Arthur is pretending not hear Molly tell the story while reading his newspaper, and Hermione tells Harry the details later when he asks what they were giggling about.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

But that's just bad writing though. Not every good person is /universally/ good, and a lot of otherwise good people have some horrible beliefs. It's fair to call Molly out on it based on canon. The premise itself isn't flawed, just the delivery.

******* They don't brew the potions but Slughorn says they should be able to brew this potion by the end of their 7th year. The twins sell them at their shop. And I get calling Molly out on it, only it feels somewhat odd to me given that that's the general attitude so I'd prefer it to be an issue raised as a way to change the general attitude. There's a matter of hexing people and laughing at them for instance. And Harry hexes Filch, who is a squib, but no one says anything to him about that. There's a lot of messed-up stuff going on there. But I think the reason I am not particularly interested in it is because then this stops being an enjoyable series. The same way I wouldn't enjoy reading about Pomfrey being sacked for not noticing the signs of child-abuse. Reality and Harry Potter don't always mix well.
