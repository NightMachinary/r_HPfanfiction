Matthew Finnegan - The son of Lavender and Seamus . Is very open and accepting of others due to how his mother ( who survived the Greyback attack but was heavily scarred ) taught him to look past appearances. Retained his father's explosive tendencies . A Ravenclaw despite expectations.

Lawrence and Ingrid Corner - The twin children of Padma and Michael. Both Ravenclaws. Neither tend to display their emotions to a great degree but they are both still friendly and popular.
