I'm working on a fic about everyone after the final battle, and I'm toying with the idea of new ghosts at Hogwarts following the final battle. It is certainly the type of event that would lead to ghosts.

I'm pretty sure Fred goes on, but what about Collin Creevey? Or any of the others that died?

If not a cannon character, does it make sense that there would be one or two new ghosts at Hogwarts following the battle? Students or otherwise that died?


** Considering many of the students died violently in a time where they could not be emotionally stable - before they had time to develop as a person or, you know, live - it's pretty easy to see there being at least one new ghost at Hogwarts. I don't think that any of the main cast would have stayed because they had each other. But everyone else? The people we don't know? The odd Slytherin that didn't really have a choice regarding where they where sorted? Or the Gryffindor that went down protecting those younger than them?

*** That's true, maybe an older sibling who was only there to protect their kid sister/brother, and they stay behind to continue to do so?

**** Exactly! That seems like unfinished business, and the right reason for someone to stay behind if we follow conventional ghostly lore.

** If Lavender Brown died (the books aren't clear), I could see her sticking around to be the school gossip and helping Gryffindor girls with makeup tips.

*** Imagine if she was aggressive about this. You are a girl getting ready for a date and suddenly that ghost appears and mocks your outfit/makeup and so on.

*** OMFG YES! Seriously though, can you imagine? She had so much depth to her that never got to be explored.

That said I don't think I'll do any named characters from the books as ghosts. I've thought about it, I just don't think I'd write it properly.

** I haven't thought too much about who, exactly, would stick around, I just sort of figured it was a given a few would stick around. Not all students either. A Death Eater ghost would certainly be a problem down the road. I imagine there's magic to force a ghost out of somewhere (how many real-world rituals are there that supposedly do the same thing), so it probably wouldn't be a real problem in the long run, but it could still happen.

Personally, if I were to make a known character a ghost, it'd probably just be in a passing mention, like including a ghost with a camera as part of a description of a crowd. Say more with less and all that. If you really want to establish a new ghost, it might as well be a new character. Like you said, Fred probably wouldn't become a ghost (though he could), nor would any of the other named characters. Not saying you couldn't, but I think they'd have to be the focus of the fic if you don't want your readers to start getting distracted. Obviously that'd run counter to any other fic.

Of course, you've got plenty of unnamed deaths on both sides, so you've got free rein to do basically whatever you want.

Also, I want to point out that while Voldemort probably couldn't become a /ghost/, he was killed at Hogwarts, and he didn't move on.

*** With the Voldemort case, you could likely swing it as a shade, or revenant, something similar to his wraith form but visible and without power.

I hadn't thought of that... I'll have to include that somehow, more like a creepy feeling than anything else but still....

As far as a passing mention, I think I'm more likely to just make a new character that fits cannon but is OC.

** I think the most likely to be new ghosts would be the Death Eaters - some of which were probably drawn to Voldemort by his quest for immortal life. It makes sense those would be some of them to linger.

Hmm nasty Death Eater ghosties pouring poison into the ear of "ickle firsties" and continuing the spread of blood purist ideals as countered by others like the portraits of Dumbledore etc might be interesting.

*** It's a good idea, but I've always imagined that most Death Eaters were drawn to Voldemort out of fear.

Not to mention that writing it would be problematic- it would have to be resolved as a problem, and I'm not sure how to do that realistically...

**** Well, you have the children you can use as the focus - the story could be about how the children learn to make better choices /because/ of their interactions with the ghosts of the Death Eaters, thus they linger as a cautionary tale. Or you could use it as the hitching pin of a quest story where the students undertake to learn more about the magic that creates a ghost, what binds them here, if whatever unfinished business that held them here is completed can they choose to "go on" - can they be forced to?

I think there is ample room to make create something workable.

***** True. I'll have to consider it some more and decide what to do before I get it posting.

Thanks!
