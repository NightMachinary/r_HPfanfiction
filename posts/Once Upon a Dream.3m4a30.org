** I like SSxHG but I'm not even gonna bother. It makes me cringe just reading your description

** I'm not hg/ss shipper, but i feel like this story would benefit if their attraction to each other was more slowburning. I can imagine snape initially maybe getting interested after the whole Marietta incident. He sees her more vindictive side, instead of just simply the know-it-all muggleborn Gryffindor. Something to set her apart from being Lily 2.0. I'm also think it would add an extra dimension to your story if there was something interesting going on at Hogwarts that we didn't see in canon (you can use this to push them closer together).
