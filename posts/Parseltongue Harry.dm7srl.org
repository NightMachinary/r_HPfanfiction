Can you guys please recommend dark Harry Potter fanfics, ones about dueling,him being a parselmouth, or a Slytherin. Basically a darker Harry?


** Here's a couple of my favorites. Sorry none really focus on the parseltounge aspect.

When Peter Pettigrew DOESN'T escape from Remus, Sirius and Harry and instead is turned over to Headmaster Dumbledore, it changes Harry's life.

We pick up the summer after 3rd year (please see the timeline note, thank you) with Harry moving into a renovated Grimmauld Place with Sirius and Remus. Mostly canon through Prisoner of Azkaban.

Dark!Harry does not mean he's going to go around killing people, so let's stay away from that assumption. Okay? Thank you. :)

How does Harry react when he finds out the truth behind all of Dumbledore's secrets from Voldemort? Simple... he plots to kill them both. The only question is whether he'll change him mind about one of them in the end. SLASH - HP/LV

In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn.

Then he gets the bad news: he'd been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

This one in progress and has updated recently!
