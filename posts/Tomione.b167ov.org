Give me all your Tomione recs. Long stories, short stories, all of them. Oh, and can you make it personal? Like share (spoiler free of course) what you liked about each story you rec.


** Oh yes! This I know, I've read all the tomione fanfiction on fanfiction.net and AO3. Literally all of them to the point where I'm refreshing the update page for new ones (sad, I know)

Here's my top stories

- Birds of a Feather by babylonsheep (Amazing historical accuracy and great characterisation. Updated almost every day)

- Unsphere the stars by cocoartist (Amazing characterisation and epic world building. It spawns several decades)

- A Change in Priorities by Seanymphe (Characterisation is spot on and very interesting exploration of student/professor relationship. Tom's PoV is superb)

- Blood and Gold by ObsidianPen (Amazing start, the best 1st meeting between Tom and Hermione I've ever read. Slow updates unfortunately)

- The Power Vacuum Conundrum by Elbow-Rubber-Duck (Interesting premises, has a lot of potential)

- Fostering a Nightmare by NinjaFairy86 (in fact most of her stories are great. Great character development, forbidden and complex relationship)

- Addendum: He is Also a Liar by Ergott (Fantastic characterisation, really interesting premises that even after 28 chapters is still a mystery)

- Ain't no rest for the wicked by Nautical Paramour (I'm not usually a fan of non-magical AU but this one is amazing)

- Choosing Grey by Beta Gyre (Interesting and complex plot with political intrigue thrown in for good measure. The sequel also seems to be pretty good)

- Dark Anomalies by Spork-in-the-road (Really nice character development with a satisfying end)

- Bleed for me by Meowmers (Still WIP, not many chapters but worth the read)

And I think I'll leave it at that, may edit this with a few more once I'm not on my phone. Hope you'll find some of these (if not all) enjoyable reads.

*** I second Blood and Gold. Her stories have so much texture. It also has the added bonus of being set during Tom's time at Borgin and Burkes.

*** I can't second 'Birds of a Feather' enough. •Great plot •Great pacing •Great grammer •Great, and most importantly, BELIEVABLE character development • The characterization and romance is believable and on point

I know it feels like I'm advertising a product on the shopping channel, but this is a gem of a fic. Highly recommend.

** My favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4630606/1/Fourier-s-Flaw][Fourier's Flaw by SiriusBlacksGodDaughter]]. For me, this is the closest to what I would expect Tom to be like whilst at Hogwarts. The story definitely has its flaws, namely that in the meetings conducted by Tom and his future Death Eaters. And the Grindelwald storyline is a bit strange and doesn't really fit with the story itself. But Tom and Hermione's interactions are really well done. That's what pulled me into the story, and kept me reading it. Also, another plus is that it's completed.

​

Another good one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4420759/1/What-The][What The? by Madam Dee]]. This takes on a 180 on typical Tom/Hermione stories in that it's actually really funny, especially with how Tom and Hermione interact at Wool's Orphanage. However, there are spelling/grammatical errors (though not overdone so that it's unreadable), and isn't completed.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3566859/8/The-Three-Portals][The Three Portals]] is a good read in that much of the story deals with Tom and Hermione at Hogwarts. In the beginning, there isn't any undercurrent as to why Hermione went back in time, but instead deals with them in classes and trying to out-perform the other in academia. It kind of reminds me of canon when Harry, Ron, and Hermione were in class learning about magic. Of course, the story deviates from this as it progresses but being how intelligent Tom and Hermione are, it's fun to see them go head-to-head. This one is also completed.

​

And that's really it. Many Tom/Hermione stories sadly just aren't that good. It's hard to write Tom's character (as I'm currently writing my own Tom/Hermione story) but authors have him too far left or too far right. Many writers of Tom tend to forget that he was charming in the sense that he actively participated in classes, shown magical brilliance, and was a true, role-model student for others to aspire to. I don't believe he smirked all that often, nor do I think he'd ever kiss the back of Hermione's hand when first meeting her. (And coming from Tom Riddle, I'm not sure if that's supposed to "charming" but I find it downright creepy.) He was able to fool nearly everyone at Hogwarts, save for Dumbledore, and was never openly active in the nefarious-like deeds that took place at Hogwarts (he was involved behind the scenes but never campaigned that he was the one who opened the Chamber of Secrets).

​

And how he interacts with Hermione is another issue I have with stories involving them. A lot of the time, Tom is, for some reason, completely open with her but nobody else. Many stories that have this plot purport Hermione is a time-traveler and Tom has taken an interest in her because she's a new student. I think with any other ordinary character, that's viable excuse to make for interaction. But Tom Riddle isn't ordinary. He would seem closed-off and would study Hermione from a distance to try and determine who or what she was and why she came to Hogwarts so late (i.e. not as a first-year). It's just off-putting Tom would suddenly come up to her after class, introduce himself by kissing the back of her hand, and offer to show her around, before pushing her in a corner and snogging her because Hermione's curves came out in the right places as she grew older, and she was able to tame her frizzy hair into soft, chocolate ringlets that danced down her back. I mean, seriously!

If you attribute most of the poor characterization choices and questionable relationship dynamics (Tom stalking, blackmailing, and pushing Hermione around before deciding he wants to bang) down to author self-insertion and wish fulfillment fantasies, everything makes way more sense. In most of these kinds of fics, Tom is basically your average YA novel high school stud, while Hermione is the plain but "cleans up nice" female protagonist with minimal personality whom Tom is inexplicably attracted to (Why the hell would he care about some random student?), and the plot is a "Will They, Won't They" with extra steps.

This is why this, along with Dramione/Snamione get downvoted in the sub, because most fics with this ship follow the same cues and unrealistic white-washy characterization.

**** For sure, and it's a shame really. It makes me think that readers of Tom/Hermione are a small group of people that only want one thing out of such stories involving the two of them. Stories of Tom and Hermione could be grand and epic but authors like to water-down any potential so they can shoehorn them into a forced romance. And most of the time, the romance isn't even done well. I honestly hate reading any stories involving self-inserts and have never actually done so. Too bad, but what can you do. Also, I've been checking out the stories you recommended a few days back and I have to say, the first two, though well-written didn't grab my interest. The third one, though, Choosing Grey, is very interesting. I haven't finished it yet (which is why I didn't recommend it here) but it was just what I was looking for. I mean, it isn't perfect and some things have me rolling my eyes (e.g. Tom offering his arm for Hermione to take as he escorts her to class) but overall, it's good.

***** Your reaction to the rec'd fics is interesting.

I found the first 2 better written than Choosing Grey, and had the most accurate Tom Riddle characterization, which I am a stickler on and notice whenever he sounds off, unrealistic, or like a fanon caricature. I'm not a huge fan of Tom Riddle shipping fics in general, because sexual attraction or physical desire on Tom's part feels inherently unrealistic and OOC, based on how he's characterized in canon as someone who sees himself above the "petty and inferior mortals."

  ...He was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasion... not anger... that was for weaker souls than he...

Ch 17, DH

So the main issue with romance-based fics involving Tom Riddle (and this applies to Tom/Harry or Tom/Whatever) is that a realistic 16-70 year old Tom wouldn't be interested in romance, dating, or any kind of love life in general, because his main interest is himself. By the time he starts identifying himself as Voldemort, even before he makes Horcruxes, that's when he's stepped into peak egotism... and it's also the point where most time traveling love interests meet him for the first time.

****** I mean, I agree the first two were better written than Choosing Grey. But I'm more interested in Tom/Hermione interaction at Hogwarts as students themselves, and upperclassmen as well. I believe the second story you recommended was a "childhood friends" story, and the first one, in my opinion, too just a bit too long to get to Hogwarts. I don't mind romance but that romance has to be dissimilar to typical romances, just because Tom Riddle is Tom Riddle. I know it's unrealistic with involving him in any sort of romance angle as he made his first Horcrux whilst at school, but it's just a small guilty pleasure of mine. Unfortunately, I haven't found a story yet that balances Tom's egotism, and a Hermione romance on the side. You could argue it's impossible and lie on opposite ends of the spectrum, and would be wickedly hard to accomplish, but it's something that I'm searching for.

******* The second one is actually a "friends to lovers" slowburn story, as I believe it's meant to cover the whole 7 years at Hogwarts. They get to Hogwarts by Chapter 5, but it takes a while for Tom to recognize how he feels about his feelings. The character tags mark it as a romantic pairing.

I agree that Tom Riddle, if he ever gets into a serious relationship with someone, would not have a conventional romance. However, in most ship fics, this "unconventional" relationship written as a semi- or fully abusive, dom-sub, power imbalanced relationship where Tom tries to control his partner's life, and his partner has no choice but to live with it, but it's okay, because "I love him and I know he does it because it's his way of showing he cares".

A more realistic relationship with Tom Riddle is one where he is extremely co-dependent on his partner, constantly seeks validation, wants his partner to be an emotional enabler. Basically he's a Stage 5 clinger. Which isn't sexy in any way, but /is/ a realistic manifestation of his congenital mental instability and his childhood emotional neglect.

This makes sense to me because Voldemort isn't a sexy person, but an extremely neurotic one who covers himself up with charisma, manipulation, and superficial charm. No healthy person gets off on making other people kiss the hem of his robes.

** My favorite Tomione fic is by far Nothing like the Sun by talloohlips who, unfortunately, is on a hiatus right now, but you'll still be able to find the fic on AO3.

If your expectations are unrealistically high (like me) and sometimes drop a fic because of a line or two said very out of character (yes, it's harsh, but it's usually a sign that I won't like the rest) then I think Nothing like the Sun is perfect for you. It's set in the canon period with the trio and major characters as you know them--- Dumbledore, Malfoy, Sirius, Remus, etc.--- but Tom Riddle and his knights are there as well. And I don't think I've ever read a fic so spot on with sticking true to the characters' personalities, so much so that I have the same fuzzy, warm feeling in my chest that I get when I read the original series. I particularly love the way Draco is written because it perfectly resembles his canon-self.

But back to Tom and Hermione! The interaction and dialogue between them is wonderful, funny, and tense. Everything they say and do gets the chapters flipping--- I think I've reread it about ten times now. Basically, I think I struck gold when I found Nothing like the Sun. It captures the emotions and motives of each character extremely well, making for a comfy as well as a gripping story. Please check it out, and tell me what you think!

** I just finished this little gem called “Romantic Idealism” by Meowmers [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11837220/1/]]

It's pretty hot and not remotely contrived. Everyone is in character and the plot contains cannon elements that took some fairly creative but seamless rearrangements. He's a prefect during Hermione's 2nd year. She has a crush on him. Then chamber of secrets stuff snuffs that crush right out. Then he graduates and is gone for a while. But she's got his number and he's got her's already when returns to teach DADA in her 7th year.
