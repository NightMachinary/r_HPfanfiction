I love world building, what are your favorite fics with unique and well explained common rooms?

Either brand new common rooms in new schools/Hogwarts, or retellings of the original Hogwarts Common Rooms are cool!


** The fic I'm co-writing right now has a unique Slytherin common room, and we're worldbuilding fiends, haha.

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?
