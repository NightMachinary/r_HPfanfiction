In that fic his soul gets yote back into the past and fuses with Lockhart instead of a second year version of himself leading to shenanigans and general Tomfoolery. What if something like this happens but with different characters at different time periods, Molly, Rita, Fudge, Bellatrix, Umbitch, young Snape, all of the Marauders at the same time, I say the crazier the better!

I just think it would be really interesting to explore how these conflicting wildly personalities with conflicting goals and morals would merge forcefully into one being and how they could affect the story! Sadly I'm not a very good writer but if you want give it a shot or speculate please do!!!
