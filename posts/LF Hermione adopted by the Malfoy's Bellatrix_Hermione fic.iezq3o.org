:END:
In the fic the Malfoy's adopt Hermione for some reason and make her out as a half-blood. Lucius has to introduce young Hermione to Voldemort who takes a liking to her and views her as an apprentice. This relationship leads to the entire malfoy family acting as spies for dumbledore. Narcissa never bonds that we'll with Hermione but she and Lucius are very close. The story ends with Bellatrix /Hermione and they have a mind link.
