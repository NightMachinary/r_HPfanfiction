I don't know why, but I'm just curious about the Malfoy and Weasley feud at the moment.

I recently read a fic where the Weasley Twins sent Draco a ferret as a birthday present (in which he was not very appreciative of). The Twins were simply angry at the Malfoys for everything they had done. They could not do anything about it, so they targeted the younger Malfoy. However, after the war ended, Fred was gone by then. I think both of the Twins had the present prepared ahead of time.

This is the fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686537/1/The-Ferret-Feud][The Ferret Feud]] by theinkwell33 linkffn(11686537) Status: Complete

Anyways, this story made me want to find more like it. A fic where it emphasizes the feud between both the Malfoys and Weasleys. Long or short, I can read just about any with an interesting prose.


** One of the many, many sub plots in prince of slytherin has the two blood lines hate each other because: magic. Not a focus of the fic however

*** Common fanon is that a witch was supposed to marry a Malfoy but eloped with a Weasley, and the Malfoy cursed the Weasley family for it.

*** I know it's not. As I wrote in the post, I read a fic that sort of emphasizes it, which was when the Twins targeted Draco. It's not really a feud, but more of stoking the dislike between the families.

Even if there was not really a cannon feud, the Malfoys and Weasleys really do not like each other. One instance was when Arthur tackled Lucius in Flourish and Blotts after their confrontation. Or when Ron talks about how dark the Malfoys were or when Draco insults the Ron's family to his face.

I was asking for stories kind of like that.

  The Weasley twins send a ferret to Draco Malfoy on his birthday for one last laugh. It might be the weirdest gift he'll ever receive, but it could also be the best. Oneshot.

** Someone help me out here--I know there's a smart!Harry fic where we figure out there's a malfoy-weasley feud. Is it linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of Slytherin)? I think it's that one, but if it's linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches) I wouldn't be shocked.

**** Yeah, I remember how exasperated he was that no one else thought it was odd that Lucius Malfoy got into a FIST FIGHT. Sounds like the little detective from PoS . . .

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
