:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a specific fic I read quite a while ago.

​

Among the things I remember is that Harry was a kickboxing champion and trained with, I think, Lisa Turpins father.

​

He also went on a visit to the gym where he trained and was brought along for an exhibition at a muggle school where he met and beat the shit out of Dudley in a match.

​

If anybody could help me find this fic I would be very grateful, it was a decent one with a few unusual twists and I would like to read it again.
