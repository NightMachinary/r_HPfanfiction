I remembered that there was this drarry fanfiction where they were in the eighth year, and there was this scene.

What I think happened was that Draco was forced to join Dumbledore's Army, and they were all sat around in a circle. They were required to say their name and a muggle skill they were good at and a wizard skill they were bad at, and Dracos answer for the wizard skill was nonverbal spells.

Has anyone read this fanfiction before, and if so, do you remember the title? I'd really like to read this fanfiction again
