Is it when the character is shown to be bad period?

Is it when the character is interpreted more negatively than they were in canon and maybe called out for it?

Is it only if they get made like villainous or evil?

Does it only count if they get exaggerated?

Or is it anything thats critical?

What about making a clear bad guy in a vague or ambiguous situation that exists in canon. It could theoretically happen but your interpretation makes one character look worse. Is that bashing?

What do you guys think?


** Bashing is when you take a character and multiply their bad traits and completely ignore their good traits. You constantly show them in a bad light and never show them doing anything good for the main hero, they always do something antagonistic to the Protagonist and never learn from their mistakes.

Ron is always lazy, rude, angry and jealous, Hermione is always a "I know best" kind of person, never question authority, doing things against the wishes of your friends, Ginny is always a slutty gold digger who's only after Harry because he's Harry Potter, Dumbledore is always Greater Good evil moustache twirling mad man out to steal Harry's money.

**** People still grow with or without Harry being there. Character bashing is treating someone like nothing more than they're negative traits while ignoring any potential for character growth or depth of character. I listed off common ways those characters are bashed because most of the time the events that transpire to cause those characters to grow still happen in people's fanfics, the authors just choose to ignore the growth because hur dur dumbles is bad and snort snort Ron's a bad friend and hurrrrrr ginny's a slut

** I've personally never heard of, for example, Snape or Draco bashing. Taking morally ambiguous characters and making them evil doesn't seem to make the cut based on that.

I'd say, for me personally, it's when a character portrayed as good in canon (even when they've done morally questionable things like Dumbledore) have all nuance removed to make them a bad guy. Usually that requires exaggeration: Ron's jealousy, manners, etc are made worse while his loyalty and sense of humor reduced for example. The other thing that I think is necessary is that they don't adapt and learn. I don't think it's bashing to have Ginny be jealous of whoever Harry dates, but she can get over it and still be their friend, or she can be bashed to hell and brew amortentia for Harry. Dumbledore did place Harry with the Dursley's, but if the abuse is exaggerated as much as many fics do, and he's still adamant it's the best place for him, that's no longer a mistake on his part, it's some kind of malicious intent and crosses over into bashing

*** It's because morally ambiguous characters suffer from another phenomenon. I call it "Glorifying." It's the opposite of bashing. The author likes a character so much that they emphasize a character's good qualities and erase their negative aspects. I should make it clear that I consider it as a glorification only if there's no character development at all. The changes on the character, for example, Draco suddenly being mushy and touchy feely with the Gryffindors happens for no reason at all on chapter one. Give Draco, Snape, hell even Voldemort himself a redemption arch--I have no problem with that-- but make it believable to the reader. Make the reader think, "Yeah, I can totally see Draco acting/feeling like this if so and so happened."

That's where the line should be drawn. As long as a character's actions, no matter how much they differ from canon, are portrayed in a believable way it should be fine.

*** I mean, Harry didnt note anything spesific when his aunt tried to hit him with a FRYING PAN, for something to be so "normal" that he just brushes it off really says something.

Most of the abuse is sadly glassed over, Harry is far too ajusted for a kid in his situation, he's been emotionally neglected his entire life and that can really get to some pepole.

Dumbledore placing Harry with the Dursleys and allowing the abuse/neglect to continue untill 6th year really says alot, especially considering how he was sent to the place after going trough something really traumatic, without a support network where his friends are told to keep information away from him..

Dumbledore is a grey af character, that had good intentions, but they were all executed horribly, the road to hell is paved with good intentions

I mean, it could be a fierce rivalry, but then it got into mortal danger, and remember, it's 4v1 (we assume), which sounds more like an extended campaign of bullying because of an assumed difference (racism of school houses)

***** Sorry clarification I mean for others than Snape like would it be bashing to make him say Bully all other Slytherins for being Slytherins.

On the one hand we know James dislikes Slytherins and Sirius does too. On the other hand we know that Snape was trying to expose Lupin as a werewolf before the bullying memory we see and we also know he is already friends with Death Eater supporters at this point.

So was the Snape James situation just the Marauders fuckung with James because he was wannabe death eater who tried to out Lupin?

Or was it extension of Interhouse toxicity? Or both ?

Is this a toxic rivalry that turned into bullying post werewolf incident? Or just bullying and Snape was obsessed with making them look bad because they already bullied him and others didn't care?

I think you could make an argument for like any one but would one that made James look worse/Snape look better be considered bashing? (or if it was the other way and the depiction made Snape look worse and James look better). How you interpret the characters to a degree is down to just how you feel about them. You don't get too much context for Snape at this age and you get even less for James.

****** It might be considered bashing. I mean, in your example about Snape and James, "So was the Snape James situation just the Marauders fuckung with James because he was wannabe death eater who tried to out Lupin?" In the books, James himself says he bullied Snape, "because he exists." Nothing about being a wannabe Death Eater. The books don't give us a reason not to take that quote at face value. If you want to give an alternate explanation in your fic, you'd be contradicting the books in a way some people would perceive as bashing and not a mere interpretation. It stops being an interpretation when it explicitly contradicts the books. You can do that, but there's a really good chance you will be accused of bashing. (For the record, some people love bash fics. You might get a loads of readers who are looking for a bash fic.)

The James/Marauders vs. Snape debates get super intense. Usually, the fics that make James/Snape look considerably worse so Snape/James will look considerably better are criticized by a contingent of fans who favor one character over the other.

****** Yeh, I mean, as an avid supporter of Snape, I kinda get embroiled in discussions like this. But regardless, in answer to your question, I think that it was definitely due to interhouse toxicity, and it kinda depends from who's perspective/side the stories from. If snape-centric, then I don't think it would be bashing, cos he's see things all one way, and he wouldn't be a reliable narrator. Same goes for James, so TLDR not bashing for either

******* The point they were making is that it is highly likely that the Slytherin's bullied right back at the Gryffindors - there is even the “Snape gave as good as he got” line in canon. It's not bashing to call the marauders bullies (because they were), it is bashing to make James love potion and rape Lily, or have the marauders ambushing 1st year slytherins when they're in 6th year.

********* To explain further, I was kinda agreeing with you that James Potter is a bully, so writing him as one isn't bashing, /however/, the post before you said a bully "in general" -- which I've seen taken to extremes such as being a bully to everyone- not just Slytherins his age. Showing him being a bully to Snape isn't bashing, showing him being a bully in general- such as to younger students, Lily, all women, whatever else- having him be that extreme in his bullying and never be nice to anyone but Sirius- that is bashing.

** I think there is a big difference between if the bashing is down by the narrator vs it being done by a character. If Tom Riddle's internal dialogue asserts that Dumbledore is an interfering old coot, that comes across different than if the author declares that Dumbledore is a manipulative old coot in descriptive narrative.

** Quite frankly I think bashing is quite often "in the eye of the beholder". I have no problem with folks pointing out negative traits that are hinted at in canon and making them more visible. But I don't consider it "bashing". For one thing there are enough plot holes and vagueness in the stories that I believe could support almost any interpretation of a character's actions. And I usually enjoy reading all of those "different takes".

However, I have seen several times in the fandom that if you point out negative characteristics of a character the reader cherishes then you are immediately "bashing". For some, any interpretation of a character that is not canon is bashing. Which to me doesn't make sense as every fanfiction must be different than canon in some ways, otherwise there would be a lot of lawyers chasing after fanfic authors.

So I personally don't really consider anything bashing though I think I have a fairly decent idea what "tropes" others consider are. Whether it's the "greedy" love potioning trio of Molly, Ron, and Ginny, or the Evil, manipulating but still incompetent Dumbledore (otherwise how else would Harry win), or the evil, unrepentant Snape for every reader who enjoys exploring that aspect there will be another reader decrying it as "bashing".

So as I said. IMO "bashing" is in the eye of the beholder.

** I think it's a combination of making a character a worse person than in canon (whether by making them do worse things or by casting their canon actions in the worst possible light) and also changing their role in the story.

Making Hermione bossier and Ron more jealous wouldn't necessarily be bashing if they are still loyal friends. Making Dumbledore more manipulative and fully aware of the Dursleys' abuse probably isn't bashing if he is still a wise mentor who wants the best for everyone and Harry specifically.

Conversely, writing a story where Harry doesn't befriend Ron and Hermione and pays as much attention to them as canon does to Seamus and Lavender isn't bashing if it doesn't also portray them as terrible people. Changing Dumbledore into a stoned comic relief isn't bashing if he's not also trying to steal all of Harry's money.

It's when you combine negative actions with a shift in a character's role, especially to a role that is more negative or less aligned with the protagonist, that you really get bashing.

Bashing antagonists is a bit weirder and less common, but it does occasionally happen, and I think it follows the same basic principals. Turning Voldemort and the Death Eaters into serial rapists isn't bashing because it doesn't change their role as competent antagonists. Changing them into Harry's allies isn't going to be bashing because they aren't also going to be doing worse things (unless it's a dark!Harry story, but then their actions still aren't going to be so bad, from Harry's perspective). But if you emphasize all the stupid parts in Voldemort's plans and portray him as a minor threat or a generally incompetent antagonist, then that's bashing (though it's bashing that you won't get many complaints about).

** Bashing is the author is using their fic to showcase how much they dislike a character. It is the opposite of "This fic is a loveletter to a character <3".

There is a lot of nuance. I don't call fics that have characters act more evilly than their cannon counterparts as bashing, that is simply the author using the characters to fit the story. Similarly, you could have a fic that deeply explores negative traits of a character without it being bashing.

​

It is only when the fic is providing commentary back on the original work that it is bashing. Either simple personal dislike or perhaps poking holes in cannon characterization in a negative way.
