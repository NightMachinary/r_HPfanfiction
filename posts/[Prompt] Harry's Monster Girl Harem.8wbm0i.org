An Idea struck me while I was reading about Ming dynasty China. The Chinese Emperor recieved tribute from many neighboring nations in the form of humans (male eunuchs and female virgins) and many of the women became members of his harem. In other dynasties, royals from neighboring countries and nobles from both China and abroad would send women as tribute or to curry political favour, and these women also joined the Chinese Emperor's harems.

So. I know I've seen fics where Harry gets crowned - either literally or in intent if not in name - and I /know/ there are harem fics. But I don't think I've ever seen a fic where Harry gets with any of the less human humanoid races in the HP world. Veela don't count, to my mind, because they look competely human most of the time. Also, there are inumerable fics where Harry gets paired with Fleur, Gabrielle either singly or as part of a larger group of partners.

So, here's the idea;

Harry attains greatness and acclaim, either through defeating Voldemort or (to make it more interesting, imo) through some means before that final battle by some mechanism like inheriting titles, such that he is considered one of the the most magically, politically and fiscally significant magical beings in Britain, if not the world. Then the girls start showing up. They're sent by their respective nations/peoples mainly in political moves, as I'm */extremely/ uncomfortable with the idea that they'd be sent as tribute. So, they'd be daughters of significant members of thier species; either outright princesses or generally the equivalent of nobles.

- Veela are an obvious one, and how you decide who counts as a significant enough Veela personage to be sent is up to you.
- Goblins are another fairly easy one, though if I were writing it I'd make them somewhat more physically attractive by human standards than they appear in the films. Maybe some thing like the WoW Goblins? I think Goblins would be amongst the first to see the potential benefits in sending a political marriage candidate.
- Centaurs are portayed as extremely aloof, to the point of distaining wizards and witches, but I think a case could be made for them seeing an alliace-by-marriage with Harry as being a useful tool in furthering their own goals with the Ministry of Magic.
- We don't know much about Merperson culture or their desires regarding representation in the MoM, but that just means they're pretty much a blank slate to work from. Plus, as with the goblins, if their canon appearance is unappealing to you, why not just fudge that a bit? It's your own offshoot universe, after all.
- I think a case could potentially be made for a Warewolf and/or Vampire girl turning up, too, but whether they count as "not human enough" to be monster girls is really up to you.
- Giants are a little tricky, to my mind, since the only giant we have direct interaction with is Grawp, who seems to be fairly infantile in terms of mental development. If all giants are like him, it would raise issues of genuine informed consent. I guess you could go the route that most other giants are more intelligent, and he was shunned by his tribe not only because he was small but also because he was developmentally challenged. We know, however, that humans and giants can interbreed (presumably with some form of modified engorgement charm?) because we have Hagrid and Maxime.
- Trolls, I think, should be a no. Mainly because they /all/ seem to be significantly less intelligent than humans, albeit capable of basic tool use and with a developed enough social structure to necessatate the wearing of clothes (even if it's just loin cloths). However, if you want to include some kind of dainty (by troll standards), sexually dimorphic (think the male and female Orcs, Trolls and Draenai in WoW) female troll then . . . I /guess/?

If you want to get a bit more . . . creative, then I could see cases made for the following extras.

- Dragons. Hey, it worked out for Donkey in Shrek. Why can't there be a species of dragon with human-level intelligence? Some kind of mythical golden/royal dragon?
- Boggart. I think at this point you'd be going for something reeeeeal kinky, but who am I to judge? It'd mean creating a society for Boggarts out of whole-cloth, but why should that stop you?
- Sphynx. We know they have human-level intelligence from GoF, but like with the Merfolk and my example of Boggarts, we don't know anything about what society - if any - they have, and therefore what "nobles" or ruling class there might be who would /want/ to send a bride for political alliance. Still, again, that just means you can invent your own.

To expand even further, you could include girls from other mytological races that don't happen to have any representation in Harry Potter canon, such as; Dwarves, Sirens, Naga/Lamia, Oni, and whatever else your heart desires.

To be honest, I'm thinking seriously about writing a version myself, but since I don't /think/ that this idea has been explored before I thought I'd share it and see what people thought. Plus, this way all you harem detractors wouldn't have to read a harem fic that just takes all the even vaguely eligable girls who're mentioned in Harry Potter and hurls them at Harry.


** The number of tropes in what you just described is actually horrifying, the only way I can see this working is as a crack piece where Harry just bumbles through it not understanding what's happening.

#+begin_quote
  (Bashing! Harem! Based on, but not an answer to, DZ2's 'Evil Never Dies' and 'The Potter Race' challenges) After a near-fatal beating by Vernon after Third Year, Harry is rescued by the most unlikely of...people. Except they're monsters, including an old friend. And he is the heir to the throne of their lord, Ainz Ooal Gown. Will Harry grasp the power that is being offered to him?

** If I were writing this story (I never would, but if I was), I would keep the political marriage candidates as all NOT being conveniently conventionally attractive by human standards - because to me that defeats the point that they're NOT humans, so why should they all just happen to look how humans think other humans look when they're attractive?

Of course if I was ever writing something even LIKE THIS, it would be a serious, actual troubling, difficult for Harry to deal with, realistic story maybe like that Game of Thrones show everyone talks about that also involves warring kings and queens and political castle stuff. He'd have to actually STRUGGLE to make connections with these alliance candidates, to see past their nonhuman looks and see the value of personality, or information, or talents.

It would have like, all the other magical human nations urging to Harry, "Make this work for us, you need to find a way to make it work!" or else everyone's screwed because war and politic stuff. So Harry would have pressure and strain and stress throughout it all, trying to navigate it all.
