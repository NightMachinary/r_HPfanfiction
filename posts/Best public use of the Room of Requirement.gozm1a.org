:END:
What are your favorite fanfic uses for the Room of Requirement that were shared by the entire school (or at least a very large group)?

Note DA training doesn't count. The group could use it for a more interesting purpose, but smarter or more unique training in and of itself isn't what I'm asking for.


** linkffn(8379655) Definitely Hogwarts Battle School. It's an AU where Dumbledore dies and Snape is headmaster, and Snape turns Hogwarts into a military-style training school. The Room of Requirement is used to make a bunch of different elaborate settings to hold mock battles in.

** I really love Esama's D.S.S Requirement ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3412346]]). It also has a sequel. It's such a cool idea and I would love to read more.

I also am really loving Relentless, We Survive by Araceil ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18710152]]) which is training the DA but very differently. Kinda a crossover with Assassins Creed, and also a Harry/Ron/Hermione ship. It's not complete and hasn't been updated in a year but definitely worth a read.

** There was one that had it be essentially the Wish spell from DnD in room-form, and Harry went in, "required" the room to allow him to use it anywhere, all the time, and then collapsed the physical room itself while attaching the spell to his person, resulting in omnipotence.

It was wild.

**** hmmmmm. I don't think I remember anything but that, sorry. However, I believe I found it on this subreddt, by searching phrases like "room of requirement".
