"Ron, what are you doing?" Asked Harry the moment he noticed his best friend hidden behind the boy's staircase at the common room.

"Shhh!" Ron pulled him to his side, so he wasn't on plain view. "They'll notice us." Ron whispered.

"Who?" He asked, and Ron limited to poke his head and point to the table on the far side of the room.

Harry gulped. Of course, it had to be them.

The Weasley twins, Georgia and Frederika. They were having a game of exploding snap against each other while their classmates and some younger students watched the match.

It didn't take him too much certain peculiarities on how they currently looked. Georgia's hair was bubblegum pink, not that much different to Tonks', while Frederika's skin was blue.

"What happened to them?" He asked because he supposed that would be the logical thing to do.

Being serious Harry was already used to the twin's antics and preferred to just relax and enjoy while the chaos the made unfolded.

There wasn't a time when they looked more beautiful and alive than when they were being absolutely mischievous and traumatizing some poor Slythering fool that had committed the mistake of cross their paths.

And they already looked positively breathtaking the rest of the time.

"They are using some of those new joke stuff they made as punishment for the loser." Ron answered irritated.

Both prankers had become even more uncontrollable since the end of the previous school year when they started working on their original joke products after he gifted them the Triwizard Tournament prize.

Harry was really happy for them... And worried for Ron and the rest of the Magical World wellbeing.

"So you are hiding from them because...?"

"Harry, if they found me they will challenge me to play with them just to use me as their guinea pig again...!" For a moment he almost voiced that Ron could just refuse them. But his friend was too prideful and pigheaded to do something like that, fearing that his older sisters would mock him for being a /coward/. "It wouldn't be a problem if I had to play against just one of them, but they always go 2vs1!"

"Well... Good luck with that, mate." Harry tried to stand up, planning to go straight to the twins to say hi, but Ron pulled him back to the stairs again.

"Are you crazy?! They know how a good bloke you are. If they don't find me they will use you instead."

He tried to not snort at how bad it sounded that the twins would */use him/*.

He certainly wouldn't mind...

In any case, he was one of the few people in the castle that didn't mind being the buttmonkey of the twins' jokes. Being Ron's best friend already made him be the collateral damage of like 50% of the jokes directed at the younger male Weasley, after all.

"Okay." Harry sighed. "Then we just wait here until they go somewhere else...?" He asked, slightly annoyed by his best friend.

But Harry supposed his behavior made sense. This year was being especially bad for all of them, and Ron wasn't the exception.

Being prefect was probing to be more a hassle than anything for the redhead, things with Hermione were weird, this year DADA was a joke and the teacher the devil incarnated, Quidditch was canceled, and the twins seemed to let out the frustration and anger they felt for Percy's betrayal on their younger brother.

So yeah, everything was a mess.

"It's for the better. Those two are being an absolute nightmare this year." /A sexy and gorgeous nightmare/, Harry thought and nodded.


** Of course, with female non-Ginny Weaselys, the problem is that everyone after that person is born will not exist because Molly is implied to have specifically been trying for a girl. So ron may not exist here.

*** If my understanding is right. We only know about that for the horrocrux that affects Ron in the Deadly Hallows.

So probably its not the actual truth but only something that Ron believes and fears.

Thats the supossition in which i did this .

  Fire-like hair, skin kissed by the sun, both the smiles of an angel and a devil. Harry was a complete fool, but there was not much he could do about it, he always had a thing for red-heads (Fem!George x Harry x Fem!Harry) (Drabbles)
