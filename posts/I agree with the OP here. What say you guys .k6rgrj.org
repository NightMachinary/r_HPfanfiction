  I'd support Cedric Diggory just to put Harry in his place.

** Does it happen "again and again", though? I think it was only the first year ending feast that looks unfair (especially the part where Dumbledore make everyone think Slytherin won at first).

The second year Harry did get an award for special services, but that was reasonable from an outside perspective (especially after half the school was accusing him of being the Heir all year). As for third year, did he get any public reward at all?
