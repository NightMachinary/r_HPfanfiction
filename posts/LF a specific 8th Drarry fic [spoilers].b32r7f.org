I'm looking for a specific 8th year Drarry fic where they return to Hogwarts but the castle has been damaged by the war and weird things keep happening. Students are getting hurt and going missing. I remember the solution to the mystery is that the room of requirement is broken somehow and affecting the whole castle. I remember seeing it in a rec list somewhere with the comment that Harry's voice is done so well it's like jk wrote it herself

  Hogwarts students are in danger; Harry is determined to save them all. There's only one thing he knows for certain: Draco Malfoy is somehow involved.
