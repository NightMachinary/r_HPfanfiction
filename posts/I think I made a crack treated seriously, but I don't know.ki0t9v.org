Warning! Backstory as to why I wrote this, scroll to end to get link! I was listening to baby in the oven, by ayesha erotica, after having just replayed Pico's school on newgrounds.

Something overcame me. The urge to write a crack fic. But I can never write proper crack fics. I specialize in angst, and edgy 'snapping fics'. So, i used my abilities to their finest.

I wrote, 'Harry Potter's Destroyed Happiness'. Currently, it's not long. I just published it today. However, i think i wrote somewhat of a crackfic, and i wanna keep writing it.

But I need to know. Is it good enough to be worth continuing? It's probably not, but i gotta know.

Anyways, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13774851/1/Harry-Potter-s-Destroyed-Happiness][Here]] it is. Pleasse, forgive me for any errors. Right now, i just need judgement.


** I like those types of fics too, but omg I feel so stupid reading them.
