What is your most in-character, well-written (in-canon, Rowlingesque) Snape fic? With a Snape that's just as mean as in the books. Harry as a character would be great, but it's not a must.

Here are some of my favourite Snape fics which I think are close to canon:\\
linkffn(4040612) linkffn(7222599) linkffn(4861242) and I recommend reading this series by her: linkffn(5045315) linkffn(2493186)

For more, see my favourites at FFN. It's hard to find the ones with a real edge, so any recs would be great.


** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11923164/1/I-Know-Not-and-I-Cannot-Know-Yet-I-Live-and-I-Love]])

It also has the added bonus of a in-character Luna.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** I will always, always recommend the works of Delphi!

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2480741]]) is one of my personal favourites. Delphi actually writes some of the odder characters (Snape, Filch, Moody, Kettleburn, Hagrid) in a way that really makes sense, and simultaneously humanizes them while pointing out their numerous flaws.
