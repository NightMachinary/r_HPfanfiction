Looking for stories where we see more interaction between the Wizarding World and magical creatures.

Not looking for stories where X character (normally Harry) has a creature Inheritance. That's not what I'm looking for, I'm just looking for stories that have the magical creature(s) more involved in some way in the story.

Be it Goblins, House-Elves, Werewolves, Vampires, Sirens, Merpeople or whoever, could be other creatures; it doesn't matter.

Can be as in canon as possible or as AU as possible or anything in between

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather not have character bashing, if it makes sense for the story then maybe, but if the characters are obviously just bashed because the Author doesn't like them then no I don't want that.

Can be any Era. Anyone can be the main character not just Harry.

I do not like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but any other pairing is okay.

Would rather not have Harry be insanely smart or powerful, a little smarter then he was in the books or a little more powerful then he was is okay, just don't have it be insane levels of intelligence or power.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** God sign me up. I love stories about sapient species and there are so few!

*Goblins:*

linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) --- HIGHLY recommended. It's the premise of /Harry Crow/ actually done /right/, and its worldbuilding of Goblin culture has essentially become my go-to headcanon.

*Dementors:*

- linkffn(Dementors by Myranya) One of those fanfics published before the last books came out, so there's a couple of unintentional departures from canon, but it's really pretty damn good. Premise: Hermione is sent to Azkaban by the Fudge-controlled Ministry, and, applying an open mind, ends up discovering Dementors are just another sapient species, who don't like humans any more than humans like them but aren't soulless evil phantoms for it.

- linkffn(The Innocent Dementor): Two-chapter oneshot by /moi/ which I may continue later on. An orphaned (?) dementor's youth in an abandoned wizarding mansion.

*Sphinxes:*

- linkffn(The Sphinx's Charge): Taken along on the Weasleys' trip to Egypt, Harry ends up meeting a lonely female Sphinx who decides to adopt him as her cub. Abandoned, unfortunately.

*Sapient Serpents:*

- linkffn(Parselbrat) The best Parseltongue fic out there in my opinion. Warning: is a fem!Harry.

- linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) Again, one of my own stories. I just started it and the premise is: what if Hermione was a Parselmouth?

*House-Elves:*

- linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where To Find Them): The premise is that Harry grows up convinced he is a 'forest elf'. It's hogwash of course, but convinces him to get closer to /actual/ elves, and... look, you just have to read it. It's a delightful story.

#+begin_quote
  The Dementors of Azkaban are soul-sucking monsters, but only becaused their own parents raised them that way. A young Dementor grows up alone in an abandoned wizarding castle, and when he faces the outside world's Dementors and the wizards' opinion of them, it comes as quite a shock. In progress.
