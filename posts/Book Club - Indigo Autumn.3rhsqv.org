** It nearly lost me in the prologue: Indigo children? 10 percent of the brain? The first is justified by the end, the second... no idea.

Other than that, it's an interesting story. Sadly, I feel it's not about Hermione. At least not the one from the books.

*** I agree...I was expecting something along the lines of how she was when she first started Hogwarts and how that affected her childhood. Maybe skipping /one/ grade level, but not this. This makes super!Harry fanfiction look good.

**** I skimmed the first chapter after seeing it in the recommendations and it didn't look bad. :(

***** Don't worry. If the summary of the next story is any indication, it will be even worse than this one.

****** I started reading the next one, and so far it's awful... the MC is Remus's twin, and she likes picking fights and is super protective of Remus. The writing and characterization is well done... but it's a total self-insert fic. I'm going to try and stick around until the plot picks up, but I don't know how long I'll last.

******* Apparently I need to do more screening than just making sure the writing isn't horrible from a technical standpoint.

******** I've read a bit more, and it's just... not good. "Mina," the main character, [[/spoiler][instantly becomes friends with all the Marauders, has a tragic past (apparently her and Remus' mother drugged them to get them to stop bothering her), she has an awful temper and everyone just seems to be okay with it, she's really pretty and has guys all over her even though she's known to have serious issues... bleh.]]

It's bad. The writing is actually quite good, but it's a shame the author is wasting it on poorly-done OC fiction. Don't worry--you wouldn't have been able to tell from a quick glance, so don't feel bad. The writing is deceptively good. I envy her style, but her characterization and storyline aren't that great.

*** In the interest of better understanding the story I spent some time googling and it seems "indigo children" is a pseudoscientific theory, something about synesthesia, auras and children who are [[http://skepdic.com/indigo.html][gifted souls with an evolved consciousness who have come here to help change the vibrations of our lives and create one land, one globe and one species. They are our bridge to the future.]]. Further googling showed no evidence that Hermione uses her vibrational powers to realign Voldemort with the cosmos.

  "To thievery and mayhem!" Sirius giggled, adding his goblet to the toast with a joyous clink, "To marauding, pestering, pranking, and other unacceptable behaviors!" Mina grinned, cackled, "To Hogwarts! If it's still standing when we're through!" Sirius/OC
