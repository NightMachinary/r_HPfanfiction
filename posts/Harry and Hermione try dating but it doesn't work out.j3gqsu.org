  AU/OOC: Its been almost 3 years since Harry asked Hermione to the Yule Ball thus starting their relationship and Ron is tired of hiding his feelings. It should be him on her arm. Not the bloody Boy Who Gets Everything. He just cant take it anymore. Will he tell Hermione how he feels? And does Hermione and Harry have some secrets of their own? RW/HG/HP DM/GW PLEASE R&R Complete:)

** It's not exactly your request, but in my story "Divided and Entwined", there's a love triangle between Harry, Ron and Hermione, with both of them dating her and Hermione picking Ron after a few dates.

  As his sixth year begins, Harry is forced to take up his destiny earlier that anticipated. With Voldemort slowly taking over, everyone looks to Harry to lead them, all while Juggling school, friends, the seach for the Horcruxes, and teenage love. In the process, Harry slowly learns about not only himself, but the true worth of the soul! Harry/Susan
