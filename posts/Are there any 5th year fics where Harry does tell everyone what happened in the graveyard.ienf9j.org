Like in the first meeting of the DA in the hog's head when he's asked about it, he just lays it all out. All the gruesome details, the scars everything. Not in a bragging manner trying to make himself sound like a hero, but in a "I barely survived this" way. Probably wouldn't change much of the story going forward but it might be cathartic for him to get it all out.


** I think he'd feel immensely uncomfortable with discussing Cedric's death in front of Cho, though.

** This might be considered a wild suggestion, but linkao3(Relentless, We Survive) has this. It's also a crossover with Assassin's Creed.

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.
