A while ago I read a fanfics about Harry having a twin (who is The Boy Who Lived) but Harry goes to Durmstrang. It was a really interesting fics, but it was abandoned. Harry is also doesnt end up with Ginny in this fanfics. I'm searching for fics that is similar to this.

The name of the fics is Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by Stargate-Lover (If I'm correct, it is a repost, and the actuall writer took it down)

** This is a pretty interesting one. Harry, Draco, and Krum are family-by-marriage (IIRC?) while at Durmstrang.
