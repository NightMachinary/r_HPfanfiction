:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! So I was wondering if anyone could help me find a fanfic. I for the life of me just can't seem to find if. So bear with me here. It's was on AO3. Post war 8th year. I believe Harry may have saved Snape from the bite. So, all the 8th years were put into the same dorm since there weren't that many of them. Snape is alive and there head of house, and he essentially is giving them counseling sessions. He's also I believe the defense teacher. I distinctly remember him teaching them how to duel, even though they had fought in the war. I know it sounds odd, but any help is greatly appreciated! Edit: the fic has been found! Thank you for helping out!


** I mean I LITERALLY just read this, and can't think of the name. Tried scrolling through recent stories. Can't find it. Sorry.
