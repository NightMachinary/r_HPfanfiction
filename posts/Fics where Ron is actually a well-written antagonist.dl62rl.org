There are a lot of fics with Ron bashing around, but they usually turn him into a ridiculous caricature. Are there fics where he is the antagonist but he's actually well-written?


** I believe Transcendence is, however I'm not entirely certain seeing as I haven't read it in a long time. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12838961/1/Transcendence]]

*** You're thinking of Resurgence. A fic where Harry comes off as being a Sinyk style edgelord, although Ron is neat.

Not that Transcendence doesn't has its problems.
