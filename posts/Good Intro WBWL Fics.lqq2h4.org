I haven't read any Wrong Boy Who Lived fics and I don't know where to start.


** Just make sure you read one of the few good ones, so that you don't get put off that genre. I'd recommend:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1664050][Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]]

There is another great one called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]], but its pretty depressing.

**** Prince of Slytherin especially, and Ashes of Chaos to a smaller amount are both aimed at subverting the existing genre of WBWL stories, so I would recommend reading a few traditional ones before diving into those two.

***** Yes, but the WBWL played straight is 1) dead and 2) doesn't have any great fics besides Antithesis. The WBWL these days is pretty much along the lines of those three fics, and most of the stuff that's recommended in general has some kind of trope subversion.

That said, I think Prince is actually a great introduction to the tropes and general world of Harry Potter fan fiction, if you're up for reading a million-plus-word fic. If you catch up on it you will pretty much be well informed on every trope in the book.

** *Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived* got smacked on here a couple days ago, but it's a pretty well-regarded fic and a good introduction to the genre. Beware that it's incomplete. There are five more chapters that are on the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net][Dark Lord Potter forums only]]; you'll have to make an account to access them. There are also probably a couple copies of that fragment floating around in dark corners of the internet, but DLP is the most straightforward way to get there.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines.

** I've only read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]] which was fantastic. Quite dark and heavy at times but thats the theme and the point. It was really interesting. Especially seeing his views on his brother and how that lack of attention affected him. And then to see how his brother dealt with him in turn.

I've heard good things about the Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived too though haven't read it.

People will knock wbwl stories for being tropey. Which they probably are but if you haven't read any wbwl then you won't know what the tropes are. So don't listen to those people =P

** If you want an intro that most older fanfiction readers had, go read the Sacrifices arc. It was one that introduced many people to the genre, and it's complete (very few are). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][link]]

Then there's Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) which is brilliant, but sooooo long, and full of tangents and rich world building which suffocates the plot. But, as I said, it's brilliant. It's also a subversion of some of the common tropes in the genre.

Its bastard child, I suppose, is Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos linkffn(13507192). Which is better paced, but somewhat of a pale copy. It's still in the top 0,1% of fanfictions, it's that good.

There are a lot of unfinished, abandoned fics. One of the more original ones is Magus Emissarius linkffn(4167175).

Here's a community with a lot of similar, not all WBWL but similar, fics. Community [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Wrong-BoyWhoLived/18135/99/3/2/0/0/0/0/][Link]]

EDIT: Found another oldie that would be a good introduction, Unsung Hero. It was deleted from ffn, but it is available on portkey archive. It's a straight played, complete WBWL story, without the subversion of Prince or Ashes. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/6109/1][link]]

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

*** To be fair, I would argue it is more of an indy!Harry, time travel, harem story than a WBWL Which is why I didn't recc it, even though it's quite good for what it is. But it does have the idea of the WBWL as its core aspect, even though it isn't central to the story.
