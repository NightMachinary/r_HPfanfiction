In canon, the books take place throughout the 90s while also having flashbacks in previous decades.

In many fics, authors stick with staying in the canon time period. How much is changed if Harry attends Hogwarts in the 2000s or 2010s? Is the canon plot still valid apply to those fics?

** I imagine there will be a lot more ethnic variety in 2010 than in 1991 in terms of the student population.

Also, I imagine stuff like Snape's behaviour would get shut down VERY fast. In 1991, mean teachers were not that strange. in 2010 a school will be crucified if a teacher behaved like Snape.

edit: also Malfoy would not be able to walk around and use words like Mudblood as easily.

*** The ethnic variety would be limited to the muggleborns. Wizarding Britain seems already quite diverse. And I don't think Wizarding Britain would be terribly changed by muggle developments.

*** The ethnic variety makes sense. On the other hand, I have a feeling Malfoy and Snape would still keep their ideals and personalities. Wizarding Society is pretty backwards, and they aren't as progressive as the Muggle World. Snape and Purebloods would still act all pompous or downright shitty.

*** It's generally known that electronics, regardless of what era they're from, will cease to function around magic especially in Hogwarts. So yeah, both will not work in Hogwarts. Unless a wizard created a spell that shields electronics from magic.

**** Personally I headcanon that it is possible for magic and technology to work together, but there's a distinct lack of interest from the Wizarding World since it's muggle and there's going to be a genuine bias. As a result any attempts towards working with it are small "homebrew" solutions and nothing supported legally, though I have no doubt there would be an easier time to finding a solution in the 2000's-2010's as it starts to become necessary to have a phone and internet connection

***** Yeah, I've seen official fiction where magic and technology are used together. Let's face it, if electronics still worked around magic in the HP universe, ALOT of problems would've been solved.

****** I mean there has to be some way to affect electronic stuff with magic, because I refuse to believe that the wizards aren't enchanting the CCTV to automatically censor any magic it records. Not to mention the Wizarding Wireless, which logistically needs /someone/ with A) knowledge of how radio technology functions and B) Enough genius to manipulate it on a deeper level. The fact that normal radios don't pick up the wireless seems to imply that either they use another mechanism to transmit the sound or the wizards found a way to make a section of the EM spectrum go missing without the muggles noticing.

**** Honestly I see no reason why it couldn't occur in recent time period. The only reason it took place in the 90s was because it was written in what? Early 2000s? That would imply if it was written now it likely would have taken place in late 2000/early 2010s.

I myself am working on my timeline for a harry potter story that takes places during the feudal era. So instead of bringing my story into even more modern times, I'm taking it back a few hundred years

** Not much. The magical world is pretty much stuck in the 1800s. I don't think two decades would make much of a difference. The Dursleys would have to play nicer though because muggles take child abuse more seriously nowadays.

** Updating with technology - in the background for muggleborn, or perhaps integrated into the magical world - seems like the most obvious difference. How would muggleborn students react with going to a Hogwarts where smartphones aren't a thing? Where they're used to computers and the internet, etc.

On the whole, the canon plot shouldn't have major issues being put in place. The Wizarding World is a wonderful insulator for things like changing times -because we can just look at everything different between the 70s-90s and 2000s onwards and say that it's unchanged in the magical world. It being insulated makes it easier to not have to connect the dots between the two timelines as much.

There's also much potential for changes. I think changing technology obviously offers up a large threat to the Statute of Secrecy, in everything being far more documented these days. We can take the option of wizards being more silly, in which case secrecy would probably be untenable, or of wizards being more competent/serious, in how they'd deal with it.

*** But in a narrative sense, is it bad to be isolated from the world? I think it helps the franchise to be timeless and therefore can be enjoyed by future generations without any problems.

On the other hand, franchises like Percy Jackson will eventually become outdated and strange to read because it depends on a lot of meme and pop culture reference of the moment.

** I think there would be an even bigger rift in fashion, language, and studies. There's little to no information on what the magical world thinks on things such as women's rights, human racial issues, global warming, LGBT rights, and mental health issues. Those are the only things I can think of that would have a properly large divide, but we also have no idea if they are something that exist, as there is never any talk of it, or if there is it's a one-off thing.

There's working women, Dean is Black, Dumbledore is gay, Lockhart obliviated himself, and the Longbottoms are almost braindead. We have such a small scope focused on things with just Harry and his adventures, and so if Harry misses out on things, we will too.

There's no real tell of things like how outdated ideas may be, and as a result we just don't know. Does the magical world have trans people, same-sex relationships, therapy or psychiatry? Who knows! If anything, I think it would cause even larger tensions between magical and non-magical worlds. Muggleborns would be much more used to things being modern with vaccines, the internet, multiple forms of media, multiple sports, and multiple cultures being present. To go to a stunted and isolated school like Hogwarts which is full of people who are just used to things being the same as their parents had.

There's not much we know about the magical world and new innovations. We never know what kind of new spells are being invented or new potions being brewed for the first time. I think there's just one mention of the Wolfsbane potion, but that's it. Altogether, I think the magical world itself would fail to maintain the Statue of Secrecy due to their isolation and would reveal every community for failing to keep up.
