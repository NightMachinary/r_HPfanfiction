:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It is an HHr fic, where Hermione brings everyone to Hogs Head but instead of starting the DA, Seamus? asks what happens at the graveyard. After that Harry declines to answer and to lead the DA and Harry and Hermione become their own study group. Dumbledore tried to get them thrown out for skipping "inexplicable detentions" but they don't bite. I just can't remember the name or use common tags to find it. Thanks for any help.


** This one? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10300874/1/Weary-Wizard]]

I swear I remember something very similar but longer though.

*** It's definitely Weary Wizard. I thought it was longer but revisited it recently - it's just a lot packed into a short story

*** I love how the prophecy was handled.

It's great when they are handled organically, and not manipulated like Dumbledore and Voldemort was attempting.

** Oh! You mean the one where Dumbledore tries to punish them for skipping undeserved detentions"as they might not understand the reason why now and then one of them comes back with "I'm sorry sir, I could have sworn I said undeserved detentions, not inexplicable ones."?
