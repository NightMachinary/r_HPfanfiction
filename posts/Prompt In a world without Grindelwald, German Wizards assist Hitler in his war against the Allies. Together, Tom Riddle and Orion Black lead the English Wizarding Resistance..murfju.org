** If Grindelwald didn't exist, Arianna would have never died, Albus would have never gotten that bitter reality check, and Dumbledore would probably be a politician rather than a teacher. Slughorn introduces Tom Riddle to the magical world, and makes sure to inform Tom of what being a Parselmouth means. Tom gains the undying loyalty of Slytherin house, and forms a network of Slytherins around Europe to defeat Hitler and the German Wizards. He also makes sure every Wizarding child in London is rescued from the Blitzkrieg. Tom is hailed a hero, has the loyalty of many Slytherins, as well as the gratitude of the Muggleborns and the people he saved. No one to deny him the job of professor when he applies, and he starts training new followers among the younger generations. By the time they realize what he's doing, they're too late. Tom has half of Europe under his command and no one even noticed. Essentially, Tom Riddle with the political quota of Canon Dumbledore. He could be a Dark Lord and the public would still love him.

** Why Tom Riddle? He was only 11 when the WW2 began. Sure he could join later by 1943, but the decisive phase for Britain was 1940 when he was only 12.

So why not Albus Dumbledore? Why shouldn't he lead the British Wizards?

Also, why would German Wizards help Hitler without Grindelwald? Why not having Grindelwald and Hitler working together?

This is after the war.

Dumbledore is dead.

Grindelwald just wanted to take over the world. Hitler was his tool. If Hitler had won, it wouldn't be a Nazi regime anymore. It would be Grindelwald's regime.

**** So your premise is really that Nazis had won.

Well, you never told that in your prompt.

There are a few abandoned fics that tried to address this idea, but I think the world building effort is just too massive.
