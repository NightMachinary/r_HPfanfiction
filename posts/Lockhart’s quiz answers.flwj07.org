one of my favourite things about reading fanfics with gilderoy lockhart being the dada teacher is the shock (and disdain at his vanity) that students (harry or otherwise) have at seeing his first pop quiz

i.e. “what is gilderoy lockhart‘s favourite colour” or “what is gilderoy lockhart‘s favourite thing”

with writers making answers that are downright hilarious or just really savage

what's the funniest answer to the lockhart self-quiz that you've ever seen/you can think of?


** What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest accomplishment to date?

The time that he managed to corner an Acromantula in a broom cupboard.

** Q - What is Gilderoy Lockhart's Favourite Colour

A - Famous, formally Hot Magenta.

The crayola reference just made me laugh. I think it's from Oh No, Not Again, that time travel fic, but I can't remember for certain.

** Overall, I'd have to say that Oh God, Not Again (already cited) wins for answering so many of the questions, and the Crayola shoutout was definitely the best one.

A [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220][Very Slytherin Harry]], sadly, only listed one: /What is Gilderoy Lockhart's secret ambition?/ /To have a smile bright enough to blind his enemies./

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] series was notable for making it a group project:

#+begin_quote
  “This is a joke,” Blaise said. “Please tell me this is a joke.”

  Theo started writing almost instantly, a vicious smirk on his face. “I'll /make/ it a joke.”

  Harry peered over at his paper. For the first question, Theo had responded: /His hair./

  “Amateur,” Harry scoffed, writing /the unique blue of his eyes/.

  “This should be entertaining,” said Blaise, grinning and determinedly putting pen to paper.

  Pansy shook her head. “Boys...”

  But Harry distinctly saw her write, /permanently replace all his teeth with solid gold so he can actually blind people with his smile/, in response to “What does Gilderoy Lockhart plan to do to celebrate his retirement?”

** there's one fic- i don't remember the name, unfortunately- where Lockheart was Actually Badass (or maybe it was someone else who was Actually Badass in disguise as Lockheart? idr) and made the quiz as a test to find out which students had the best memories. he then put those students through training or something like that
