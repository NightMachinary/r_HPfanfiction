Would rather not have character bashing if possible.

NO OP Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful is fine, but I'd like it to be believable.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

No Lord Potter, no Harem Harry et cetra.

Can be on any site. Would rather it be completed if possible.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  Harry has had enough of seeing his reputation shredded in the Daily Prophet and decides to do something about it. Only he decides to embrace his Slytherin side to rectify matters.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** My headcanon is that Salazar left a lot more to his Heir than a snake and a hidden room, like books with all the spells he knew and awesome magic items, but to make sure nobody except for the Heir would find them he put a Fidelius on them and made the Basilisk the secret keeper. That's why it's called the chamber of secrets.

*** It's just a shame that Rowling created this awesome chamber, and there was only a giant snake, a giant snake that could kill people, but still.

I always thought there was more to the chamber, like secret rooms, it had to of been big, to host a giant snake.
