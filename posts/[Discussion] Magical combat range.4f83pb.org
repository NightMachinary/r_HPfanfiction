Do we ever get a good idea on the maximum range that it would be practical for wizards to fight at? What factors affect spell accuracy and spell speed, two components needed to actually hit anything.


** my head canon is tennis court size. spells don't travel very fast, it's possible to dodge them.

why Harry, who is amazing on a broom, never fights from the air, I don't know. A broom would easily run away from a curse.

*** While it would be easier to dodge on a broom I expect that there would be a corresponding decrease in accuracy

** It depends on the spell. Wands are obviously weapons but they aren't like guns that only fire a certain projectile.

Something like a stunner is probably equal to having a baseball pitched at you.

Some of the spells that Dumbledore and Voldemort dueled with could probably take out a city block if left unchecked. Fiendfyre was used by Crabbe who by all accounts was semi-powerful but neither intelligent or strong willed. It still destroyed The Room of Hidden Things.

**** I suppose I crossed the subject matter a bit. My point is that some spells have a near football pitched effective range due to sheer firepower while others you basically need to be at spitting distance due to how small the spell is mid-flight.

** How difficult is it to hit something with a basic "point and shoot" device? Judging by this article ([[http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2012/8/7/point-shooting/]]), effective point shooting range with a pistol is 10 to 15 yards. More than double that range seems to be reaching into "it's magic! It simply hits!" territory.

***** 60ft 6in would be hard, but at the same time pitchers do it occasionally. I feel like casting a spell is more akin to throwing something than firing a weapon

****** pitchers are incredibly well trained to do specifically that. Magicals aren't trained to point cast like that. You're comparing apples to oranges.

Have you ever seen them do anything beside point their wand, maybe give it a little twirl--which would change their original aim--at a point beyond about three or four meters? A wand is very much a weapon, even more so than it is a tool.

******* Well, in a way they ARE: They all have defense against the dark arts at school and they learn to cast those spells (sure: an auror or someone who's into professional duelling will be better than the normal citizen, but saying they don't train at all isn't true. I mean you probably have to aim household spells as well!)...still, if intent influences magic, then wouldn't it hit at longer distances (unless the person targeted dodges or throws up a shield or even apparates away!)?

********* What is "long distance" - are 20 meters "long distance"? 30? 40? a 100? (yes, meters, sorry - German, so metric...don't use feet (inches is ok because even Germans use that for screen-sizes (TVs, Computer-Screens, Mobile-Phones etc.))

I mean hitting something at a 100 meters is probably really hard (unless intent to hit really influences the spell!) because wands do not have a scope or something similar, so yeah duels are probably something that happens within a 20 meter radius in most cases!

*** I agree that non-area effect spells are likely difficult to aim more than about 15 yards away. If you're looking at 30 yards or more, and are assuming the spell hasn't dissipated into nothingness, you'll probably only hit someone if firing into a densely packed crowd or at a target who isn't aware of the incoming spell.
