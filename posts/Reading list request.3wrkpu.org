Hi there, I'm looking for Harry Potter fics to read preferably not one shots. The thing is that I've read a lot of them and I've looked at the general recommendations thread and id like some new recommendations maybe with rare pairings or stories that don't just have Harry saying "oh muggles are so much better! When in doubt, nuke the bastards!". I do have a few requests though:\\
No slash\\
No pairings with Ginny or hermione\\
No bashing\\
Decent English\\
Thanks!


** This is pretty vague. Are you pretty new to HP fanfiction? Do you have an examples of fics you like, or things you like in fics you've read?

*** Um yeah, I wanted to leave it up in the air I guess. Haha. I started reading fanfic around 2011-2012 I think. As for the types of fics I like: I avoid slash and Harry/Ginny and Harry/hermione as I've stated I prefer darker fics but the issue is that most of them involve a lot to bashing and that's just sad.\\
I adore fics that expand on wizarding culture and don't go all: Wizarding culture is so outdated? Why aren't you guys in the 20/21st century?\\
The prince of the dark kingdom is one of my all time favorites for just that reason. Am I slightly disturbed that I liked Voldemort's Britain? Absolutely! But that's why I love it, it makes the world so much more.. Magical. Stories like Harry Potter and the Boy who lived or the (now abandoned) Out of the Night by Raining Ink. Love the malachite series and stuff like "the legacy" too. I've also read stuff like the lesser sadness (one of my recent favs- been looking for fics similar to this) and I like things like the Harry from silence game by silens cursor

It's rather sad that these are my basic requirements for fic but I'm just looking for something new. Ive read stuff like delenda est, and stuff by jbern.

Finally I guess I really like slytherin harry stories and or ravenclaw Harry stories and I like au and time travel fics along with stories like Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge.

So yeah stories like forging the sword are also much appreciated. Any suggestions about how to search for newer well written fics on fanfiction.net would also be much appreciated. I also love fics where Harry is the main character, though I can read fics with OCs as long as they aren't Mary Sues. Finally I avoid all next Gen fics (see above Mary Sue problem) and marauder fics as they just et me depressed (since, you know, we all know how those stories end).

Hope this helped! Thanks!!! Sorry about the long reply.

**** I'll just throw some of my favorites at you then, maybe you won't have read some of them.

linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel) Timetravel, marauders era. Will probably avoid that sad ending you don't like.

linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) Neville is the BWL. Driven Ravenclaw!Harry.

linkffn(A Fallen God) Crossover, but not really. Loki ends up in Harry's head. Darkish Harry.

linkffn(Out of the Dark and into the Green) Harry magics himself away and if raised by an old man who finds him. Darkish Harry.

linkffn(The Last Enemy) Post-DH Dark!Harry. Oneshot

linkffn(Just Another Orphan) Neville BWL. Harry is just another Orphan. Slytherin!Harry

linkffn(Ravenous) Neville BWL. Darkish Ravenclaw!Harry.

linkffn(Travel Secrets First) Timetravel Slytherin!Harry. Kind of bashing, but author doesn't try to convince us canon characters were evil, they're just AU in this.

linkffn(Too Young to Die) Twin!BWL Harry's sister dies and he'll do whatever it takes to get her back. Dark!Harry done amazingly. The first couple chapters are terrible.

All of these are WIP or complete.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

*** I've not nothing against gay folks, a good friend of mine is gay, but 99% of the authors can't make it work. Yaoi fangirls are the bane of this world. The only fics I've read where slash is implied would be the stories by The Fictionist.\\
As for Ginny and Hermione, the canon pairing of Harry and Ginny doesn't make sense to me. Rowling herself said that she regrets it in an interview.\\
I'm just so tired of Harry/Hermione especially as most of stories basically read as "oh muggles are so much better than wizards- wizarding culture is so very outdated. Haha you wear robes.". Finally, I've never been a big fan of hermione. I don't dislike her, but I don't like her all that much either.
