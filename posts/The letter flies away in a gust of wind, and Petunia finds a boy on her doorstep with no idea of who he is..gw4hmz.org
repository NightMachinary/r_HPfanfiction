** Chances are that if she didn't know she would take him to the police first thing in the morning (leaving a baby in a basket at the front of a stranger's door in November -not knowing who he is means she wouldn't even contemplate magic being used- only works out in romantic novels).

Would be a coin toss if she would decide to keep him. From one side there is the PR of taking on a poor orphan and her having no idea he has magic. From the other it would be a new financial burden they had no obligation towards and the general strangeness of being chosen randomly to take care of a stranger's child.

*** Surprised I don't see the Dursleys getting rid of him more often. Harry's a healthy baby. He'd be adopted in an instant. The Dogfather is the only one I can think of.

Exactly this. Only Harry also froze to death during the night.

** I think the only way of her conserving Harry without the letter or Dumbledore visiting, would be if something bad were to happen to Vernon or baby Dudley before that.

So she would be in a weak mental state and maybe would consider keeping Harry to fill the void
