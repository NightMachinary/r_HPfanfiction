Harry had received the resurrection stone early from Albus and was told of its ability to call upon souls. Harry wanted to test it but after the second turn he hesitated, not wanting to potentially hurt his parents by calling their souls. It then hit him.

"professor, horcruxes are bits of soul right? And Voldemort is technically a wraith possessing a fake body. What happens if I use to call his soul here?"


** Ooohh that is really cool. I never thought of it. Or alternatively imagine Harry getting his hands on the stone without Dumbledores knowledge and Harry plays with it and accidentally summons the soul piece of his head thus gaining a confused (The-night-I-wanted-to-kill-Harry-Potter) Voldemort as a ghostly companion. Just imagine this Voldemort trying to get Harry to be really good in school and stuff after he notices no one but Harry can see him, so that he can manipulate Harry into building him a body or so.

**** /Ghost-Voldemort growing more frustrated with his physical counterpart every time he tries to kill Harry/

"...must've already realized he is a Horcrux... as if that boy could talk to snakes on his own - Merlin POTTER pick that wand up or are trying to get us killed! -*

Weeks later: /suspiciously narrows eyes at Snape during Order meeting/

*** I like the original prompt, but I would read the poo out of this one! Or over time ghostie Voldemort (Ghostemort?) is affected by the non-tainted soul it's attached to and over time he wants Potter to do better for personal development, that is the power he knows not. By the time he and Harry can create a body, that soul piece is on the 'light' side so Ghostemort helps Harry with the horcruxes and battle Voldemort. With Ghostemort being the last remaining piece, but good, he lives his life out as a normal auror or something and dies of normal causes like blowing up a potion or something at the age of 89.

** He should have summoned Merlins or Herpo the Fool's soul to find a way to get the Horcrux out of his head without suicide.

** Here's the big question though: does he release Voldemort afterwards? Because on the one hand, it's causing v immense pain. On the other hand, v is scared of dying so... Which is the worse fate?
