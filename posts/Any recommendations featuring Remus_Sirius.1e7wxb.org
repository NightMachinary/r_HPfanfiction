It's my favourite pairing and I've read a lot. I seem to be running out of stories, any ideas?


** I'm not really a Wolfstar shipper, but damn, the Shoebox Project just killed me. I honestly cannot read any other Marauders fic because of it.

**** Even though it's not properly completed, I think it ends in quite a good place so that it doesn't feel unfinished.

** This is a very long fic, and unfortunately I cannot link it at the moment, but it is on fanfiction.net. It is called "Casting Moonshadows".

The plot follows the Marauders through their Hogwarts career, starting with Remus and Sirius as kids. Remus isn't part of the group at first, so it shows how he becomes their friend. Remus is abused by his father, Sirius is treated horribly by his family. It takes a little while for them to get together, but the story is very good. I highly recommend it.

It shows how they grow up and the differences in between the pureblood families. The boys also pull a lot of pranks, so if you like that, you get to read about how they pull off each large-scale prank (one of which includes a giant pumpkin monster and giant transfigured ships).

It is very worth your time to read it.

*** Casting Moonshadows is the one that got me hooked on this particular ship. Wonderful story.

**** Oh, it's completely riveting. I'm sad that it rarely updates, though. It's been months since the last one.
