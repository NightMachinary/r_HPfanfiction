Hey all,

As the title suggests, I'm looking for fics that do stereotypically bad tropes well. An example fic and trope(s) would be /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ by The Sinister Man which has the WBWL trope and a bit of the Lord Potter trope. Other fics I've read and like (not necessarily bad tropes done well, but just to give you a sense of what I like to read) are:

Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived

The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll

Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches

The Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs

The Arithmancer by White Squirrel

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi

The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville

I'm open to all sorts of suggestions, and my top interests would be well-written WBWL, Lord Potter, Wizarding Politics/Pureblood Culture and NotTotallyEvil!Voldemort. If there's any good Dramione fics, or (dare I say it) evil Ron fics, I'd be interested to try those. Also, I haven't read a good Severitus in a while, so if anyone knows any good recent ones of those, that'd be great.

I'm really open to anything, just looking for something new and different to read. Slash is fine, just no Harry Potter / Lord Voldemort pairing.

Thanks!


** Can I ask for a 'forgive Death Eaters again and again, give Malfoys chances to redeem themselves, blah blah' Dumbledore to be done well, instead of being a strawman/bash-target for Super!Lord!Harry who slaughters all the DE in inventive ways?

Think about it, Dumbledore is 110 years old or so at the start of book 1. That's enough time to see World War I, II, the American Civil Rights Movement, India's independence...that's dozens of genocides and dozens of civil rights movements.

And, he's a wizard, he could conceivably have a front row seat to any number of these events.

And then on top of that, there's Grindelwald; Dumbledore's best friend, he ended up terrorizing the entire wizarding world for decades, and very nearly convinced Dumbledore to join him.

Basically what I'm saying is, a century of all that, seeing what peace makes and what violence makes and what makes people turn to evil, wouldn't that influence a powerful wizard's philosophy towards peacemaker-no-matter-what?

So, can we have a 'forgive everyone and try to reform them' Albus Dumbledore who's meaningful and effective and potentially right? One who knows just how human the bad guys are, how possible it is for someone to fall to temptation, how horrible violence is and how effective olive branches can be?

*** If Dumbledore saw WW2, he'd never follow a philosophy of "peace, no matter what". He'd know that there's evil you need to fight.

There's nothing wrong with Dumbledore reaching out to those who can be redeemed - the problem is that few stories actually have Dumbledore redeem others. That takes far more than forgiving them; they need to make amends and prove themselves.

Even in canon, only Snape and Regulus could be judged as having redeemed themselves; the Malfoys only switch sides after realising that they'll not fare well under Voldemort.

Let me know if you find one, since I consider the idea impossible. It would be interesting to read a story to prove me wrong.

****** Me too. Dumbledore was nothing but a plot device, from spending an entire year for teaching Harry Voldemort's past (which could have been done in a single evening) to not telling the trio all they needed to know about their task, it's all done so the plot could stay on the rails and on schedule.

******* Yep. A lot of things in hindsight only happen because someone is carrying an idiot ball around, and it's usually Dumbledore. It's really easy to see why there are so many Evil!Manipulative!Dumbledore stories. To rationalize that many bad calls many people just assume "He HAD to be evil to make that many obvious mistakes...right?"

In reality J.K. made sure "the plot could stay on the rails and on schedule" and the writing is good enough that you don't care until you've reread the story many times.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
