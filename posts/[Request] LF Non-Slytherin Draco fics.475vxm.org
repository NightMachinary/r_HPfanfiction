Hi, I recently finished 'If You've A Ready Mind' by Maya and was wondering if there are any good fics where Draco is in Gryffindor/Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff? The above fic has Drarry as a pairing but I'm not too fond of slash...

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  "If you're thinking that I'm not going to put you in Slytherin, then you're quite right," sniffed the Hat, sounding somewhat vindictively gleeful. "The house which actually suits you best is---HUFFLEPUFF!"

  Minerva McGonagall steps in on the awful night the Potter are killed and arranges to have Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black and his somewhat cousins, the Malfoys. Draco and Harry grow up as almost brothers and everything - everything - is different. Gryffindor!Draco. Dramione. AU.

** I dont really get this - Draco in Hufflepuff or Gryffindor would propably end in either suicide or him being shipped to Durmstrang and that would be one short fic, lol. Or as a crackfic only, nothing serious. Is that why people like them?
