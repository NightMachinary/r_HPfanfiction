:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am searching for a Harry Potter fanfic in which harry was going to the court hearing and some distant royal relative sends his advisor to save him and makes him his heir. Harry was paired with Fleur in this. Sirius helps harry retrieve his things. Then harry returns to Hogwarts with bodyguards and at one point he also poses with his crown for a picture with Colin creevy.
