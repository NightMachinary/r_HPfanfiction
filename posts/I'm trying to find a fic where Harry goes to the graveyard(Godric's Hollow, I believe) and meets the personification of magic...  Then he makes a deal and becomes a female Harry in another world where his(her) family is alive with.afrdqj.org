That's all, I think. Oh, I also remember there being a deal made between Harry and magic such that Harry needed to do things for her....

Edit: Thanks for finding it [[/u/SkyRider123][u/SkyRider123]] ! It's linkffn(behindtheveil)


** I read this as "meets a female Harry..." and was excited for some selfcest. On re-reading the question, I'm less excited.

*** I see you're a man of culture as well.

Still hoping for one day to someone make a great, LONG, fic about this. Most are just so cockteases (in the figurative way) with their lenght and being incomplete.

** There's Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool, but it's not quite what you mentioned. No deal with anything as far as I can remember, but it's a scarred old Harry who goes back and lands in the body of a female Harry where his family is still alive.
