Yes please see the title, I'm having a lot of fun in NOTEPAD writing my first ever Super!Harry fic type, a super magic action extravaganza! :) If you want to read it too I might put it on my fanfic.net maybe, I don't know! :o


** Glad you're having fun with writing! Certainly put it up if you want feedback, but if you're happy just writing for yourself that's awesome too.
