After reading [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/bjfk6f/as_harry_is_a_horcrux_what_would_have_been_the/][this post]] I was wondering if there's any stories out there that have tried this.

I've read Second String and I know it's awesome :) I'm asking about stories that address the issue of Harry having a bit more than one soul though.

  Voldemort discovers his human horcrux and takes control of wizarding Britain. Harry is allowed to live though it's a knife-edged journey. Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, he struggles with a strange connection to Dark Marks and Tom Riddle whispering inside his head. AU dystopia. Story is mostly gen, though praised for its platonic intimacy between the two arch-enemies.

*** Great story in the beginning, with an evil Dumbledore I can truly appreciate, excellent explanation of mythology just being powerful wizards. Then it starts getting weird and racist.
