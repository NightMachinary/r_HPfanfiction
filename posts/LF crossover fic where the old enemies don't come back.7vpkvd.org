I was binge reading my crossover collection. Most of them were trash but there were few good ones but in almost all of them, an old enemy of the MC comes back to haunt MC. Maybe it is few surviving death eaters making troubles for Harry who become an Avenger, maybe it blood purists teaming up with his new enemies. Even in some fics where he somehow went to an entirely new universe, his old enemies find a way to his new home universe and make trouble for him.

I'm looking for stories where Harry goes to another universe crossovers with NO old enemy of his would find a way to his new one and make trouble for him.


** Linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) Harry has buried everyone from his old life, and the only person who is there from his old Universe is... well, just read the title.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
