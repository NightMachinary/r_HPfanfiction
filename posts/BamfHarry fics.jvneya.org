I'm looking for fics where Harry's basically a badass. The fics can be cliche or completely out-of-this-world original. My preference is that they're complete or at least have a lot of chapters or are being updated regularly. I'd also prefer to have no crossovers, though I'm open to crossovers with either Twilight or Avengers. That's all.

Here's a list of things I'm looking for (mix and mash at your convenience):

- fics where harry's really intelligent or academically inclined
- fics where harry's dark or grey but not necessarily evil
- fics where harry makes his own side in the war
- slytherin politics
- regular wizengamot politics
- fics where harry's good at wandless magic
- fics where harry doesn't care about killing
- master of death harry
- fics where harry's really good at duelling
- fics that take place post war or during hogwarts
- genfics or pairings
- parallel universe
- bashing
- harry/theo, harry/draco, and harry/voldemort or tom riddle are main contenders but i'll accept other pairings
- fics where harry has a completely different childhood
- partially founders era like in *linkffn(Gelosaþ in Écnesse)*
- parseltongue!
- fics where harry runs the DA really well

Things I *don't* want:

- *harems*/multiple pairings/threesomes
- *wrong boy who lived*
- *first person point of view*
- no harry/*bellatrix*
- muggles find out about wizards
- harry/oc
- female harry potter

*Thank you for any recommendations!*


** Pretty sure linkffn(Honor thy blood; Wind shears; The Templar Death, Shaken not stirred) fall into that spectrum Edit: made the commas into semicolons, the ffnbot should link now as far as i understand

If you managed to find it, could you provide a link? As usual, the bot doesn't like names (Names working is basically random, story IDs always work) and I can't find anything that jumps out at me as 'this is the one they mentioned!'. Also, 'The Templar Death', if you found that one.

***** Just a heads up, don't expect a sequel for wind shear. Chilord died a few years back. Stage 4 cancer.

Echoes of the Fallen is probably my favorite fics of his. It's a buffy the vampire slayer fic. Somewhat a YAHF, as well. Has Xander dressing as Magneto for Halloween and being left with his memories afterwards. Its pretty much a character study.

  Harry is involved in a temporal incident during a skirmish with Voldemort at Privet Drive. For him, a decade later, with new allies and a love, he returns on the Autumn Equinox a few months later, a powerful mage with a dislike of those corrupted by dark magic and abilites to kill a Dark Lord. How does a man who wants nothing more than peace struggle through brutal, bloody battles?

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

He usually does a great job of explaining any crossover universe tho. I didn't know anything about "Hawaii-Five-0" or "Rosario + Vampire" and still enjoyed his crossovers. So maybe just give it a go, or read a very short summary about the Mass Effect universe if you feel totally lost, but I doubt you will. It is definitely worth it.

  harry/voldemort or tom riddle
#+end_quote

aha my time to shine! tomarry is /saturated/ with bamf harry.

(Please note these are all my /opinions./ Not facts.)

​

Inevitabilities linkao3(16308554) is a personal favourite. I love EclipseWing's writing style to death.

Diagnosis linkao3(12707139) is a masterpiece. Medical AU where Harry is so fucking cool I love him here. All of MaidenMotherCrone's fics just hit the spot. I know you said no crossovers but Fairest linkao3(11614332) was so good I have to at least link it. It's GoT/ASOIAF but with HP characters and is frankly fucking amazing.

Full Circle linkao3(6614155) is humour and hasn't updated for a while but it's immensely satisfying to read.

​

The following contain underage relationships:

Linkffn(5402147) is a favourite to reread.

Linkffn( 8195669 ) is more Hogwarts based.

Linkffn(4924413) is enthralling. Utterly enthralling.

​

And finally a few classics: (I'm too lazy to comment about these but they're classics imo.)

Linkffn(8149841)

Linkffn(6985795)

Linkffn(3532054)

  After an accident, Harry wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but Tom Riddle has a habit of making himself Harry's problem.

Slow-burn powerup, creative combat, action-heavy, and believable. International travel, to places and settings almost never used in fanfics, canon is thrown out the window after First Year.

Just updated it, only 1 more chapter til it's complete. If you read one action story this year, make it linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

Focus on wandless magic. Muggle OC is an important side character, but no muggles vs. magic.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

#+begin_quote
  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
