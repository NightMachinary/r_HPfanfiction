So, like almost all fantasy book, Harry Potter focus on Europe with a slight medieval theme. I'm bored of this, give me new horizons please.

I'm looking for either 1) African community of wizard, it can be Harry or any character. I want to discover a new way to be a magical. Is there a huge community of Egyptian sorcerer and sorceress being casual with inferi because “mummies have their use as servant, you know, it's an honor to give your flesh vessel to service your family forever after you go seek Osiris” or something. Do they still have pharaoh ? Is Alexandrie library “burnt down” because magical couldn't remove every mention of magic among it so they used a massive amount of floo powder to get it somewhere behind muggle repelling wards, only to discover they made a too big fire

2) Anything else than medieval themes : pirates ? Steampunks? Renaissance? Romans/Greek ? Prehistoric wizard ? Otori clan-like wizard. Anything to change things a bit.

3) Plague or similar bleak settings (the dishonored/HP was really good). Magic running out / chaotic. Dark magic making people mad was only the beginning of magic poisoning because now magic is heavily unhealthy, everyone is at risk of loosing their minds / mutate. Magic is in fact a non renewable energy release magical waste, and magical ley line change is coming, only no politician want to do anything because pureblood will lose money if they had to pay a tax for improper magical waste disposal.

Please and thank you Signed: A starved ffic reader


** I've read a fic where Harry is adopted by a Somali warlord at 6 years old. There's a fair bit of non-European magic as well. However, it gets a bit rapey at times with attacks on rival-controlled villages so linking it may be forbidden by rule 8.

  Hermione comes up with a contingency plan for Harry's Ministry hearing, and they decide their education can be better pursued elsewhere---at the largest and oldest school of magic in the world: Uagadou. Voldemort won't know what hit him. Harry/Hermione.
