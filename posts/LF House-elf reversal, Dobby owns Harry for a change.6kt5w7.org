Following [[/u/TheBlueMenace][u/TheBlueMenace]] 's example, I thought I'd ask about something I haven't asked for in a while.

Namely, are there any role-reversal fics where by some means, Harry ends up being Dobby's house-human, instead of Dobby being Harry's house-elf? 0800-Rent-A-Hero doesn't count.


** "But Hermioneeeee, I don't want to serve that house elf for a year. Besides. I'm the hero of the Wizarding World!"

"First of all, his name is Dobby, and he is a FREE elf." Hermione smacked him on the back of the head, and gave him a stern look. "You will do it, or this wedding is off. The way they sacrificed themselves wholesale so that their cruel overlords don't die!? And they get NO thanks at all? No. This will simply not do. If we don't set an example by doing something dramatic, this entire subjugation of an entire species is going to continue, and human and magical creature relations will continue to be at the breaking point. Or do we want a repeat of Voldemort's divide-and-conquer strategy, where he reached out to put-upon magical beings, and got them on his side?"

Harry sighed a deep, body-shuddering sigh, and replied, "I know, I know. We've been over this. Who knows, maybe it'll be nice to get away for a bit, and just focus on something purely menial, instead of having to be the centre of attention for a rabid public."

"Exactly," Hermione replied. "After that year in the forest, and the final battle, you've been looking more frayed than when Umbridge was lurking about, and that's saying something. This'll be a chance to get out of the public eye, and not have to be constantly looking over your shoulder. Besides. I'll be in Australia anyway, taking care of the house elf who watched after my parents. We can't get married until I finish working with her to figure out how to reverse those infernal memory charms."

Harry gave Hermione a tight hug. "I hope you're right, my love."

--------------

"Does master Harry Potter Sir wants another cup of tea?"

"It's just Harry, Dobby. And I'll fetch it myself. You've been following me around all day. I'm supposed to be serving you, not the other way around."

"Does Master Just Harry Potter Sir wants another cup of tea? And Dobby is not serving the great Harry Potter Sir as a servant, Dobby is serving the great wonderful Harry Potter Sir as his truest friend."

"Fine. I'll have mine with lemon, please. But I'll throw together some sandwiches, agreed?" Harry did a sharp turn, and walked over to the pantry, so that Dobby wouldn't see his eyes getting misty for just a moment. After all they'd lost, the exuberant little elf was still a loyal (if a bit exuberant) friend.

The two of them puttered around the kitchen, as Dobby filled Harry in on all the current goings on of his house elf friends from back in Hogwarts, and Harry filled Dobby in on the goings on that he'd gotten from Hermione in Australia. He had to practically wrestle the broom out of Dobby's hands before Dobby automatically started cleaning up after both of them.

"DOBBY! This is Harry Pott-- erm--MY job. Hand it over!"

"It just is a little scrubbing! I'd be done before you know it, and then you won't have to get your hands dirty," said Dobby.

"Here, just take the tea and sandwiches to the table. I'll have this mess sorted in short order, OK?" Harry pulled out his wand, and gave the entire kitchen a quick once-over with the spell he and Mrs Weasly had developed. "Culina aquam!" A great wave of water came through the place, washed over every surface, and dumped itself neatly into the garden pond, to feed the fish with the crumbs.

The two went to the newly sparkling table, and enjoyed a lovely meal together.

*** Neato.

Makes me wonder, actually. Gandhi put on his loincloth to show solidarity with impoverished people in India, would Harry or Hermione embrace slavery to show solidarity with elves?

...Actually, improve my historical knowledge here; who are other people who have changed how they dress, how they act, what they eat or how they live or et-cetera, to bring attention to the suffering of a lower social class?

I remember something in school where everyone ate rice for a day to think about the Children Starving In Africa, but that's about it.

*** Well, we all know what the fic will be called now if one ever comes out with this concept in mind.
