:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago. I remember Harry was gone from the Dursley's pre-hogwarts, although I do not remember how. After that, he met two people, fellow orphans who would be his sort of siblings, one muggle and one girl who turns out to be the heir of Ravenclaw. He doesn't know about wands, so he uses only wandless magic at first. He ends up in slytherin when he makes it to hogwarts.


** Thanks to anyone who tried to help, I've found the fic. It was linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hero's Path)

** You really aren't giving us much to work with here. :/ Anything more? No matter how trivial would help, especially if it happened in the beginning of the story because some of us might have begun reading it and then dropped it.\\
Edit: Or how long ago was it you read it in years?
