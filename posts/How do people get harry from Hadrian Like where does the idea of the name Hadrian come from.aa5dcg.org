** It was the name of a Roman emperor, so it fits with the pureblood naming conventions of being pretentious as heck. It also sounds cooler than Harold, and both start with Ha with an R in there somewhere.

Tbh, I'm guessing someone wrote a pureblood fic using it at some point and the name just caught on for lack of better options.

***** I've got a headcanon that Lily's father was also a Harry. We don't know, but I've always written her parents as Harry and Vi (Violet) Evans.

Petunia calls it a “nasty, common name” at one point...but the thing about Petunia is that she married up a bit with Vernon, and she's acutely aware of that. The Dursley family clearly comes from at least /some/ money - enough to have sent generations of their sons to a place like Smeltings.

The girl from a Derbyshire mill town has affected a BBC radio announcer's voice to hide her natural accent, never told anyone anything concrete about her family (even though she has nothing to be ashamed of) and generally tried very, very hard to fit in on the Surrey stockbroker belt.

****** Petunia calling it a “nasty, common name” is irony: the reader is supposed to be aware that it is obviously not true, to be familiar with Prince Harry for example, and to read “Dudley” (and “Vernon” and “Petunia”) as... well, common and nasty. It's all very “[[http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/john_betjeman/poems/785][Phone for the fish knives]]”.

And yes, I've never got why people would think “Harold” would be reasonable. That's barely a step-up from “Neville”.

********** Or concluding that the Windsors are common. One of the stereotypes around the lower middle classes who strive to be considered proper (‘non-U' and all that) is that they get it all backwards: they think ‘serviettes' is better than ‘napkins', and ‘pardon' better than ‘what', and so simultaneously mark themselves as non-U while reading the U as unspeakably crass.

There was genuinely some stuff a decade or so ago about the Windsors being a bit common, though, with the Queen using tupperware and things like that. Germanic johnny-come-latelies to the native aristocracy, or something along those lines.

But seriously, Petunia will probably have gone a bit red and then continued to maintain that Harry's name was common while ‘Dudley' was a strong, respectable name. It's hard to know how much cognitive dissonance is involved, and how much social incompetence.

** If you want Harry to have a more fancy name Hadrian works quite well as it starts with the same two letters and Hadrian was a Roman emperor and Roman names are used for other characters too (Severus, Lucius etc).

Mist of the fics where Harry is short for Hadrian also have him as "lord Potter" so a roman emperor name fits with the persona.

Also Harry is usually short for Harold. Hadrian is a sexier name while it still being plausible that Harry could be a nickname.

*** Even if it makes sense, I hate it when I see it in fics now. I've read through too many that use this convention where the author takes themself way to seriously while trying and failing to write something deep and meaningful. Wisdom and elegance only work when the person isn't trying to look wise or elegant. When it's forced the character just ends up looking like a tool. I'm off topic now... I just don't like seeing hadrian anymore, but it's not because I dislike the name.

** From what I've seen, people go for a longer name that could believably be nicknamed to Harry when writing lord Potter/dark Harry/pureblood politics kind of fanfics. Hadrian is actually one of the better names that pop up in those, and one that I actually like - I cannot take seriously fics when Harry's 'full name' is Harridan or Haraldr.

Fics that I've read with Hadrian are where Harry has to ditch his original name for a disguise. I read a lot of time travel. Thus Hadrian Evans is born! It's close enough to Harry but still different.

Mine is because of a smilair reason (it's fine travel, kind of) where one Hadrian Peverell is hosting the memories of future Harry Potter. The names are similar because they are connected or some shit lmao
