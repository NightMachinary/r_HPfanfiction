** linkao3(1048010) from the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] series. Highly recommended! Although, in terms of sexuality it is correctly rated PG-13 (I don't think somebody gets kissed), the series has some parts which are the most nightmare-inducing stuff I have read ever. And also (in later part of series) “1984 with Dementors” is one of the best fanfic stories I have read. Highly recommended (if it is not obvious).
