What I mean is, are there any completely off-the-wall crazy stories that are presented seriously yet have a 'cracky' premise? Or, stories that just completely leave canon behind? I just want something... new, I suppose


** There was a meandering story on Ficwad that included a piece lasting a few chapters about Charlie Weasley rediscovering a water nymph's sacred pool in the Forbidden Forest. He was granted a vision of how the nymph had negotiated with the Founders to establish this as a protected area near their intended castle. I think it may have even been a primary reason for the location being chosen. Somehow this ends up being a catalyst for his finally abandoning his Quidditch ambitions for creature handling.

It was great stuff- moody, meaningful and sexy without being tawdry (though I may not be the best judge of that).

The specific section is called [[http://ficwad.com/story/155041][Into the Glade]]

** So without being based on humour? Well, I guess linkffn(9911469), "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus", and linkffn(7552826), "An Unfound Door", kind of fit. The premises they start off with are, respectively:

[[/spoiler][1. Lily (fem!Harry) accidentally kills herself, finds herself with a MOD!Harry and a disgruntled TMR/Voldemort at a train station. This happens a lot. 2. Ravenclaw Harry deals drugs/illicit potions.]]

Or do you want something entirely or mostly AU?

The series '[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]]' by mad_fairy, seemingly starts out your typical misguided!Dumbledore fic and goes completely off the rails into space travel.

** linkao3(Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels) This is likely not what you mean and may not be something you would read since it is a HGSS story that is a little messed up at times, but I have always thought of the undelying storyline for this story to be very absurd and something that belonged to a crackish smut fic rather than a serious story. I was surprised by the quality of the story and characters and how the author eventually manages to explain everything in a way that more or less makes sense.

The premise is that a marriage law that forces people together is passed and Hermione has to marry Snape and have lots of children with him as per Ministry law. While there are some explicit scenes, the plot gets very interesting, intense and well thought out with lots of great action scenes and twists. The characterizations are great and everyone feels more or less in character. Has some great humourous scenes too.

Warnings: it does have explicit smut, dubious consent and occasionally violence so read at your own risk.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

** I'm not sure if it fits the request, but I have “In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life” (linkffn(9118202)).

As for leaving canon behind, unless you've already done it I recommend taking a look at esama's “Island of Fire” (linkao3(3236603)), then its sequels, and then any- and everything she wrote, including non--Harry-Potter things for as long as you know the base story/game/whatever (some of them are really good). Quite many of her stories take some world and then twist it into a wonderful AU pretzel (I think it's most prominent with her FF7 stories, but there are some HP ones that go quite far in this direction too).
