Like if Lily wanted to protect Harry throughly and she put some extra things in it, something along the lines of Blessed Blood where her sacrifice powered a ritual that gives harry super strength, speed, magic, and other things.


** Linkffn(Aggressive Love)

Just an FYI, it starts weird and gets more so.

  Both Dumbledore and Voldemort underestimated just how powerful Lily's sacrifice for Harry really was. There was nothing she wouldn't do to ensure her son had a life full of the love and happiness he deserves. She'd make sure of it. "The power of love is a great thing. Terrifying. But great." Harry!Harem Harry/Multi, Genderbent!Voldemort, and lemons.
