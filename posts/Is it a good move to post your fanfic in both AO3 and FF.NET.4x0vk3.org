** Uh, yes.

They have different readerships for the most part, so you're going to be showing your work to different audiences of people, and although Ao3 has a much smaller audience, both have fairly significant HP readerships.

Be aware that on Ao3 your summary can and should be longer than the 250 character limit on FFnet, and pairings and tropes, as well as the characters involved, should be tagged in the Ao3 options for those.

For FFnet, your summary should be short and snappy, and usually you should have some tags at the end of the summary giving some info about your fic.

On Ao3, people are far less willing to open a fic if there's no idea of what it contains. They're generally looking for specific things, and subsequently people who prefer Ao3 generally tend to say that Ao3 has better quality works. That's obviously not true, as there are both great and shit fics on both websites, but on Ao3 it's much easier to pick your way through for fics that are more to your liking, and it's easier to search for certain specifics.

*** The AO3 tag system is a double-edged sword though, by which I mean it's an absolute mess.

**** Yeah.

I also dislike how it's possible to filter for what you want, but not for stuff you /don't/ want.

For example, my OTP is Remus/Sirius, so that's what I search for, but the filters won't let me filter out fics where there are also other pairings (say, Harry/Draco). This can be frustrating at times.

***** You certainly can -- [[http://filter-me-ao3.tumblr.com][this tumblr site]] is a good reference on how to do it.

****** Thanks, I'll look into that!

(I have nothing against other pairings; it's just that when I search for Remus/Sirius fics it's Remus/Sirius-centric fics I'm wanting and not fics where they're background to something else!)

*** I didn't realize how much readers cared where it was posted? I stopped looking for fics at random years ago, I either search through a rec list, reddit, or favorite fics of writers I like. I read on journal sites as well as normal archives. On some of the yahoo groups stories have been recced and peopled have said they wont read them on so and so, why do people limit themselves like that?

**** I'll only go to ffnet based on recommendations from this sub. I find ao3 at least /possible/ to browse, although tbh I mostly use it for smut \o/

But yeah, there are people who will read any new thing on ff, or on ao3, and I guess that's how they get read in the first place!

** I have been doing that for a couple of years. I find at ff.net I get a lot of short reviews eg. "good update!" whereas at ao3 I seem to get more con crit and thoughtful, long reviews. I find it valuable to post at both.

*** Really? In the FFN vs. AO3 articles I've seen, one of the complaints against AO3 is that so few people comment there. Has that changed since those articles were written?

**** From my own experience, though granted most of my stories are 5+ years old, I have way WAY more reviews on ff.net than I do on ao3. I probably also have 10x more hits at least because I only uploaded the stories to ao3 last year, but still. I would agree with those articles.

** Yes. FFN has a larger readership, but the seach and tagging functions at AO3 make it much easier for people to find your work.

** My subjective view is you're right, wayyyy less comments but I suppose to me they are more meaningful because they are detailed, thoughtful or legit concrit.

*** Did/would you post to ff.net or to Fiction Press? It's like a partner website to ff.net but for original works; it's smaller but there's some good stuff there.

***** Hah, maybe. The original fiction on there is good, but it's not really the same quality as the fanfic - maybe that's just because I hadn't already connected to the characters, idk. It was definitely a smaller readership though, even as a partner website to ff.net.
