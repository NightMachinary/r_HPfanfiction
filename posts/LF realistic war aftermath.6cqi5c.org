I want to see the characters deal with PTSD, depression and grief. I want to see relationships break down. Basically, I want to know what happens once Voldemort is finally defeated and everyone can finally deal with their emotions.

I'd love a fic focused on Harry/Ron/Hermione, but don't mind if the fic has other MCs as long as it's well written ^{^} Thanks in advance!

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** I just finished reading linkffn(what comes next by bex-la-get) and enjoyed it. Not wonderful for the whole post war grief and trauma healing, but it definitely was one of the few that I've read that involved mental health healing and relationship mending.

It's faster paced and spans multiple years, overall it's a romance more than anything.

If I remember right, linkffn(the first day by little0bird) might be closer to what you're seeking, but I can't remember too much of the plot past the beginning since it's been a while.

** I really like linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation). It takes a serious (and very dark) look at how messed up the wizarding world is even after Voldemort. Hasn't updated in years, but still hoping.

** I'll also give a tongue-in-cheek mention of my own one-shot [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-31520/dspeyer+Black+Goo.htm][Black Goo]], which is a logical extrapolation of what comes next, albeit not really what you were looking for.
