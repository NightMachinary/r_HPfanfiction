** My headcanon is hat the inventor of Floo was inspired by phoenix travel, but never managed to completely emulate it.

** Alternate possibility: Phoenixes /secrete/ Floo Powder (or a highly rough form thereof). That's where all of it comes from. Maybe Floo Powder is ground Phoenix Feathers or something.

*** Or phoenix ash.

Anyway, we know Floo Powder was /invented/ by someone in the 18th(?) century, so thats unlikely.

**** Well, modern Floo Powder clearly doesn't work /quite/ like Phoenix Flaming: it connects to the Floo Network and will only land you in a chimney, not anywhere you can imagine. Presumably, within the boundaries of this theory, the "inventor" was the one who refined natural Phoenix powder into modern, easy-to-use, regulated Floo Powder --- kind of like petrol vs. usable car fuel.

**** Perhaps phoenix ash is a component. Like a whole barrel of floo powder can be mixed up using the ash from a single rebirth or something.

** I'm like 99% sure that phoenixes can't teleport in canon. In OotP Dumbledore just walks out of his office after stunning the aurors. It's only in the movies where Fawkes teleports him to his secret bat cave... goat cave? Old goat cave?

  Fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him. Dumbledore released Harry, raised his hand and grasped the phoenix's long golden tail. There was a flash of fire and the pair of them were gone.

** Floo-powered fire turns green, no? If a Phoenix flashes green when he teleports, then maybe.
