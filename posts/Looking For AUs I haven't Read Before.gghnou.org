I'm hoping for a list of recs. What sort? Well... I like independent!Harry, time-travel, and Weasley- and Dumbledore-bashing. I don't care if it contains romance or not, but if it does, I prefer that aspect to be believable (and I don't care which ship, save that I loathe how Harry wound up with Ginny in canon - it always struck me as far too Oedipal for my tastes). I don't read WIPs, so it needs to be complete. My only other absolute must is a decent grasp of grammar.

I'll be happy if I get a single story recommended to me that I have not yet read.


** Linkffn(You're my Density) is AU, timetravel, Harry/Hermione romance.

Linkffn(Blindness) is AU, independent super!Harry (who still stumbles across a concrete barrier), romance with Hermione, Weasley practically nonexistent.

Linkffn(Invincible by DarthMarrs) is AU crossover with Battlestar Galactica, no time travel but space travel to another star system (at FTL speed which according to Einstein is really close to time travel), Harry is an independent spaceship captain.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) has Dumbledore set fire to a chicken for some reason (utterly insane), Harry is extremely independent and time travels all the time, Ginny doesn't make a single appearance. It's weird at first but it's got a few things it does really well.

Linkffn(In the mind of a scientist) fits most criteria as well.

Linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot) has independent Harry on a world trip. Dumbledore gets somewhat bashed for his inability to find him, but so does everyone else. Glorious crack.

And finally since you asked so nicely:

Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

-Two seperate AUs with Dimension travel

-Ron-centric

-Dumbledore's a good guy

-Weasleys are awesome in both dimensions

-Two sets of Harry/Ginny relationships

-And it's a WIP

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344][Grey Space]] by noaacat) is an AU where Hogwarts starts when kids are 14. Harry spends a lot longer with the Dursleys.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296][Blood Crest]] by Cauchy) is one where Harry gets "saved" by someone who's honestly worse than the Dursleys.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.
