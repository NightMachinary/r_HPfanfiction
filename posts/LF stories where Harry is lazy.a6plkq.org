I just recently finished reading the most recent update of /Harry the Hufflepuff/ and, enjoying it immensely, thought I'd see if there were other "Harry is lazy" stories out there, though Google was no help.


** I keep checking this post in the hope there will be stories

** I don't have any stories for you but out of curiousity, what makes you interested in a "lazy Harry" story? I feel like that could get boring really quickly. I can understand wanting him closer to canon than a lot of smart/studious!Harry fics make him out to be but if it's a canon compliant fic then him being straight up lazy would seem pretty odd while he's trying to survive Hogwarts and Voldemort.

From my understanding Harry the Hufflepuff (I started reading it but didn't finish) would make sense since Voldemort isn't an issue, so are you looking for more fics like that or ones with that personality applied to the usual fics that stay closer to canon?

*** "Lazy" main character stories tend to be relaxing for me, because they're generally stories where the main character avoid conflict simply because they're too much of an effort to deal with. It's a lot more of the main character using cleverness to get out of work.

â€‹

Voldy is still a problem in *Harry the Hufflepuff*, but Harry generally just can't be arsed to care because it would take too much effort, so unless somebody reluctantly drags him along to deal with the problem, he's off doing his own thing. I'm generally looking for more stories like that, where Harry Potter is lackadaisical but clever in trying to get out of work, because I find them clever and relaxing to read.

*** Honestly, J.K. Rowling's series has more of an incompetent Potter than a lazy Potter.
