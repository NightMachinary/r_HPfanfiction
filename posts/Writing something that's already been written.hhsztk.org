I just jumped into writing a story, super excited, everything is spilling out onto the page. Words are coming to life under my pen like magic and I've never been this excited about a story in years. I get 5 chapters deep and realize...I've read this story. It was an incomplete WIP from years ago...maybe 2011? It's not the exact same mind you, but some of the thoughts are based off that fanfiction I had read that I've been waiting years for an update on. I haven't put it out there in the wild since I realized this. I'm super sad now because I have to tell all my characters to go take a nap because I feel like I can't finish it. Dolohov is not happy...So my question is have you ever done something similar and what did you do about it? I don't want to come off as stealing someone else's work so I'm going to scrap it but my mind is still telling me to write it down. Help!


** Nope! Finish it!

ALL ideas have been done before. As long as you aren't lifting words from another author, go for it. If you can remember the author's name, you could do an "inspired by x" bit and link their work.

*** Yep, that was one of the best things a literature teacher ever told me.

There are no new stories. Mark Twain said it well:

‚ÄúThere is no such thing as a new idea. It is impossible. We simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort of mental kaleidoscope. We give them a turn and they make new and curious combinations. We keep on turning and making new combinations indefinitely; but they are the same old pieces of colored glass that have been in use through all the ages.‚Äù

**** You want to know something cool? There's scientific evidence to support this. Scientists put a bunch of people in an FMRI machine and asked them to alternate between imagining whatever they're told to imagine and "imagine something completely new, something you've never heard of before." People's brains lit up in exactly the same way, as if they were "remembering" the new object rather than spontaneously generating new ideas.

The scientists concluded something along the lines of "the human brain can't male truly new ideas, only reassembling the ideas it already has."

I'll come back and provide a link if I can find the article.

** There's many different stories in the same genre hinging on the same base ideas. If it has your unique voice and you put your own spin on it, and you're passionate about it, then go for it!!

*** I'm really glad that I don't have to throw it out because this is the most intense piece of work I've started in years in fanfiction. I would hate not to share it with someone who may be looking for something like it.

** One of the things that actually made me take Dan Brown seriously as a writer was a single line in his masterclass talk on how to write thrillers - "You don't need a big idea. You need big hows." It's not about what plot points, tropes, or even cliches you use, it's just about how you use them. And you can use them very, very differently. For example, the 'Boy leaves the farm' trope is a pretty common one - in Star Wars, that happens when Luke leaves Tatooine to go on the Millennium Falcon, in Harry Potter, when Hagrid takes Harry to the Wizarding World, in Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit both, when a Baggins leaves Bag End to go on an adventure, and in many others besides.

I could go into the full explanation of tropes, but I'll spare you that. Basically, a trope (ie. a similarity to something seen before) is a good thing because it allows your audience some familiarity to leapfrog their immersion and empathy from into the things they've never experienced. If Hogwarts was completely original, with no Boarding School tropes, it'd be really hard to empathise with the characters, whereas due to it being really Boarding School tropey, people can find similarity with their schooling experience and immerse themselves in it.

Basically, so long as you're not directly copying the wording of someone else's fic (you can legally do it, but it's kind of a dick move), then all that matters is that you're telling a story you enjoy and want others to enjoy with you.

** My creative writing teacher said you shouldn't aim to be original, because everything has already been done. Aim to take a concept and make it yours. Write your interpretation of it.

** Contact the original author immediately and try to discuss with him your writing of sequel/prequel/whatever. If you like your story, and if it is just a cribbed version of hers, than there is no reason why you shouldn't finish it.

Hermione will do everything in her power to give them a home but if in doing so, she has to spend some 'quality time' with their parents in order to raise them, so be it." üò¨
