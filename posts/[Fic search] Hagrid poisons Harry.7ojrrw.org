So I've been hunting down this story for a while, but can't find it. From my foggiest of recollections, it was kind of fandom-famous back in the '07-'08 days, but I could be misremembering.

It was a oneshot of Hagrid and Harry sitting in Hagrid's hut, having tea. About 3/4 of the way through, it's revealed that Hagrid had slipped poison into Harry's tea because Voldemort is offering rights to giants that were too tempting.

For the life of me, I can't find this anywhere and would love to hear from other people who might remember it or know where it's housed.

** Yeah, I know the fic. It's [[http://members.ozemail.com.au/%7Ebrussell/tea.htm][A Nice Cup Of Tea And A Lie Down]] by Bernice.

Didn't really like it all that much. I thought Hagrid's reasons for turning on Harry and Dumbledore didn't ring true to his character -- yes, being a half-giant sucks, but Hagrid's the sort to step in front of those he loves to take a bullet for them, not to sell them out for his personal safety.

Besides, he should know that any promises made by Voldemort of all people aren't worth anything. You KNOW Voldemort only keeps his promises if they don't inconvenience him in any way -- the moment keeping a promise is the slightest bit of a bother, he'll break it without a thought or concern. Hagrid would have known better.

*** I 100% agree with your analysis! In fact, I've been trying to track it down because I remember thinking it didn't quite add up at the time I read it and wanted to give it another read since I was so young back then. Then I come to find out that nobody I knew remembered reading it or even hearing about it, and I had to follow the thread until I convinced myself I didn't imagine the whole thing.

Thank you so much, you rock!

** The premise was always going to be a little OOC, but for what it is, it's... well, I mean, /if/ Hagrid decided to side with Voldemort and wanted to kill Harry, this /is/ a very well-written version of what would happen.
