Hi everyone, I've started outlining and writing my first fanfic, and I'm quite excited about the story. My story does include a fairly big age gap for the main pairing, and I'm afraid to mention who the pairing is if I get backlash. It's also a fairly rare pair, I don't see it that much in fics. However, I stumbled across a tumblr group chat talking about how disgusting age gap pairings were, and I got insecure. So, I haven't worked on my fanfic yet tonight, even though I have been every night since I came up with the idea.

Should I just abandon the fic in favor of some other ideas I've been thinking of? I just don't want to make people upset or have people get a bad impression of me, even though I was really looking forward to creating this story. What do you all think?


** If you're going to get discouraged by some people on the Internet talking shit, you'll never get anything done. There'll always be a group of people somewhere on tumbler that disapprove of any or all actions you could conceivably take.

** People tend to find age gap pairings messed up if the older one is/was in a position of power over the younger or the younger is underage. It also gets a bit gross if the older person knew the younger as a child and there's a creepy "I was waiting for you to be old enough" undertone.

Remus/Nymphadora pretty much everyone's okay with because she was going into her mid twenties and met Remus at that age.

These are very safe rules to go by, and if you can't change the story to make them work, and you have a different idea, maybe just move on because there will be some backlash.

Bathinda Bagehot/Stan Shunpike is better than anything with Snape.

*** Okay I'll just be honest and see what you think about this pairing: I was going to write Sirius/Hermione post-war. She would be of age, I wasn't going to write smut, and it was going to be a very slow burn. And Sirius was never in any ‚Äúpower‚Äù over Hermione. I created a plot line in which it would be very believable (or so I think) that they might end up together, but it's a rare-pair and I'm not really sure what people think about it. What are your thoughts?

***** Yeah, this is a pet peeve of mine. Like, I'd be completely freaked out if a parental figure starts fucking my best friend. It's creepy. That'd be the end of two relationships for me pretty quickly and yet Hermione/Sirius and Hermione/Remus are super common. It doesn't help this is often paired with a tiny bit of Harry or Ron bashing to explain why Sirius fucking Harry's best friend is totally cool and really it's Harry who's the asshole.

That said - if she's not underage or was being groomed for sex as a school kid then whatever. This also isn't really a rare-pair, it's fairly common.

****** I get what you mean. It would actually be post-war and it's a Voldemort Wins/Harry dies AU. So it's dark, and there's a lot of reasons I'm seeing them end up together, particularly after the death of Harry. She'll be of age and no grooming or anything will be involved. I didn't know it was common, I don't see many stories with this pairing. But I see what you mean. That's partially why I made this a post-war/non Harry story, because I think having him around would make things very very weird. Maybe that's me taking the easy way out as an author though, I don't know.

**** To give you my personal opinion, I'd never read such a story, but not because of the pairing - rather experience has taught me that Hermione centric stories annoy the fuck out of me.

The fact that you can't please everyone is an important life lesson to internalize.

So go for it and don't give the haters any consideration. If you get negative reviews about the premise, delete them without a second thought. Life is too short to worry about random trolls on the internet think.

** This is sadly a fact of life in the fandom at the moment.

However, there will always be those who judge stories unfairly based on applying their own expectations, sight-unseen. Just as there are those who say that 'all fanfiction is crap smut written by degenerates' without ever having actually explored the fandom outside of a few of highly visible 'memefics' there are those who will immediately label age-gaps in much the same way.

The perspective is understandable. Fiction has a power to normalise things. Usually this is beneficial, for example in the representation of homosexual or trans people who usually get short thrift in conventional published fiction. Fanfic has, I am sure, helped a great many people come to terms with who they are, by seeing that they are /not/ freaks of nature, but part of a global community with shared experiences. However, that normalising power is occasionally cited by moral crusaders as being a bad thing when combined with 'problematic' or 'troublesome' ideas.

In the 90s, the Shawshank Redemption was released to cinemas, based on a novella by Stephen King. It received a significant amount of criticism due to its humanising portrayal of incarcerated criminals. Today, it is typically listed among the greatest and most important movies of all time. /Not/ because it is apologising for people who committed murder, or theft or any other crime, but because it reminds us that, whatever their actions, those things are part of the human experience. Whether we like it or not, these things happen and, contrary to what we'd like to think, being a convicted criminal does not make someone /all/ evil. Similarly, those who are /not/ convicted criminals are /not/ all good.

The world exists and shades of grey, and Fiction, be it in the form of movies or books, should serve to paint a picture of the world in all its shades. Lolita is a deeply troubling novel, but its worth in increasing a reader's understanding of how the human condition can lead to such worrying thoughts and actions cannot be denied.

I do not want to suggest that age-gap pairings (or, as many of the those who feel them to be immoral might say, paedophilic pairings) are something we as a society will 'grow out of disliking', in the same way much of society has grown out of the blanket demonization of criminals. Nor do I want to imply that age-gap pairings are equivalent to Lolita, as by no means do all age-gap pairings involve relationships which are quite so troubling to the general populace.

All I am saying is that it is not the job of fiction to define what the human condition is and can be. Fiction is merely meant to describe it. All its curves and its edges; all its heady peaks and lowly troughs, the good and the bad, the dark and the light. It is only through understanding of who we (collective 'we') are as humans, and what we all can be, or be seen to be, that we each can individually grow into the people we all wish to be. And if we are to do that, we must see it all. We must see that which we believe to be bad so that we do not lose sight of the fact that we all are on the same journey. But for a few missed wrong turns, I could perhaps have been Red, or Humbert Humbert.

This is all a very long-winded way of saying that you should write whatever it is that is in you to write. Write that story, and post it. Add to the sum of what humans are and can be, and do not back down.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

*** This is fantastic. Thank you very much for this insightful post. Yeah I'm not writing this age gap relationship to say that this is the end-all be-all for what relationships should look like. It's almost the opposite. My pairing takes place in a dark, Voldemort wins AU. These two, due to lots of things, are emotionally broken. So I'm writing the pairing trying to grapple with life together, not to say ‚Äúlook at these two, they're doing great so therefore age gaps are perfectly acceptable‚Äù. No. I'm writing the two together because of who they are as people, what they've gone through, and the similarities I see between them. You've definitely encouraged me. Thank you!!!

** Tumbler groups tend to magnify radical or extreme ideas, and shouldn't be given much authority to influence what you write.

Rough rule - every character in a relationship needs to either be of age, or under age. You can't mix, unless your plot is literally about the problems that causes.

As long as every one is of age, go for it. Some folk won't like what you write, but that's always going to be the case. Some folk may even be offended, but that will always be the case no matter what you write.

The most important rule is to write what you want to write, screw the haters.

**** You are, only because you could take months and try and figure out the exact combination of characters and relationships that won't offend anyone and still get some asshole trolling you on your first chapter. As a writer, people are going to criticize your writing no matter what - write something you are proud of and don't worry overmuch about what people on the internet think. Not to mention your writing is naturally going to be better writing about characters and relationships you're interested in, rather than trying to adapt to other people's preferences.

***** Thank you, this is really solid advice. I really want to write this, and I know people write a lot of age gap pairings for Snarry, Snape/Hermione, etc. So I don't know why I'm so nervous about mine (I'll just go ahead and say it, it's eventual Sirius/Hermione). I could easily transform it into Sirius being a mentor rather than a romantic partner as the whole fic will have a found family vibe. but I just saw it as a romance. I guess I want it to be kudosed and commented on (what author doesn't?), but I have a couple options I think. Either write what I want to write, or use one of my other ideas for a more popular pairing

** It depends. Are they all 18+ age wise? And are all parties involved aware of age difference? Because I read a hermione/grindlewald fic a while back and it wasn't creepy or icky The age gap thing comes into play typically when the age of consent isn't met and the parties involved aren't informed typically in self inserts or other deage fics where one person is an adult in mind if not in body and the other is a child\\
the other issue is the power dynamic, a professor involved with a student, underage or not is not ok, the professor holds power over the student outside of their personal relationship which makes the consent given invalid

** For the most part in cool with two adults getting together. There are a lot of fics out there that have really toxic relationships and some of them have age gaps, but in my opinion it's all in the circumstances of each story as to whether it's toxic or not---and of course sometimes we write things that would never be advisable in real life, but are perfectly fine to indulge in within the fantastical and imaginary realm of fan-fiction

eta: I just saw that it's Sirimione post war slow burn and my opinion is that if it was a real person I'd be encouraging them to stay the fuck away from the traumatised older man but in fic it's well and truly permissible and a very popular ship

That's pretty much textbook grooming. There is no possible way to write a character doing what I described and /not/ have him be a predator. Which, whatever - if you're into reading fics where the molester is the protagonist, that's not illegal. But I'm certainly within my own rights to call stories like that gross.

Edit: also, saying that because "he didn't groom him in canon, it's okay" doesn't really make any sense, given Snape died in canon and Harry hated him, plus Harry had a girlfriend. If a fic has Harry/Snape plowing each other, that's by definition AU. And if Snape was Harry's teacher, in that AU Snape is def a predator.

** A gap by itself isn't the problem. It is a function of younger vs older. The difference between a 16 yo and an 18 yo is vast. Between 20 and 22, also vast. The vastness is often severely underestimated by those around that age...

If you have a large age gap, you have to age it up if you want to present the relationship as appropriate. There's always wiggle room, but I think half plus seven is normally a good rule. I don't have a problem with writing an inappropriate relationship, but you'll be fairly accused of finding an inappropriate relationship appropriate if you write it as if it were.

I'm not of the thinking that art has to be appropriate or moral. Hell, murder is common. Just be clear with yourself where the boundaries are. If you're writing underage and you aren't aware that you're crossing a line, it will come through in the writing and you will be rightly criticized.

Just like every 'rule' for writing. You should really only be breaking rules when you're aware of them. Also don't forget, relationships matter as well. Let's say it's Hermione/Remus. His relationship as her teacher at a young age ups the ick factor significantly.

Sorry for the rant. Don't be afraid of criticism. Jump into it. There's nothing wrong with breaking a rule, being criticized for it, and learning from it.
