** I really enjoyed linkao3(Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time). The first two stories are complete. The third, about all the next generation kids as adults, is still in progress, and it's one of few unfinished stories where I actively check for updates because I want more.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** They're older, from way before Cursed Child, and I haven't read them in years, but I remember a series posted on [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/viewuser.php?uid=2651&page=2][The Petulant Poetess by dracontia]]. I don't remember if the kids are in Slytherin or not. There are two story arcs, one het and one slash; some of the stories fit in both arcs. Maybe worth a try!

** You just described the most boring story that I'd never want to read.

Sorry, not intending to diss you, everyone has their own tastes. Just... usually I see either requests of stories that I might like or that I might hate on this sub, this one just sounds so incredibly bland. But to each their own. I don't mean to offend!
