I remeber a fanfic where Harry is watching over Teddy. They are watching a game (football?) on the TV when Death Eaters come along and interrupt them. Somehow they all wind up in the Veil room, with Teddy held captive and Harry walking into the veil (with or without Teddy, I don't remember) when he promptly time/dimensional travels to somewhere and somewhen. This occurs in like the first chapter or two.

If anyone remebers what this is, I'd appreciate it if you can tell me its name.


** Did he also travel to a dimension where it was The Girl Who Lived instead of another Harry Potter ?

Sounds like 0800-Rent-A-Hero to me.

*** No, though thanks for the rec! The first chapter/prologue consists of Harry and Teddy watching a game on the TV (or something similar), and I have the feeling Harry was acting like an ethusiastic sport fan (sports memorabilia and all).

*** Unfortunately, thats not it. (Though thanks for the recommendation!) The one I am thinking of started with Harry watching Teddy, them being silly over football/soccer/whatever on the TV (for some reason I want to think Harry was teaching Teddy to be a propper sports fans, with loud cheering and hats and other sports paraphernalia...) when Death Eaters barged in, kidnapped Teddy (or both of them) before Harry falls into the veil.
