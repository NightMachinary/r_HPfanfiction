The more obvious bit of mirroring is between Dudley and Draco: A blonde bully spoiled rotten by his vain, bigoted parents shows late in the series that he's not evil down to the bone and could have been so much better had he been raised by decent people. Dudley seems to come to genuinely regret his behavior, and we see that Draco truly loves his parents and is at least too squeamish to murder somebody (YMMV on whether he actually didn't want to do it or was just squeamish).

Slightly less obvious is the mirroring between Hogwarts and Smeltings: Dudley and Harry both attend the same private boarding school as their father, where they wear a uniform that would look ridiculous on an average London street and carry sticks with which they're encouraged to hurt each other.


** There seems to be so many polar opposites and so many differences in the Harry Potter series.If you look in depth do many thing come to light,sort off fanon but not.

** Also the Malfoy and Dursley families: the Durselys are a muggle family that's anti-magic, and the Malfoys are a pureblood wizarding family that's anti-muggle. Both sets of parents also spoiled their sons.
