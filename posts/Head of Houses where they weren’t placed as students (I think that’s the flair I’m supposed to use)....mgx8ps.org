Hey everyone! I was just wondering if anyone knew of any fics where a Head of House wasn't a part of the house they are over when they were students. Like Snape being the head of Gryffindor or Hufflepuff or McGonagall being over Slytherin? I feel like I might have read something with this premise before but I'm not sure (it doesn't even have to be the main part of the story)! I would prefer completed works but would be perfectly happy with just having a discussion on the topic (how do you think it would go).

  Why would Albus ask Severus to be the Head of Hufflepuff? Why should Severus accept? How would a Severus succeed in working with this house?
