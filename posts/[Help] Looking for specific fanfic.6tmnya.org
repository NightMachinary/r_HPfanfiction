Years ago I read a fanfiction that I'd like to read again. The pairing was Harry Potter/Tom Riddle. I think Harry communicated with his horcrux and helped it get a body before the main soul. Then the main soul got a body and claimed publicly that the horcrux was his son. I think the locket horcrux also got a body but was insane and messed with Harry a lot. So 3 TMRs. Does this ring any bells?

A different one in looking for I think the author removed. Harry is neglected with Dursleys and goes to Hogwarts. An attack on Hogwarts collapsed part of the dungeons and traps the potions class there for a month I think. The fic had a title somewhat like 28 days or something like that. No pairing. Just a survival tale there.

All help is appreciated


** For the HP/LV one, I'd go over to [[/r/HPslashfic]] if no one here knows what it is. There are a number of fans of that pairing there. They tend to be fans of the horror aspect of the pairing and not so much the stories that make the dark good and light bad. So if the story is more like the former than the latter, you should have some luck.

** No idea to the second one, but the first one sounds sort of similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10781599/1/Androgynous-Lover][Androgynous Lover]]? It's a long call here. But it has a ring Horocrux Tom gaining human form claiming to be Tom Riddle's kid, and there's a scene where Ring vs Diary vs Voldemort spirit.

I'm scratching my head if there's another one similar to your specifications though. Will post if I recall more.
