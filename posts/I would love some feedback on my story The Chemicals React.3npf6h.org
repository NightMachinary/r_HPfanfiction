** I care very little for Draco!Hermione but the writing is quite decent, couldn't spot any major errors, though I'm usualy not the best at spotting them. The sentenses are short and you don't write filler sentenses on useless descriptions or needless statements, this makes the story quick and light to read, while not compromiseing any of the plot or charector development.

Exampel of what you do great: "I swear these compartments are getting smaller every year," Ron said finally sitting down in the only empty compartmet they could find. "Ron I think you just grow two inches every summer,"

Light, quick and reaffirms that the relations between the charactors haven't chanced much from canon. Seen fics spend half a chaptor telling the same though exposition. And on the topic of exposition, it's something you clearly and masterfully stear around. I'll have it bookmarked for now.
