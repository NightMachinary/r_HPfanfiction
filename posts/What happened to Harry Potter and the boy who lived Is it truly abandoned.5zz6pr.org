It's the best fanfiction out there and I want more of it.


** I have no idea. I can only make a wild ass guess and whether it is abandoned.

Assuming that you're referring to the one by The Santi, there are apparently a few more chapters available in DLP forums somewhere. However that community requires one to register and meet certain community participation requirements to unlock the specific repository which contains those extra few chapters.

Attempting to circumvent that site's rules is a violation of this sub's rules.

*** And those chapters aren't at the polish level of the currently published chapters. Which explains why they are in WbA and not published on FFN.

** Possibly, though keep in mind that it was spontaneously updated about a year ago after a year+ of no activity.

#+begin_quote
  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
