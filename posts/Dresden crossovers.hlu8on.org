I was thinking about how ridiculously outclassed Potter would be. I think it'd be very humorous for Dresden to just wander in and destroy everything. Alternatively, actually decent fics would be appreciated as well.


** Why would Harry Potter be the one outclassed?

In Dresden, transfiguration and conjuration are very difficult. Dresden magic usually involves the manipulation of non-magical forces. Dresden is limited by energy. His rings store kinetic energy, and his spells revolve around fire and kinetic energy. Dresden can run out of energy to cast magic.

Conversely, Harry can animate, transfigure, and conjure with relatively ease. Obliviate and legilimency aren't too difficult and don't have any long-term ramifications for the caster unlike in Dresden where black magic leaves a mark. We don't see Harry ever unable to cast magic from exertion, unlike Dresden. And Harry Potter magic does not rely on mundane forces for strength, leaving easy counters to Dresden's magic. Flame-freezing charms nullify fire which Dresden manipulates. A shield charm is easily capable of defending against the energy in Dresden's forzare. Why? Harry Potter magic overrules mundane nature (Rowling). If you insist on conflating energy with Harry Potter's magic, a comparison that really does not work, just look at the energy involves with conjuration. Hell, given how shields in Dresden have to be carefully designed to work with different types of energy, I'm not convinced that a stunning spell wouldn't just fly straight through Dresden's shield to knock him out.

Harry Potter magic is conceptual. Stunner spells knock people out, killing curses kill them, and the imperturbable charm protects against objects (rendering guns useless against a wizard). Fiendfyre, which can be cast by Crabbe and Goyle, would easily outclass all of the fire spells we see Dresden cast, not to mention the magical nature of the fire spell. Dresden's fire spells are limited by physics which we see Dresden comment on multiple times. This isn't the case in Harry Potter where fire can take the shape of animals and hunt people down.

Healing in Harry Potter is great. Bones can be mended with a flick of a wand, wizards can survive bludgers to the head and car crashes, colds can be cured with a potion, wounds can be healed as fast as a bone or by applying a potion. In Dresden, a burn to his hand is a crippling injury which will years to fully heal. The sole advantage of health in Dresden is seemingly superior life-spans.

The real advantage of Dresden would be thaumaturgy, especially tracking spells, which we don't see a counterpart to in Harry Potter.

*** As I understand it, Dresden's magic is based largely on belief. There are limits, but if you believe something should happen, it will probably happen. Hence why the same spell can be used with different words and the like. I think this is also shown in Ghost Story. And if Potter's wand is damaged at all, he is largely defenceless. As to the shield issue... I understand why Dresden's might be ineffective, but why would you assume Harry's would be effective? We know they can be broken. We don't know exactly what it takes, but we do know that unforgivables can bypass them, and that while Harry was learning, a jellylegs jinx was enough to break it. So I can absolutely believe that Dresden could break it.

** Wizard/Sorcerer Potter vs. Wizard/Warlock Dresden

Both systems are Apples and Oranges, but can mesh well together.

The best cross fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183715/1/Awaken-Sleeper][Awaken Sleeper by Water Mage]] I always recommend it.
