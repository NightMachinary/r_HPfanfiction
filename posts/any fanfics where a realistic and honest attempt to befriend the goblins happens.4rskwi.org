we've all seen the cliche and overdone fanfics where harry is polite to the goblins and suddenly he is their best friend or god to them or they are super helpful to him but i was wondering a different take

anyone seen where harry or someone makes an honest attempt to reach out to the goblins and help mend the relations with them? like more likely trying to befriend them or get more friendly relations with the goblins would likely take decades for meaningful change in wizard and goblin reactions to each other

anyone seen anything like this?

A fan continuation of HPMOR. Finished a while back. Wwizarding society make peace with goblins, and give them back their wands. A lot of people don't like HPMOR, and while this is quite different, I can't say if its different in the ways that would make it palatable for you. IMHO it is worth it to read for chapter 14.
