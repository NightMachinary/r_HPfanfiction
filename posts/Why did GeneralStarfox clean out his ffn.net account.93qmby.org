Earlier, in about mid-July, he deleted The Life He Leads. Today, I discovered that everything is gone. What happened?

  I was writing for an audience either too illiterate to understand thousands of words of foreshadowing or too stubborn to remove the blinders of shipping for one moment to recognise the direction of the narrative.

Honestly dude, if you feel this way about fanfic it is for the best you stopped. I appreciate your work but writing fiction should never be for anyone but yourself. When you start trying to get cater to people who might read something you take away the magic.

*** It's been an honour, sir. If I can say anything about your story, I'll just say that your story scratched an itch that I very very rarely ever get scratched in FFN. I particularly love the complexities of the magic that you have created and the incredible amount of thought and wonder and depth that were all present. I found this to be probably the first story in a few years that have really hit me and stuck with me like some of the best books I've read. Whilst I completely understand and respect your decision and reasons, I will miss your fantastic writing style and skills. Best of luck, and thank you for the story you were able to give us.

*** Thank you having written this story. I will really miss it because I loved the interesting magic and especially the realistic relationships. Because that is something that one doesn't find often in fanfiction. I wish you luck with your studies and hope that you maybe one day write again. And thanks again for the nice story.

** I'm incredibly sad that it's gone... I'd not long since read it as it got deleted! Really enjoyed the depth in the story, and glad that I got to experience it before it was deleted - even unfinished I'd have liked to re-read it sometime.

*** I have a copy of it on my phone. Not quite sure how I'll get off there as it's on an app but when I get access to a computer I'll give it a go.

** I would try fictionhunt.com, that has a backup of all HP stories even if they are removed from FF.net.

The search is very simple, so it may take a while to find it, but it should be there.
