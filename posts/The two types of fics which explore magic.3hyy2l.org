There have been a few threads recently requesting fics that "focus on magic" or "explore magical theory". It strikes me that this type of request could be asking for one of two very different types of fics which treat magic differently.

Expansionary magic: these are fics that seek to /expand/ the HP magic system by filling in gaps and exploring new spells and areas of magic. Magical theory remains within the HP magic system paradigm. Magic remains an essentially mystical force separate from the normal rules of nature.

Reductionistic magic: these are fics that seek to /explain away/ the HP magic system by describing HP magic in terms of something else, i.e. some kind of "science of magic". Magic becomes incorporated into the normal rules of nature, part of the same system.

Some examples of expansionary magic: Forging the Sword, Ectomancer, What You Leave Behind, HP and the Boy Who Lived, arguably Runemaster.

Some examples of reductionistic magic: Methods of Rationality, In the Mind of a Scientist, Prodigal Delinquent.

What are some more fics that fit into these two categories?

Which type of fic do you prefer?


** Expansionary magic has always been my favourite. It maintains the magic of the world whereas I feel the other type just reduces the wow factor and scales it right down to a bunch of boring "facts" and figures.

I love world building and character/creature/spell creation and so fics that are able to do that appeal to me much more. I like them if they build on what's already there and don't contradict per se. So for me expansionary magic, as you've dubbed it, is my favourite.

Both can be interesting if made well, I think. However, it's much harder to successfully merge the magical and natural laws because it almost instantly spawns a plethora of contradictions and paradoxes, by which point you basically need to be well-acquainted with /all/ branches of physical science for at least being able to explain away these contradictions.

I think you can define at least one additional category, just because items from this category like to disguise themselves as belonging to groups №1 or №2. These are the ones in which the author writes walls of generic rules of magic only to explain why is it perfectly natural for the protagonist to be so overpowered or for his fetishes/relation pairs to work out.

IIRC, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6685668/1/A-Switched-Chance][/A Switched Chance/]] (W: 116,174; on hiatus) was doing a good job of getting into magical theory in the latest chapters. Same with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2750705/1/In-The-Company-of-Secrets][/In The Company of Secrets/]] (W: 420,992; abandoned), but here the plot was starting to get out of hand by the latest chapters, so the abandonment wasn't that bad.

/(I've redacted some weakly relevant MoR and Mind of a Scientist criticism)/

** For Hermione-centric fics, linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) strikes me as "expansionary", while linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) is "reductionistic".

That said, I think that it's an apples-to-oranges comparison. In the fics you list as "expansionary" --- at least the ones I've read --- the study of magic is a means to an end for both the characters and the author, any additional breadth is limited to what the plot calls for, and any additional depth is limited to the (typically) more scholarly character's point of view. In that, any "expansion" is incidental, and the focus is not, in fact, on magic. In the fics you list as "reductionistic", characters exploring and understanding magic is the focus of the story. Of course, I haven't read /all/ the fics listed, so I could be wrong about this.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** I like stories that explore magical theory --- to a limit. I would say your story /Alexandra Potter/ had a bit too much focus on magical theory, and it seemed everything else was secondary. A couple of classroom lectures are fine, but it gets a bit too much after some time.

I like stories that take some particular branch of magic and explore it thoroughly. An example would be curse-breaking in this fic:

[[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/4777/][Curse Breakers: The Maya]]: /Thirty-year-old Ginny Weasley is the preeminent Curse Breaker in Central America. Her job allows her to ignore the aftermath of the Second War, but when she is given a new assignment, she finds that the Mayan tombs hold not only the keys to the ancient civilization, but the key to the ghosts that still haunt her and Harry Potter./

Curse Breaking is a major part of the story, but there is plenty of adventure and intrigue to go around otherwise as well. An excellent exploration of the ancient Mayan civilization. A good story all around.

** How would you categorize fics that fundamentally misunderstand the magic system of Harry Potter?

Take the deservedly mocked concept of Magical Cores. Which of the two streams would it fit under? You could argue for both, seeing as how it's an expansion of canon's system, but on the other hand you could say it attempts to explain away.
