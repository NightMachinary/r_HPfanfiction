** If I'm interpreting your question correctly, which I might not be, what you are asking for are usually called self inserts. They are more popular in other fandoms.

What's her Name in Hufflepuff is the best one I've read imo. To The Next is decent too.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** I literally just finished reading a fic like this a few minutes ago. Technically rereading I suppose.

Linkffn(A Curse of Truth)

It's not incredibly long, about 200k words, but in my opinion it's really well done and honestly the only self insert style fic I've actually read and enjoyed.

Also, this is the first time I've ever used the bot, so hopefully it works.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

This type of fic is way easier to find on ao3, especially since isekai only really exploded into the "mainstream" (or at least, non-anime) part of fandom in the last decade or so and ao3 specialises in niches like that.

  Being a Chosen One is hard work. The Dark Lord of your universe is out to get you, people you love definitely die, and you have to suffer a lot. In fiction, it makes for a compelling story. In real life not so much. She isn't sure how she boarded this particular train but she wants off. Self-Insert. SI-OC.
