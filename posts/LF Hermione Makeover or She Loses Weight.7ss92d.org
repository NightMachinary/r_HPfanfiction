I'm in search of completed fics where Hermione decides to lose weight or where she goes through a makeover. I am NOT looking for the Ho!mione challenges. I like my Hermione classy.

Thanks!


** Hermione wasn't described as being overweight or even chubby. I don't think I've ever seen a fic where she is. But you'll find plenty of fics where Hermione gets a makeover in Harry/Hermione and Ron bashing fics.

*** I was thinking maybe she had gained weight and then lost it. Or the author could create their own world where she was chubby and lost the weight.

** I feel like this is veering dangerously into anorexia fics or something.

*** I'm not looking for an eating disorder fic. I'm looking where she healthily loses weight. She's a smart woman. Just because someone loses weight doesn't mean they will go off into the deep end and have an eating disorder.

  Draco gave a cocky grin. "I am going to give you a makeover." "I'm sorry what?" "You heard me Granger, I'm going to give you a makeover that will make every man want you,and make Weasley die of regret. You will be simply irresistible."
