I'm looking for stories where Harry joins Voldemort. He doesn't turn dark or evil, he just realizes that Voldemort may have a point/ or where Dumbledore and every one else believes that Voldemort is evil when he's not.

I'm also looking for stories that deals with unusual het pairing (please no slash) while at the same time has the whole Voldemort thing going...Like Harry/Bellatrix.

For me the usual pairings are Daphne/Ginny/Hermione/Fleur/Tonks etc

Also looking for Lord Potter/betrothed/emancipated!Harry/manipulative!Dumbledore/WeasleyBash stories that aren't usually recommended here. (Yesyes I know every one hates those tropes, but I love them)
