I got facinated with the idea of wizards actually using their wits and skills to deal with being confined to like a single room or a house. Would like to read anything that describes in depth how they live there, what changes they make to the space, how they are dealing with it psychologically.

Please link completed stories. I love long reads (the more the better).

Any protagonist or pairing will do. But no rape or torture fics, please.

Thanks a lot in advance.


** The characters do indeed get trapped in a confined space in this fic, but their magic is wonky and I'm not sure they « make the most of it »: « A place for warriors » by owlsaway
