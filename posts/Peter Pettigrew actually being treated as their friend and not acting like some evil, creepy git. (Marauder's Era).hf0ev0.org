Peter is always either evil from the get go or isn't treated very nicely (The latter makes me at least understand why he would betray his friends.)

I don't really care if it's Wolfstar, Time Travel or something else.


** Linkffn(One Hundred and Sixty Nine)

This is probably one of the best in the whole time travel genre, let alone the Peter Pettigrew interactions. Don't get me wrong, he's still with Daddy Voldy, but he is treated with respect by Sirius and Remus despite Hermione seething in a corner. And we even get to hear of what he was like in school pranks-wise with a few nostalgia moments between him, Sirius, and Remus.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** Ohana: linkffn(12353895)

Peter does give up the Potters' location to Voldemort, but then pretty much immediately turns it around, confesses what he's done, and spends pretty much the whole fic making amends.

With Peter's warning, they manage to turn Voldemort's attack into a trap and end the war there and then.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** linkao3(Don't Waste It by Sarah1281)

This one's from a time-travelling Peter's perspective, and I think does a good job characterizing him and explaining his actions. While it's super short and doesn't contain too many interactions between him and the rest of the Marauders, I find what is there believable and fair.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** This fic is Snape/Lily, though I'd honestly consider it closer to genfic. The first couple chapters aren't super engaging, but I swear: once it picks up, this story is well worth reading. Lots of character growth (esp the Marauders), lovable OCs, and really cool plot.

Might be worth noting that at times, word choice is a little funky, since the author isn't a native English speaker. But it's relatively rare, and easy to overlook.
