What are the consequences? Does prolonging Dumbledore's life for a short while lead to any changes? Does Dumbledore even survive against three other death eaters (Malfoy is too much of a coward to count)? Without Snape's cover and without his appointment to headmaster of Hogwarts, it seems likely that a lot more people will suffer under Voldemort's regime without the blunting effects of Snape. What does Snape do with his blown cover?


** Snape dies, because part of his Unbreakable Vow was to finish the job if Draco couldn't.

*** I was so tired when I wrote this that I forgot about the unbreakable vow. I feel like an idiot. The worst part is that I even double checked the canonical accuracy by reading through a pdf of Half-Blood Prince, only the wrong scene apparently.

**** It would look rather strange, though. I mean, you'd have Dumbledore probably releasing Harry from the spell, trying to summon back his wand after it flew over the Tower's edge (or he'd try to quickly disarm Draco somehow, thus regaining the Elder Wand's loyalty), and Harry rushing to assist his Headmaster.

Then, in the midst of all that chaos, Snape just randomly drops dead.

***** Could also give the wands allegiance to Harry earlier by him disarming Malfoy. With his double agent dead Dumbledore probably would have to rush to change his plans in the little time he still has (probably be forced to be much more open with information to Harry since even he couldn't depend on anyone eles explaining after his death) and since the subtle and in-shadows way of guarantying the student's security had just died he would probably try something harsher and more brute force-like.

** Best scenario:

Dumbledore, Harry and Snape kill all the remaining death eaters at Hogwarts, and then put the entire castle on lockdown. Imprison Malfoy. No one will know apart from Dumbledore, Harry and Snape what exactly happened on the tower. Choose people to polyjuice into Dumbledore. Relocate the Order to the burrow or even Hogwarts ASAP.

** It's a fun idea! I could see that with a Snape whose cover is blown, he might end up joining (very reluctantly) the trio on their DH quest. Bit of fudging canon and that would make for a very interesting fic

** Snape instantly dies, because he broke an unbreakable curse. The remaining Death Eaters kill Dumbledore. Harry may get killed chasing after them, or not. With no Snape, a Death Eater is made headmaster under Voldemort, and seventh year is considerably MORE brutal for Harry's classmates, with some potentially ending up dead. Harry may never get the sword of Gryffindor, or the info on being a Horcrux, though Dumbledore might find some other way to pass that on. All things considered, it probably goes worse for the good guys.
