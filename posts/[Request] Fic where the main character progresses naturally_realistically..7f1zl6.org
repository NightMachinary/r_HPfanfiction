** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), does a pretty good job in building characters' power realistically. Hermione took several years of hard training to finally carry out her first mission, and she still needed to be saved by Sirius. Harry was also training hard for several years, and he got his ass clobbered in his first major engagement.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the accidental Horcrux) Well done characterization of Harry who is slowly influenced by Voldemorts horcrux that awakens in his head.

linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Ridiculously long, incomplete fic with lots of great characterizations of Harry, Voldemort and many others. Harry's progression in skill/other qualities is done slowly and realistically.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
