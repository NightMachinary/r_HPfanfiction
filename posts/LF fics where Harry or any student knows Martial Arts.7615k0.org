Any fics where Harry or any of the students know karate, kung fu, or martial arts in general. Especially if the fic is novel length. Don't really care for plot but it would be great if the fic deal with the character becoming tougher (especially if they are someone like Neville) and stands up for himself and others more.


** There is a very funny crossover called linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Source) . It's a lot of fun and Harry is a student of the greatest martial art in all existence.

** There's linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6484423]]), what cultivation technique did you use to make me love you?. It's..well, kind of a mixed bag.

It's Harry Potter, except in a xianxia world. Chinese martial cultivation fantasy, to be more clear. If you've read actual wuxia/xianxia, you might not like it so much, because the 'really awesome' techniques aren't really that great compared to those in the novels that it's pretty much based off of. Also, there are a /lot/ of elements from Coiling Dragon & TDG.

If you haven't read xianxia, then it's a fairly interesting combination of Chinese magical martial arts fantasy and the HPverse.

  In a world where magic doesn't exist, supernatural power goes by another name. Hogwarts is not a school of witchcraft and wizardry but of cultivation, and new student Harry Potter has been scouted by the venerable Grand Master Riddle for his mysterious potential in martial arts.Little does he know, the ‘power the Dark Lord knows not' takes on a different meaning.

** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/horst_pollmann/][Harry Potter and The Flying Squad]]

In the second story of this series, Harry spends a month studying under a japanese Zen master, mostly Aikido, some Kenjutsu, the Zen philosophy and a few other disciplines. After that beginning, he continues to train his martial arts skills through the series and they become an integral part of his arsenal.

Features a trip to Japan that actually contains no shitty anime features. In fact this may be the most un-anime depiction I've ever read. It reads like the author has travelled there and is superimposing his impressions and experiences over Harry's trip.

** Linkffn(Legends of Potter)

The writing in this one isn't great, but there is a lot of focus on self improvement and one of the many things Harry does is learn martial arts. It's a Super! Harry fic so be prepared for all the usual clichés. My only real complaint is that the author tends to repeat himself a lot.
