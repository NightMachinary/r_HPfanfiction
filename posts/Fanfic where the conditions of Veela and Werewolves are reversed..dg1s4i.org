Werewolf men are Hot, okay? Remus is like the Adonis of Hogwarts (and he knows it) and he only shifts when experiencing extreme emotion.

Fleur, on the other hand, is cursed with Aviathropy (or something scientific-and-official-sounding). Once a month, as daylight breaks, her body turns against her and she transforms into a bright, colorful, horrifying, carnivorous (and contagious) bird of prey. From dawn until dusk she swoops from the sky and screeches in jubilation as she snatches up morsels to sate her uncontrollable bloodlust. She scratches and clutches with deadly talons and pecks with her poisonous beak. Everyone knows to shutter their windows, lock their doors, and plug their chimneys when the local Veela flocks raid their skies.


** That's hilarious. Someone write that.

*** Since, in canon, there are only female Veela, or only female Veela who are capable of shifting between bird form and humanoid form (and my headcanon is that male Veela exist only as birds), I imagine that in this world only the male werewolves are capable of the same.

...So there would technically BE no she-were-wolves if they could ONLY exist as magical wolves.

**** But wouldn't girls with werewolf blood have a minor form of the curse? Everyone knows that male descendents of Veela have veela bonds which severely impact their lifestyles.

***** According to the HP Wiki: "Veela have been known to marry wizards ... . Children of these unions are half-Veela, and they will inherit magical ability from their wizarding parent and beauty and charm from their Veela parent." And: "It is unknown whether half-blooded Veela can ... transform into harpy-like creatures as their full-blooded relatives can." I am running with the idea that they cannot transform at all. Therefore: girls with werewolf blood in this prompt scenario would inherit only the seductive properties of werewolves; not any of their physical/transformative attributes.

Interestingly, in the Trivia section of Veela on the Wiki page: "Veela are described as fairy or nymph-like creatures in Slavic mythology ... . They often appear as beautiful women, but are known to morph into swans, snakes, horses, or WOLVES." Wolfy-Veela are apparently a thing.
