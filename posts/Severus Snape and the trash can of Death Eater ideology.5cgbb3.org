there are varying thoughts on his commitment it, so i thought it'd be interesting to make a thread discussing them. i think his joining the DE in the first place was more about the potential prestige than any principles. per jo:

  Nithya: Lily detested mulciber,averyif snape really loved her,why didnt he sacrifice their company for her sake

  *J.K. Rowling: Well, that is Snape's tragedy. Given his time over again he would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people (like Wormtail) he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive.*

  J.K. Rowling: He wanted Lily and he wanted Mulciber too. He never really understood Lily's aversion; he was so blinded by his attraction to the dark side he thought she would find him impressive if he became a real Death Eater.

the displays of anti-muggle(born) prejudice as a child were personally motivated- in opposition to his abusive muggle father and the influence of his (implied pureblood) mother, and then proximity to the proto-DEs that had a platform for the recognition he wanted. still, it's something he'll change if/when it suits him e.g. telling lily it makes no difference to comfort her

post defection i think he actively opposed it to redeem himself for his complicity in lily's death

  He stood to gain nothing personally but *the triumph of the cause Lily had believed in*. He was trying to do right.

  Snape is all grey. You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world.

cursed child tries to emphasize this in a hammy and heavy-handed way, but

  One person. All it takes is one person. I couldn't save Harry for Lily. So now I give my allegiance to the cause she believed in. And it's possible --- that along the way I started believing in it myself.
#+end_quote

what are your thoughts on how he interacted with it pre- and post- defection from the DEs?


** My own headcanon is that Snape's original defection was indeed triggered by Lily, or rather by guilt over her death. However, his continued service cannot be attributed solely to that. I like to think he simply detests how worthless the Death Eaters & Voldemort have proven themselves to be; in 30 years of fighting they've accomplished... very little. They killed some wizards, raised some mayhem and mostly sat around scratching their asses.

I like to think Snape remembers Voldemort's promises of greatness (and how he, himself was ensnared by his charm) every night (like an occlumency excercice, lol) and then proceeds to contrast them with the reality that in the end, Voldemort and the DE are just a bunch of /imbeciles/ with dark magic.

*** Except Voldemort was winning the first war, and essentially won the second. It was basically bad luck that kept him from winning both times. Hell, the second time it took less than 3 years from his rebirth to essentially win.

** If Snape really thought Lily, a muggleborn, would find it impressive if he became a real death eater, then Snape was pretty much the dumbest character in the whole series.

*** Voldemort might not be that hostile to muggleborns during first war. He even made multiples offers to Lily to join him. It appears to me that he was more on an anti-Ministry and magical supremacist agenda.

*** i don't have time to elaborate rn, but i don't think, given his circumstance, that it was that un-intuitive. snape was always interested in the dark arts, even while he was with lily. despite that, she still defended him, made excuses for him, loved him etc. he was used to and expected the loyalty she had always given him. so his logic is: lily likes me, i like the dark arts, if i pursue success on the terms that i define it, (become what i think is a superior version of myself) lily will like me even more
