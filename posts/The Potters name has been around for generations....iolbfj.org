**** Just a small mistake, it is Parceltongue but the alphabet (although it doesn't really exist).

***** No, it's Parseltongue, not Parceltongue. /Parcel/ is a small package, /parsel/ refers to "harelip" or "cleft" in Old English or something similar (there are contradicting sources) which refers to the fork in a snake's tongue. That's why the language of the snakes has "tongue" on the end of it. Because it roughly translates to "forked-tongue," referring to both a snake and the language since another word for language is "tongue." You literally have to look up Parseltongue and a million different things will pop up saying "Parseltongue." Nowhere does it spell it with a "C."

** This would be a really interesting premise for a fic where Hermione is actually a lost Potter, since she is also a HJ as Hermione Jean.

** If you're wanting old names, Harrison isn't it. Harley isn't old either. You need something to invoke the medieval if you're going back that far.

**** Nah. Where in Britain would he come from? Presumably England with the surname Potter. Presumably southern England too. We know Godric's Hollow is in the West Country. He needs a Celtic name. Huw seems to fit all the requirements.

Of course, Britain did have 8 king Henrys by 1520.
