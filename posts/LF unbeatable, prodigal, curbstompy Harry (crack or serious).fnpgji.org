** On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads comes to mind. linkao3(17926664)

Incomplete, but still updating and well into the endgame: you likely won't have to wait long.

  Harry finds out that his dad is alive, has been the whole time. Instead of being overjoyed, Harry's disgusted. His dad left earth and abandoned his friends. Every painful thing he's ever gone through can be traced back to one man. Now Harry's got super strength he can't control and an almost unnecessary amount of magical power. His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.

** A good crossover one is A Third Path to the Future linkffn( 9443327). Basically he goes to the marvel comics multiverse and becomes OP. From Ruin by GreaFoxx is a time travel one where he goes to an AU to try and change it linkffn(13025350). He is OP and basically humiliates everyone who goes after him. Harry Potter: Return of the Death Walker is a good time travel one linkffn(13338624)

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

** It's not finished yet but my favourite in this category is /Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches/ in which Harry is sent to Azkaban and his only source of entertainment is using his connection to Voldemort to learn magic and the Death Eaters' tactics. And when Harry is sent back in time to fulfil his destiny of defeating Voldemort... well, you can imagine what a force of nature he is. linkao3(5058703)

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
