** Not exactly sure why you'd think this warrants its own post. The story's had like six updates in the past three months.

As a question about the story itself - does Harry actually grow as a character? I've read the first ten/fifteen chapters and got bored with it due to the fact that Harry was still the same as at the start of the story. Felt like little to no character development, does he actually become somewhat 'less' of a sociopath?

** Umm.. can we only post that a story has updated if the story hasnt had updates for a long time? Worthy is a fairly actively posted story, even if the last update was 1 or 2 months ago.

The fanfiction story alerts is, generally speaking, sufficient.

But as for the new chapter, i am mostly curious what was meant when Dumbledore's "soul evolved". Was that just flowery language, or is plot?
