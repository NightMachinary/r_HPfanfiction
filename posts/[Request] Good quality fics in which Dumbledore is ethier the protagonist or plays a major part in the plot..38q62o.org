** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9824342/1/Dumbledore-s-Next-Great-Adventure][Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure]]. It seems to fit most of your requirements, but I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not it's good.

Here's the summary:

#+begin_quote
  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon).

Hermione/Dumbledore pairing. He's not the protagonist but does play a big part in the plot.

**** If you had checked the link, the A/N at the top of the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Yes, you read that right. Hermione/Albus. I know Albus is not exactly on the het side of the Kinsey scale, but who says exactly where the poor guy falls? I am after all borrowing JKR's entire word, so I can have fun with a character's orientation if I feel like it. (Have to say, I'm normally a slash writer. This is the first time I've ever taken a character in this direction...)
