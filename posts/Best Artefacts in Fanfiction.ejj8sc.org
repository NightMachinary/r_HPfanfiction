So, canon has a few hella cool artefacts - the ones from the Founders being the most obvious ancient doodads of celebrity importance with magical enchantments that've lasted until now. What about fanon? I'd like to see any fanfic with a cool ancient magical whatchamacallit involved. Can be part of the main plot, a throwaway mention in a vault, the kind of MMO loot you immediately sell because you have better, etc etc.

No real limits. I'll read pretty much anything. Slash with or without Magic Nazis, WBWL, Lord Potter-Black-etc-etc-endless-bloody-etc, Nice Goblins, Bad Goblins, Slytherin Harry, one-shot, million-word ramble, whatever. I'll even take the esoteric kink shit, if it's not just a porn fic. Well, I suppose that's a limit, then - anything with an actual plot. I just want cool old magical doohickeys.


** I don't know the specific ones, but there's a few where the Sword of Gryffindor imbibes other things apart from Basilisk Venom.

There's one with Fiendfyre, where a character accidentally deflects the curse with the sword and it basically catches it and makes the blade ever-burning with cursed fire.

There's a crossover with Mass Effect (I think) where Harry kills a Thresher Maul with it and the sword imbibes the ridiculously strong acid.

I think I remember one where the MC uses either a Lightsaber crystal or a finished one on the sword and it basically becomes a lightsaber itself.

It might have been a crack-oneshot but there's one where they stick the sword into all kinds of ridiculous things, like a neutron star, which immediately cooks the earth when it's unsheathed there because of the heat; Or a black hole, which immediately destroys the earth because the sword now has its gravity; or a pile of Antimatter, which makes the sword explode anything it touches, including air.

I also think I remember one where they basically cast all sorts of dark curses at the sword for days, until the blade becomes so cursed that it brutally murders everyone who even thinks about it or something.

There was a LotR crossover as well where it can de-manifest a Ringwraith, but also absorbs a tiny bit of the corrupting influence of the ring it wears, slowly making it into an Artifact of Sauron.

Most of these were back in the olden days, and I don't know their names or if they can be found on the popular websites today. Maybe on Spacebattles? I know that some of these were written when it was first revealed that the sword could do that, and I don't know if any of these have survived that long.

If not, well, maybe your summaries will inspire their addition to fics people write in the future. I'd certainly like to see Rorschach's Blot take a stab at that crack-oneshot.

** So far I've enjoyed the portrayal of Morrigan's staff in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13098062/1/The-Red-Witch-and-the-Nightmare-Queen][The Red Witch and the Nightmare Queen]]". It seems to be semi-sentient and has a strong affinity for mind magic. The fic eventually delves into the extremely creepy backstory of who Morrigan was and how she got the staff. I like that the story shows how truth might be twisted in fairytales and things aren't always what they seem.

linkffn(13098062)

Another example of a malevolent sentient artifact: I love the idea of the /Matrix Aeternitatis/ in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717563/1/The-Lord-in-the-Mist][The Lord in the Mist]]". In that alternate universe one of the last un-destroyed copies of the tome was originally owned by Grindelwald. It is said to contain knowledge of powerful sacrificial rituals that Grindelwald used during the war, but it has a well-earned reputation of driving its readers to madness or catalyzing their transition to becoming the most feared Dark Wizards in the world. No one knows exactly what the tome is, or what it contains, because even the most obsessive collectors of dark artifacts prefer to steer clear of it. I particularly love the disturbing scene in which the main character finally tracks it down.

linkffn(12717563)

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12957404/1/Subversion][Subversion]]" also has some neat worldbuilding and artifacts vaguely inspired by European folklore. In the past of that alternate universe, the forebears of wizardkind used forgotten ritual magic to seal malevolent or tricksome spirits inside of fanes. It is illegal (and exceedingly dangerous) to disturb a fane, but criminals occasionally brave the risks in order to steal the voidrope used in each fane's sealing. Voidrope is extremely valuable because when worn as a noose around a person's neck it can completely block any mind magic performed on them or by them.

** In a fic that I have been writing for a while, the main character finds a sword in an old tree. The sword has the ability to warp the mind of the person holding it, causing them paranoia or anger. It can also possess anyone that has touched it, regardless of distance. Finally, it was able to communicate with the wielder, talking to them in their mind.

The sword also reeks of death, something wizards do not seem to pick up on, and constantly leeches the lifeforce of anyone nearby.

Of course, the kicker is that the sword is found by an eight-year-old that uses it to practice sword fighting on a hay dummy and speaks to it like a child would any object. The child also seems to dilute the sword and causes all of its powers, bar a few, to be useless on wizardkind.

The sword was created/enchanted by a vampire who wanted to create a weapon that was able to function as a wand. However, something went wrong and he trapped himself in the sword.

*** Heh. That sounds almost publishable. I can totally picture a slightly insidious children's book where the young only see a kid befriending a grumpy sword and rereading when you're older reveals the more predatory aspects of the sword's behaviour. Very 'don't talk to strangers' metaphor.

Have you read a published novel called The Misenchanted Sword by Lawrence Watt-Evans? There's no sentience on that blade, but there's a good degree of... inconvenience to the magic on it that I think you might enjoy.

Yeah, it's not the most well-known of series'. Shame, really. It's pretty darn good, aside from the Silmarillion-esque word usage and overuse of invented words that aren't explained very well.

** Well, I have just the fic! Namely [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10200][Cursed Artefacts for Sale]] by Icarus, linkao3(10200) or linkffn(1753258). It's part of a series, but can be read as a standalone. It's Snape/Harry, but in this installment the Snarry is super mild and barely there at all. I could easily call it gen even. Anyway, in this series Snape is a rich pureblood and dark arts afficionado, who enjoys buying cursed artefacts and then trying to lift the curses off of them. In this fic, he and Harry go to a cursed artefacts auction, because Snape wants to add to his collection. They obviously see a lot of cool artefacts along the way. It's very imaginative and lovely and I think you'll enjoy it!
