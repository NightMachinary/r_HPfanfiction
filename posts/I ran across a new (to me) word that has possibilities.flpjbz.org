While watching an old episode of Antiques Roadshow, I came across the word 'Grangerize.' It means to customize a book by adding pertinent or related material (usually) to expand upon it, for example, by adding drawings and photographs, letters from people written about or referred to in the book, and so on.

It is named for an English clergyman named James Granger, whose 1769 "Biographical History of England from Egbert the Great to the Revolution" was apparently often added to in such manner.

Even with a reputation for respecting physical books, I could easily see Hermione doing this. I can also see her being horrified that anyone could consider doing such a thing, but at the same time treasuring an old Grangerized book she ran across. Having a Grangerized book be a plot element in a story ("Half a mo - my copy of Flamel's biography doesn't have the recipe for a Philosopher's Stone!") could also be fun.

I just thought the word was amusingly appropriate.

*** Oh, that was the reason why she behaved as such jerk! And I have found him [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Granger][on Wikipedia]], where it says about him: “Granger was an early advocate of animal rights.” S.P.E.W. as his inheritance?

Oh, this is too good story to pass:

#+begin_quote
  In 1772, Granger preached a sermon against cruelty to animals. However, during the eighteenth century the subject of humane treatment to animals was deemed beneath the Church and was considered abuse of the pulpit. The sermon caused an “almost universal disgust to two considerable congregations”, as mention of dogs and horses was regarded as a “prostitution of the dignity of the pulpit”. Granger went to prison for preaching twice against cruelty to animals.

  The sermon was published as An Apology for the Brute Creation (1772). In his day, the sermon was unpopular and only one hundred copies had been sold by January, 1773. However, it was positively reviewed in the Monthly Review and the Critical Review as a sensible discourse. The sermon influenced Arthur Broome, one of the founders of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

**** The reason she was against using the book was because she was written as a very "trusts in authority above all else" kind of character. So using instructions for a subject like potions (which is extremely dangerous, as seen in Neville, who constantly exploded or was horrifically injured by his mistakes) which were written by some random guy, /whose name you don't even know/, doesn't seem like the best idea to her.

Even considering that they worked better than the ministry ones, the book contained Sectumsempra, a dark arts spell with pretty horrific effects, none of which were explained. It just said "Sectumsempra - for enemies". Who might a 16 year old consider enemies? A bully perhaps? Why was the spell basically a murder weapon, then?

All in all, I can see why she didn't trust the book.

Of course, a big part of it was also that she wanted to do it "the right way" and considerered using the book cheating, which is less understandable. Still, using untested and undocumented and unofficial methods to brew potions seems like a bad idea overall. That's like if you were an electrician working on one of those HV power lines and found a book by "The electric man" which said that a dried mixture of birch resin and honey which you dip your hand in works better than rubber gloves.

Regulus's middle name is Arcturus, which is the brightest star in the Herdsman constellation (and one of the five brightest stars that can be seen from Earth).

Lucius only means "light" in Latin, but "Malfoy" means "evildoer."

Narcissa is a reference to Narcissus, the most vain character in mythology... except for Andromeda, who defied the gods and nearly lost her daughter. From a pureblood perspective, it sounds a lot like going against your blood and having a Half-Blood, doesn't it?

** I have plot bunnies a running round my head now. I fully believe that Hermione would be the type to have a "fresh" version of books and a version with little notes scribbled all over it, mistakes highlighted, changes written in, questions in margins. I think her animosity to the potions book would be partly because of the fact that it allowed Harry a shortcut (and let's be real, the amount of hard work Hermione does to be the best? I'd be pretty pissed if my friend who kinda slacked at stuff I worked hard for used a cheat sheet to fly to the top of the class) and the fact that she doesn't know where these notes come from. It's one thing to make your own notes when you understand the methodology and rationale, but to just accept a stranger's vague notes as gospel is stupid. "for enemies," anyone? Wtf is it supposed to mean? Either way tho this makes me really want to write something.

*** I totally agree that Hermione would be one to have two copies of books like that - she's too practical to be the sentimental type about writing in books, but she'd still probably want a pristine, nice copy for actual hobby-reading too. Oh, and the technical term for what you're talking about in your second sentence there is 'marginalia'. It's common in older classic writers and philosophers from the renaissance and earlier (my field of psychology grew out of a lot of essays written during the search for the Soul and quite a lot of those essays grew themselves out of marginalia). Even Bill Gates does it - I think his writings and notes on books he reads are still up on the internet somewhere.

I'm with you on the second part as well, btw. It always irritated me that he'd take some random instructions with no conclusive source and try them out in a field that could cause explosions. Like getting an un-signed "Nuclear Power Plants for Dummies" book from a second-hand store and actually using it in a real plant. Can definitely empathise with Hermione in that part, though not to the degree of anger I remember her showing.

***** Could be. I... don't really have much more of an opinion either way. I can see her doing either. I could argue that she holds too much value for the actual act of reading to let a book stay idle like that, or that she holds too much value for the record of knowledge to overly stain it, and probably find evidence for both sides. Room for both options, depending on what worked best for the story.

Heh. I don't know, I don't think that's overly well-known outside of the mathematics community. Might be an English thing, but in my experience if you're not into Maths, you're really not into maths.

****** Thanks. :)

It really is. Whenever we conquered or got conquered, we just took everything that wasn't nailed down - food, culture, traditions, artefacts, money, peoples, and language. That old line about English being the language that follows other languages into dark alleys then beats them before rooting through their pockets for loose grammar is deliciously accurate. There aren't many other languages where three words can make the same sound (along with additional other sounds on top of that) and one letter can make a half-dozen sounds all depending on the context of use.

** This is so interesting, I never knew this!!

I can't say for sure whether Hermione would find doing that horrifying in the 1990s (I'll leave that up to others to decide), but even if she does, the way books were produced in the 1700s would have been different enough to what Hermione is used to to easily account for James' and Hermione's potential differences in how they accept marginalia and adding on.

For example, in James Granger's time, +the printing press had not been adopted yet+ [edit: it had been, I was off by three centuries! So you should just ignore the entire rest of this comment], +so all books would have been hand-written and hand-illustrated anyway by gifted scribes and illuminators (aka illustrators), and often these people were clergymen (so I'm not surprised James was). There was also no copyright, ISBN numbers, publishers, or mass production. I think in a world where books are made by hand one by one, it wouldn't seem /quite/ so strange, abnormal, or horrible to add on to them, even if there were only one copy. It looks like this was James Granger's own book, too, so it makes it even more believable to me that he could produce it and then continue to add to it throughout the years. Obviously it was unusual enough that James Granger is specifically remembered for this, but I just mean to say it is probably less unusual for him to do it in the 18th century than it would be for Hermione to do it in the 20th.+

This kind of reminds me of another fictional book, actually, the book of plants and herbs that Katniss makes in Hunger Games. It's never "finished", just constantly added to throughout the years. It's a book, undeniably, but it's not mass produced. Or even /A Hobbit's Tale/, where it had multiple authors who continued to add to it, although I don't remember that in detail, so I better leave that comparison up to a better LOTR fan.

This is really really interesting, thanks for sharing! I definitely want to read more about James Granger now. After Harry Potter, the history of language and writing is my second favorite thing.

*** Actually, the printing press was introduced into England in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Caxton][1476 by William Caxton]]. That's one of the major reasons why English grammar, pronunciation, and orthography are so idiosyncratic - the language was still in flux with various local dialects that got "firmed up" by the access to printing before the language had settled down. So Granger's book would have been printed, not hand-copied.
