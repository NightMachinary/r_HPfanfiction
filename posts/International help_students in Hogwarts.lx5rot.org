I'm curious. Are there any stories with international help in the fight against Voldemort? Or even just international students in Hogwarts during the Trio's time?


** The R Series has some international students in hogwarts. Then some other international interactions post hogwarts. linkffn(1795399)

** While its a fairly dystopian trilogy, in the second and third books of my Firebird Trilogy America and France cooperate against Voldemort. The international aspects of the wizard of world become very important by the third and final book.

**** Linkffn(Firebird's Son). If that doesn't work, google Darth Marrs fanfiction and I'll be on of the top hits.
