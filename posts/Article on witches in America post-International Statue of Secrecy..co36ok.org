There is prevailing notion in the magical world, that the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was both necessary and effective way of protecting from then prevailing witch-hunt. There is now [[https://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2019/08/americas-last-witches/][an article by a Muggle historian]] claiming that its efficiency has been actually rather questionable. Capital punishment against witches largely disappeared during the early 1700s, but it seems that vigilante hunting and lynching of witches happily continued during whole 19th century. Quite interesting.


** To be frank, a lot of this depends on whether you think the majority of the witch hunts were targeting actual wizards and witches, both pre and post-SoS. Frankly I doubt it. If you want to get real old school, the Code of Hammurabi outlines precepts dealing with witches 4500 years ago, so clearly punishment for so-called magic has been a long running theme of history. However, history shows most witch-hunts tend to target outsider groups from the majority - people who don't fit the common mold. Whether this was the Jewish and Moor converts in Spain or the random epileptic in feudal England, people went after what was different and called it witchcraft.

From what we know about HP-world, the Statute of Secrecy was partly a way of avoiding clear scrutiny from the non-magical. It isn't that witches and wizards are afraid of being caught, but to avoid a conflict of a more powerful group of aligned individuals and a more common majority (Magical vs. Muggle). They could win, but why would they want to fight anyway? What could they gain? Better to avoid the conflicts inherent in human nature than to wait for the inevitable violence and subjugation.

TL;DR: Witch-hunts were a catalyst, but SoS was in discussion decades before that actually occurred. Like many political events in the muggle world too.

** I'd say that while witch hunts aren't a major issue any more, other issues make the Statute of Secrecy crucial for the continued survival of both the magical and the nonmagical worlds.

Due to wizards spending 7+ years learning magic and the seperation between the two worlds, there's very few people who both know about the existence of magic and have a solid understanding of muggle weapons, and that's good the way it is because the last thing the world needs is some guy casting duplication spells on enriched uranium supplying terrorists with nukes.
