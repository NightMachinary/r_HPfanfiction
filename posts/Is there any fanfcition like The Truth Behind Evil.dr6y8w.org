In it, Voldemort has one person who he calls his brother who he thinks has died. But turns out that Harry turns into the person and time travels(accidentally) into the past just to be that person. Harry, now Alex then dies(But he's immortal so not really) and ends up in the future but before the time he wanted to be in and spends the rest of the time until his past self(Harry) goes back in time in France. Then he returns in the sequel Friend Of Lord Voldemort.

If there's any fanfiction like that please let me know. Or at least let me know about fanfiction where Harry travels in time to when Voldemort(Tom) is at Hogwarts.
