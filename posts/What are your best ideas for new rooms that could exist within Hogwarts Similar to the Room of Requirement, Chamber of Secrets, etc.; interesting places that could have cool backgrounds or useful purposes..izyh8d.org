**** Possibly:

-teaching how to swim

-learning water magic (walk over water, part it, ...)

-home to Hogwarts goldfish pets

-some Divination technique like crystalball gazing

-special Apparition training grounds (apperate into/out of water is especially hard because of reasons (density, ...)

** There's a fan theory that the Room of Requirement is Hufflepuff's secret chamber, and that each of the founders made one.

The expected for Ravenclaw would be a dusty room filled with ancient tomes, accessible only through the darkest corner of the Restricted Section of the Library. But let's go beyond the expected. Perhaps in this room there is more than just old bookshelves. In the center of the room is a bowl that looks very much like a Pensieve. But if one were to look within, they would not find memories of the past, but instead a window to the present. No matter where in the castle it is, Ravenclaw's Oculus can see it, for the user to gather knowledge. Though like the stairs to the girls' dormitories, it is enchanted to prevent boys from looking where they shouldn't. In olden days, the staff of Hogwarts would use it to find wayward students who had failed to attend class, but the room has largely been forgotten. Occasionally some curious students will find it, and learn how to use the Oculus. One such group even unraveled some of the magic used to create the Oculus and worked it into their map to make it show every room and occupant of Hogwarts.

Moving on, what would Gryffindor have made? Again the answer seems obvious, an armory full of weapons, or a dueling space. But we're here to imagine the unimagined. Deep in the Forbidden Forest, there's a cavern where even the centaurs and Acromantula dare not tread. It is a dark place, filled with a fog that shows frightful visions that make boggarts seem tame. A strange choice for the man who valued bravery above all. But there is a method to this madness. Hogwarts is where one learns courage. Gryffindor's Cave is where it is tested. Those who make it past the fog will find in the cave a deep pool of clear water, and those who dare to drink from it will find themselves forever freed of their subconscious self-doubts, capable of great and terrible magics.

Now it is known that none of the four Founders was the first Headmaster of Hogwarts. Rather, they chose a wizard named Gedric Alwyndir. Alas, his name and deeds are lost to time. Alwyndir's portrait in the Headmaster's office has not spoken in centuries, and even Hogwarts, a History does not mention him beyond that he was the first Headmaster, as it was written five hundred years after his passing. Even so, he too left a lasting legacy in the top of Hogwarts' twenty-fifth tower. Now, those of you who know a thing or two about Hogwarts' architecture might realize that the castle only has 24 towers, but that's the beauty of Alwyndir's magic. The twenty fifth tower will move around Hogwarts, disappear when you're not looking, and make a surprise appearance when you take the wrong staircase. The tower itself contains an old wandmaker's workshop, as that was Alwyndir's profession before he became headmaster, and even afterwards he would make the wands for the students who needed them, much like his descendant, Garrick Ollivander.

There are other secret quirks of Hogwarts, such as the alchemy lab on the second floor that only appears when that elective is being offered, or the enormous wine cask in the kitchens that pours out whatever drink is requested if it. But those are for another time.

*** Ravenclaw's Oculus is an outstanding idea, thanks for that inspiration. I didn't know about Mr. Alwyndir at all, and I think the idea of a twenty-fifth tower is very interesting, as well as the fact that he's neglected to speak for several centuries. I can see it now, because the chapter titles have nice rings to them: "The Twenty-Fifth Tower" "The Highest Workshop" "The Silent Portrait"

If you want an interesting background you could invent a character who went to Hogwarts in the past and bring them up a few times. Then later in the story have a hidden study room that they created/used.

** I had an idea that if you got lost in the Room of Requirement and asked for the door, it would appear free-standing in between the piles of junk. Then you could go back out to the hallway from the nearest side, but if you went in from the other side, you would get into Rowena Ravenclaw's secret office full of ancient, magically preserved scrolls.

Another thing I saw in a fanfic once was a room with the castle Wardstone, engraved with all kinds of runes that anchor the protections on the castle, most of which have been deliberately tampered with and weakened over the centuries, which explains why so many shady characters are able to get in.

** The Mimic Room. Either the room has an equal and opposite reaction to any reaction applied to it (can't banish that earworm from your mind? Enter the room and sing the song and the room'll kill it), or it continually replicates whatever is applied to it (you sing the earworm into the room and it'll sing the song back until another reaction is applied).

**** That's basically the idea, yeah. Every action done in or to the room, the room provides the opposite reaction in equal measure. You throw paint at the walls, it throws paint at you (and inverts the colours). You sing, it shuts you up.

Sometimes it doesn't work quite as straightforwardly as it otherwise might - kind of hard to find an equal and opposite reaction to some things - but so long as an action is taken in or done to the room, it will do its best to provide that equal and opposite reaction. It wouldn't reverse the stunning of someone stunned if the actual stunning occurred in the Great Hall, for example.

But it does cancel ALL of the action, not just the verb. That's why the earworm thing would work - you're singing the song that's stuck in your head, so it shuts up the song that's stuck in your head.
