********* I feel like Voldemort was slightly underrated in many ways and is overrated in others personally. I feel like Voldemort tortures his servants in different ways. Lucius had his son given what could be a death sentence. There is a point that fear pushes people to fight what they are afraid of I think. If he constantly tortured his followers for little reason he would have more risk of disloyalty and less likely to get as many willing followers. He's supposed to be smart so I feel like even if he is a sadist he would torture his enemies not his minions. At the same time though some FanFiction has him fighting hundreds of people alone and winning with no scratches. I've always viewed him as a terrorist. It's not a war like the grindelwald war but it's hit and run tactics. The reason he's so feared is because talking bad about or against him could likely end in your whole family being tortured and killed.

** Ron is a great friend, who very realistically had a brief falling out with Harry that was related to his also very realistic insecurities regarding his family. This only lasted a couple of weeks before they made up and Ron went out of his way to make up for his actions.

And let's not forget that their second falling out was due to the fact that Ron had a literal object of pure evil drawing on his negative thoughts, that every single person has, and bringing them to the forefront. Almost immediately after he was separated from it he wanted to return but couldn't due to the protective charms they set up. When he did manage to return he saved Harry's life, had to face these negative thoughts brought to life, and managed to defeat it.

Also related but the films really butchered him by giving a lot of his moments to Hermione, who they also kind of butchered by making her too perfect.

*** People eviscerate him in book 7 for "abandoning" Harry and Hermoine. He did nothing of the sort. Realistically, Ron forgot about the protective charms in his anger (which was amplified by the locket) and stepped outside to get some air before returning once he'd calmed down.

Then, when the protective charms didn't let him back in, he left for Shell Cottage because he knew his presence outside the charms would endanger Harry and Hermoine because he'd draw attention to the area- so he left with plans to reconvene with them as soon as possible, which he did. None of that makes him a bad friend- at worst, he doesn't think before he acts, which is already a well established flaw of his. There was never any malice or intention to abandon them.

It would be like saying that the prime minister of UK is personally responsible for every neglected child in the country.

**** I'd say Dumbledore did a pretty good job of protecting Harry from wizards who'd want to harm him for being the Boy-Who-Lived. His blood ward held up and no death eater had managed to attack Harry at his muggle house until he turned seventeen. Everybody who gripes about Dumbledore (at least as far as I've seen) tend to focus on him being either deliberately evil or a bumbling fool for leaving Harry with relatives who don't treat him like their own son.

Being the “Prophesied one” necessitates the special measures that Dumbledore put around Harry's house to make sure he doesn't die. However, it doesn't make Harry more at risk of mistreatment by his aunt/uncle than any other kid, so from a quality of childhood perspective the prophecy doesn't justify special attention by Dumbledore. (Unless it's in the special attention in the sense of “let's engineer this kid's life and make sure he grows into a virtuous, responsible pillar of society”, which would actually be manipulative)

Dumbledore telling Figg to watch over Harry might've just been something along the lines of “Here, would you mind living next to Harry and let me know if wizards show up? Don't worry, the blood wards will stop them - or at least it'll hold them up until I get here.”

** 1. Harry is way too passive and carefree in canon, and if the story would have aimed for realism, Voldemort would mopped the floor with him. Heck, he probably would have died all the way in Philosopher's Stone, at the hand of Quirell.

2. Dumbledore's reasons for abandoning him with the Dursleys are contrived and inexcusable.

3. Molly Weasley is annoying as hell.

4. Lord Potter trope gets way too much shit in the fandom community. Is fun to read.

5. The worldbuilding in HP canon is poor (when its even there).

6. The Ministry shouldn't be blamed for not believing that Voldemort is back. There was not enough proof for it, the main points being the mere words of a teenager and someone that can be classified as a closet dictator, Dumbledore.

The problem is not them not believing that Voldemort is back, its them being oblivious and hasty even though there was enough evidence for at least an investigation. You have a dead student, a supposed dead death eater disguised as a teacher and flippin Dumbledore saying that Voldemort is back. Thats enough to, at the very least, get a team to look into it.

** OK, I'm going to go after the title character:

- Harry himself is an uninteresting lead protagonist, and even people who refuse to read any fic that isn't Harry-centric recognise this. As evidence, observe that the most popular Harry-centric fics (whether in the Harmonian subfandom, the DLP subfandom, the HPMOR subfandom, or the WBWL subfandom) choose to completely rewrite his personality, talents, interests, and even values.
- Harry is not a "natural leader", and when people follow him, it's either because of his reputation for unrelated feats or on (the late) Dumbledore's orders. Otherwise, he is not particularly good at motivating and persuading people, planning, or making high-level decisions. He only shines in low-level tactical situations, and even there, it's because in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king: when everyone else is panicking or frozen in fear, the only one who isn't gets to be the leader.

Well, it depends a bit on your definition of Mary Sue. If you define her by a set of common character traits (special abilities, pretty, often clumsy, ...) then she might arguably qualify.

However, the thing that defines a Mary Sue more than anything is that a Mary Sue warps the plot around her, and makes everything centered on her - even when it shouldn't be: multiple characters will fall in love with her, she'll have the obvious solution to all problems, is generally well-liked (even begrudgingly by the baddies), ...

And Tonks does't do that, mostly because she's kept out of the story most of the time.

Why do you think so? Snape is portrayed very differently in movies compared to books, and it's later installments where it really shows.

This one is complicated. Why did the KKK form if black people were still systematically oppressed? The answer is, of course, that they wanted to oppress them /more/.

Why? Because they had issues and /felt/ threatened (and/or disgusted) by them. These feelings aren't rational.

I mean, why was the average German angry at Jews in 1933? It's not because of anything the Jews really /did/, it was more that Germans were angry and unhappy because of the previous war and the financial crisis and needed someone to be angry at.

There are more reasons to this, of course, and it's way more nuanced than I'm qualified to talk about.

Ron canonically calls him out on it, and is upset because they were supposed to be best mates who always got into shenanigans together, and he believed Harry turned his back on that- and it wasn't unjustified suspicion.

Then, Ron wakes up in the middle of the night and sees Harry's empty bed. Even though they're fighting, he still cares enough to go down to the common room to make sure Harry's all right, and maybe even apologize. He accidentally interrupts a fire call with Sirius, and instead of recognizing that Ron still cares about him Harry flings a "Potter Stinks" badge at his head and storms off.

Harry isn't innocent in all of this. Harry's own comments made him look suspicious, and he was the one who resorted to physical violence where Ron never canonically does. It was hardly a "betrayal" on Ron's part- just because Harry is the protagonist doesn't mean his friends should blindly trust everything he says when evidence suggests the contrary- real friendships don't work that way, after all.

This bleeds over into how they perceive stories, and the main character is of course always right, while secondary characters don't get the same leeway.

It's always disappointing when you are reading a story and are see other characters bashed simply because they don't bow to Harry's whims, especially if Harry is actually acting like a dick.
