Preferably fics that are easy and fun to read. Bonus points if harry is in another house other than Gryffindor. Thanks!


** Try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] fic as well :) Just search "Drarry" and there are tons of threads of people asking for general recs as well as more specific ones. Besides Harry being in another house, do you have anything you like?

I definitely recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/390301][astolat]]'s fics, particularly linkao3(Timeshare by astolat; Reparatio by astolat; House Proud by astolat; Slithering by astolat; Unseen by astolat). Some other good ones: linkao3(All Our Secrets Laid Bare; Running on Air; Tea and No Sympathy; The Bucket List by GallaPlacidia; A Hag, a Hex, a Tale of Redemption).

  “It's not for long,” Hermione said. “By the time we get back to Hogwarts, the Unfettering Brew will be ready.”“Listen to you!” Ron said. “He's got to get through a month with the Dursleys and a month at Malfoy Manor. With Draco Malfoy.”“Yeah, thanks,” Harry said, because he hadn't just spent the last week contemplating just how much more horrible his summer holidays were about to be than they'd ever been before.

  Draco snorted. “I'm not reduced to penury. I want something considerably beyond money, and I rather think you're the only one can give it to me.” “You want the Invisibility Cloak,” Harry said, flatly. He'd half expected as much; it was the only thing he had that Draco could want---“Don't be stupid, Potter,” Draco said. “I want my reputation back.”
