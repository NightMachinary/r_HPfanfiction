So magical kung fu is a thing in fanfiction, right? So why not magical wuxia?

For those wondering, wuxia is a type of novel usually published in China and Hong Kong involving kung fu. The genre usually involves themes of patriotism, brotherhood, loyalty, and justice.

I, for one, would love to see Harry going around Britain beating up Death Eaters with magical martial arts.

I'd write it myself, but it's my senior year and I have to study over the summer. Oh well.


** There were attempts that I have read briefly when I got started on the HP Fanfictions, but most of these fics were less than 10k words and have most likely been deleted by now.

You should check linkffn(harry potter and the sun source by clell65619)

Its the closest you will find, I think.

Real Wuxia wont work with the HP world. You would need to write 100% AU and make up a new world that is similar, which is alot of work, I imagine.

*** True, that. A modern Western world with ancient Chinese values would be pretty damn hard to explain away.

**** You could just turn Harry into a British Imperialist who wants to keep Hong Kong as part of the Empire. That way, you'd get him in the location and have him be patriotic/loyal whatever without making him Chinese.

*** Wouldn't Voldemort come closest to a Wuxia protagonist? Working hard to grow more powerful, seeking immortality and power, wanting to avenge any slights he suffered, facing entire countries...

Harry "I want to be just Harry" Potter doesn't seem like a Wuxia protagonist.

**** Er... Have you ever even read wuxia? Maybe we read different ones, but the protags I know are just ordinary people who suffer a series of unfortunate events. The Deer and the Cauldron is basically a story about the protag training to get pussy, and he even ends up with a harem.

Actually, maybe Louis Cha had some issues. Never mind.

**** Maybe a young Tom Riddle would fit as a HP-Wuxia MC, but Voldemort in his late years was lunatic and obsessed with killing a single schoolboy.

Canon Harry is overrated.

He grew up muggle and is allowed to enter a world full of Magic. And what's he doing? Lazing around, skipping out on Lessons, Homework and playing Cardgames with Ronald Weasley, not all that reliable "friend".

*** i think wuxia novels get farfetched enough without introducing ghosts and goblins and such.\\
tried reading them and couldn't get past the intro for most whereas wuxia are usually tolerable until the MC turns into a self teaching easily improving undefeatable prodigy\\
any xianxia books you can recommend where the MC stays at normal strength and is still struggling by the end?

**** I'm pretty new to the genre, I've just found wuxia boring due to the lack of the worldbuilding aspect which is often strong in xianxias even when they are full-on power wank. But I can recommend two titles. The first is Cultivation Chat Group - more comedic series set in modern times. The protagonist levels fast, but not unreasonably so and it's only on a second stage so far. The other is Pursuing Immortality, another modern times title. This one sometimes reads more like "Socioeconomic and political effects of the increase of spiritual energy in modern China" than a novel, but I'm a worlbuilding maniac so I don't really mind.

Both have a problem of pretty slow pacing, but that seems to plague Chinese webnovels in general.

  Martial Arts. Two words that mean so many things, but above all it is the drive to better ones self, physically and spiritually, it is an ever distant journey to perfection. What would happen when a small green eyed child with a destiny far greater than even he knew enters this seen yet unseen world? Adventure, magic, love? And it's all due his cousin's past as a spoiled brat.
