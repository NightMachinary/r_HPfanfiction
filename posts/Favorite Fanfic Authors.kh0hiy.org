I was not sure if a question like this had been posted before and if it has sorry for being redundant. Instead of asking for story recommendations, list some of your favorite authors for harry potter (obviously) and for other fandoms as well. Some of mine are: Linkffn marksmom Linkffn Lovefremione on ao3 too Linkffn Ithil-valan Linkffn Calla Mae Rose Mae on ao3 Linkffn WyrdSmith Linkffn DebsThsSlytherinSnapeFan on ao3 too Linkffn lastcrazyhorn Linkffn swamygliders Linkffn KiyaNamiel Great Lotr fics the silent flower series is awesome! Linkffn arwenraven Pale Hope Rises is a hp/lotr crossover Linkffn darknightstalker Linkffn Kendra James Linkffn Aileen Dickinson Linkffn Emma Lipardi There are others, but I didn't want to add too many at once and I asked for ya'lls favorite authors not mine. Excuse me if I linked the authors wrong, even though I have been a member for a few months I am still trying to figuring out how to correctly link stuff.

** PsudoLeigha and inwardtransience on ao3. They often write together. Their Plan series is my favorite wip right now. Plus they are ludicrously prolific. Like millions of words.

** Mayor hagger on ao3 isnpretty good especially if you like more adult work. James Spookie on ffn is just good all around

*** Hard disagree on both. James Spookie has written the same plot a dozen times (admittedly not as bad as Robst) and MH just flicking through it is becoming another Megamatt in doing nothing but increasingly bizarre and OOC "sex" that once you get down to brass tacks is every woman as a faceswappable meatsuit with no personality.

**** Incest maybe but if you're uncomfortable with that that's your preference. As far as the other thing all of his works that I've read have all the participants over the age of consent.

Some of my favourite authors (They're all Ao3)::

Flamethrower :::: writes very intricate and detailed plots with so much foreshadowing and subplots and politics and eugh. It's juicy. Everything they've written is fantastic.

Marie Kavanagh::: Focus's on the Black family and really has them down to a T. How they understand the family dynamic, how she portrays so much in such small gestures and comments. Mostly Young Sirius so you really get to see how and why he grows into who he is.

MissKingBean69::: Focus's in young Marauders. She has such a great grasp on their personalities, really letting each character be individuals and with their own motivations. And she can write an OC like no one else. It's incredible.
