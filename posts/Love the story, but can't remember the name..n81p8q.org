:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hiya. I forgot the name of a particular fanfiction that I considered a great casual wtf read. Could someone please tell me the name of it based off of my description of it please?

It starts with Harry buggering his work with ingredients that sent his future self's mind back into the body of his five year old self. From there he visits Gringotts where through series of events Severus becomes his brother and their adopted mother is Professor McGonagall. More series of events Hermione is thrown in the mix and she becomes their sister. Ultimately they have Dumbledore locked up for being a danger to the wizarding world and muggle world, and Harry enjoys a happy life with his husband Sirius.

*** Thank you! It's insane, bizarre, sweet, dark, hilarious, and just too damn well written for a bibliophile like me to allow to fade from memory.

**** I know!! The plot is insane and it feels so good and self indulgent to read this. Sometimes you just need a good bash fic with obvious good/bad guys, yknow? No stress of moral ambiguity.

***** Not too complicated. Plenty of snippets to flesh out the original alternate timeline. Great work with nobility as a part of the wizarding world, and giving depth to the goblins as people and a culture. Dobby doesn't die. My favourite part is where Harry and Sirius are romping across the grounds in their animagus forms carefree and enjoying themselves; a captured moment perfectly written.

If it isn't a guilty pleasure to read, then I still haven't learnt the meaning of that term lol.

******** this fic is part of a series ‚ÄúHarry in time- variants on a theme‚Äù A bunch of unrelated time travel Harry Potter fic, but they all have the same vibe as the one you read. The only other one I've finished has both Harry and Sirius time travel to the same period where Harry is 5, fake their deaths and linage so they're the children of lupin's squip sister (who tried to love potion james in front of Remus and was never seen again), and get themselves adopted by him after she's killed by her boss/boyfriend.
