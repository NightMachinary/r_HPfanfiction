I personally feel like the Slytherins are subsided to be evil, like all of them are shown to be dark emo kids up the attic.+ Overly dramatic{though this time its the bad kind-of dramatic}

Cunning, Ambitious and Proud. Those are the traits of a Slytherin. I don't think 'EVIL' is a Hogwarts house trait.

BTW, i dont mind negative comments.


** My understanding was that it's less that Slytherin selects for 'Evil' and more that the house has been a breeding pit for racists for the last fifty-ish years.

Imagine if whoever is leading ISIS these days joined a country club in the Hamptons and somehow turned a majority of its members into sympathisers and outright allies of ISIS. Those beliefs then propagate through the group (we naturally realign ourselves to mimic our chosen social groups) and become part of the institutional culture and then new people joining that group are taught those beliefs. It's called 'Canteen Culture' and was a really big thing back in the days when people were first trying to work out why the Metropolitan Police was so rife with racism, homophobia, and general dickbag behaviour. It was so called because they found a strong influence there was when the officers got together in the canteen and talked about their experiences and beliefs and thus displayed a morality for newer officers to move towards.

Whether Slytherin House is like that or not is debateable (not by me - I don't know enough about canon to have a personal opinion here and am just repeating what I've read on this sub) but that kind of dynamic is a studied and evidenced thing that happens.

*** This is especially true that they spend most of their life from 11-18 living in their Hogwarts house and are incredibly impressionable. Also houses are chosen by your attributes at eleven when the only people they have ever spent time around previously would have been their parents and (children of) their parents' friends so again even at home would be surrounded by the same sort of people.

** Good Slytherin - Andromeda Tonks (went against her family's bigoted beliefs)

Neutral Slytherin - Horace Slughorn (guy just wants to be important and live in comfort)

I wish Rowling expanded on these characters more to give Slytherins more depth than just the "Evil house" but she instead tried (and failed imo) to make Malfoy and Snape sympathetic and force fed a shitty redemption arc for both of them down our throats. So not only do we not get good Slytherins, we have a bunch of crazy Snape and Malfoy fans that blame these characters being shitty bigoted people all on external circumstances.

*** At heart, Rowling was lazy.

She's said many times that all Slytherins were not evil, but all we SEE are Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy, plus one or two from the Quidditch Team. All on Team Evil.

She really should've had one or two year mates who interacted with Hermione in Runes now and then, or helped Harry in minor ways on the sly, to show it. I could think of a few places it could work.

But nope.

**** Eh. Rather than keeping views of what is "evil" and simply introduce characters that aren't, I'd have much preferred if she kept the characters, and introduced a different notion of what is "evil" (from their POVs, naturally). A mindset where discrimination is fine, selfishness isn't bad, and Voldemort isn't evil. /That/ would have been interesting. But it's obviously harder to write.

Maybe the series could have done with different POVs ... aside from Harry's & co, the best we get is two narrated chapters about Narcissa, where we are more observer than anything. I feel there was more potential there, to get into her (or someone else's) head more. Nowadays, people go overboard with POV changes, but HP could have actually done with just a little more diverse POVs.

I can see trying to point out that there are some things to support in Wizarding society that some new folks don't like, but not ... Voldemort/Death Eaters. I'd also not make Draco and Co the voice of that as again, they are wayyy too up Voldemort's arse.

But yes, I get what you mean. It's challenging to endure as a reader, but then, that's just why the impact is so great. Reading only from Harry's POV, everyone would be Harry IRL, certainly, easily, brain-skips-right-past, no-further-thoughts. But reading Malfoy's mindset, would some of us be them? If we were raised that way? It's a small, uncomfortable hook that doesn't let you go, and I like that in books.

**** Lazy?

Rowling wrote one of the most influential series of literature of all time. Hours and hours and hours--years of her life--devoted to this, and she was tremendously successful.

She influenced two generations of school children, encouraging millions of students to read for leisure. And pulled it off better than any other author of her generation, tenfold.

I dare anyone to do better.

***** Lazy.

You're making a common mistake. Simply because it is popular doesn't mean it's well written. Note that I'm not saying lack of popularity means something is well written either.

Rowling's work is popular because it 'struck gold' at a particular time in history. And I don't see how I said she wasn't successful or had an impact.

However, to try to say that the books have no flaws, that characterization in the books is not lacking, that characters in the books do not act in whatever way Rowling needed to for the plot to happen? And that is lazy writing.

***** Ehh ... Slytherins shouldn't make up more than one quarter of the population, if it was just about that. You wonder where all the courageous Gryffindors were ...

Alternatively, you'd have to posit everyone just didn't care because it didn't matter to /them/. 20% Muggleborns and 40% half and pureblood each leaves the vast majority in theory unaffected. This has been my hypothesis, but it is contradicted by the Battle of Hogwarts, where "everyone" is said to come to fight Voldemort. Then again, maybe this is the difference between fighting /Voldemort/ and fighting /the Ministry/?

Because yeah, I dunno that he won the first time round. He did, the second time, because he kept in place the existing power structure, instead of trying to overthrow it. And there had been conservative Ministers before, names you would expect; e.g. Flint or Rowle (who was only forced out by a censure from the ICW) -- so maybe we can conclude that Britain /does/ tilt conservative, and while they don't stand for someone declaring themselves Evil Overlord, if you take care not cross obvious lines (pointless terror, getting censured by the ICW), and keep in place the bureaucracy people rely on, they (or: /enough/ of them) are willing to let things be.

*** But that was at least consequent. They stayed true to their principles, and this time, not even just the "show" part of what Slytherins are, but the "tell" one, too -- there just is zero self-preservation in joining a rag-tag resistance group that only isn't crushed because no one can find them. Indeed, it would be very /courageous/ to join -- and that's the same as saying, Slytherins would be good, if only they were Gryffindors.

The most Slytherin thing anyone ever did was Pansy's grand entrance -- selling out Harry to save her own skin.

So, I get that this may not be particularly appealing, but if House values have any meaning at all, I wouldn't say it was surprising or unexpected.

** I think that JK's thought was to create a house of bad people so we can clearly differentiate them from the good guys. If you want to use it in a fic, you can always play it off as the damage that Voldemort had done to even three generations after him. The boys in Harry's year, other than Blaise (who also didn't think too fondly of Muggleborns from the one scene in which he appears), were all associated with Death Eaters and Pansy tried to get people to give Harry to Voldemort.

I can get behind the fan trope that they were all acting like Machiavellian members of a Royal court but, overall, they were divided and were quickly losing power to a more progressive society, so they needed to rally behind someone like Voldemort who was powerful, charismatic and ambitious. However I really don't understand how they could accept to be Voldemort's slaves if they were so proud and cunning, especially some people like Malfoy or the Blacks who had more gold than ten generations from them could spend and were in positions of power already. Maybe some of the lower families.

*** This curious thing about power and desiring it, I think.

Part of it is having an excellent nose for where the most power lies. And if your mind works that way, then basking in the power of someone else is only slightly below having such power yourself -- especially if you are also clear-eyed enough to see you can't beat that person. The next best thing to being the biggest bully on the block is being the biggest bully on the block's right hand.

Another part of it may be looking at /who/ joined. Regulus did. Bella, and Lucius -- those were youths, right out of school. Young and determined to change the world. Abraxas Malfoy didn't join, or Cygnus Black. They stayed well away from that. And later in life, as we know, Lucius came to regret this arrangement very much, and Regulus even gave his life, trying to escape.

So I think there is that hesitance you're looking for. A less charismatic Voldemort likely wouldn't even have gotten as far as he did.

** To be honest I don't know that that is true of Slytherins in general. I think it's rather one of those squeaky wheel things. Rowling names a bunch of characters but only a limited few have any real characteristics at all. Out of the whole house we know of about six students who we would be able to say were evil (I guess the rest didn't particularly matter to the story) and most of not all of them were the kids or death eaters. We don't know (because it wasn't particularly important to the story) if there were any on Voldemort's side from the other houses just like we don't know if there were any from Slytherin who weren't.

** Slytherin in a nutshell:

1. Take children who are already predisposed to value or at least tolerate dishonesty and ruthlessness (euphemistically called "cunning") and self-aggrandisement (i.e., "ambition") over other things.
2. Teach them that these traits are virtues and that everyone else is against them.
3. Also teach them to admire a founder who was considered to be xenophobic /in his own time, a thousand years ago/.
4. Appoint heads of house who alternate between corrupt wheelers-and-dealers (Slughorn) and former Death Eaters who never outgrew their childhood rivalries (Snape).
5. Let them stew in this environment for 7 years.

What would you expect to get out this kind of environment?

** Is this about what you would like, or wondering what is, in the books?

For what /is/, there is a disparity between show and tell. We are told what Slytherins are -- resourceful, ambitious, cunning, winning at all costs etc. But what we are shown is something else -- no one we see is particularly cunning, but basically everyone we see is either an asshole, a blood-racist, or both.

But tbh, for me, that's fine. I don't mind having a house full of self-interested assholes. That's /interesting/. What's more of a pity is that the poster-child of Slytherin, Draco, isn't particularly cunning. Throwing around his name is fine. But it's also quite one-dimensional. There should have been more plays like the midnight duel in PS. That was reasonably clever for an 11 year old.

The actual /issue/ is the moral values assigned to all of this. Loyalty == good, self-interest == evil. We are mostly shown Harry's POV, granted, so it's sort of expected, but it'd sure have been nice if Rowling had expanded on the different view that Slytherins must have, in the few instances where we had different POVs, because clearly, if you had such values as the above, you wouldn't consider /yourself/ as evil.

But I guess this'd kinda run counter to the theme of the series, so eh. What we got FF for, then.

*** Yeah, I think the defining trait of Slytherins in the canon is actually Power. Some value the power they already have, others value being close to power. For eleven year olds power can just be being a bully, or being a popular mean girl. You could value power in a nice way, like Slughorn, but it still aligns you with enforcers of power structures. I don't think it is Good to value Power in itself.

Knowledge above all else is mostly neutral.

Loyalty/Justice above all else is probably the goodest you can get.

Bravery above all else is good because good is usually aligned with the underdog (there aren't many cases where people try to do something bad even when it is difficult, though there are definitely cases).

**** I mean, that's one way; it's coherent, and arguably also what most people would say. But precisely for that reason, the opposite is interesting.

So what kind of mindset regards bravery and loyalty as wrong, as negative things? This is what I'd have liked Slytherin to explore. So that the difference between the Houses isn't "Good" vs. "Evil", but entirely different definitions of what "Good" /in itself means/.

In Slytherin, what is good is power (as you say, and also along the lines of Voldemort's motto), self-interest, doing anything to win, and what is bad selflessness, fairness, loyalty. And for Gryffindor it's exactly the reverse. Building up the Houses along those lines would have had a dramatic impact when reading, I think.

Sometimes I think that's what Rowling intended, but then she got derailed halfway through. It just fits with so many things we see in Canon, not least that it'd decisively explain the antipathy between Gryffindor and Slytherin. They are opposites; within their moral framework, the other side is "evil" (or, for a less sensational term, morally wrong), and there truly is no way to bridge that, because either side is operating with entirely different premises.

It's a literal speechlessness, like two different languages; an impossibility in understanding, because the mindsets are utterly alien.

But in the end, Canon never quite got there, and what we were left with was the usual Good vs. Evil.

***** I don't get why you think that tis is difficult to write or whatever. Slytherins don't think they're evil - they think discrimianting against muggleborns is good. They think just thinking of yourslf and maybe your family first and foremost is good. They consider the brave and selfless idiots, maybe useful idiots, for not thinking of themselves first.

And that's a stance that's really common in our world, as politics prove time and again. So, why would've JKR had to write a special viewpoint when you already know that viewpoint?
