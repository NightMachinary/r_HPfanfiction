:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was Hermione centric, and in the first chapter Lucius killes her parents, so she becomes reeaaally angry and tries to avenge them. It was on ff.net, and I remember a scene where Lucius tells Snape that she scares him. Anyway she trains a lot and (maybe?) starts living or with Snape or at Hogwarts. Pls help me.
