I am looking for something very specific which might not exist. But if it does, I imagine I can find it here.

In the original Harry Potter series the tone of the books changes around book 4. Possibly even book 3. People start dying and things become ever more grim and depressing.

I'm looking for a re-write of the last 4 or so books of the series written in the same tone as Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets. That is: no one dying, unambiguous victories by the heroes, no difficult issues, etc.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?


** There are plenty of "powerful!harry-gets-training-from-dumbledore/secret-organization-and-at-least-1-or-2-girlfriends" fic out there.

You need to look for the older fic's, the ones that were written before book 4 came out. OBHWF (one big happy weasley family) fic, Harry and company go back in time and meet the founders, Harry lives with Sirius after 3rd year, etc.

Hard to pin down, but all easy to find. You just have to be willing to look through a lot of crap if you are trying to find anything on FFN, I'd suggest checking out a few different stories on fanficauthors.net, most have descriptions that are easy to interpret, and you can tell by the publish dates when they were started. Look for fic that were first published pre-2000

Also helpful might be [[http://lira-snape.livejournal.com/5672.html][Lira Snapes lists of lists]], an old but very good list of different genres and subgenres.
