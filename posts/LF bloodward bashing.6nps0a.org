Anyone ever write a fic where a character stops up and wonders how the bloodwards are supposed to work if tracking his friends owls are supposed to be dangerous?

So unless its to keep him in the dark, then just following an owl can break the wards?

-and wouldnt that just make a deatheater send him mail and following the owl, the easiest way to track him down?

..and if they are so OP why does he need an orderguard? Or even allowed to leave for the weasleys?

And are we supposed to believe the bloodwards not only protects 4 privet drive but also from harm on his body? (Quirrel) then shouldnt other deatheaters also burn to death when he touches them?

And if they only works against voldy, who is supposed to be dead, then any deatheater can just walk into the house and kill him?


** - No magical owl ever reached Harry before he got his Hogwarts-Letter, and even then he never got fanmail. Maybe the protection works.

- Maybe because they want Harry to be able to leave the house, like he does when he is attacked by the Dementors?

- The fact that Harry was never attacked while he was there shows that they were not completely useless. Indeed, Voldemort decides /against/ attacking there. Maybe Voldemort had an idea of how dangerous the protections were? After the Dementor-attack Mrs. Figg's top priority is to get Harry back in Number Four, and not having him summon the Knight Bus for example.

- Since no death eater killed Harry there seems to be a protection against that too.

You assume an awful lot of things without thinking them through properly or even basing them on textual evidence.

I know this is a request and we shouldn't just critique it, so in linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI by Larry Huss) a flaw in the bloodwards is a plot-point.

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

*** not to mention what used to power the blood ward, to make ward that big its either siphon harry magic which can be dangerous especially for young children, or use his mother blood which mean dumbledore desecreted her grave.

** The blood wards are not the same thing as Lily's Protection. If you're going to bash something at least research it first. Lily's protection is eternal, but only protects against Voldemort. The Blood Wards get fueled by Lily's Protection, but are otherwise entirely separate from it. They protect all the occupants of Privet Drive from anyone who means them harm, not just Voldemort, but expire when Harry no longer calls the place home, or becomes an adult.

*** actually a common bashing point in some of the stories i read accusing dumbledore of tying the protection to the blood wards which mean instead of harry being protected he instead protect the dursleys

**** Without the blood wards, literally anyone who isn't Voldemort who felt like being the one to get a nice shiny "I killed the Chosen One" sticker on their t-shirt could have tracked him down and offed him.

just because dumbledore said its the safest place doesnt make it so, after all he was wrong time and time again in many of his decisions.

***** Tracking people at that time wasn't as easy as now with everything digitalized... And we are talking about pureblood who think of non magicals as monkeys barely smart to bath themselves.

Really the only danger would be them paying muggle-raised half's or squibs to find him, and it would be a challenge. And honestly, just changing his name would protect him from that.

** A few things. I don't believe that word wards was ever used in the books. I think Dumbledore said "protective enchantments". And the nature of these enchantments was never really revealed to us in any detail.

Did they prevent death eaters from finding him? In a similar manner to a fidelius without the weakness of a secret keeper?

Did they stop wizards in general from dwelling on Harry Potter the actual living person so instead they refocussed on "The Boy who Lived" the icon? This could for instance explain the lack of fan mail.

If neither of those did they actually physically prevent any Witch or Wizard from approaching Harry if they intended him harm? Or was it just death eaters?

Did they extend over all of Privet Drive? As far as his primary school?

Did they require magical "anchoring", or a magical "source" in order to stay active? The fact that Harry had to stay at Privet Drive for at least part of his summer every year suggests a possible yes to this one.

"Blood" doesn't refer to the literal red fluid flowing through our veins, but to the nature of the relationship between Lily and Petunia, they were blood sisters, ie not sisters by marriage or by adoption. So I am reasonably certain there was no actual draining Lily's corpse and sprinkling the resulting liquid around Privet Drive. Though I could be wrong.

This would also negate a common criticism, in that Voldemort used Harry's literal blood to resurrect himself, but he is still not a blood relation of either Lily or Harry himself. So while Harry's blood (red fluid that keeps us alive), flowed through Voldemort's veins. Voldemort was in no way Lily's (or Harry's) blood (related biologically).

Harry survived to attend Hogwarts, therefore the wards must have been effective at preventing death eater's from finding him and attacking... is a fantastic example of specious reasoning. I would have liked it made explicit in the text of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that death eaters made attempts and were thwarted by the protections that Dumbledore placed on the house at Privet Drive. As it stands, we don't know that any of that happened.

My own take is that the death eaters were too busy trying to maintain their facade of innocence and allaying the suspicions of the general public to make any such attempts.

I also don't believe that Harry considered Privet Drive his home, and given what we were told in canon the protection could not have truly been effective. Again I could be wrong.

Anyway, the way the "blood wards" work (or don't) doesn't have to be the same in a fanfic as it does in canon. In fact given the lack of detail in canon they can't. Unless the author chooses to keep them as much of a mystery as Rowling did.
