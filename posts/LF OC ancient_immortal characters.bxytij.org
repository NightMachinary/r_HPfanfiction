Preferably someone successfully and discretely using horcruxes, but a philosophers stone user, ancient vampire, coherent lich or whatever else is out there is fine too.


** The antagonist of my fic is what you would consider a lich. Updating tomorrow evening, likely. Edit: She's not actually a 'lich', per se, just cursed, a blood malediction. I try not to stray too far from canon with the magic.

  Bloody revenge is a tale old as humanity, an ever-spinning grindstone bound for another turn. Morrigan awaited hers for a thousand sleepless, deathless years, but she waits no longer. Pyrrha Clay is her mortal enemy, her liberator, and she flies from the reckoning with nothing left but what she carries; in her heart burns the same ruinous fire which fuels the cycle.

** Linkffn(Significant Digits) has three ancient beings trying to stop Harry's plan of universal healthcare. It's a sequel to HPMoR and even more crazy. Including suborbital kinetic bombardment, flying castles, actually decent security, space exploration, politics and sparkling unicorn Hermione.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

**** Well, HPMoR is already pretty crazy, and ends with Harry getting his hands on the Philosopher's Stone. In this sequel he uses it to run a hospital, and it keeps on getting attacked by dark wizards and ancient beings that want the Stone for themselves, so he tries to put the hospital into space. Hermione had an unpleasant experience with Azkaban and goes around destroying prisons and killing Dementors. She got her superpowers in HPMoR.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
