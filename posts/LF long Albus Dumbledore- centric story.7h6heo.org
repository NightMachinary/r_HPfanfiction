Hi! I was hoping you guys could recommend some good stories that focus on canon!Albus and his efforts to save the world during the two wars. I'd imagine it would be a hell of a challenge trying to coordinate a panicked population and manipulate a corrupt ministry into some semblance of competence... all while trying to sort out his feelings for Gellert and protect his students at the same time.

I'd be especially happy if there are stories that describe Albus's political/military/PR maneuverings, and don't completely focus on Albus/Gellert or child!Tom or how Albus screwed up.

Please no Dumblebash fics, thanks!


** It's kind of sad that there are no recommendations for this. You rarely get to see Dumbledore be ruthless without it turning into bashing.

** Might not fit your description but I remember liking this once upon a time (before JKR came up with more post-canon "facts")

Nothing would make him happier

Upon her retirement McGonagall gives Harry some of Dumbledore's journals, and a much greater understanding of the Headmaster and her relationship with him. In return Harry gives her some advice

*** This is an interesting story, thanks!

It's a bit disconcerting to see McGonagall talk about sex haha, but it's a nice take on Albus

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305274][Their Finest Hour]] by Cassius Alcinder is very much what you're looking for. Has Albus involved in political and military manoeuvring and confronting his fears. 60k words. Trouble is, it isn't very good. But do try it out for yourself.

There's no other story I know that has all of what you're looking for. But here's some that have some of them.

/As Human as to Breathe/ is an Albus-centric AU where Ariana Dumbledore lived and Albus and Gellert joined up. Has political wrangling and Albus wrangling with his conscience. 15k words. linkao3(76683)

/L'optimisme/ is a long regularly updating WIP (100k+ words) that is Gellert centric but does have a lot of political manoeuvring and his relationship with Albus. linkao3(2428940).

/The Last Straw/ is a short fic that takes place towards the beginning of the Grindelwald war. linkffn(9079271)

  A chance encounter leads Dumbledore to finally make the decision to confront his demons. Or more specifically the one demon who started it all - Gellert Grindelwald. No slash!

  Harry proudly accepted the title of 'Dumbledore's man through and through' but how little does he, do we realize that Dumbledore was 'Harry's man through and through? Their years together, now through Albus's eyes, see the bond that these two share.
