And by this I mean most of the house not just Harry and some snakes or just Harry's snake friend with the rest of slytherin shunning him. It can be whatever year, time travel or whatever. I just want the two houses unnaturally close and if possible a lot of pairings between the two houses. No slash. Closest thing I found and the fic that made me realize what an amazing plot idea this is is linkffn(1755901) Rebellion.

  Harry starts up a Rebellion after Dumbledore is forced to flee Hogwarts and his two targets are Dolores Umbridge and Severus Snape. He has a foolproof plan: to drive them insane by acting insane himself. Complete and sequel, Rising, is up!
