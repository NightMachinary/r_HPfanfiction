I like these oldest Weasleys best, they're adventurous and cool. Any great completed fics in this vein? Not slash, if possible.


** linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle) and a bunch of other cursebreaking fics that are largely incomplete. Charlie helping is something I've never seen.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley. And ends up joining Bill on a Cursbreaking expedition to Cambodia. He gets far more than he asking for! Disturbing news, promises, trouble and danger keep following Harry's every step.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

**** Oof.

Just binge-read Muggle-Raised Champion and it /barely/ qualifies. At best, Charlie gave Harry a nudge and Harry did the rest. It also can't seem to shake off Manipulative!Dumbledore, the characters suffer a tad from speaking the same personality and it ditches an exploration into values and culture shock plot point I personally would have loved to see expanded.

I would say there are better fics to read and binge, but if you're starved for literally anything then I guess its worth a shot. I did it, after all.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10765600/1/The-Past-and-Future-War][The Past and Future War]] by AlexDnD is the closest I can recall. Basically, Bill travels back in time from a bad future to help Harry. Sorry that it is incomplete, it is actually really hard to find the fics you're looking for.

** Whispers in the Night is a good one. Bill is a sort of big brother/father figure for Harry after his second year, students start at Hogwarts 2 years older than in canon. Harem fic, with F/F relationships, not sure if you just wanted to avoid slash with Bill or Charlie, or in general.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
