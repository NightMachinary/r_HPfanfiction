** Hello all, author here. One of my friends said he didn't like fan-fiction, so this is my attempt to write a fan fiction that I think he'll like. Let me know if you have any questions!

********* Please do not do that. I do not like that at all. People did that to me in school and some people have done that when I go to restaurants and the store! It is so rude and upsetting, and I hate it. Just because I am not as smart as most people doesn't mean I can be called retarded or braindead or dumb or stupid.

****** I think the misspellings are plot revilement. It had a slow start, but I really like it now having just come across it.
