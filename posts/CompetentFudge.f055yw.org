I'm currently almost halfway through Harry Crow, which I'm pretty sure I read a few years back but I'm enjoying it again. One of my favorite parts of this story is that Fudge sees the writing on the wall early on and decides that his two most trusted advisers (Lucius and Albus) can't be trusted. With no better alternative, he decides to start thinking for himself, and it turns out he's kinda good at his job. I'd love to have more stories like that to read once I finish this one.

** Lone Traveler: The Greatest Minister fits your request. Basically dimension traveller Harry becomes Fudge's first advisor, it is part of a series about the Lone Traveler but it should stand alone

  The Lone Traveler arrives on the even of Fudge's election. Instead of pelting Dumbledore for advice, the new Minister listens to a new viewpoint. Much is changed.

** I can't remember the title but I remembered reading a fic where in Harry's meeting with all his dead relatives because he died somehow, he also meets Fudges badass grandfather who gives him a message fir Cornelius. Basically it gives him the kick up the arse to get that stick out his arse and be more like his grandfather who he strived to be as a kid and is why he ran for minister.

** While its short and incomplete linkffn(The Minister's Son) depicts a mostly canon-like scenario where Fudge decides to raise Harry after some things happen for fairly believable political machinations.

*** It has adults being competent and helpful, giving Harry the kind of support and training that he should have had from the beginning. In spite of how much better things go, they still face challenges and threats (a big problem in a lot of fics that have things go better than in canon is that the good guys have it too easy). The victory at the end of the story feels /earned/, far more so than the /deus ex machina/ Rowling used in canon. While RobSt's plotting can (especially in his earlier fics) be a bit clumsy, there were several times in Harry Crow where I reached the end of a chapter with my heart pounding, and developing that level of tension with nothing but written prose is /not/ easy.
