Hi there! I'm working on a fic where Draco may or may not have murdered some people, but my only experience with any legal system is Law and Order SVU and being an alternate juror once like 8 years ago.

I try really hard not to grossly Americanize my fics, but I'm admittedly really clueless about how any other justice system works. Seeing as how the wizarding world doesn't stick to muggle laws and processes to the letter, I know I have some wiggle room, but I don't want to embarrass myself, yanno?

Bonus points if you're up for beta reading as well. Please and thank you.


** I'd encourage you to Americanise it.

English criminal procedure underwent significant modernisation in the 2000s and is now highly codified in a very unromantic way. Taking inspiration from modern procedure would not fit well within the HP world, I think.

American procedure on the other hand reflects the older, unreformed English system with a lot more arcane vocabulary and mystical entities like the Grand Jury. So you'll probably achieve a more fitting justice system for wizarding Britain by using the US system (just steer clear of anything constitutional...).

*** I've seen fics use the amendments. It's very silly.

** Studied English law as my undergraduate not too long ago. I've moved into a slightly different field now (so not sure of how much help I can be), but I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have.

** I'm happy to help to the point that your bog standard person would know - I work in the legal industry but IANAL. I don't have time to beta but willing to answer some generalised questions.

If [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] has any time on his hands he will know more than me.

** As I recall, [[/u/ConsiderableHat]] is knowledgeable about the legal system in the UK and has often answered questions on the subject in relation to Harry Potter. Perhaps they might weigh in on this thread if they have time/are interested.

*** Happy to answer questions, not really got any room in the schedule for closer involvement or beta reading though. However: while my time in criminal defence practise was actually during the period the books were taking place it was a. brief and b. in the capacity of being the most excruciatingly junior legal personnel it was possible to be at the time. I certainly never had any involvement in a murder case (which are, from the police end, handled very differently from how other crime is handled to the point of clear up rates being above 90% in the worst force areas).

And I have a /very/ cynical view of criminal justice in the wizarding world, being as even on the high side it's not big enough to have a functioning legal profession such as I was a member of, and their approach to law enforcement and criminal proceedings is, in canon, not even up to the standards the muggle world had reached two hundred years before.

**** Of course, if you read the Secret Barrister you may well conclude that the Muggle justice system is also not up to the standards of 200 years before...

***** The system hasn't changed much. It's the current shower trying to cut funding to the more important half of it - the defence side -that's causing the problem. Or so I take him to be saying.
