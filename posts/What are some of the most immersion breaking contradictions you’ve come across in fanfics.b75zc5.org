I've just been reading a fix that was talking about arithmancy and how muggleborns usually were better at it than purebloods (because that year 6 maths is so advanced), but because of pureblood bigotry masters would never accept them, and would rarely accept halfbloods either.

Which I suppose would be okay but the author then said purebloods hated working so it was only halfbloods, and that struck me as odd, because I'd have really thought half bloods would be more open to muggleborn apprentices, especially seeing how “Britain barely had any spellcrafters left” and it's been that way for 300 years.

But hey, what do I know, anyways what are your immersion breaking moments from fanfiction?


** A Dark!Harry fic, where he's raised in a universe where Voldemort doesn't die on Halloween 1981, somehow becoming friends with Ron (family of known blood traitors) and Hermione (muggleborn).

Harry throws around the word "Mudblood" in casual conversation. Ron and Hermione disapprove, but are still friends with him. Hermione tries to scold Harry for his language, but then he scolds her back for attempting to apply her muggle sensibilities on him, and that it's part of his culture's traditions, a culture that is currently being watered down by whiners like her who take offense at everything.

Why...? How?? It feels like the HPfanfic version of being friends with Eric Cartman, except in these stories, it's never intended to be comedic or satirical.

** A well written “Harry raised by someone else” series mindlessly rehashes canon plot stations. I mean why?

A nice time travel suddenly begins manufacturing angst and drama. Reviewers were pissed, and the author gave up.

A decent postwar crossover with Sherlock Holmes suddenly has James Moriarty taking over everything from 10 Downing St to the Ministry and to the Azkaban, without any warning and foreshadowing. Then J.K. Rowling also showed up and I'm like WTF?!

A rare “Wizards in Space” fic degenerates into an abandoned Star Wars crossover.

So true! I came across this (almost completed) canon re-write where James and Lily survive and raise Harry. It was all so promising until the author relied on coincidences and ass-pulls to keep to the stations of canon. FFS being an orphan is a huge part of Harry's canon storyline and character. Changing that by necessity should exploded canon.

** The one thing that always gets me up in arms are those story where Harry goes to Gringotts and realizes he's the heir to half a dozen lordships of prominent families that have been thought to have died out (or have been without a recognized member in a long time, such as the founders). It was funny the first time or two, if not exactly believable, but that got old fast.

In that vein, I also dislike authors who go with the whole shebang of cliches, such as helpful!goblins, extended shopping montages or Harry buying rare and unique magical items in some random Diagon Alley shop.

But coming back to your own issue with magical research and spellcrafting in particular. This is a pretty complex topic, which doesn't make a lot of sense in many of the stories I've read about. To really make sense about it, one has to explore the possibilities and make some wild-ass guesses.

Let me explain: spells, the way they exist in the HP universe anyway, are nothing more than intellectual property. Yet there doesn't seem to be any political, legal or commercial entity which deals with that type of thing. Unlike other magical researchers - potioneers for example, who can either keep their knowledge secret and sell the consumables lucratively or contract that service out with use of secrecy contracts - the only known way wizards and witches learn spells is from books (or with the help of books while they're in school).

The problem of this model is that it doesn't allow for a sustainable business model, at least not from book sales alone. The wizarding world is too small for numbers to make up the other challenges, such as the fact that it all revolves around families and legacy, so it stands to reason that families would buy books, hoard them in private libraries and make them available to at least the entire immediate and in some cases extended family. With the amount of (implied) interrelation of the population, in wizarding Britain at the very least, this would reduce the number of possible book sales by a vast amount and it doesn't take into account that a spell you learn from a book, you can also teach without needing the original source.

Maybe spellcrafters are working for the Ministry of Magic or are funded by them while they do independent work, but I don't recall there being any shred of evidence for that. The only way the ministry seems to interfere is by making certain spells illegal.

More likely possibilities are that spellcrafters shop out their talents to those who can pay for it. Rich wizards and families want utility spells for their private use most likely. That could be a lucrative job, because experimenting with spells can be a dangerous thing (we all know about Pandora Lovegood's death) so it stands to reason that the same must be true for creating your own spells as well.

This is the most believable business model in my mind and it would segue nicely into the whole pureblood/muggleborn political issue. If those people who are commissioning spells are rich pureblood families, many of them won't be interested in dealing with a muggleborn. This also makes them very hard to employ in that profession even if the masters might be willing. Not only might masters be viewed as blood traitors and lose prestige and income themselves for taking on a muggleborn apprentice, they would also know very well that any they do take on to teach won't be successful in their future profession anyway.

Maybe that's true, maybe not. I don't recall there being much or any talk in the books about family spells as that is most likely a big bunch of fanon ideas collected over the decades. However, if there are spellcrafters in any fanfic, then there also needs to be an economic underpinning of how they're able to make a living. Once that question is answered, you can say if a backstory along political lines or a certain heritage makes sense or not.

** The most immersion breaking thing I remember, outside of the usual poor writing or heavy bashing, would have to be a scene in Harry Potter and the Natural 20.

It's a DnD crossover involving a DnD wizard who was summoned via ritual and eventually attends Hogwarts. It's hilarious over the first 30 or so chapters but then slowly starts to become more serious as the story progresses. Coming from the DnD world, the MC believes that he needs to kill his enemies and complete quests in order to gain experience and level up. He also initially has problems understanding that in the Harry Potter world, death is generally permanent, unlike his home where a dead character can be revived using a cleric and a bunch of diamonds and gold.

The death eaters have repeatedly attacked the MC some 40 chapters in, and when he bests a group of Death Eaters who've infiltrated Hogwarts via polyjuice, they give up fighting and he just LETS THEM GO. Not incapacitate them so they can be arrested, not attempt to discern their real identities, hell if the author was trying to go for funny I might have even accepted if the MC let them go just so he could XP farm them. But nope, there was no reason given as to why a character with all the motivation to kill or capture his opponents just lets them leave. I quickly lost interest in the work.

tl;dr The MC does something way out of character without any explanation as to why.

** Way too many. Fics that bend over backwards to justify how muggleborns ruin pureblood culture. Every Slytherin is pureblood and Malfoy-level rich and doesn't ever have to work. Kids that act like adults before they even step their foot into Hogwars (I've been searching for a decent mafia/undeground fic for ages, but they all have teen mob boss Harry, and I just cannot suspend my disbelief).

My latest big immersion breaking moment was with a fic I was already reading kind of ironically. It didn't have the best writing and was chock full of cliches, but I was enjoying it for what it was until Harry got himself a new name. Renaming the main character alone is a back-button moment for me, but in this case, while the author clearly aimed for something unusual and fancy, the name they chose is an outdated name that fell out of fashion over a hundred years ago in my country and it's as unglamourous as you can ever get. I laughed for a full minute before closing the fic for good.

** Inconsistent world building is my biggest one. If an author says the world works a certain way then inexplicably diverts from that, all immersion is gone. (Bad) example: I was reading a creature fic the other day (not my cup of tea but it was recommended by a friend, so why not?) where they talked about mates. The protagonist has 3 mates and in the early chapters it is said that this is incredibly rare because most people only have one, a couple more chapters in and everyone and their mum has 5 mates.

Molly/Ginny/Hermione bashing. It often seems to be rooted mostly in sexism and the trope of women being sneaky, manipulative and untrustworthy. Really sets my teeth on edge. Also seems to always to hand in hand with characters from the 'dark side' being redeemed - somehow some authors seem to be unable to let go of the good vs evil narrative and so if the dark side is good the light side must be bad without any middle ground. Feels very unimaginative

Passive female characters throughout. So many fics have the men doing and planning everything while the women worry, nurture, socialise and support without having any autonomy/involvement of their own. "I'll leave you men to talk about the politics" yeah no.

Generally I'm good with almost anything as long as it's explained well and not ethically iffy (redemption because the world isn't black and white and things are far more complex than Harry understood, sure. Redemption because the dark side is actually right, no no no no) ; j.k. left plot holes big enough to fly Arthur's car through so as long as diversions from cannon are justified well, sure.

Except HP happens in 1991-1998 and those sensible gun laws were only passed in 1997, so that's not necessarily a problem. And as far as I can remember a safe wasn't required either, even after 1998 (the firing mechanism would have to be removed and secured separately or something like that)

*** That really depends on 'how' he used it to kill the assassin. Did he snipe him at long range with a quick shot? Ya, that breaks my immersion. Did he shoot him close range with a shotgun or pistol? No problem at all, especially if it was in the house and he had a chance to aim. As someone who owns both a shotgun and a pistol, hitting someone at 10 ft (3 meters) is dead easy, even if your rushed, and is easily believable for someone who basically has been 'taught' how to fire it.
