** For me:

- because I am curious what happens next. " All was well" is a nice dream, but even if Harry get's his happy ending all is /never/ well. - so, how would new characters deal with new trouble?

- Because I like the different interpretations people have of the kids. I wonder "how would it be growing up I in a shadow as big as Harry's has to be?", f.e. - and I like when others go through the trouble exploring that.

- Because the world is already there. So much more can happen in it. It is vast and interesting. And using the kids to explore that is pretty clever as it offers some familiarity to the reader( we will know some of the supporting cast... Or history even the new main characters have no idea about).

- because I just want /more/ of it all, really.

** I think there's two different kinds of next gen stories:

There are the "trio+Ginny with kids" fics, which to me are kind of like settling down with your favorite comfort food. They're domestic, they're generally fluffy, and they make you feel like the characters got the happy ending they deserved. They include OCs like bosses and SOs for minor characters, but generally the protagonists are people we know and love.

You also have fics where the kids are the protagonists, and that's fun because there's a lot of different directions you can take those kind of fics. You can turn it into HP2.0, with Harry's kids dealing with dark magic and dark wizards. But there are also a couple of different romances to explore, and all of them kind of have a ready-made backstory. Teddy/Victoire is canon as per the epilogue, so you can get a lot of mileage out of their relationship progressing over the course of their lives. Scorpius/Rose is popular thanks to Ron's joke in the epilogue, and you can churn out some conflict between the families, the couple themselves, and of course, Scorpius is a font of inner angst as well given his backstory. And then there are loads of other characters to play with and read about.

I think it's interesting to think about how the wizarding world and the trio themselves would have changed after the war, and that's something that next gen fics allow you to see as well. I've seen fics where the kids get ambushed by paparazzi, fics where WWW has a whole line of HP merchandise, fics where Hermione is spearheading the post-war pro-muggle politicial movement, etc.

It's this massive family, even if they weren't wizards there would still be a lot of stories to tell. There are a lot of next gen humor fics, which I think makes sense.

*** I agree with you for the most part in dividing the next gen fics between HP&Co and the kids. I also want to add that one of the biggest draws of next gen fics are that there isn't the spectre of Voldemort contaminating fucking /everything/.

Seriously, you can't write a fanfic after fourth year without the war oozing into it from every direction. This isn't a bad thing by default, because it does give our main characters a purpose, but it definitely narrows down what you can write.

You very, very rarely see the Wizarding World from a peaceful perspective post year five, and even five is sometimes iffy. Next Gen doesn't have that problem at all.

** I don't really enjoy next-gen fic much, but the reason I looked into it is because everything else has been DONE already. HP@hogwarts has been done to death at this point, its nice to read something different but in the same world.

** Haha, I'm the person a few posts down wanting to get into writing Next Gen. My draw to writing Harry Potter fanfiction in general is the fact that I already have a cast of characters to play with...and I love these characters. Next Gen is like that, but instead of fully defined characters you have 2D cut outs. You know their name, what they sort of look like, and basic background...but the rest is up to you. And I think that's a lot of fun.

** I like the style of many next gen fics, in that they don't read like fanfiction as much. There's a different kind of hook and pacing. Because the characters are largely original, authors have to introduce them and develop them in the fic naturally; they can't assume readers already know what the character is like or extend off of a scene in canon. Same goes for setting, plot, relationships, etc. I mostly write next gen though; I'm more of a post-war reader!

** I hate them with a burning passion. It's a cop-out by JKR, extended into a circlejerk by the fandom...

*** Not really. Alexandra Quick is totally different - no involvement /at all/ by the HP characters, different continent.

** I would imagine people like them because they get to write the stories that are like what the books could have been without the specter of war. Its got a happy Hogwarts.

I suspect the epilogue wrapped everything a little too tightly. Next Gen fics allow the writers to play with character that are pretty much blank slates--but named ones and therefore not OCs. Some are good and try to deal with a society in the aftermath of a war and the theme of living in one's parents shadows. Some use the children to pull together the parents in a way that subverts the Epilogue (like Harry's son and Draco's sons are friends, which is awkward when Harry and Draco start to hook-up).Some seem really trite, like the reprise of the Romeo and Juliet story that writers used to put Ginny and Draco in now have Rose and Scorpius.
