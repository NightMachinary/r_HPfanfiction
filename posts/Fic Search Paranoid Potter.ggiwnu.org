I'm looking for a fan fiction where Harry Potter disappears from Gordric's Hollow after the night of October 31st. Everyone thinks he died that night too. Than the Ministry and Gringotts confiscates the entire Potter legacy. He only has some money because an ancestor I believe was the great-grandfather, known as Paranoid Potter, who regularly stuck money in the Potter estate, which Harry then uses first. Hope I have described this fic exactly enough and you can help me further.
