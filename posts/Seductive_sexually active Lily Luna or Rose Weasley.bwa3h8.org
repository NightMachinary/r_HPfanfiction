** ...this may be a strange thing to fixate on, but how strange a way to write those names. For one you give her first name and middle name but not her last name; for the other you give only her first name and half her last name.

**** Doesn't explain Rose Weasley. If you said Lily Luna, say Rose; and if you are for some reason going to use her full name, actually use her full name without bizarre truncating it.

** The fred weasley memorial scholarship

I always like to call it a 'tumblr' fic. lots of lgbt+ stuff with a little bit of teenage anxiety stuff.

However one thing the writer does extremely well and what I think really carries the fic is how great they are at writing banter. There is a ton of dialogue based humor and all of it is executed so well to the point where it did actually get multiple audible giggles from me when I read it.
