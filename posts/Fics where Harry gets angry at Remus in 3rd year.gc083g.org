** So I'm just gonna say that Lupin had absolutely no obligation to ever visit or have anything to do with Harry. He wasn't his godfather, like Sirius. He was just a friend of Harrys father. He didn't want to raise a child, mostly due to his lycantrophy. He was even double thinking a child of his own ten over fifteen years later. Which is another point. He was in his early twenties. Not everyone wants a child at that age. He'd just lost literally all of his friends in one blow. That's not conductive to being in a frame of mind for good parenting skills. Being a friend of someones parent doesn't obligate you to have some kind of involvement in their life.

I feel a lot of people get caught up on Sirius' desire and expectation to be in Harry's life and transfer that onto Lupin because they were both James' friends. Sirius is Harry's godfather. He agreed, before Harry was born, to take an active role in the childs life and to be responsible if anything happened to Harry's parents. Lupin didn't. Relationships are different, even in close friend groups. I couldn't imagine being obligated to visit my friends child, even if they died. Harry went to his relatives. That's a typical process when a childs parents die. The relatives were abusive, sure, but that's not something you automatically assume. As far as Lupin knew, Harry was safe and fine. He had no part in Harry's life, as evidenced by Harry never ever even considering that Lupin did have any obligation.

  or around the time that Remus took the marauder's map and told Harry that he was insulting his parents sacrifice simply because he was out after curfew.
#+end_quote

He took the map and told Harry he was insulting his parents honour because Harry was using the map to sneak out of the (relative) safety of supervision in the castle in order to sneak into a public village during a time that a dangerous serial killer who had (by their knowledge) directly caused his parents death was /known/ to be in the area.

In essence, he was putting himself at risk of being murdered by his parents murderer for a bit of butterbeer. So no, that was actually justified.
