It's a fic I read a while back and can't remember the title or site it was on. What I remember best from it is a scene near the end. Harry and Draco are talking, and one tells the other that Ginny and he are leaving to travel the world. The other gets slightly upset, thinking Ginny and the other boy have decided to be together, only to be informed that they've got 3 tickets so all 3 can travel together.

Things about the story I'm less certain of:\\
I think it's a one-shot.\\
I don't think there's smut, but I could be wrong.\\
I think at least 1 of the 3 fakes their death, which explains why they can leave and travel.
