Rules:

1. Any universe and any genre is permitted, so long the character(s) involved are all *fictional*. So there's no Donald Trump/Umbridge comparisons, hilarity be damned.

2. Choose a character that fits /well/.

3. Be tastefully [in]offensive. Nobody wants hate comments, after all.

The format is as follows:

[/genderbent HP character/] = [your chosen crossover character name *and* universe]

Example

Fem!Snape = Marceline the Vampire Queen from Adventure Time


** Fem!Harry as a misunderstood Maleficent with a dragon animagus form.

** Ok this just occurred to me:

fem!Lucius = Legolas (Lord Of The Rings)

If you're a guy and like Legolas you're gay because he's so girly looking.

** Dumbledore is a character you can take a lot of ways, but my favorite interpretation genderflips into Esmerelda Weatherwax: haunted by the knowledge that the person most like zir turned into a brutal dictator, but still making life-and-death decisions for everyone else because someone competent has to.
