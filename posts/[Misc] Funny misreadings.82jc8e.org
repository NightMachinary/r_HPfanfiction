I was just searching for the excellent linkffn(Heroes Assemble) when I accidentally typed Herpes Assemble into search... I had a good laugh and thought a "Change One Letter" thread could be fun. So, pick a fic and change a letter, or a word, and post below!


** Not quite what you're asking, for but I feel like I got to mention linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist). Because so many people misread the title as /Hermione Granger, Dermatologist/, and said so in reviews, that the author did the magnificent thing of actually writing /that/ story, too --- and did it very well! linkffn(Hermione Granger, Dermatologist).

#+begin_quote
  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  Hermione makes new friends at Hogwarts -- and one lifelong enemy -- with her newfound love for proper skin and hair care. The wizarding world will be changed forever! A silly idea turned serious, and dedicated to those who skim read the title of my fic "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" a bit too fast. Hermione POV, humour, no pairings, complete.

*** No, this is exactly the sort of thing I was talking about :') the fact that it led to another fic being written is just the icing on the cake.

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.
