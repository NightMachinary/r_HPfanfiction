This might lead to some pretty traumatic PTSD from just all the ways he's died, or be played for complete laughs when he walk off being bitten in half by a troll, or for feelsgoodman, when he uses his abilities to make sure everybody is safe and happy while he takes on everything by himself.


** Ron watched in horror at Harry's crushed body that lay on the floor. He had not meant for this to happen. He had thought that Harry would be able to get off the Troll's back. But he was not able to get off it and got crushed by it when it fell. He had banged his head hard on the floor and blood was pouring out of his head, /Oh Merlin so much blood/ he thought hysterically. His legs were even worse if that was possible. He could see bone sticking out of the skin and it did not look good.

He stumbled forward and barely managed to push the troll's head off of Harry. This cannot be happening. Harry could not be dead, his friend could not be dead. They shouldn't have come to warn Hermione. He should have told Harry that the Professors would take care of the troll. That the troll was in the dungeon and no where near where Hermione was. His best friend was dead.

He fell to his knees; tears rolling down his face as he wept for his friend when he suddenly heard a gasp. He looked up to see Hermione looking at Harry with a look of horror. She asked,"Is he_ _dead?"

He opens his mouth to say something, what, he does not know. Maybe he was going to ask her what does she think or maybe he was going to ask her why she did not move when Harry asked her to. He does not know because all that came out was a sob.

Her eyes started tearing and now she was crying too. He does not know how long he sat there crying when he heard someone swearing. The sound was coming from Harry's body. He looked down to see Harry's face twist into a pained grimace as set his head wound started to heal. His legs were also twisting back into place and it was sickening to watch.

He just sat there staring. He could not believe what he was seeing. Finally Harry sat back up and looked at him and asked,"Are you okay Ron?"

He could not help it he laughed, he laughed so hard. He had never laughed so hard before. Hermione was no better. He could hear the hysterical edge to her high pitched giggles while Harry looked between them with confusion on his face.

*** Hope you don't mind but I did one for the Quirell confrontation as well

Harry formed a fist and punched Quir- Volde- Quirellmort in the nose. Instead of a bruise, however, the latter one's face began to burn into ash amidst the host's horrific screams. The hateful face began to twist, and with a sickening crack, Quirell's voice fell silent.

"I'll get you for that one, Potter!" hissed the baleful face, and began popping his host's joints backwards. Just as Voldemort made to push himself up on a horrifically mangled arm, Harry grabbed at his face once more, and Voldemort began to scream shrilly as his his own face began to burn up.

At the same time, Harry's hand felt like it was submerged in a tub of boiling water, and he quickly made to pull it back, only to see a tendril of pure black connect the stump of his arm to the hole in Voldemort's face. From within the now smoldering shell rose a ghostly figure leaking darkness, and threw itself toward Harry; Just then, a flash of light and exclamation of "Expecto Patronum!" created a luminous phoenix which stabbed the wraith viciously and sent it howling through the wall.

Albus stood, lowering his wand, eyes fixed on the horrific display of dark magic before him; Where Harry had just been was now a quickly decaying skeleton.

"Harry, no, it wasn't supposed to end like this..."

Albus fell to his knees, dropping his wand in the process.

"Why were you here, you foolish, foolish boy..."

Now muttering to himself, clenching his eyes and shaking his head, Albus missed the miracle happening just before him. What was left of Harry was slowly drawing itself together, the loose bones quickly knitting themselves into a proper skeleton, and the ash beginning to flow along the slowly whitening bones. Within a few moments, the form of a human was visible once more, and a few seconds later, the last layer of ash fell away as Harry loudly took his first breath in several minutes, shocking the elderly headmaster into falling backwards into a heap.
