Harry and Hermione travel to a dimension where Snape and Sirius are best friends, and James and Lily never got married. Pretty sure Neville and Luna are there at some point as well. Also, Harry is mad from constant use of Felix Felicis.

I think I found it on ff.net, but I can't remember the title.
