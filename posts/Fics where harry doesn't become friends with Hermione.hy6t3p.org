Hi im looking for fics along the lines of where harry and Ron never became friends with Hermione.

more like they barely acknowldge her existance or just find her annoying but she is essentially just like any other hogwarts student. While Ron and harry are the bestest of friends and having adventures

Preferably without heavy hermione bashing like being involved in some conspiracy.


** No one saved her when she was in the bathrooms.

*** Or they saved but after they just didn't become friends. Ron /was/ the cause for her being there in first place, so she could not feel like getting close to him after almost getting killed (admittedly, it was mostly Quirrel's fault, but how to convince 11 years-old Hermione of it?), and if she tried becoming friends with Harry and deliberately excluding his first friend I can see him getting annoyed and the whole thing going up in smoke -though to be fair it could be fun to see a Ron and Hermione who hate each other fighting for Harry's friendship, even more so if it dissolves in Ron and Hermione acting like divorced parents in a custody war while Harry is just weirded the hell out by it.

Alternatively we could also go with Hermione's parents transferring her to Beubatonx after first year.

***** Good point, and this is without even entering on the ways the friendship could break before truly taking off or earlier divergences, like Harry (or Ron though it's not done as often) going into another house (even Slytherin I guess, Ron's hatred for the house is almost completely fandom) and so not being in the same class as her for charms, Hermione being born some months earlier so they aren't in the same year, or even changing personalities to the point the pre-Halloween confrontation doesn't happen.

*** I read a bit of this a few days ago, and I can't stop thinking about a particular scene. When Augusta Longbottom first meets Dean Thomas, she calls him polite “for a Muggle-Born” after he addresses her by “ma'am”. My first instinct was that this was the author saying that she is the same sort of casual racist as Slughorn is. But there's no indication in the text that Harry thinks of it that way. Does anyone else who's read this have any thoughts about this? I can't shake the feeling that the author was being completely serious, lol.

I didn't get very far, but I had this feeling that >! Augusta was going to have a bit of a fall from grace, since it seemed like the story was setting up a good Dumbledore, and she was acting like she was in a Manipulate!Dumbledore story!< .All in all I found it hard to tell what was me overthinking it and what was the author trying to be subtle.

****** Honestly, all of it, but it was specifically in reference to her being a muggleborn. She has no prejudice at all against muggleborns. The reason she said that is simply for her to keep strong with her demeanour. Augusta is a very hard person to earn unconditional respect from, which is why she did not endorse him too openly. The muggleborn comment was simply a reference to the fact that purebloods go through hours of study in regards to etiquette, where most muggleborns do not. If anything, it was complimentary of Dean, not a slight against muggleborns.

It's like if I saw somebody with an office job go out and do an impressive athletic feat and said “Damn, he's athletic, especially for somebody with an office job.” It's nog a slight on him. If anything, it's pointing out how good he is at something in spite of an inheren

You did infer correctly about Dumbledore though. He is good in this story.

******* I see what you mean. To me, it reads as a slight, because calling an older woman ma'am doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary. It reads like Augusta thinks she's being complementary, but she's actually displaying her prejudice towards Muggle-Borns by implying that they aren't capable of basic civility.

This is why I compared her to Slughorn, who defends himself by saying that Lily was one of his favourites after expressing surprise at her being a Muggle-Born. It's a sort of casual racism.

Either way, you've said that's not how you meant it, but I do think it's something to keep in mind.

  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater. Good Dumbledore All Years

** I love this prompt because I think without Hermione, Harry and Ron would've been forced to get creative and start using their brains more. Both have great potential. Ron is suggested to be a total slacker but still gets decent grades (I'm sure many of us could relate). I'd like to see the two of them actually having to buckle down, and I think they would if they had to. Hermione became a convenient crutch for them as the books went on. Not so much in the beginning but towards the end of the series she had all the answers and I think that would hold Harry and Ron back. If they didn't have her they would've been forced to be more mature with their education all on their own

  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?
