My favorite part of these Manipulative Dumbledore fics is, and this happens in all of them, where they have "Hadrian" say something snarky like " Dumb as a door far too many names" like they didn't just change Harry's name to have more last names than Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven Way. But there are different rules for Indy Harry I guess he is after all A pUrEbLoOd LoRd MaNy TiMeS oVeR


** I don't think it's quite the same. Each additional last name is directly connected to the political power he's wielding in said fanfic, in an uncomfortably long, hyphenated, but technically only one, last name.

Dumbledore had 3 middle names, which I find quite unusual. I remember one fanfic that claimed that he added the extra middle names to make himself seem more important.

*** I remember reading a story where it's common for people to take on a middle name for every mastery they gain, and the reason Dumbledore has so many middle names is because he gained three masterys.

**** I like that idea. Or the idea that about 200 years ago that many middle names was normal for wizards and when he was born it was going out of style. So since he's so old and it was already going out of style he's one of a few people with that many names.

***** Yet his sister and brother only have a single middle name. Personally prefer in Basilisk-Born by Ebenbild where no one has a middle name and at the start Harry says his full name and its assumed his name Harryjames Potter, his middle name is assumed to be part of his first name.

** A Slytherin Way of Being by catchingafallingstar points out that Dumbledore changed his name to be more impressive

**** True but I find it very interesting that for the most part the rest of the wizarding world uses a single middle name. And we never hear of a single middle name for the rest of the Dumbledore family. So we are to believe that Albus' parents thought he was going to be so special that at birth that they gave him 3 middle names?

It's much easier to believe (even though there is nothing in canon) that as a teenager when Albus was discussing/planning the "Greater Good" with Gellert that he decided that a longer name was impressive so Dumbledore added the two additional names. Similar to how Tom created his name as a teenager.

Now I will say the few fics that do this use Wulfric as Dumbledore's "true" middle name and have him "adding" Percival and Brian. But I would have thought since Percival was his Father's name that would be his "true" middle name and he "added" Wulfric and Brian.
