Imagine the Truman show but with Harry, in this Harry overhears conversation and eventually escapes hogwarts with I think professor lupin and some others. Why Harry got into this is because (if I remember) he got sick as a baby and got helped by some company in exchange for said show. I read this in 2018 and really want to find it again.

First thing on Duckduckgo to come up, if it's not it it still seems a good read.

  Harry woke after the battle to the castle acting wierd. What in Merlin's name is going on? Is magic only in the movies? What really happened to Harry's parents? How will he get out of this mess? Took it out of crossover and just saying its similar to Truman.
