So I became aware of this series because so many people on reddit recommended it. The Author said no pairing until fourth year but even in the fourth book he doesn't reveal the exact pairing in the tags, citing "I'm not going to say because you get to be surprised". Now I get where the author is coming from but also I don't wanna start this series just to find out that it's H/HR again.. (Don't judge me, I just don't think they fit together)


** I'm just praying it's not Harry/Theo

** I will tell you that the pairing isn't Harry/Hermione.

I will also tell you that just because characters are dating someone in one book, it doesn't mean they will be with them throughout the entire series.

** Spoilers, obviously.

But you were asking.

.

The pairing that makes the most sense within S&S is Harry/Daphne. Characterisations of the Slytherins are the highlight of the series, and both of them aren't an exception. Daphne has the burden of being the heiress, raised with little affection by her mother to become strong enough to avoid her mother's fate of a political match ... only to find that somewhere in the process the goal slipped from her grasp, certainly gaining the strength to chose for love, but having lost the capacity for it.

In that way, she is matched by Harry. Both are broken in similar ways, both are best friends, both get together and break up, and that's where the story leaves off. There's character growth left for both of them, but mostly on Daphne's side. If that relationship is to work, she needs to accept that she's never going to get anything closer approaching love than Harry. Right now, she is searching, but that's pretty much doomed for failure. She is who she is, and it's not someone warm, affable and capable of overflowing affection.

The other option on Harry's end is Pansy. It'd be a political match -- he likes her well enough, and Pansy is calculating enough to settle for that and be happy enjoying the benefits of being his SO.

But yeah. From where I am standing, the character arcs pretty clearly point to Harry/Daphne as the final pairing. If we ever get there, I suppose.

** Skimming through the first quarter of the fifth book, I can't even tell. But Hermione is mentioned as his "friend", in a place where if she were his acknowledged girlfriend, they probably would have said "girlfriend." The fifth book looks abandoned but what I skimmed intrigued me so I'll probably read the whole damn thing now.

  The conclusion of the AO3 work Sarcasm and Slytherin. Chapters 1-16 are available here. https://archiveofourown.org/works/15848610/chapters/36912186This is Sunmoonandstars, back from the dead. Original work summary: Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.Happy reading everyone. I have no clue when book 6 is going to be done or ready to post but have at least the end of book 5 because it's been languishing on my hard drive for too long.

** Harry and Daphne where together for a while, but I think they split up. They said they worked better as friends.

The girl he's closest to (outside of Hermione who he sees as a friend) is Pansy.
