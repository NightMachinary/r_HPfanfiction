Like "What's a little death between friends?"


** linkffn(A Black Comedy) has this. Though the fight is not quite the same as in What's a Little Death Between Friends.

*** This only sort of fits. [[/spoiler][It's a 2v1 and Harry had to sacrifice his wand. It's stated in the fic that you never find another wand that's as good as your first. Even then, the fight is very much a struggle.]]

***** That's disappointing. Do you remember the dialogue specifically? Like is it super awkward and forced? I can tolerate spelling mistakes, but if they are coupled with unbelievable dialogue then I'm out.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
