I remember reading an old fanfic about the Mauraders years ago and I can't seem to find it anymore. Basically it was about The original Mauraders plus an OC in their last year of Hogwarts. They each are paired up with Lily and her friends. I think the OC Maurader and Lily's best friend are fraternal twins. If anyone can remember the fanfic I would very much appreciate it!
