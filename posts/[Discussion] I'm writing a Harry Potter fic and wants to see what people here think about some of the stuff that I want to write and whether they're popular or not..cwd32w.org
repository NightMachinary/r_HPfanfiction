** From what you've described on this tread, I feel like you're trying hard to inform us that this will not be like the others lord Harry fics, but I don't actually see what's making it significantly different, if at all. If you want to write OP Lord Potter with a harem fighting against manipulative Dumbledore and meanies Weasleys you can do so and you don't need to justify yourself.

*** Yeah... it sounds like a completely generic indy!Harry bashing fic from 2008, with incredibly minor variations - "Yes, Harry will inherit multiple lordships, but my Harry will have 2% less wealth".

The only distinguishing feature is having another villain more powerful than Voldemort... which does not seem like a good idea. Power inflation = meh.

*** Came all the way down here to write this comment.

This is the type of stuff that has “Not your typical indy!Harry“ in the summary and then proceeds to be a typical indy!Harry from the get go.
