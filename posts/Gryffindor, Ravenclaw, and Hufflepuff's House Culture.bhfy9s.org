We've seen a lot of fanfiction that shows Slytherin Inner House Culture, from the Parlour in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]], Prince of Slytherin in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][HP&POS]], or even Founder Treasure Hunt in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]].

Is there any other fanfiction that explores the other houses' culture in more details? More than simply 'Ravenclaws has a regular tutoring in every Thursday', 'Hufflepuff has the wildest party in Hogwarts', or 'Gryffindors are recklessly stupid' . Maybe how Gryffindors has a broom landings in their tower, Hufflepuff has a year-end test where everyone must work together, or Ravenclaws has a room full with magical invention from older students.

â€‹

Edit: I just remembered a fanfic where Ravenclaws has a regular Seminar and Discussion from a student about a topic they're expert in. I just can't remember what the title is.


** linkffn(The Ravenclaw Chronicles by ivorynightfall) has a Ravenclaw!Hermione and portrays Ravenclaw as a site of constant academic competition, with students forming study groups and being very selective and strategic about whom they let in, to make sure everyone pulls their own weight.

â€‹

One bit of my headcanon Ravenclaw culture I would like to see in a fic is something along the lines of Hermione being sorted there, acting not very differently from early canon. Then, about a week or two into the year, one of her roommates asks for her opinion about some fashion decision. That sort of thing happens more than once, to the point of Hermione being a bit puzzled by it.

It turns out that in Ravenclaw culture, Hermione-grade academic success puts one at the top of the pecking order, and asking someone for advice is a way of showing respect and deference.

â€‹

I can also imagine Ravenclaws trying to out-know-it-all each other.

*** I think so, I've read a lot of Ravenclaw!Harry that I can't remember the detail in each fanfiction. I remembered Harry (or one of his friends) giving a seminar about Potions though, I think Cho and some other upper classmen is also there and they finally understand Potion better after the seminar.

** linkffn(The Tinkerer) has some stuff for Hufflepuff that maybe counts; it's been a minute since I read it. Though what I'm thinking of is mostly peripheral, I thought it was pretty neat and enriched the story. Incomplete and likely abandoned, but an entertaining read nonetheless.

(Also, I can personally recall all the example fics you cited, so it's probably time for me to step away from fic for a bit. ðŸ˜‚ Maybe after the next Pureblood Pretense update.)

** - Harry potter in the claw of the raven. linkao3(10889381) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/338101][Full series here]]\\

This goes into greater depth about the study culture in Ravenclaw, such as how the tower's own library works (while being a student there, you can create a copy of one of your more unique books and place it on the shelves for everyone to read). Trigger Warning: good goblins, Lord Harry, pure-blood culture, bow and scrape oh my. In other news, Flitwick is a BAMF.

Note: There are a lot of things that the community dislikes in the previous fic, but it's well written and an enjoyable fluffy-time read nonetheless.

- The Eagle's Nest. linkao3(33410025)\\

An 8th year dramione fic, everyone gets resorted. Explores the idea that founders other than just Slytherin left secret rooms: we see Ravenclaw's and Hufflepuff's. Ravenclaw also has a tradition about leaving behind a book in their massive library when they graduate. Heavy on Alchemy. I have some mixed feelings about this fic personally.

- The Best Revenge. linkffn(4912291)

Hufflepuff culture. Mentoring, 'Council of the Sett', talent shows... It takes quite a while to actually get to school though. There's a bit about Ravenclaw in there as well, primarily hazing. This is a two part story, the second being [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5843959/1/The-Best-Revenge-Time-of-the-Basilisk][here]] - I'm a /huge/ fan of the way she resolved the Chamber of Secrets storyline.

  The Wycliff family deals with the after-effects of Holly and Vernon's summer adventure. Student pranks go too far at Hogwarts and Albus finds himself at the center of the accusations. An ultimate act of revenge points to Albus as the guilty person and forces both James and Holly to bear witness against him. Meanwhile, Rita Skeeter and other wizards question Harry's guardianship of Holly while trying to pierce the veil of privacy and security surrounding the Potters and Wycliffs. Harry Potter works to protect both families while keeping himself out of Azkaban Prison.
