Seriously, Dumbledore using the phrase would be like a German wisely saying "Work sets you free!". It's clearly not how Dumbledore thinks of his actions - as shown in dialogue at the end of OotP. It makes much more sense that Dumbledore would be disgusted by using that justification.

  Dumbledore looked directly into Harry's eyes again.

  “Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution.

  “Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true.

*** But this is still not a real argument for the "Greater Good", it's an old man bitterly reminiscing about his foolish youth and the misplaced motivations he used to have. If you ignore that you're not even dealing with the same character, so what exactly is the point of a Dumbledore-bashing fic? There are decent fics out there which do explore Dumbledore reconciling with Grindelwald or Ariana not dying.

There is something that rings so true here: that those with power, drive, and intelligence will always think that they know better than others and will want to use that power to impose their will on the rest. Machiavelli's Prince is all about how people do that and the various reasons why. So it does definitely follow that someone who is as paternalistic as Dumbledore would certainly have wanted to impose the general good on others for their own good, even if he later decided that the forceful way was not the right way. So fan fic authors really picked up on that.

  Aunt Petunia's hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late---the envelope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it.

  "Remember my last, Petunia."

- Dumbles, 1996.

*/puts on tinfoil hat/*

Dumbledore fights against Voldemort, a dark wizard who murders muggles and muggleborns. But Dumbledore also overrides the free-will and agency of muggles whenever it's necessary for the cause (the greater good!). He forces a baby into the home of a young family who didn't want one, who already had their hands full with a baby of their own. Petunia must have been only 23 years old when Dumbledore dumped Harry on her doorstep with a letter explaining that her sister was dead.

It's hard to say that Dumbledore truly respects muggles based on how he is seen to treat them in canon. Not only did he bully Petunia and family (he sent Hagrid to pick up Harry and no one seemed to care that Hagrid gave Dudley a tail, a clear example of illegal muggle-baiting), but he also Confunded and lied to Mrs. Cole from Tom Riddle's orphanage, when she was Tom's legal guardian, and by all rights had a valid, legal reason to know about his magic, like all muggleborn/muggle raised guardians do.

But it's for their own good, I guess.

Just imagine somebody who you know could kill you without breaking a sweat coming to your home at night, physically forcing you to sit and then coercing you to drink an unknown substance. That's psycho-thriller material. And Harry notes "that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself".

**** Lmao, with the right editing and music, the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDpkehq3uRE]["letter delivery" sequence]] from the extended cut of Philosopher's Stone would be straight out of a horror flick.

Another example of wizards pulling off a "quirky home invasion" is the Weasleys visiting the Dursleys in GoF. If the story was told from a muggle perspective, it would be horrifying.

#+begin_quote
  The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fireplace burst outwards, expelling Mr Weasley, Fred, George and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings.

  "That's better," panted Mr Weasley, brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses. "Ah---you must be Harry's aunt and uncle!"

  Tall, thin and balding, he moved towards Uncle Vernon, his hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia.

  "Er---yes---sorry about that," said Mr Weasley, lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. ‘It's all my fault, it just didn't occur to me that we wouldn't be able to get out at the other end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network, you see. I'll light a fire to send the boys back, and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate."

  Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn't understood a single word of this.
#+end_quote

What the actual fuck. I think the worst thing about wizards taking liberties like this is their not seeing anything wrong with it. They're not torturing, baiting, or assaulting muggles, so what they're doing must be perfectly fine and dandy. In some ways, it makes sense for how insular their culture is, but it's also unnerving how this is just accepted as the status quo even for people who have close, positive personal connections with muggles. Eg, Seamus commenting on his muggle dad finding out being lied to by his wife, "Bit of a nasty shock for him".

**** Honestly. If we just look at this from the Dursleys perspective for half a minute, the whole thing becomes a freaking horror story.

Petunia starts her life with a younger sister who she is terribly jealous of and, in an effort to cope, proceeds to basically cut off all contact with her only remaining family member after the death of her parents. She knows that she'll never be as 'special' as Lily is, so instead decides to be the exact opposite, painfully normal, in response.

For a few years, this seems to work for her. She marries Vernon, a proper, respectable sort of fellow, and has Dudley, a completely normal baby.

Then it all comes crashing down on her. One morning, she opens her door to find a freaking baby on her steps and learn from a letter in his blanket that her sister is dead and she is now responsible for her nephew.

We have very little idea what those first few years that Harry was at the Dursleys house were like. I personally find it hard to believe that he was always as mistreated by them as he was later on. A fifteen month old needs a fair amount of attention and love just to develop normally, and considering how Harry turned out, I personally find it hard to believe she just immediately locked him in the cupboard until he was old enough to be useful to her. I highly doubt that she ever doted on him the way she did Dudley and she was probably resentful of how he showed up and 'ruined' her perfect little life, but I doubt any major abuse would have happened in those early years.

It is much easier to believe that treatment of Harry got worse and worse each time he had a bout of accidental magic. Now, we have no idea when accidental magic starts happening for a child, or how often it occurs, but given that magic requires intent, it probably doesn't start happening until a child can clearly identify what it wants - say 2 or 3 years old. That's when non-magical children start to really exert their will on the world around them, so let's assume it's the same for magical ones.

Each incident of accidental magic on Harry's part leads to more fear and resentment on the Dursleys part and fear and resentment breed anger. The Dursleys get harsher, heaping on more punishments and chores, taking away (or never giving in the first place) any 'extras' that they lavish on Dudley. Until you eventually get to the point where we meet Harry just before his 11th birthday.

From that point on, every single summer that Harry spends with them, something terrifying and out of their control happens. Before 1st year, there's the zoo episode (which seems to be fairly run of the mill as far as they handle it). But then the letters from Hogwarts start to come and they try to get away from the magic world that they have been aggressively ignoring ever since Harry showed up. But Hagrid appears, strands them on a rock in the middle of the sea, and leaves Dudley with a pig tail that they have to have surgically removed!

Second year: Dobby shows up and ruins an important business dinner for Vernon. Then, Ron and the twins fly a car over Surrey to pick Harry up, damaging the Dursleys house in the process.

Third year: Harry inflates Aunt Marge, then runs away rather than fix it, and the Ministry of Magic has to get involved. We know that Obliviators get called in to wipe Aunt Marge's mind of the whole incident, so if the Dursleys weren't aware before, they definitely know now that wizards have no problem messing with the minds of muggles.

Fourth year: The Weasleys blow up their fireplace when they get Harry for the World Cup and the twins trick Dudley into eating a sweet that makes his tongue grow to his knees. If he hadn't eaten it while Mr. Weasley was still there, what would have happened to him??

Fifth year: Dementors nearly suck out Dudley's soul when he's out with his friends one day. Then the Order tricks them out of their house so that they can steal Harry away in the middle of the night.

Sixth year: Dumbledore himself shows up to (deservedly) harangue them for their treatment of Harry, but does so in the most petty and childish, while simultaneously terrifying, way imaginable.

Finally, seventh year: They are forced to abandon their home, their work, their school, their lives or be killed by wizard supremacists just because Harry lived with them! They also seem to have been under the Order's protection during that whole year. Were Order members living with them, rubbing their magic and the war in their faces the whole time? Or were they 'just' being spied on, as they had been for basically Harry's whole time there?

Now, I am in no way defending how the Dursleys treated Harry. They were neglectful, abusive, hateful people and quite frankly I wouldn't treat a spider with the contempt and viciousness that they do their own nephew. But all of this could have been avoided if Harry was never forced on them, or if Dumbledore seemed to actually care about how they treated Harry and said or did something about it before Harry was 16.

I think it's easy to ignore how horrifying this must be to a muggle because the Dursleys are such terrible people and we as readers (understandably) experience schaudenfreude reading about what happens to them. But nothing that happens to them is in anyway helpful or constructive towards actually improving Harry's life with them and instead just feeds back into the cycle of abuse.

​

I'm Not condoning how they act with harry. but your point make's a lot of sense about their point of view. they just wanted to be normal before a baby dropped into their lifes.. and they had to deal with it all.

and think about this? just how horrible it could be, They were horrible people but understanding their motive and how they got there does not agree with it.

and think about it? we see what you said. small incidences.. imagine over the years.. They may have wanted to move, wanted different things in life. their resentment and pettiness did go out on the boy. but their could have been a reason that lead to it.

Gee, woman, September 1 is the traditional date for starting school in the UK, and it's a muggle train station, what did you expect? If you didn't want to mingle, you shoulda used the Floo.

You see themes of "power imbalance" discussed in superhero fiction between supers and normies, but the lack of this in canon HP is so weird to me. But it sort of makes sense when you step back and realize that there are few, if any, central muggle characters in the story. The Dursleys, and that's about it. We don't even know Hermione's parents' names since she stopped visiting them after around book 5.

***** Lol, no. Sirius was 21 and completely unsuitable to raise a baby, no matter how much he wanted to. And, ffs, Dumbledore had no say in whether or not Sirius had a trial. Barty Crouch made the decision. Why didn't Remus secure Sirius a trial? Why didn't Arthur? Did McGonagall just not give a crap? It's a ridiculous accusation. Dumbledore isn't god or king. In PoA the limits of his power are clearly spelled out. He couldn't have countermanded Crouch's decision.

What's more, everything pointed to Sirius guilt at the time. Dumbledore had no reason to doubt his guilt until Pettigrew showed up in Harry's third year.

The "Dumbledore didn't get Sirius a trial" thing is one of those bad fanon memes that Dumbledore haters who don't remember the books spread.

as for the trial thing, Dumbledore was Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, as well as one of the two most popular wizards in Britain, with Harry being the other one. even if he somehow didn't have the authority as Chief Warlock, it's impossible to believe that if he, Albus Dumbledore raised a huge public stink about the godfather of Harry Potter being sent to prison without a trial, that the ministry wouldn't cave and give him one.

******* Look, ultimately "Dumbledore not getting Sirius a trial for nefarious reasons" isn't canon, it's not implied by canon, and it contradicts everything canon tell us about Dumbledore as a character. What IS canon, is that Dumbledore did not have the political power to keep Sirius out of Azkaban or from being kissed in PoA. Which means we can take it as a given that he wouldn't have had the power earlier on either. Your personal headcanons aren't relevant.

And, as I've said before, if Dumbledore hadn't left Harry with Petunia, he would have been murdered by Death Eaters within days. So, yeah, Petunia was the better option. You can't just ignore the text when it doesn't support your headcanons. Hating Dumbledore indicates a deep lack of understanding of the series as a whole.

  “I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power. “But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore,underestimated --- to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.”

  “She doesn't love me,” said Harry at once. “She doesn't give a damn ---”

  “But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, *she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.*”

  “I still don't ---”

  “*While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort.* He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, *but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you.* Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. *She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.*”

  “Wait,” said Harry. “Wait a moment.”

  He sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore. “You sent that Howler. You told her to remember --- it was your voice ---”

  “I thought,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, “that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you. I suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son.”

** Dumbledore definitely rejected Grindelwald's ideology, but that ideology was /more/ than just "For the Greater Good." At the root, they disagreed on /what/ was the Greater Good. Grindelwald believed it was ruling over the muggles, with some gratuitous torture and murder on the side. Dumbledore ultimately believed it was fighting /against/ dark wizards like Grindelwald.

I agree with [[/u/SMTRodent][u/SMTRodent]] that it's pretty easy to see many of Dumbledore's actions as motivated by the Greater Good, but I think the best evidence comes from Harry's line to Aberforth, where Harry is explaining his understanding of Albus's philosophy:

So, I have a lot of issues with his decisions. Do I think he's evil? No. Flawed? Yes, but all the adults in Harry Potter were. But I can't see anyone making the decisions he made in the series without having the "Greater Good" in mind. And all leaders have the greater good of the company, group, country in mind when they make decisions. It's just that generally the consequences of those choices aren't felt (or seem to be felt immediately), nor are they as disastrous.

*** I think it would be more accurate to say that they don't regard their manipulative behavior as bad.

First, we all manipulate others to greater or lesser extents. Did you ever write a Reddit post in such a way as to elicit - or /avoid/ - a particular emotional reaction? That's a form of manipulation. Every parent does certain things to get their children to learn how to behave a certain way - they know better and can't explain every little thing, so they use shortcuts that work. Manipulation sounds bad, but acting in a certain way or carefully choosing words in order to achieve certain results is normal.

Second, we must never forget that Dumbledore isn't simply a school headmaster or teacher. He's also a /politician/. Given how long he's been doing that, he's probably moderately successful. And he's a politician in a system that has both idiots and bigots in a lot of important positions (politically, socially, culturally). Did he achieve his status and success by simply being a beacon of purity? Unlikely. It's more plausible that he's engaged in rough political deals and compromises. For decades.

Politics is a dirty business, even when pursued by the best of people for the best of motives. And there's not a small amount of manipulation involved.

Dumbledore is manipulative and he manipulates Harry all over the place. And I'm sure he knows he doing it. That doesn't make him a villain, but it's a situation that lends itself well towards villainy, if you want to spin things a certain way. And even if you don't, it's impossible to accept that Dumbledore is purely good. In addition to a politician, he's a general. In wars, generals sacrifice others in order to achieve tactical and strategic goals.

Where Dumbledore really falls down there is that it's not clear that he has the moral/political authority to make such decisions (who elected or appointed him?) and it's not clear that he's gotten anyone's consent to risk them in his plans (on what basis did he have the right to risk so many students when he hid the Stone, for example?).

And if his defense is that he knew better than anyone else and thus was right to take the lead, then that's where slip into “Greater Good” arguments. Again, that doesn't make him evil, but it does mean he isn't paragon of goodness, either. It's ultimately what makes him an interesting character. He does things which deserve to be condemned for reasons most would agree are good.

I agree with everything you've said, except this. That is exactly what makes him evil IMO. Outcomes, good or bad, are almost never in anyone's control and so goodness should be defined as "good intentions followed by good actions." We can debate his intentions but his actions are not those of a good person in possession of all his faculties.

And people in general should stop looking at his actions only in light of defeating Voldemort. There should be higher standards for being considered a good person.

*** Yes, you can - and most fics that use 'for the greater good' fall flat because of that failure.

However, the phrase itself (and a similar ideological outlook) would not be amiss in a well written negative view of Dumbledore. Him trying to do what he thinks is for the overall good of society isn't bad on its own as an ideal, is it? That's what the justification is for the actions he'd be taking in such fics - that they're necessary.

For example, it'd be very easy to write a scenario where Dumbledore's only goal is to stop Voldemort - at basically any cost. Or one where he sees change to Wizarding Society as dangerous - bringing charismatic leaders (eg Grindelwald and Voldemort) who'd harness that towards their own personal power and devastation, and where a pro-muggleborn/house elf movement from Harry & Co to upend traditional power structures would also be seen as such a threat.

He's a complicated character - and certainly manipulative. The problem with most 'greater good' fics is that they are badly written, don't actually have him going for a greater good, and stripping all of the interesting bits/complexity away. Oh, and that the authors seem to think that it's the canon attitude of dumbledore.

"Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD."

Grindelwald liked the phrase so much he took it as his own but Dumbledore was obviously using it too - Aberforth mentions it in his rant to Harry about his brother: "what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good?" and later "How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?"

Dumbledore uses the phrase himself to Harry at King's Cross: "I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards."

So while canon Dumbledore might well have abandoned the concept after the split with Grindelwald, it's not actually a huge leap to write a story where he believes his plans are more important than any one individual.

******* Well, let's give an example (not even the most horrifying) : out of all the boys born in France in 1896 (those that were conscripted in 1914), 1/3 of those who survived to adulthood (child mortality was high at the time) died during WW1. Most were not volunteers.\\
And from an american perspective, even if you never had a peacetime conscription, the draft was called every time the recruitment objectives (political decision) were not met. And today still, the US has a system of conscription for untrained adults and alien residents.

Dumbledore behaves exactly like someone who uses other people as chess-pieces (sacrificing some "pawns" like Harry and his order-members!) "for the greater good" of society at large!

Dumbledore might have wanted to change (he never takes the position of minister for example, despite it being more powerful than all his other positions, but he still kind of rules wizard-Britain from the shadows (he wields a lot of influence and even Lucius Malfoy can't always compete!)), but he never made it!

Lily was a prodigy at school, friendly with professors, the one that casted the Fidelius and whose sacrifice saved Harrys life other than that she was the reason Harry went to the Dursleys after his parents died.

  "Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort

  had split his soul."

  "Where?" asked Harry. "How?"

  "You handed it to me, Harry," said Dumbledore. "The diary, Riddles

  diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets."

So he definitely did not groom Harry to sacrifice himself from birth.

Secondly Dumbledore himself told Harry that he preferred Harry's happiness over the lives of Voldemorts potential Victims, like OP quoted.

and then he introduced him to the wizarding world, where he was practically messianic figure, only to force him to go back to the Dursleys every summer to be miserable again, until Dumbledore or his people rescued him, ensuring harry felt grateful to him, when if he had been doing his damn job, he would have seen to it that Harry never went back there again, at the very least, after first year when he definitely saw harry again.

he even admits he knew harry's childhood would be miserable there, and left him there anyway. it's also (one of many) a failing on the part of McGonagall. she knew they were unfit guardians as well, yet did nothing more than issue a feeble protest to Dumbledore when he placed Harry there.

he also didn't KNOW Harry would survive, he guessed he would, based off nothing more than supposition and hope.

How do you not know this? Its a pretty important part of the books.

Also he didn't bully the Dursley's into taking him, he just informed them that if they want Harry to survive he needs to live with them.

#+begin_quote
  “I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power. “But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore,underestimated --- to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.”

  “She doesn't love me,” said Harry at once. “She doesn't give a damn ---”

  “But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.”

  “I still don't ---”

  “While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.”

  “Wait,” said Harry. “Wait a moment.”

  He sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore. “You sent that Howler. You told her to remember --- it was your voice ---”

  “I thought,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, “that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you. I suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son.”

Firstly Quirrel wasn't harmed by the Bond of Blood charm, but by the protection of Lily's sacrifice,(those are not the same thing), secondly its purpose was to keep him safe from Voldemort when he wasn't at Hogwarts, considering that neither nor his followers ever attacked him in the Summer it seems to have succeeded. And about the Stone whtat else was Dumbeldore supposed to do, he already had it hidden at the second safrst place in the world and failed, Hogwarts was literally the only secure alternative he had, or do you think should have let it be stolen and allowed Voldemort to return early, not to mention that if Harry didn't fucked up and gone after the Stone Dumbledore would have defeated Voldemort in first year.

I personally think the origin of tropes is an interesting part of fandom history. For instance, where the "Draco in Leather Pants" trope originated, a trope which has spread so that the name is used outside the universe of Harry Potter, to a universal term used by fandom culture in general. The author of the Draco Trilogy (who wrote the most famous case of Draco wearing literal leather trousers) was one of the first authors to use fandom as a springboard into mainstream published writing, paving the way for fanfiction and and non-traditional e-publishing to become a legitimate and accepted form of art and commercial product.

Most just use it to make Dumbledore the bad guy and then use this as an way to explain why he acts the way he does. Instead of keeping the old cannon Dumbledore, they replace him with the guy who doesn't care about who is around him and only uses them as pawns. I've never seen someone use the trope good, but it could be done. The trope is common amongst OP Harry and Independent Harry fics as to say that "Dumbledore put blocks on my magical core and now, since theyre removed I can be the most powerful wizard evar."
