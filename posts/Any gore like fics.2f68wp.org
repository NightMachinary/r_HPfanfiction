  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley bought an ancient puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it. The entire Dursley family suffered the consequences. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second reign of terror, Harry Potter is convinced the only way to defeat the Dark Lord; is to call upon an even greater evil. This decided, Harry begins his plans to recreate the Lament Configuration... and to open it... again.

**** That was the idea. It was written before fanfiction.net had a 'crossover' indicator, or it probably would have been listed as such.

** You can inch close to the line, but fanfiction.net won't like anything too extreme. And I think Misery would cross the line. Human Centipede /definitely/ would. But most writers don't seem to be interested in pushing those boundaries.

I think the best approach is body horror, though. Please try my much reposted, I-should-have-a-macro-for-this-by-now recommendation:

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

  This fic is dark. Not silly-power-fantasy "dark," like the kids write nowadays. Really black. The world is not a friendly place, evil things happen to normal people for no reason -- or worse, cold, unfeeling reasons -- and everyone is screwed no matter what the hero does. Rape, abuse, and body horror are the bread and butter of this fic. And again, it is ultra-mature (almost more so than you'd think FFN would allow) but it is done professionally. King, Romero, or Craven would be fitting comparisons to Wordhammer's style, but also Hitchcock. Apparently, I want Wordhammer to have my creative fiction bab- OH GOD NO, THAT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA!!

  Original (and horrible) use of common canon spells, and also some new bio-magical stuff that just...ugh. You were warned, but also recommended.

  It is a thing that stands alone amongst all the sappy and crappy gray/dark Harry Azkaban shitfics. This story is dark, it is the exact opposite of a comfort fic, it does not have a happy ending, it does surprising and horrible things to the main character. It does have a sequel, which I have not gathered the courage to continue, but it stands alone just as well. And you'll be happy to finish it, because you know there isn't another chapter of the main character being tortured just a link away.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] has loads of gore and it is as close to King's writing as it gets with fanfiction in my opinion. It's a time travel fic where Harry is a PTSD nutjob trying to save the world from the hellish future.

** There's plenty of gore in 'Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness' and the sequel 'Sluagh.'

The bulk of it in DAYD is in the final battle, but Andy is very descriptive throughout the work. Very. For Sluagh, the bulk that i recall is about halfway through, but again, he's very very descriptive when something happens. If you haven't been acquainted with DAYD yet, it's a retelling of 7th year from Neville's point of view, what happened at Hogwarts when the trio was off. And it's brilliant. Definitely AU.
