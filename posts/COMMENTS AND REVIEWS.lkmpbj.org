I was wondering why people don't comment on stories they like. I've noticed for my story, that even though it gets a lot of kudos and bookmarks -not so many comments. And I don't know why ; I always leave a comment if I find a story I like enough to kudos or bookmark, because I know the author would like to hear thoughts from the reader. It is why we publish fanfiction, after all, is it not? Otherwise we would just write for ourselves. Again, I wouldn't wonder why I don't get that many comments if I would't get kudos and hits and all of that. I would just assume my story is bad. It gets a little frustrating when a week or two pass before uploads and then comments like "pls update" come up. And then I add new chapter and they don't comment on it, except to ask for another. And it's not just me, I noticed this trend with a lot of stories. Writing and editing takes up a lot of time, especially if you want your story to be good. And when we are talking 10k chapters, and people don't even comment a few words of it, it is a little disheartening. So I am asking you guys, the ones that give kudos and you truly like a story, why don't you comment? I am not trying to be confrontational, just genuinely curious. Thank you!


** Alot of peoplenarent comfortable with commenting think if they only leave a few words its rude bitntheyre not good at reviews or if they want to say a lot they'll come off as assholeish pointing out flaws or something. As long as you're getting kudos and bookmarks people enjoy it and aren't pointing out glaring mistakes or leaving highly critical and/or rude comments you're doing pretty well. Maybe say something in the authors notes saying how you love hearing form fans no matter what or something like that

**** A lot of people are likely to be uncomfortable giving criticism anyway, though, if they like the story and appreciate the author's effort. In fact, the more they like it, the less they'll want to come across as "that person who just turns up to complain".

There's also going to be a percentage of readers who come across your story when it's complete, or at least has a lot published, and are just too interested in continuing to the next chapter rather than stopping to comment :).

And then there's the fact that "please read and review" is fairly ordinary and therefore easy to overlook - yet there are in fact authors who are less open to criticism, and who respond badly. I was able to turn to a Discord server and get some actually useful feedback on [[https://archiveofourown.org/comments/379742895][this conversation]], but it's certainly a turn-off from commenting on strangers' work.

** I lurked as a reader on various archives for nearly 20 years before I started publishing my fics. In my case it was a matter of simply not realizing just how meaningful comments are to the authors. Since I started publishing 5 months ago, I've left more comments on fics than I have in the last 10 years at least. I personally understand now just how validating and motivating those comments really are.

To other lurkers: The more you comment, the easier it becomes! I'm especially fond of comments that quote a favorite line from the fic or point out just 1 thing specific that reader enjoyed, so that's what I try to do now when I comment. But even a quick "This is good, thanks for posting" means the world to us authors.

Normally people will just make a thread to open themselves up for reviewing and read your fic, no matter what fandom.

Some reviewers do have stipulations as to they will and won't read (some won't read underage sex or deathfics for example).

Most review threads happen on weekends when people have more time aswell

I don't think people realise how had it is to write and they joy we get when we see people's thoughts. I think it boils down to that.

** I only recently found this post by searching Ouroboros on a whim so sorry for the late reply and first things first hello dear author, I'm in love with your story and am so stoked that I've found you on reddit. Thank you for the masterpiece that is your story. It's the first ever self-cest that I've read and thank you for welconing me over to the dark side lol.

The main reason I don't review or comment much is that hasn't been mentioned in this thread yet is because of the nature of fanfiction itself for me personally, mainly that it's free. I love talking about things that I've read with people, pointing out characters and plot holes and things I don't like about the story itself when I spend money on it.

Fanfiction on the other hand, is free. I don't spend my money or support the author in any way. So writing reviews often makes me uncomfortable. Add to that English not being my first language and my terrible writing .I suck at writing even in my native language, so I prefer speaking because it gets the tone right-something I feel I always fail at when I write so I'm usually afraid that my comment, however well intentioned it is, might come across as off putting to the author when I try to honestly review their work- which they selflessly spend their time and effort and made available for free.

I haven't ever come across a story where I liked everything (that's why fanfictions exist in the first place) but another thing is that for me fanfiction is meant to be fun, a hobby so I'm cautious about telling the author I think their OC is a dick or that the story is dragging or I don't agree with their characterisation, or I would have preferred it if they wrote more about a plot point I feel they rushed, and no I don't think most 11 year olds behave or speak like that, the story is getting too convoluted with all the sub plots and the hundreds of characters that I'm having trouble keeping up etc. , something I won't mind talking about if it were a published work I bought.

So basically I rarely reviews because for me it's a self indulgence for the author which they've gennerously shared for free, so with my limited English and lack of writing skills I would feel like an asshole if the author was affected because of something insensitive I wrote because I didn't get the tone right or wrote something that could be misinterpreted, even if my intention was to praise the story to heaven and back I honestly feel it would be better to just lurk and be safe than sorry.

*** Oh I am so happy you like Ouroboros! Your reasons are completely valid, of course! But if I may suggest, I hope you don't mind, what you said in your first paragraph is a lovely comment. You could leave something like that for any author whose story you enjoy and it would make them very happy. Even a ❤ or a "i like this!" Is enough for most authors to enjoy. Like you said, we write for free. We don't make money or any profit. So us authors only get comments as "payment" so to speak. Kudos/likes too, but the comments are the moat valuable. Anyway, thank you for your answer and btw, your english is great! I am not a native speaker either, but I understood you just fine!

** To be honest, before I started writing I almost never left reviews. Now, I try to always tell an author if I enjoyed their story.

As for why, when I think back, I honestly didn't really think much of the author; I wasn't a very dedicated fanfiction reader (never made an FFN account until I published my first fic), and I'd only read maybe 2-3 stories per month.

I think that it is like another commenter said, that readers just aren't aware of how much work goes into writing our fics. The favs and follows (I use FFN, not AO3) make a lot of sense if you think of your readers strictly as consumers. They're not really invested in the process, not interested in how/why you go about writing it, they just want to read it. That's flattering, although I agree with you it isn't as satisfying as actually reading someone's review telling you that they enjoy your work!

Truthfully, making my own discord channel was the best decision I ever made RE: fanfiction. Even though only about 5-10% of my readers joined, it still helps me out so much to be able to have conversations with them, offer them sneak peeks, talk about my plots, and get instant feedback. Idk what your numbers are like (I didn't create a discord until I had over 1,000 fav/follows on my first story), but it may be worth considering for you!

** Commenting is really difficult for me because of anxiety and some toxic expierences I made in the past. On most days it is pretty much impossible. And I know a few other people with similar problems. I do want to comment and I often feel bad about reading a story without leaving any review at all, but I found that trying to force myself or stressing about it just makes it worse. I love the kudo function on ao3, because it gives me the chance to show my appreciation at least a little bit. It's great for the quieter and shyer readers!

** I normally try to leave reviews on stories I've read. But sometimes I tend to spread the reviews out. Especially if I don't have much to say outside of "I like this, please write more." Which I personally feel is counterproductive over time.

So, I tend to leave a review when I really have something to say, when it's a work in process. Or, if it's a completed work, I will leave a review at the final chapter, thanking the author for writing it, what I liked about it, etc.

I found that I got more reviews on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] than I did on archiveofourown. I did get a lot more kudos and bookmarks on my work, though. I always assumed that people were waiting for the fic to be done before they commented on it. I found on A03 that people were more receptive to a story that was completed than the ones that were being updated every now and then.

But I think it depends on the fandom as well. I participated in a very small fandom that wasn't Harry Potter and I got a lot of reviews on my fics as I was uploading them.

*** Oh, yes! The completed story stuff! You're right! A lot wait to see it finished. In that case, I hope I get a few hundred comments on my last chapter 😄

** you should write something really badly and argue with the readers... if I remember correctly My Immortal had tens of thousands of reviews.

** I tend to believe that it means my story didn't connect with them enough for them to leave a review. Basically, that they didn't like it enough or that my characters didn't inspire them enough emotionally. To me, review/fav ratios are an indicator of a reader's engagement with the fic. A low ratio means that the story doesn't connect with readers for whatever reason, and many readers couldn't even be bothered to leave an in-depth comment. So I find that it's a form of criticism in itself.
