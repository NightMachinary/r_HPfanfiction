** It's sort of a grim idea, but I think it's actually pretty nice. Authors dying mid-story /has/ happened, and many artists (me included) would much rather their last work be completed if they ever die than to have it hang around unfinished, forever tainted by their unfinished-ness being a testament to the tragedy, never mind that it may have been a light-hearted comedy.

*** This, and it's nice to be able to know that somebody can get to your account if necessary (what if somebody finds typos!?). Of all the things that I expected to see Ao3 get lambasted for, their fannish next of kin policy was not one of them.

Like, hell, it's just giving people an /option/, you know? Ao3 isn't going out and asking you to eat a baby to seal the deal or something.

**** Of all the things I was expected to get torn up at, this wasn't one of them, either. I can just see this FNoK getting abused by people in so many ways, and it's horrible to think that people would do something like that when somebody else dies? Do I know it happens? Yes, of course I do. But that doesn't make the idea any sweeter.

And yes, I did take a look at their FAQ on it, but that didn't really offer me any solace on the problems I have with it.

***** That doesn't make sense. Do you think just anyone can become the new author? That a bunch of random people will have access to your stories should you die? As the link you posted specifically states, you have to choose the person that you want to be able to do these things.

There's absolutely no problem here. It's /good/, if anything.

***** How is it going to get abused? You /appoint/ a fannish next of kin, and both of you have to tell Ao3. It can't get abused more easily than giving a friend your passwords in case of your death, but has the added benefit of making that transfer contingent on your actual death rather have it occur earlier.

*** [[https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/2366][Here it is]]. Apparently it was inspired by an author on LiveJournal dying in 2007, so maybe I just haven't had the chance to see it until now. But yeah, it is pretty horrible.

******* Well, what I was trying to say, that they pretend that everyday things that happen (deaths, people getting hurt, theft, etc.) do not actually happen, hence the illusion.

And to break that illusion is a crime to them because it forces them to see the "harsh" reality we live in.

****** Actually, no. It's horrible to me because of several reasons, none of which are the “perfect illusion” as you claim.

It's horrible to me because if something happens to an author, I can see the FNoK breaking the trust of the author. Like maybe the author only told them to write notes on their stories if they died, and the FNoK decides to continue it on anyways. Or maybe the author only wanted the FNoK to continue their stories, and instead they put them up for adoption as soon as it happens.

It's also horrible for me because I see this as a way for authors to continue on others' stories if they die, even if they aren't FNoK. Can they just claim that the author was going to make them it? Provide a photoshopped email? Or maybe they won't even claim they're FNoK, but thanks to this they think that they can take over the author's work anyways?

And I guess it's also a little horrible to me because the anniversary of someone close to me dying occurred recently. Fine, sue me for being human. But most of the reason as to why I'm upset is in the two paragraphs above.

Pretty sure, they'd have to have been 'flaged' by the real author for them to be FNoK (I don't know much about FNoK, so don't take it as a fact)

******* There's nothing stopping someone from claiming a dead author wanted them to continue the story either way. Even on FFN, it can be done. Someone could easily photoshop a conversation, or even use Inspect Element to edit a conversation and make it look like the author gave them permission to continue the story. So your fears aren't necessary. They're a little silly.

********* That has literally nothing to do with the matter at hand. If anything, it just shows how ridiculous your concern is. Yes, we had a plagiarizer on FFN. I'm aware, as one of my stories were taken.

But that's exactly the point. This FNoK thing doesn't suddenly allow people to plagiarize or whatever. People do it anyway. So there's no reason to have a problem with FNoK. It doesn't give bad people a tool to use. They can lie and plagiarize either way.

Seems like you didn't bother reading what it was actually about, and came here immediately instead to complain about it. It's a good feature, and the only way it could possibly be abused is if you picked an untrustworthy person to be your FNoK.

****** You know that you can communicate about these things, right? All that fannish next-of-kin does is make it possible for your FNOK to get access to your account if you die, assuming that both of you informed AO3 that the other person was your FNOK.

Maybe you want that person to finish your stories, maybe you want that person to be able to fix typos, it's all up to you. It's exactly the same as just giving somebody your pw, except that the exchange only happens upon your death so you don't have to change your pw if you change your mind, and your FNOK doesn't have to worry about keeping it safe and hidden in the interim.

All this does is give people more options.

I was just explaining my thought process when I wrote that comment. But I'm pretty sure my comment does say that if it was for that then I'd be okay with it?

And someone close to me died recently so I'm sorta in a mood about death? Sorry about that.
