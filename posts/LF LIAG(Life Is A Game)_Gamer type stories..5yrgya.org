I'm looking for decently written stories where someone's life is turned into a game. I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Game][*Harry Potter and the Game*]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/The-Adventures-Of-Harry-Potter-the-Video-Game-Exploited][*Adventures of Harry Potter: Video Game Exploited*]] but I'm having trouble finding any others that are decent enough to read. Most of the ones I'm finding are either failed attempts at copying one of the two fics I mentioned earlier or 2-5 chapter long origin stories that fizzle out almost as soon as the writing finishes. I don't have any real parameters. I'll take anything I get so long as it is readable.

--------------

P.S. In case anyone wants to recommend it, I just wanted to say that I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12004695/1/Harry-Potter-Potter-Verse][*Harry Potter: Potter Verse*]] too. The writing was half-decent in the first 3 chapters, despite it not managing to avoid the 'lengthy boring instructions' cliches like Harry Potter and the Game had, but it soon gave way into 11 year olds fucking and quality degradations of crippling proportions. Not really interested in that.

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter. Add in one mad genius bent on destroying the lives of ten thousand people by trapping them inside of his online virtual reality game and you have the makings of a very dangerous brew. HP/HG
