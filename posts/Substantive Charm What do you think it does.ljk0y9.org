From OotP, Chapter 31:

#+begin_quote
  Meanwhile Ron was reading two years of Charms notes with his fingers in his years, his lips moving soundlessly; *Seamus was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm, while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5*; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practicing basic locomotion charms, were making their pencil cases race each other around the edge of the table.
#+end_quote

Any ideas as to what it might do? I've got one, and it's relevant to the Snape vs McGonagall duel in DH.

From DH, Chapter

#+begin_quote
  Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that *McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers*; Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armour in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another into its breast -
#+end_quote

I think McGonagall used the charm to shape the smoke into daggers, and then transfigured them.

Or I could be wrong, and she used just transfiguration, or maybe some other charm.

What do you think?


** Sounds to me like it's a charm to make light objects denser and heavier

** From context, it might not be an actual spell, but a category of them. It sounds kinda weird semantically if it's a spell - imagine if it'd said 'reciting the definition of a Blasting Curse'. Technically correct, but sounds a little odd. Could be reciting the definition of a type of Charm, which seems to fit a little more with the name - substantive means either firmly based in reality or existing independently, which sounds like it could be a category of charms to me (since a lot of Charms are modified by other things - protego maxima, Locomotor morbis/wibbly, etc - being unable to attach modifications or other spells to them would be important to keep track of).

If it is an actual spell, then with Rowling's pattern of 'pseudo-grammar' for spells, I'd say it probably 'gives substance' to something or makes it more substantial. So, it might take something incorporeal like a gas and corporealise it into a solid (ie. the smoke to knives), or it might take something weak and strengthen it (eg. you cast it on a cracking support pillar to make it more substantial so it'll hold longer).

If it doesn't match Rowling's grammar and is an actual definition directly, then (as I said above) 'substantive' either means having a basis in reality or existing independently. So, could be a charm along either of those lines (maybe changing one thing in reality to another? - not sure about the independent thing though, unless it's breaking a connection or creating something that operates on its own?)

** It means “standing in place of...” in Latin, that's all I got.
