As far as I can remember, this fanfic came out over 10 years ago, I definitely remember reading it in 2004 or 2005. From what I can vaguely recall, Harry and Hermione were together, and Ron and Luna might've been together, but they weren't the focus. Also, as far as I can remember, Cho Chang tried to kill Hermione with Avada Kedavra, but failed due to not casting with the right emotion, and Harry destroyed all the Death Eaters with light. This was a long, long time ago and I'm mostly trying to find it for nostalgia value. Help?


** To be honest, if it's a Harmony fic, try looking on Portkey.
