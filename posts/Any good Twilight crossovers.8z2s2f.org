Preferably no slash other than that just any good fics you'd recommend. Chrysochlorous is the only good one that I've come across so far.


** im enjoying linkffn(12777708), but its very heavy on the angsty woe-is-me harry, which i can see putting people off. as a positive its being actively updated, though.

theres also linkffn(8750155). leah imprints on harry. its not as well written as chrysochlorous but its fairly light hearted and amusing

  Harry Potter has just defeated Lord Voldemort as the Battle of Hogwarts draws to a close. Or so he thought. Suddenly needing to run, Harry ends up somewhere he could never have imagined: a Muggle hospital in America. When he finds himself in the care of a mysterious Dr Cullen, things start to go wrong. As innocent lives are put at stake, who comes out with their secrets intact?

  The Volturi ran off with their tails between their legs, but a gathering that large of supernatural creatures attracted attention from the magical world. The magical world is still rebuilding from Voldemort so Harry gets sent. He finds trouble quickly with vampires - and an infatuated shape shifter.

** Interestingly enough, that's my next project planned! I was afraid no one would want to read it because Twilight is a dying fandom. But most of them are pretty terrible: either Bella is actually Bella Potter or everyone escapes the Wizarding World after the second war. Those last ones are usually Harry/Edward slash fics.

Anywho. I'll look around for you!

*** I'll probably read it if it isn't Slash or Bella isn't suddenly a Potter/Malfoy/Black ect in hiding. Seriously.

**** Or Harry getting pregnant, or finding a soulmate. Or cowering in fear of the Volturi.
