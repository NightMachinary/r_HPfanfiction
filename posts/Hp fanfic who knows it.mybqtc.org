:END:
Im looking for a story that I've read a long time ago. It's about harry being a mage that gets unlocked during the story. He can sense powers in others to. In order to protect him he takes the looks of an earlier mage. I think that mage was called Darius and he was from the times of Atlantis.

Voldemort has undergone rituals in order to get close to the powers of a mage.

I remember a different scene. Harry is at the burrow he talks about finding his love, but that person isnt born yet. Ginny overhears that and is sad. She also unlocks some kind of empath powers then.

I really hope someone knows this story and can tell me the title.


** /The Awakening of a Magus./ It's been removed years ago (with a rewrite [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/301335/the-dreamer4][promised]]), but there are still some copies online (I saved one as well; just reread it a week ago).
