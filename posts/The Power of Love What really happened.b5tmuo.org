I doubt that Lily Potter was the only person to have willingly use herself as a shield, even when given the choice to back down. Although the magical population is eclipsed by the non-magical, the odds are still... slim for it to be the case.

Personally, I think that Lily (and maybe James, too) did something else to protect their child. Both were exceptionally bright individuals, and James did come from a significant Wizarding family. For love to just /happen/ to create a form of protection for Harry is... iffy, even for the setting. A lot of fanfics postulate that maybe a ritual (powered by love?) was the basis of the protection.

What do you think? Should the love protection simply be that -- love? Or was it something else; /should/ it be something else?


** I think that Lily differently from other mothers had a choice, Voldemort offered to let her go if she stepped aside and he would have probably kept his word had she done so. The other mothers didn't have the same choice, Voldemort would have killed them all the same. Of course this doesn't explain how Harry managed to obtain the same effect at the end of DH, Voldemort would have killed him regardless, although one could argue that he could have run but didn't.

*** Maybe it was because Voldemort foolishly framed it as a "sacrifice yourself to save them" thing to get Harry to give himself up? So if Harry had just killed Harry in battle, it wouldn't have worked, but since Voldemort himself said he just wanted to kill Harry, magic made that true.

And? Dumbledore /recognized/ the protection after the fact, and so did Voldemort eventually ("it was old magic, something I should have foreseen", he says). It is fully canon that it happened before --- long ago, but it did, and enough time that the phenomenon is known to magical scholars, though not yet well-understood.

** I like the theory in linkffn(Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy by ForestUUID) that baby Tom Riddle's mother died for him too, and he had the mother's-love protection. It kept him safe in the Blitz, and kept him alive despite all the freaky dark arts malarkey he did to himself in pursuit of his power.

Turning his wand on a defenceless toddler was simply the final act by which his mother ceased to recognise him, and deprived of the protection keeping him alive he simply popped like a balloon.

Blitz was September 1940 to May 1941. Tom Riddle would have missed the entire thing, since that period falls within Hogwarts' school year (and one assumes he stays at Hogwarts over the Christmas period).

** One of my major head canons is that Lily, perhaps under Dumbledore's guidance, created a sacrificial ritual based on blood magic that ultimately blew up Voldemort's body. I refused to believe that her scenario had never happened before. For example, a jealous or crazed wizard might think that the child was not his, so decided to kill the baby while offering his wife another chance. Lily had to have done something that was unique, and performing a complex sacrificial ritual would reinforce her reputation as a powerful and intelligent witch.

JKR acolytes can tow her official line all they want, but I find her constant promotion of ‚Äúpassive sacrifices‚Äù very off putting. In her world, good guys can't be calculating, cunning, proactive, and ruthless. They must not show political acumen, strategic brilliance, and tactical common sense. They are only allowed to react to whatever those sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums throw at them, and take the shit in passive sacrifices.

Fuck that!

*** I think you make some good points, however, I also think that it could really have been possible that she, indeed, was the first one to do so. Be that as it may, it is a rather unlikely and uncommon scenario to kill someone (especially a child) with the knowledge of the mother and then asking her first if she wants do die or not. I think it is much more likely that either both are killed without the optional question or that only the child is killed and the mother is not even asked. What reason would they have to ask anyway? Wouldn't anybody be, well, /not/ be in favour of such a horrendous deed?

However, if that was not the first time it has happened (which is not only possible but also very likely) it does not mean that a lot of people know about it. Just imagine: someone (unimportant, or at least not as important as Voldemort) goes around, wanting to kill a child, giving the mother the option to live, which she refuses. The endresult would be mother and said someone dying without anybody knowing that the original intention was to kill the child, thereby protecting it. Why would anybody know what happened? Nobody really would, and even the people that were aware of the plan, I bet they would not go around blazing abroad what the real intention was. Therefore, yes, it could have happened. But that does not mean that sacrificial protection it is well known or common.

** My canon thoughts on this are, that voldemort gave her the possibility to live because of Snape asking for it and lily refused. As voldemort probably never let anyone else this choice, this could be the key to the protection. She gave her life willingly, even though she could have lived.

** I think you're probably correct that Lily isn't the only person who willingly gave their life for someone without fighting even when given a chance to back down. I expect in the other cases, the same protection happened, and we just don't hear about it because they were much less notable circumstances than kill the Dark Lord who was threatening the whole country. I'll also note that exactly this mechanic is how Harry's sacrifice kept Voldemort's spells from working permanently on the defenders of Hogwarts. It's a pretty overpowered thing, sure, but Dumbledore did say that love is the strongest kind of magic. (There's also precedent for this in the Messianic Archetype it's clearly playing into. Jesus is said to have died for the sins of all of humanity; compared to that, the defenders of Hogwarts aren't very many people to protect, let alone one child.)

** IMO it's a scenario where the intent and wording is key. Think of Lily's actions when Voldy breaks into the nursery, she puts herself between them and offers herself as a sacrifice even going as far as to say "Take me instead". That IMO is the key bit that people forget that the magic at it's base is about intent. Her true willingness to die if it meant her kid's survival.

This leads me to think of certain scenarios mainly that Lily's intent to protect Harry leaches off of his magic for enough power to block/redirect the curse (I use redirect because of the state of the room in Snape's memories from DH) This is possible because Lily's intent to protect him (out of love) is stronger than Voldy's desire to kill him.

*** Canonically: because unlike Lily, Voldemort was /always/ going to kill James whatever happened. Lily's sacrifice was a true sacrifice, born of her free will, only because Voldemort gave her a chance to stand aside and live (which he did because Snape had asked him to).

*** It may well have done. Ritual magic is all about the symbolism and the ceremony, a last-ditch defender fighting heedless of any hope of survival is a powerful symbol. Follow that up with a mother thrice refusing to stand aside and Voldemort is unwittingly playing his part in the rite. That there's a pre-existing threefold denial only added to the effect.

The Potters couldn't have known, but Voldemort was also a lord forsworn to his liegeman: that would have weakened him still further.

A powerful rite, a mystically-weakened attacker, an astrologically-significant date, and a rune of victory on the head of the child. Plus whatever the Potters did to tie all of this together and give it magical force? Voldemort casting that killing curse was equivalent to donning a pointy copper hat and yelling "All Gods are Bastards!". In a thunderstorm.

** I can't accept your logic on this. You think the sequence of events surrounding that night have happened before? Lily didn't just die, Harry wasn't just another casualty. Voldemort was intending to commit cold blooded murder of a baby. Young and pure where Voldemort was neither. We know there is significance to the soul, we see it. We know there is power in action, virtue, and sacrifice. We see that.

What happened that night was exceptional in many ways, but I don't think it was unbelievable to wizards. It's not like people are going around talking about how Harry is "the boy who lived" in a sarcastic way. They accept it, and they understand the circumstances better than we do.

** I would like to believe that it was a one time incident, a miracle during the most deepest and darkest moments, if you could call it.

It's a miracle because it defies all the logic. If you can replicate it by some arcane ritual or by some set of rules, then it's no longer a miracle.

That's why Harry sacrifically protecting his friends during the battle of Hogwarts in DH, based on same reasoning isn't a good idea on part of JKR.

Yes, the same could have happened very well with James. Instead of mother's love, the miracle could have been based on ultimate sacrifice. Logically they might mean the same thing. Sacrificial protection. But emotionally, they are as different as heaven and hell.

But remember, it should be treated as miracle. Not /"if the conditions are fulfilled, this result is bound to occur"/ thing.

*** It's funny because the fact that it lacks logic takes away from the sacrifice for me. Harry purposely walking into the forest means something because he consciously, knowingly and logically is willing to sacrifice himself for everyone else.

Lily in no way thinks her dying will save Harry therefore it isn't a sacrifice...she is heartbroken and desperate for sure but she doesn't know she is saving her son by refusing Voldy's offer.
