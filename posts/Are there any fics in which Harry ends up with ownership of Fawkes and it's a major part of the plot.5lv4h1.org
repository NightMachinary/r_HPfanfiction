**** They usually use the premise that fawkes was only with albus until harry arrived at school and then he follows harry around. And for the majority of those stories, he is only there for rule of cool.

** With Strength of Steel Wings linkffn(9036071) involves a bond between Harry and Fawkes though saying ownership will not be correct. It is an interesting (and very long) fic and hasn't been updated for some time. Still would recommend for the detailed runic magic system

** It's old and considered clich√©d but linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern) covers the transition of Fawkes from Dumbledore to Harry. But it is only a minor part of the story.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** Pretty sure that is a big plot point in [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3386][Secrets]] by Vorabiza. Although I am a Drarry shipper, I personally didn't like this fic. It comes highly recommended by many people though so many you'd like it.

**** I don't really recall the smut but it's rated M so I figure that's for a reason. If you usually avoid slash, I really wouldn't recommend this. I LOVE slash fics, but this one just isn't great (even though it's highly praised in the fandom). It's really long too and for me was a slog at the end.

If you're just interested in Phoenix fics more generally (rather than fawkes specifically) I really liked [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380][Cartographers Craft]] . Harry hatches a Phoenix egg in that fic and has it as a pet/familiar to help in the horcrux hunt.

***** I enjoyed it, but just skimmed over the smut. It really wasn't great romance wise, but I liked the way things played out in this story better than the real seventh book as far as the ending of the war. There are times you have to suspend your disbelief, at times things fall together a little too neatly considering the characters baggage. Give it a try, you might like it.
