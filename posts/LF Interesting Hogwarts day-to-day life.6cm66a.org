I just finished reading "Applied Cultural Anthropology" and I really enjoyed to read about Hermione's life at Hogwarts and at home. The children were children, the teachers competent, and the lessons and character interactions interesting. Do you know any similar stories? Where the plot doesn't only revolve around the end of the year adventure, but where the rest of the year (lessons, subplots about friendship/enmity/research etc.) is also reasonably interesting and well written?

I don't care who the main character is, or which house they are sorted into.

Thanks!

*** The Alexand/ra/ Quick series by Inverarity doesn't take place at Hogwarts, but it does take place at a school that's highly similar to Hogwarts (perhaps a touch of Durmstrang; not more or fewer regulations than Hogwarts, but different values and precautions), and has everything else you asked for.

** [[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focus on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year complete, but theoretically there is a new version planned. With theoretically being the key word here.

Original Description:

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505][Wit of the Raven]] - Heavily AU fic, with an interesting alternative system of magic and more meritocratic Hogwarts. Strong focus on school life and especially school competitions. Dead.

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5461818][Hogwarts 1835]], which for me is how inter-house relations in fics should look. Probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6909029][Hogwarts 1940]] is a similar case as well, being by the same author. But I haven't read it yet.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

  The school stood long before the boy with the unusual scar arrived. Each year new students enter, and old leave. 1835 featured its own triumphs and tragedies as students in the houses contend with each other for recognition as the best house at Hogwarts.

  The war in Europe and a trainload of muggle children, sent as evacuees to the safety of Hogsmeade, receive more attention in the village than events in the wizards' school. Familiar names wear younger faces. Acts of kindness bring their own punishment.

** The Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom linkffn(8417562) has surprisingly a lot of nicely written fluff, especially the first book. That was my impression of it anyway. Absolutely fantastic characterization. Extremely well planned plot.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.
