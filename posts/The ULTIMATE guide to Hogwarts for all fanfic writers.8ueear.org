  It's a multi-part essay, nine years in the making as at 2014 and still not entirely complete, examinng the layout of the castle grounds, of Hogsmeade, the Forbidden Forest etc. as they appear in the books rather than the films, culminating in maps which are compatible with every canon reference which mentions what is visible from where, how long it takes to get from A to B etc..

Bellow are links a select (most important in my opinion) number of articles and maps found on the website. On each map all major locations are annotated! There are essays detailing the evidence which determined the location of things on each map:

1) [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts/grounds_map.htm][Map of Hogwarts]]

2) [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts/grounds_map.htm][Map of school grounds]]

3) [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts/Hogsmeade_map.htm][Map of Hogsmeade - include a description of what you would encounter as you walked from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade.]]

4) [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts/forest_map.htm][Map of Forbidden Forest]]

5) [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts/location.htm#map][Map showing the route taken by the express from King Cross to a possible location off Hogwarts]]

6) [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/map_of_Hogwarts/forest.htm#flora][Flora in the Fobidden Forest]]

8) [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][What we know or can deduce about the number of students attending Hogwarts, and the size of the wizarding population in general.]]

9) [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/birthdates.htm][An examination of what we know or can deduce about the dates of birth of various Potterverse characters]]


** I am so excited to see this site getting attention that I'm basically just going to copy my comment from the post on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]]

I have been ALL over this site for years and years, it is SO invaluable to fanfiction writers

Claire Jordan, who created it, is an inexhaustible source of Potter resources. She also had a Yahoo group about HP discussions and wrote for HP Lexicon at some point.

I have been working on a series of Snape-centric fanfiction for the better part of a decade (abandoned for a while and also partially rewritten but actively posting now) and I have received many, many compliments on my believable, sympathetic, but still in-character Snape and I owe SO MUCH of it to Claire's fantastic character essays on him.

There are two on that site, "Reserved!Snape: Fanon or Canon" and "But Snape is Just Nasty, Right?" And I implore ANYONE, whether a lifelong Snape-basher or his biggest fan, to give them a read.

Anyway, /fangirling

**** Sure! It's a long trilogy (over 1 million words so far) and is Parent!Snape/Mentor!Snape with an OC so that's not everyone's cup of tea, but I do get a lot of feedback that my Snape is very realistic, and I think it's largely from those essays.

The entire trilogy is on FFN Linkffn(Always in your shadow by Arinus)

But I am also currently cross-posting to ao3 Linkao3(always in your shadow by Arinus)

#+begin_quote
  After the Dark Lord's fall in 1981, more than one child was lost in the spoils of war. Six-year-old Calista, the daughter of the Dark Lord's most infamous and fanatical follower, Bellatrix Lestrange, has been left in an orphanage by her mother's cousin Sirius Black, following her rescue from a mother that only wanted to twist her to the Dark Lord's purpose. The staff at the orphanage consider her both a lost cause and a Squib, but it may take a forgotten, rejected man to save a forgotten, rejected child. For his part, Severus Snape has enough to regret without dwelling on his brief, haunting affair with the Dark Lord's most quixotic servant; but he decides to see, in the aftermath of her arrest, if he can locate her missing daughter. Instead of answers, he finds a haunted, irrevocably damaged child with his eyes and his ghosts, and he knows at once that he cannot leave her where she is. Above all, a realistic Snape's daughter story, as well as an honest depiction of recovery and PTSD, and an in-depth exploration of the mental arts of Legilimency and Occlumency.

***** Oh, this honestly sounds fascinating, and I could really use a long fic right now. Thank you, and as someone drafting a story involving Snape, thanks a million (again) for sharing those thought-provoking essays.

******* I hope so, too; depends on how happy I am with the result. I can let you know, but it is (very mild) slash, and an unpopular (or at least, uncommon) pairing, which I know isn't well-received around here.

******** Well for me personally as long as Snape is believable but also at least somewhat sympathetic, the genre/pairing is not very important :)
