I just need to read about Sirius alive and having a chance to fight Voldemort together with Harry. Any recomendations?


** Yes! This one! It's the best.

  Post-OotP Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. Rebuilding his life with a war brewing in their world isn't simple. It's a good thing he has a family to fall back on this time. What he didn't realize was that good things don't last too long. Not for him anyway. Semi canon-compliant. No Slash/bashing.

Sirius escapes Azkaban years earlier than in canon and rescues Harry from the Dursleys. The Veil makes a later appearance in the story.

*** I have tried this a while back but i really couldn't get over the ooc-ness of the characters. Does it get better later on?

**** I didn't think that they were too much out of character. Harry is way younger and Sirius is different because he has to take care of Harry, and Draco is obviously different with Hydrus taking his place, but apart from that I hadn't really noticed much ooc-ness.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
