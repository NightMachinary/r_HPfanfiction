Read this story just a while back. It goes something like a family of Potters in another dimension where the war hasn't ended is attacked and Harry asks a genie to help them. They reappear in another dimension where the war has ended. The newly arrived Potters are manipulative and try to do everything they can to take old Harry's place. It was a Harry/Hermione story posted on fanfiction. Thanks!
