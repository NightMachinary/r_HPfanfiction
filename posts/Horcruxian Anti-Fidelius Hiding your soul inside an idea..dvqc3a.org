The Fidelius; a complex magic that allows an intangible concept, a secret, to be wrapped in magic and (in a sense) corporealised, so that it might be treated like a material object, hidden away and given only to those trusted few.

The Horcrux; a dark magic that shatters the soul and forces a fragment of it into corporeal existence, binding it to a physical anchor so that its owner becomes immune to death, not leaving the world when their physical body is slain.

Both magicks are truly ancient, dating back more than 25 centuries. Both magicks deal with immaterial things, forcing them into physical forms. And both include concepts that can be combined into a more diabolical whole than you have ever imagined.

What would be the ideal object to turn into a Horcrux, to ensue it remains intact? A priceless artifact that no-one would dare destroy? An autonomous weapon to defend itself against its would-be destroyers? An impossibly-hard stone buried beneath the ground, or perhaps launched into space?

Herpo the Foul, the legendary dark wizard of Ancient Greece, did not create his Horcrux out of anything so mundane. He was a student of the immaterial, expert on all that affects the unreal, and he did the unthinkable.\\
He worked a charm to take an idea, the strongest concept he could claim to control, and much like the Fidelius would, he wove magic to bind his concept into a material form, one that could be hidden, destroyed, altered...or turned into a Horcrux.

That concept, which Herpo claimed rulership over, was 'snakes'.

** 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
Herpo's charm to corporealise the notion of 'snakes' was short-lived, but it served its purpose.\\
The shard of the dark wizard's soul was hidden inside the very concept of snakes; as long as even one serpent slithered the earth, he would remain, immortal, unkillable.

Where is Herpo now? He has not been seen, but all snakes everywhere still hold the fragment of his soul.\\
Witches and wizards know not to keep snakes, or grow too fond of them, even if they don't know why.\\
Because like Tom Riddle's diary, if you pour your heart out to a snake, then Herpo the Foul might start pouring some of himself into you. If you find yourself talking to your snake, and the snake talks back, it's already too late.

Even centuries after his mortal lifespan, Herpo has ensnared countless magical beings this way, innocents whose only crime was to have too close a rapport with snakes.\\
Using these victims, Herpo has returned himself to physical life, flesh, blood and bone, time and again over the centuries, using many names and many faces, pursuing his twisted goals and fathering more than a few bastard sons and daughters along the way. It's possible that all Parselmouths are descended from Herpo's 'conquests'.\\
No matter how many times he's destroyed, as long as serpents exist, Herpo will return.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-2
   :END:
So, what of Harry Potter?\\
It is already too late for Voldemort; Herpo sensed his hunger for power at a young age and spoke to him through his snakes, slowly twisting him from a child into a monster.\\
But neither Harry Potter nor his classmates have no idea that the innocent serpent was twisted into a corrupting danger centuries ago; his serpentine familiar, plucked from the gardens near Privet Drive, is nothing but kind and a good listener, nary a hint of diabolical intentions to be seen...not even when his classmates start understanding snake-speak too and start going around in odd dazes...

*** The closest I've seen (spoilers) was VD hiding the knowledge of TMR and VD being the same person into a Fidelius secret. So, for instance, Dumbledore knew Tom Riddle, knew that Tom "left" to go "explore" the magical world, knew that Lord Voldemort returned, etc --- but almost literally for the life of him couldn't put 2 and 2 together and discover that the TMR that left was the same VD that returned later. I think the fidelius was tied to the diary too.

But I always wondered about this. I found it weird that people were scared to say Voldemort, but didn't call him Tom? Surely Dumbledore and others would have pushed the agenda of not respecting him enough to even call him Voldemort. Also no bloody way would he be have been able to taboo that name.

[[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/54174/why-was-tom-riddles-trophy-at-hogwarts-never-removed][His trophy]] was sitting at Hogwarts with noone batting an eye. Hagrid got imprisoned as a scapegoat for the Myrtle incident and got dragged into it again 50 years later because TMR was still regarded as a model student and the case was never reopened.

Regarding Dumbledore's motivations, I'm not really that sure. Perhaps he thought that sharing VD's entire life story would potentially aggravate VD enough to make VD retaliate in some mass-scale terror act, or that if he publicly disclosed just how much he knew about VD's background, VD could grow suspicious about the obscurity and safety of his souljars.

Literally all you'd need to do is copy about a 1000 fliers that say VD is Tom Riddle, a half blood and chuck them around Diagon and hogsmede. Boom, job done.

** The only problem with this is the fact that you would never find a snake in the middle of residential Surrey. There are three types of snake in the UK, and we can immediately rule out the Smooth snake because they are only present on the southern shores. The Adder lives in the countryside, usually on the edge of forests, and doesn't stray very far. The Grass snake lives in fields near water, and its only defence mechanism is playing dead, so it definitely would not move into a residential area where there are lots of animals that can be considered predators.

/So many/ stories fall into this trap, and it's annoying to read.

Anyway, rant over. The idea is actually really cool, and I'd love to read it, if it's done well. It's always interesting to add new villains in, even more evil than Voldemort.

****** I was talking about prevalence too. England was ground zero of the Industrial Revolution and it shows in its biodiversity. Many species were lost or their ranges decimated. Surrey has been inhabited heavily by humans for centuries. They literally built the second Globe Theatre there.

I'm not saying it's impossible. There are literally leopards prowling the streets of inner-city Mumbai. But it's just a lot more unlikely in Surrey than it would be in, say, Adelaide (speaking from experience seeing a brown snake in my cousin's back yard once).

Only one species of British snake is deadly, the adder. And it's barely deadly to adults. Nobody has died of an adder bite in the UK since 1975.

Harry interrupted his gloating by figuring out that the Dark Mark that each Death Eater had was one of the 823,543 Horcruxes, though.

Not really the same thing, except for dealing with a ridiculous number of horcruxes.

*** Personally, what I'm imagining at the moment is that in order to destroy the serpent Horcrux, the protagonist (presumably Harry) needs to cast the corporealising spell to force the concept of 'snake' to materialise, much like Herpo did, so that the Horcrux is physically present to destroy.\\
But, in order to do that, he'd first need to establish dominance over the concept of serpents (again, like Herpo did), by learning the magicks that make use of snakes, and learning to command and/or destroy the various magical serpents from runespoors to basilisks, whilst at the same time avoiding falling for Herpo's own enchantments.

But what you really want is something so completely ordinary that no one will ever look twice at it. Perhaps a pebble, which is then thrown into the ocean.

** Harry Potter has also had some very special circumstances influencing him. It could be possible that you can shoehorn him into the concept of sacrifice, considering that his parents sacrificed themselves so that he could live only for him to be subjugated to emotional and - at least a little - physical abuse (which can be thought of as a sacrifice in its own way) until he went to school where he sacrificed himself to save it against Voldemort many many times (most notably dying with the express purpose to save everybody else).

This could serve as a very legitimate way to give the good guys a boost in a fic focused on the future.
