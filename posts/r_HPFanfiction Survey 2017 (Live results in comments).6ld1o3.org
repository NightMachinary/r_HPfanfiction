[[/r/europe][r/europe]] surveys always end with a joke question about how Germans lack a sense of humour, and [[/r/ukpolitics][r/ukpolitics]] surveys always ask an ethical question relating to a duck (after someone a year or so ago did a survey of ethical intuitions in the face of various moral dilemmas involving ducks).

The grid question is a new feature introduced by Google Forms that allows us to ask an open-ended favourite pairing question this year. But there's a fair few problems with it: needing to scroll is annoying, you can't unclick an option if you accidentally click it, and I'm not sure how useful the particular presentation of results is going to be. But it's better than nothing!

*** Will you be able to reformat the grid responses once more responses come in? Perhaps sort it in ascending order or something, currently there is a lot of scrolling involved to find responses. It will probably get better as more results come in but the number of possible options spreads the data a lot and in my personal opinion its not optimal.

**** Unfortunately not. Google Forms has no real options with regards to the presentation of results. It's all auto-generated.

I'm hoping that as more results come in, the grid answers will be easier to read as certain pairings gain a significant gap over others. But it's not looking promising.

I think next year I will abandon the grid and just do it like this:

Favourite Pairing: Character 1 (drop down list)

Favourite Pairing: Character 2 (drop down list)

The reason why I didn't do that this year is that the results are not instantly readable. The Google results will just give you two pie charts, one for each question, showing the characters picked for that question alone, with no association with the characters in the second question.

But the data in the spreadsheet will at least be good enough to make my own chart showing pairing preferences.

Negligence and incompetence, ignoring if you believe them to be valid complaints, they are easy to understand and easy to have suffered from. Umbridge reminds too many people of people they've met and Dumbledore holds such a strange place in the fandom its not surprising to me. Heck my answer was Hermione simply because I don't think I could stand her personality in real life. I hate reading about her rather than hate her. Obviously Voldemort is more evil but I don't mind him within fanfiction because he is what he is, this might sound strange but he never chose to be evil, he just was, Umbridge chose to torture Harry, to be petty and controlling.

**** Hah. We have almost nothing in common. I hated worm with a passion! Depressing and with slight overtones of racism, though I could have forgiven that if I was otherwise enjoying it. I mean, I liked the main character fine, but it just felt like it was turning into one of those "all bad things happen all the time forever" type stories. And I do not want! Then again, I read absolutely insane amounts of My Little Pony fanfiction; apparently I just want to escape to happy sunshine land. I read Godmode overpowered Harry/Hermione fics for similar reasons.

I don't really do anime at all, because I can't read subtitles, and all dubs are terrible.

I read a couple Portal fanfics that weren't awful; but it can be hard to find an author who can channel that type of humour. Oh, and all of the classic Dwarf Fortress let's plays. But that's all the video game stuff I ever bothered with.

As for what I do read: a lot of Sherlock, right now, because I just started the show. Not sure if it'll continue to be a regular thing or not, though. My regulars are Harry Potter, Dr Who, Buffy, MLP, and Discworld.

Oh, and my one true badfic pairing is Goku/Anne Frank! Because how could it not be? Also, I'm horrified by the fact that lots of people apparently write Anne Frank fanfiction. Though I've never had the courage to try and read any of it.

How do you feel about those "Harry Potter discovers his life is a computer game" type fics? There's a lot of potential there, but I don't think anyone has yet done it justice. Though Harry Potter and the Natural 20 gets close.

***** Yeah, Worm is too grimdark for a lot of people, even the fanfiction strays away from the original tones of Worm and is usually happier. The real thing that makes me like the fanfiction is it's mostly gen, too much romance turns out badly and turns me off to stories so I've grown to prefer very little romance.

I'm not surprised Portal fanfiction turns out bad, it has too few characters to go anywhere and the characters are very distinct so it's easier to tell when the characterization is off. For video game stuff I usually go with stuff like Mass Effect or TES, in both consequences of player actions are clear and there are generally obvious opportunities for divergence which makes for more interesting fanfiction. Portal doesn't really have a clear point to start fanfiction from which further hurts it.

Gamer!Whoever stuff, I've only ever gotten attached to two stories, sadly they have a terrible tendency to die before the plot starts. There's great potential for all kinds of things, mostly OP characters, but I always feel cockblocked as they always die before the MC gets OP enough to flaunt it. It'd be nice if I found a complete one, I've never seen one before.

Also, I've never heard of Goku/Anne Frank, but I can already see the potential if Goku was at DB levels, you could probably do some elaborate resistance plot where most of the antagonists from DB were Nazis, replace the Red Ribbon Army with the Nazis, have either Pilaf of Piccolo as Hitler. But I'm not sure how to fit Anne Frank in properly.

It works really well in crossovers, though. IE GLADOS somehow kidnaps your favourite characters from some other fandom in order to test them. Can make for some fun throw-away stories, anyway.

I suspect it's because the authors get carried away inventing complicated character sheets, game rules, skill lists, etc. If I was going to write something like that, I'd probably just go with "rule of cool" and "rule of funny" and leave it at that. Otherwise the score sheets just get too long and confusing, and the author gives up.

** The pairing table was a disaster.

A few things greatly surprised me.

1. People don't hate Death Eaters and incompetent politicians like Fudge, Bellatrix, and Voldemort very much.

2. While [[/r/HPfanfiction]] is rather liberal and 58% of responses said they were feminists, they sure don't act like the more vocal ones do. Nice to know politics will never matter here!

3. We seem to be fairly divided on the merits of canon characterisations of magic and the world. I was expecting that we'd lean a bit more towards not valuing them, instead of being equally divided.

4. I was rather surprised Fantastic Beasts isn't considered canon by much of this sub.

Not surprised we hate Dumbledore more than Voldemort. Voldemort was up front about his motives in canon, Dumbledore wasn't. Not to mention Dumbledore bashing has been around for over a decade by now. You can't really bash Voldemort considering he's the villain, he's already evil. Dumbledore, however, is more real to us. Hence why we bash him.

Lastly, I'm surprised so many people still read Harry/Ginny and Harry/Hermione. Haven't read either in a long time.

As a feminist myself, it's encouraging to know that there are still people who separate the crazy feminazis on Tumblr from true gender equality.

***** I think you should try to look at things from the perspective of feminists who are pissed at men.

Think about it this way. You're a woman working towards a good degree. You're just as smart as your male peers, involved in extracurriculars, have a great summer internship lined up, etc. Yet your world is filled with subtle and not so subtle misogyny. Your male peers get more respect and recognition from male bosses despite your own accomplishments. When you're ambitious you're labeled a schemey bitch. Sexual harassment and assault are constant problems on and off campus - everyone I know has at least one friend who has been raped or assaulted in some way. Politicians say that women shouldn't have certain rights, are whores for going out, should be mothers instead of have a career, etc. You and other women are constantly treated badly, usually by men.

So why wouldn't your immediate visceral reaction be negative as hell towards men?

Despite this, every feminist woman I know is super supportive of men's issues as well. Ending toxic masculinity, de-stigmatizing the rape of men, etc. Anger towards men and misogyny doesn't preclude compassion towards them too - me and my friends wouldn't have girlfriends otherwise!

So while I get it's easy to say "feminists suck, all they care about is being angry and hating men", understanding where a lot of women are coming from in terms of how they're treated makes it hard to judge them for being angry.

*** Plot summary:

The giant squid is an Witch cursed to remain in cephalopodic form during the events of the last TWT (hence her entry in the revamped TWT as a 5th champion, as the last TWT was never resolved--see the cocktrice incident--and the magical obligations on prior entrants remain binding).

The squid was a skilled legilimens prior to her transformation. This skill is retained in her current form and through it, she and Harry form a bond. She learns of his life, his suffering, and the intoxicating depth of his will and love for his friends. He learns of her own life, her joys and pain, her dreams of release and return to humanity.

Kindred souls, they are now joined in a most profound way.

Seconds pass, though it seems far longer for the two.

Time is elastic in the HP verse. When, to their horror, they realize that she's dying, that the magic holding her to life in this time is raveling, they seek help. Desperate, Harry begs Dumbledore for aid. Moments pass and an emergency Portkey lands squid and human in the time room of the DoM, where they are sent by an experimental device careening backward in time to the late 18th century when the last TWT was held.

And then Harry embarks on perhaps his greatest quest to free his love from her curse...

As an application, currently, up to about the mid-1990s it would appear that a sufficiently annoyed non-magical population could destroy the magical world with barely a secondary thought.

Yet at the same time I believe that what magic could replicate from the non-magical world, if sufficiently motivated, could almost immediately outpace the forefront of non-magical technology. Think of the microprocessor for example. Yes, yes, computers and magic don't interact - but why? That's never really explained. Computers are, after all, counting machines at the very stripped down level. What if you created a giant counting machine that ran on magicaltunieum, and then shrunk it down in size? This places the possibilities for what magic can produce technology on the scale of the Earth while non-magicals think that a Pentium II is Deep Thought.

It has been shown that magic can make pocket universes (more or less). I bring up the concept of microprocessors in that vein. There are multiple ways to get around making that cake, I only brought the shrinking it down to size as an example. At the same time textual support is lent to the idea that these 'pocket universes' aren't taking place outside of the space-time continuum. What that means is that what happens inside these spaces isn't 'outside of the timestream,' it can interact going both ways. What this means, at a base, is that the potential for a counting machine massively larger than anything we, as humans, could currently create is indeed infinite.

What textual support is not leant to, however, is if these pocket universes must be kept stable or if they are allowed to be moved around at will. As in, does the pocket universe collapse when it's moved from a fix location? Does a magically expanded trunk lose it's expansion during transit? Do magical tents lose their inside expansion when not set up? Etc etc.

It could've been formulated differently, but in the end the answer should be clear to everyone possessing even half of a scientific education.

The question about renting, owning home, does this include apartments? I feel like renting a home implies home and not apartment.

That grid is really poorly displayed on mobile, it was making page super slow and was difficult to select. Maybe listing popular pairings would work better? Or listing popular pairings first? I doubt there is a lot of data for minor characters such as zabini, nott, etc so you could easily have an other field for those.

For read slash fics question, could we have a read rarely, often, sometimes answer. I have read them, but usually avoid them so I think it would be interesting to differentiate between those who read it often and those who don't.

Canon characterization/magic and AU are independent for me so that question was difficult to answer. You can still have an AU with canon characterization and magic, for example what if stories such as where events happened different. Would have been nice to differentiate those since I love AU's that keep canon characterizations and magic.

Yes, it includes apartments. "Home" is not the same thing as "house" - it simply refers to the place where one lives, not any particular type of building.

I will consider adding this for next year. For the time being, however, I think "I unusually avoid them" is close enough to "no". I mean, even people who are frothing at the mouth in hatred of slash fics have presumably read at least a part of one at some point. It's about habits rather than "have you ever".

Noted, though my personal terminology for canon-like story with different events is a divergence rather than an AU (which to me implies a certain level of fundamentally changing the setup of the world).

****** Your interpretation is literally on the most extreme end of the spectrum you could possibly be lmao.

As someone that likes to look at things rationally and without feelings, there's been a ton of research (mountains of evidence) that show us that people of the same race (edit: and religion, economic/social class, etc.) have more empathy and compassion towards each other.

The answer is obvious based on that, it has no indication that the person is racist or "literally hitler" or alt-right at all. It's just a matter of people being more comfortable around people they can relate to even if they have no conscious racist inclinations towards other races. Therefore the logical conclusion is that a society that is not diverse would be ideal.

Nobody that's rational or a critical thinker could argue against the statement that the world would be a better place if everybody was the same race and same religion.

- Disability is a thing too for occupation.

- If you put in more than one pairing for someone in a column it won't let you change it but won't let you go on so you have to start over. Though I might like Hermione/Snape as my favorite Hermione pairing, I may also prefer Hermione with Draco over anyone else with Draco, etc. That would mean selecting Hermione for multiple people even if I only have one for her.
