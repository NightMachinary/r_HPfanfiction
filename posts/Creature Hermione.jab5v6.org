So, if anyone has a list of complete creature Hermionw fanfics, pleeeeease share


** linkffn(8423230)

Set in the 2nd year after the polyjuice accident and Hermione going kitten irreversibly, with Harry deciding to voluntarily do the same to support her. Utterly adorable.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8423230/1/][*/Amber and Emerald/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4109427/Contramancer][/Contramancer/]]

#+begin_quote
  Response to whitetigerwolf's Polyjuice Cat challenge. When Hermione is told her Polyjuice problem is permanent, Harry refuses to let his best friend go through this alone. He chooses to drink a similar potion, and the consequences of that choice are unpredictable and far-reaching. Rating for later themes.

**** Wait a couple of minutes, the Reddit API and the bot sometimes lag (biggest I've seen was about an hour)... "Amber and Emerald" by Contramancer, if the bot refuses to reappear...

This one's pretty good! It has a werewolf Hermione. The author aged her down a year, so she's in the same class as Luna and Ginny.

  Sequel to Basic Needs, which starts where that left off: in Azkaban. But the world is changing rapidly, Voldemort is ready to make his final move, the Ministry and the Order are desperate, Harry had about enough and Fenrir really doesn't like his attitude.

  When Remus came back to himself, he was in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, naked, shivering with pain and with cold, and he could taste blood.“I don't have the full story,” said Madam Pomfrey. “You'll have to speak to Minerva or Albus for that. But Black has escaped, and - Remus, I am so sorry. You bit Hermione Granger.”or: a story of innocence, experience, and prejudice, spanning the summer holidays after Prisoner of Azkaban.
