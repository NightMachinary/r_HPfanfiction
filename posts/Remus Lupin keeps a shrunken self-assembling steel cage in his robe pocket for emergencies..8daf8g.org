Exactly what it says on the tin; it occurred to me that it'd be a useful backup plan if there's no Wolfsbane Potion, Shrieking Shack, or otherwise secure enclosure available.


** probably line the thing with silver, so the Wolf doesn't even try to break it

*** "Oh no! He hasn't taken his potion!" Hermione whispered...it was a loud whisper, but still a whisper.

It was nearing the end of Prisoner of Azkaban, and they had just captured Peter Pettigrew.

"We're horribly screwed, right?" Ron commented dryly, as though he wasn't about to be mauled.

"Probably." Hermione answered "Unless.../Nipul Nhoj Sumer/!"

~CLOI-OING! CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLANG!~

Everyone stared as what seemed like an iron box leapt out of Lupin's shredded robes and rapidly unfolded itself into a thick-barred steel cage around the transforming werewolf.

There was an awkward silence as Remus the werewolf repeatedly slammed against the steel bars keeping him penned up.

"Okay, that was clever, but how did you know Moony was holding something like that on him? How did you know how to activate it?" Sirius asked.

Hermione blushed, "Oh...I, um, asked Professor Dumbledore about it after I realised Professor Lupin was a werewolf. I thought that a backup plan in case he couldn't get Wolfsbane would be good..."

"I'll say it was good," Harry muttered, "That's the plot of the next four books resolved right here and now. We still have Peter, right?"

Then the dementors showed up.

Then Delphini showed up.

Then muggles with bazookas showed up.

Then the Fire Nation showed up.

Then Ron Burgundy's news team showed up.

Nicely done. That's from the thread with Lupin seeing Scabbers on the HE, right?

******* Post op here. Thank you very much! I was really just fulfilling my own musing of what might happen in that situation, so that you're putting effort into turning it into a meme honestly made me squee with happiness.

Edit: forgot to add, I wrote the rest of 3rd year and a 4th year fill as a reply to someone's comment on my post. If you have any interest it's near the bottom of the comments from the post.

******* As the op of that post, I'm really truly honored you liked my throw away line I wrote at 3am as an attempt of humor and because I needed somewhere to end the passage. Please link me to your fic, I'd love to check it out!

Edit: I forgot to mention, I actually expanded upon the original passage and wrote a whole third year and 4th aus. They're in the comments buried at the bottom. Not trying to self promote, honest, I just know if I read something I enjoyed I'd like to see other content from the same au.

******** I'm one of those crazy people who like to write the whole fic, or close to it, before publishing, so it's not actually out there now. And... may not ever be? I dunno, it's pretty ambitious. It's going to be called "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" and it's a weird mix of angst and crack. However, Harry is on the run with Sirius and there's lots of times when the dementors get to show up :)

Self-promotion fully appreciated, half the reason I come here is to see what authors say about what they've they've written.

********* I absolutely get you. I have in my life completed only 4 works of fanfiction, all under 2k. I'm rather surprised with myself that I've even made it this far with my spur of the moment au. It's to the point that if I get it entirely planned out I might actually attempt to write it.

Angst and crack can definitely go together, and make a masterpiece. It's a bit out there what with them being Korean and all, but The Handmaiden or The Host are good examples of humor and hurt going hand in hand.

****** Author of the remus post here. I just thought you should know it means a lot to me that you referenced something from my fill, when I mostly wrote it for fun. If you liked it, I wrote a bit more about 3rd and 4th year as a reply to one of the comments on the original post.

P.S. Your writing was very clever, the concept of a collapsing cage is one I'd never seen before. Kudos to you!

**** Haha why was the spell to assemble the cage just Lupin's name backwards?

***** 1) Because it's not actually a magic spell, but rather a command word.

2) It's easy to remember (the general gist of it, at least).

3) Pretty much no chance of activating it by accident.

4) Because then thematically, the command to disassemble and re-shrink the cage would be 'Remus John Lupin' (repeated three times so it doesn't go off by accident), appropriate for once said Lupin has returned to being his human self.
