Honestly the man is vile and every first year can take him out.

Any fics where he's used for target practice or run out of the school?


** I'm pretty sure it was somewhere in linkffn(it all started with a trip to gringotts) ?..

**** Then I don't recommend reading it. Actually this fic is pretty old and full of tropes and has a bashing group (oh no, not only Dumbledore and some Weasleys, but also your Filch, Flamels and, if I remember correctly, Seth from mythology. Are you impressed?). It was just one of the first fics I've read and I'm a bit fond of it, it has an interesting plot (including Atlantis and the whole Seth thing) but, oh dear, how many tropes are there... and OOC too...

***** I'll give it a try, I can handle ooc as long as they're not bonded soulmates or creatures with pheromone issues.\\
There's too few post war fics to be really picky xD

****** As long as you skip everything you really don't like, you should be fine, I guess. The plot is really interesting! Enjoy.

Also, I remember Founders (their portraits) being really cool guys

Maybe I want to reread it too...

******* Ghe I'm six chapters in and it's fun so far, dunno why but all those tropes are actually fun in the older stories. Classic Dobby like goblins ^{^}
