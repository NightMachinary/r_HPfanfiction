** /Enemies to Lovers/ trope, simple as that

Also it's fanfic, fandoms gonna do what fandoms do. Personally, this particular ship was never my tea, but it is what it is. Nothing wrong with some m/m or w/w

**** I'm with you on that. Harry and Draco was never what I really was into. Even with my own like for enemies to loves trope. I prefer other options for it. But people just ship what they ship and that trope is the most popular. Since they're the main young males character on either side of the war, it was like it was made for them.

Also, sorry if I came off as aggressive before, I've seen some rude opinions towards any m/m or w/w on this (and other fanfic) subreddits. Didn't mean it that way. Apologies.

** Apparently many female readers find reading about slash arousing (and similar for male readers and femslash). There is no good reason for it, I am afraid.
