EDIT: FOUND THIS FIC BUT THANK YOU FOR THE HELP

That is set in Harry's 4th year, and he's like bezzie mates with Barty/Moody, and he's on the dark side if I remember correctly.

I remember this one scene where after classes Harry goes down to Barty/Moody's office and sleeps there and all his friends get worried looking for him, and he floos through the fire in Barty/Moody's office to meet with the dark lord.

As I said, quite vague, but I would be really glad if someone knew what this fic is.

Much obliged :)


** Fairly certain that it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][/A Well Groomed Mind/]], though I don't believe Harry's actually going dark in that fic. He's just trying to survive, and Voldemort isn't /nearly/ as dark as canon depicts, because apparently he's suffering from a bad case of "History is written by the victors".

  On Halloween 1994, Harry learns his mind isn't his own. On Samhain morn, he vows to question everything. Armed with logic and an unlikely ally, Harry makes a last ditch bid to reclaim his life. The goal: survive at all costs.
