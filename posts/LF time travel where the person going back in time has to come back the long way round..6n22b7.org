  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

** linkffn(Their Verdict of Vagaries by Angstier)

Fits your description almost to a T. It's a brilliant, gorgeous, extremely well-written fic with the most outrageous prose you'll probably ever find in a fic of this length. It's also slash, so not sure if you're fine with that. If you are though, definitely check this out.

linkffn(October by the Carnivorous Muffin)

It's yet to reach Harry's time, but it's very close to there now. Harry is immortal, has lived through a horrifying length of history (however most of that is "future time" in relation to canon). Also read the side fics to this series (can be found in the author's profile page) for the full picture.

It says slash on the tin but imo it's not really slash. Tom has kind of a crush on Harry that never went anywhere. Not sure what the author will choose to do in the future.

**** Well, I think it would depend on how you interpret canon Harry's personality and how you define OOC-ness. There are definitely Tom/Harry fics out there where Harry's canon spirit is captured perfectly - in fact, I can even name quite a few - but stories that involve long-term time travel would be a bit different, since you can expect people (especially teenagers) to change when they're thrown suddenly into a whole different situation, probably forced to become someone else, and stay there for a long time.

When it comes to these two specifically: the Harry in TVOV is seriously traumatized. He traveled back in time in a grief and shock-stricken state, and never really gets a chance to catch his breath. Add this to his sudden loss of any purpose, interpersonal connections or sense of identity whatsoever, you can expect to him to act quite differently from what you might expect of the teen leader who's determined to overthrow a Dark Lord.

With that said, however, I never had trouble seeing him as an extension of the canon Harry. There are essential parts of him that remains, like his compassion, his natural leadership, his love for his friends and family, his sense of justice; however, a lot of that is either smothered beneath, or twisted by his serious depression and Tom's influence, so. All depends on how you see that, I guess. I'll say this though: the author knows her canon, there is a crazy attention to detail, and she never lets you forget who Harry is. Some of what he does later on and his emotional reaction to situations makes him undeniably Harry Potter.

I've never read A Long Journey Home, but I'll warn you that TVOV is...a ride. The good sort, at least to me.

As for October, I'll have to be frank and say that this Harry seems more like a different person than the twisted but still recognizable version in TVOV, especially in the beginning. It's kinda to be expected if you know this particular author's style. If you squint you can still see a bit of the canon Harry though (she really does make an effort to make Azrael Harry in this, instead of writing a straight-up OC like she does in all her Lily Potter stories), and imo what's important here is that nothing in Azrael really goes against the essential nature of Harry Potter in canon, but rather reinforces and emphasizes it. Considering that by the start of the story he had lived for a gazillion years and became a near-God entity, it's only to be expected that he'd be pretty far removed from who he once was as a teen. But to me, the background that TCM gave him (before he turned into an immortal being) is pretty convincing. I can see why he might become this person given what happened to him after the war. And just like TVOV, there are points in the story, too, that definitely reminds you of who this person really is, at the bottom of it all.

To me, OOC-ness implies that there are things that the author has written that is without a doubt incompatible with how the character is portrayed in canon. Like a callous, violence-prone Harry, for example. You don't usually see that in Tom/Harry fics. Any development built upon the original and built with thought is acceptable, personally speaking.

And that reminds me...in TCM's main fic linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus), Lily travels back in time and lives to the present, allowing the child-Lily to take on the role that her future self left behind, if I've got this right. Can't say for certain though, stopped reading mid-way through year one.

Sorry this was long and I hope it's been somewhat helpful, at least...

***** What I mean is, say Harry goes back in time during 5th year. Does the fic start out with a fairly canon 5th year Harry? It makes sense to me that the AU experiences would change Harry during the fic. What I can't stand is when he's already a different character at the beginning too - I read FanFiction because I LIKE the characters as they are and I'm interested in how they'd react in different situations. But I know not everyone agrees with that which is why there's so much OOC fanfic.

So in that sense, it's very hard to talk about his character. I, personally, think the core character works as a harry that has live longer than anyone ever should, but he only tangentially related to the character in the novels at this point.
