Pairings in particular I'm looking for:

Harry/Tonks, reading linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass), loving it so far; with a few complaints with some of the way the characters are written. The way Tonks is written is really neat though.

Blaise/Parvati: Likely after the war would be good.

Padma/Anthony: Again after the war or year seven would be good.

Luna/Draco: No Seer Luna please. After the war story involving them.

Ginny/Draco: Would rather it not be dark Ginny.

Harry/Non Ice Queen Daphne: I don't like the ice princess/ice queen persona for Daphne, I don't see her as that. Feel free to have her be as different from the ice princess/ice queen as possible.

Neville/Ginny: Set either during Neville's seventh year or after the war. I've always wanted to read a story where they get closer because of the Death Eaters at the school and are each other's shoulders to lean on in tough times.

Hermione/Ron set after the war, maybe with some PTSD with Harry being a minor or reoccurring character, as long as he isn't main character; would like to see a story where it's mainly them without Harry being the center focus.

Seamus/Lavender set after the war. Maybe dealing with the attack that Greyback did to Lavender.

Susan/Draco: Doubt it's popular, but any story with a pairing with them would be great.

Any Hufflepuff/Slytherin pairing in general would be good to see. Been on a Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw paired with Slytherin kick for a while.

A Severus/Minerva friendship story, I don't ship them but I like the idea of the two of them being friends.

Absolutely No Harems. Very little to absolutely No Character Bashing please. Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Those are just suggestions, any other pairing except for Harry/Hermione and Draco/Hermione is fine, anyone can be the main character not just Harry.

Please don't have Harry be incredibly powerful or super smart, a little more powerful or smart is okay just don't make it unbelievable.

With little to no character bashing as I said before, any rating any era is fine.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
