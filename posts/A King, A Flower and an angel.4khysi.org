Just a bit of shameless promo for my story at. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11831700/1/A-King-A-Flower-and-an-Angel]] Leave a review letting me know what you liked, did not like, and a reason. Please and thank you.


** I hate to say it, but this comes across as a rather rushed and lazy offering. You didn't even stop to check if you'd spelled the protagonists' names correctly, did you? WEASLEY. WITH AN E. Also, 'Diggory' has two G's, who knew? You could have checked these in about five seconds, you know.

You apparently still have the working title 'Harry's Veela' at the top of each chapter, by the way, which is a little offputting.

Now, I honestly couldn't read this. My eyes just... skim over the page. There's little in the way of description, and the scenes are not properly set, so I almost had to make something up in my head as to where any of the characters were, or what they were doing. Otherwise they're just... blankly interacting a big, white, empty space, mentally speaking. The dialogue is quite bland, and falls prey to Talking Head Syndrome, especially in the early chapters. Harry is apparently completely unaffected by cutting a man's throat (a sight that is notoriously horrific, I might add), and while I appreciate that fight scenes are hard to write, the one in Chapter 1 was completely lacking in tension. Seriously, Harry couldn't bring himself to try to kill /Voldemort/, so why does RandomDeathEater#556 get special treatment? It's really OOC, unless he did it accidentally in the heat of the moment, in which case I would expect at least some psychological impact. Not that Rowling was ever any good at writing that herself, to be fair.

If you want my advice, the simplest thing you could do would be to /re-read and edit your work, dammit/. Seriously, there are so many spelling mistakes and just... sentences that make no sense, especially in the early chapters, that I don't blame people for thinking that English is a second language for you. You need to learn to [[http://emmadarwin.typepad.com/thisitchofwriting/showing-and-telling-the-basics.html][show]] more, rather than telling all the time, a problem that persists even into your latest chapter. Harry just telepathically knows how people around him are feeling, completely bypassing their expressions and body language, and I hate to say it but that's bad writing. Unless he literally is a telepath, in which case the way you've written it is just incredibly bland and lacking in description, I guess. Most jarring of all are the tense shifts, where you suddenly start using present tense in the middle of a sentence.

#+begin_quote
  They /proceed/ on to lighter conversation while they waited for Fleur's parents to arrive.
#+end_quote

That should have been 'proceeded', for example, because the rest of your story is in the past tense. See, I looked at your later chapters, and I can see that you have the capacity to improve, but as a new reader, I'm never going to see those if I'm immediately repulsed by the unedited mess that is your first chapter. You need to go back and knock those into shape. In all honesty, I personally still wouldn't voluntarily read it (mostly into femslash these days, and H/F is often just het 'older girl' fetish with little substance), but your story would be a lot more pleasant on the eyes if you fixed up the early chapters to your current writing standard.

Writing a good story is difficult, and requires a lot of effort on your part. If you're not bothered by that, and just want to write for fun, then fair enough... just don't ask me to call it 'good writing'. Fanfiction.net is famous for its legions of 'yes men', who will tell absolutely anyone that their story is 'amzing' and 'best fing I ever red'. If you want to improve as a writer, /don't believe them/. They say that to /everyone/, because they're 13 and have no taste. The ego boost is nice, but never let it make you complacent. You can do /better/ than 'best thing a 13 year old ever read'. Good luck.

** I read the first chapter. You have a lot of spelling errors in your story. I know finding a beta is harder than it sounds, but your story seems to be rather popular, which might increase your chances.

Also, the entire first chapter felt extremely rushed. You condensed a timeframe that takes up over a hundred pages in the books into a chapter of less than 1500 words.

Also, please distinguish between the name of a spell and its incantation. Don't write "He was his by a Crucio." but write "He was hit by a Cruciatus Curse."

I also found fourteen year old Harry cutting a man's throat quite out of character.

*** He cuts men's throats but he wouldn't even kiss his "soul mates" until he's of age? This is so funny. Hard to believe someone wrote it as a serious fic.

** I read about the soul bound with Fleur and then Gabrielle and I thought to myself "this is gonna be good".

First chapter, first paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  Made by the Love of the Dursleys but no more than their hate
#+end_quote

This does not make any sense whatsoever.

#+begin_quote
  he would not need to come back his personal hell
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  would be at his home Hogwarts
#+end_quote

lol this is so bad it's funny. Almost as good as My immortal. Did you change Harry's name to Harriet Ebony Dementia Black?

#+begin_quote
  For tomorrow though he would go see his best friends
#+end_quote

Are you not a native English speaker?

So first paragraph proved to pe quite funny, even though I don't think you intended for that to happen. But I can't read a whole chapter written like this, no matter how much mirth it brings. So I'm skipping ahead to...

Chapter 17! Starts with a smiley face. Aww, that's nice.

First paragraph. At a glance it looks like all the sentences start with Harry's name. Intriguing.

#+begin_quote
  Harry a woke to the sun

  Harry tried to turn over

  Harry immediately stopped moving

  To his dismay he heard a soft groan and slight movement
#+end_quote

I stand corrected, not every sentence begins with Harry's name. My bad. So this is the paragraph where Harry a wakes, turns over and then stops moving. It's riveting. The suspense is killing me now. What will Harry do next? Is Harry going to turn on his belly? Is Harry going to fall off the bed?

Let's go to the next paragraph and find out!

#+begin_quote
  Harry recalled

  Harry smiled

  Harry worried
#+end_quote

Oh, Harry's life is so interesting. Oh, please, next give us a description of how he ties his shoelaces!

Apparently he is in bed with some girls, btw. You could say he's tired after a long night wild monkey sex using much less words than you did.

#+begin_quote
  He remembered that they did nothing but sleep in the same bed. He did not want to go farther than that until he was older at least until he was two or three more years.
#+end_quote

That does not make sense, again. But what I assume you mean is he wants to wait two or three years before they bang. So you don't agree with people having sex until they are legally adults, I take it.

At that age he's not horny all the time? Is one of the girls dosing him with an impotence potion? Plus, wouldn't Fleur be around 21 by that time? Why is Harry such a selfish bastard, not considering her needs?

And I can imagine how this came to be: "guys, I know how to make an incest, threesome fic without the incest and the threesome!!!!" by making them happen in the future, off screen. For no particular reason. That is such a good idea. Such good plot and characterization. And it makes so much sense. It doesn't sound at all like a 12yo with sexual hangups is writing this.

Let's go to the next paragraph and see what else that rascal Harry is up to!

#+begin_quote
  To Harry's surprise he then heard a yawn
#+end_quote

I want to remind you that just a couple paragraphs ago this happened:

#+begin_quote
  To his dismay he heard a soft groan
#+end_quote

All these horrible noises dismay and surprise him. Poor Harry, going through this whirlwind of emotions over a groan and a yawn. His life must truly be a tragedy.

What can I say? Brilliant plot. Exquisite writing. I'll have to stop reading now through, because such good writing can only be enjoyed in small doses.

Extra:

#+begin_quote
  To Harry's credit he no longer turned red when Fleur or Gabrielle gave him small pecks but when they both did at the same time he still had a slight blush on his face or when he displayed such affection. He returned the gesture with a small bit of redness.
#+end_quote

The incest is definitely more enjoyable now that there's blushing involved.

**** You're a nicer person than I am. I think some things are beyond hope. Plus. Maybe the repetitions and the grammar are beyond what he can correct right now, but his profile says he's from US so, keeping that in mind, are you telling me that a native speaker thinks stuff like what I quoted makes sense? If he cared at least a tiny bit about publishing a good story he would revise his own writing and correct the awkward turns of phrase and take out the endless, pointless description of every tiny little thing Harry does, and stop starting every sentence with Harry's name. But in the case he does care, what I did was provide examples. He could read what I wrote and go "oh, that really doesn't make sense there" and "that plot line really doesn't hold up" and "I should fix all this".

Edit: and you do know, as it stands right now, there's nothing good about this story. There's not one good thing to be said about it. The author doesn't give enough of a shit about his own creation to reread it once before he presses publish.

So I don't know what's rudder, publishing the drivel or offering an in depth analysis of a couple paragraphs that, if taken to heart, will help him improve his writing many times over? I don't know if you yourself are a writer, but when someone is editing your work that's how it generally goes, they take a few paragraphs and deconstruct those. Now, if all you see is mockery then what can I say? I don't have high hopes for OP either.
