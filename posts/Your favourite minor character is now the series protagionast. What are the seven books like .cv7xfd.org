Nah. Ginny's trouble wasn't due to a connection to Harry. Her salvation was. Arthur and Molly would be likely to join the Order even if Ron weren't bff's with Harry, which means the connection only benefited them when Harry was able to help save Arthur, which might not have happened otherwise.

**** Molly's brothers were part of the Order during the First Wizarding War anyway, so I'm betting she would still have joined up to avenge them.

** I'll say Lavender is probably my favorite minor character. She's as brave as any Gryffindor and participates in the battle of Hogwarts. During OotP she's in DA and in HBP she's a clingy girlfriend, but the rest of the time she'd just be a normal Hogwarts student and observer to Harry's madness. I think I'd quite enjoy seeing Hogwarts that way.

**** LOL I was trying not to be too revealing with the titles. AKA I could do a bunch of clever stuff with "Two Masters" for example. Because there's Dumby and Voldy, but then there's also Master of death, Draco vs Harry in Master of the Elder Wand etc. "Two Masters" can be ambiguous if you think about it. Just like the debate around "Two Towers" from LotR!
