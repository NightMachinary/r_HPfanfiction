Some of mine:

Snape can no longer take dreamless sleep potion, as he took it one too many times during the first war when we was a Death Eater and it no longer affects him.

Andromeda was the one that was going to marry Lucius but left because she could no longer support her family's views upon meeting Ted Tonks.

Harry keeps contact with Dudley, after the Dursleys' return back from being in hiding. Dudley learns from the people that protected them, that Figgs was a Squib, and asks her to contact Harry for him. Dudley, years later, ends up having a Muggleborn child and Harry is able to help him and his wife out. Though Harry never talks to Vernon or Petunia again.

Harry learns that he can still speak to snakes, even after getting rid of the Horcrux. (I like to think it's because of the side effect of being a Horcrux)

Susan Bones becomes a Healer after Hogwarts. I see her training under Pomfrey, when the Death Eaters took over Hogwarts.

Bill Weasley, Lavender Brown among some others, bring support to Werewolves. With the help of Hermione Granger (Who ends up helping creatures who are don't get the care that they rightfully need). They eventually have it a law stated that all Werewolves must be given the Wolfsbane Potion during the Full Moon, and that no Werewolves can be fired because of who they are.

Later on, Hermione with the help of some other supporters. End up creating the blood bank, for Vampires. Volunteers will give their blood to vampires.

Katie Bell and Alicia Spinnet end up joining Ginny Weasley with the Holyhead Herpies.

Justin Finch-Fletchley and Susan Bones marry, while Susan becomes a Healer, Justin becomes the Professor of the Muggle Studies class, updating the course to become more practical for Purebloods and Half-bloods to learn about the Muggle life.

Dennis carries on his brother Colin's love of photos, and open up a place to create professional photos.

** Andromeda absolutely hated her daughter's husband. While Harry was giving Remus a stern talk, she was busy comforting Nymphadora and swore vengeance. Generally, I imagine Andromeda a lot more vindictive than in most fics. Someone who'd respect Bellatrix more than Narcissa because she never lied about her loyalty. And after losing her husband and daughter, I can imagine her becoming very bitter.

On a related note, Andromeda in canon is not some frail old grandmother, she could probably still have children of her own for a few years (since she is 45ish and has a 50% higher life expectancy than a Muggle).

  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with ‚ÄúThe List.‚Äù The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see ‚ÄúThe Last Death Eater‚Äù and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.

** High-magic environments don't disable muggle technology - unplottability, protection and anti-muggle charms do, but nobody knows for sure, since all high-magic places have had anti-muggle charms on them before the invention of electricity.

Wizards don't naturally age slower than muggles, they just have access to superior medicine and cosmetic potions. Wizards' natural lifespans being significantly longer than that of muggles is pureblood propaganda.

Bludgers are 'smart'. Their goal is to hinder the players, not to kill them, and they act accordingly. They never go at players' heads at full speed and magically slow themselves down right before making contact with the bat so that the beaters are actually able to hit them without dislocating their shoulders. This fact is rarely mentioned and often denied because it makes quidditch players seem lamer.

Male veelas exist, but they look pretty much the same as the female ones in their human forms, causing some people to get confused. Mythical Helen of Troy was half-veela, as evidenced by her being: a) supernaturally beautiful and b) hatched from an egg after her mother had an intercourse with a shape-shifting bird-like being.

Dementors consume human souls for the purpose of reproduction - digesting a soul triggers production of many small buds which can then be spread around and remain dormant until the optimal conditions for their growth are met.

Contrary to popular opinion, dementors prefer to feed on moderately miserable people - with enough hapiness left in them to satisfy dementor's hunger but not enough to let them effectively fight back against it. If dementors in Azkaban weren't provided with new prisoners to feed on, they would quickly abandon the place, hovering over the restless sea. They knew that Barty Crouch Jr Was replaced with his mother, but they didn't notify anyone about it since she was tastier than him. They do not care about long-term prisoners and only go pursue them when they try to escape in hopes of getting to eat their souls. All in all, dementors make better torturers than guards.

- Percy is a single dad to Molly and Lucy. Audrey left him and the girls shortly after Lucy was born

- Molly (his daughter) has a wild temper and will fight people muggle fist fight style

- Molly looks like him the most but Lucy is most like him personality wise

- Oliver gave his daughter "the talk" by using quidditch to explain it

- Marcus (Flint) has a daughter in Gryffindor

- All three of them are single dads and their kids (well Lucy, Oliver and Marcus' daughters. Molly is older than them) are friends so the first time they got together it was awkward. Marcus and Oliver were glaring at each other and Percy had to be the adult and make sure they didn't fight each other

  When she was small, Susie's aunt Amelia had taken her to work whenever her parents asked her to babysit. She toddled around her office. When Susie was older, she got to sit under her aunt's desk in court and listen to her give out rulings, verdicts, decrees. There was tradition there, scripts and structure, and Susie had felt herself lean into them, comforted, strengthened. Over the years, she saw so many ways the system could be corrupted. Umbridge used it like a blunt weapon and blood purists had snuck into it for years like burrowing termites, undermining the foundations, making it their own home.When Susan Bones was twenty-three she would look across her steaming mug and the Ministry breakroom table, and see Hermione aching to burn it all down to ashes. Susan wanted to scour it to its roots, instead, wear it down to its rebar and concrete, and then rebuild from the old, worn foundations on up.‚ÄúYour parents died for you,‚Äù Susie told Harry Potter once. ‚ÄúMy aunt died for this. Now either shut up and get me a fresh cup of coffee or try to drag me out of here before I finish this.‚ÄùBut that was a war away. That was a childhood away from now.

** Hermione is actually half-French, and speaks French.

Ginny's quidditch career only stopped when she got pregnant with Lily. She came back after Albus' birth for a couple of seasons. She had also been writing about Quidditch ever since signing for the Harpies, but for the Quibbler first. She was also their captain in her first spell, having been hand-picked by Gwenog Jones upon her retirement. This got a little awkward when Angelina joined the team that year.

A lot of the war survivors from Harry's year went into the Auror force, including all the Gryffindors save for Hermione and Parvati, Susan Bones, Padma Patil and Terry Boot. Lavender joined later than the others because of her condition, but stayed longer than all bar Harry.

Harry and Narcissa share a very large mutual respect, even if they don't like each other, and Harry does ask her for advice if he feels he has to. Harry and Draco, however, seek to avoid each other at all costs.

There is a specific taskforce among the Aurors dedicated to solving the more difficult crimes. Padma heads that branch up.

Neville taught DADA for a year before becoming Herbology teacher as a test of his abilities as a teacher. He also fills in the post when needed.

Yeah, Snape loved Lily, but not romantically.

Some other people mentioned this too: Harry retained Parseltongue. My addition: Ginny might have it after being possessed IF the reason Harry has it was originally from the scarcrux, not latent genes resurfacing from freshening the gene pool with a Muggleborn. Regardless, he passes the trait to 1/4 of his kids but if Ginny has it too then the kids have a 50/50 shot.

The Black family have Veela ancestry, but practically gone by Sirius's generation until Muggleborn blood freshens the incest pool. Boom! Daughter with active shifting features. I play with the Veela/mate trope and that's why Bella is barking. She chose family and blood purity over her mate. Reggie chose to have Kreature leave him in the cave rather than suffer the fate of either Andi or Bella (madness or exile) because he was already starting around the bend and not thinking clearly. Siri's shift into becoming an animagus was easier for him because of the latent Veela transforming genes, but James was the one that was actually really good at transfiguration. Poor Cissa got the pretty looks but nothing else.

** TLDR version:

Dark-Traditional Potter family came from Egypt via Spain, Sally Supernoodle is closely related to the Potter line, Parseltongue is a long-lost Potter family trait, Brits (probably including Harry) are racist. Also, when an inbred line crosses with Muggles/Muggleborn, the kids will be extra powerful.

Details, copied from chat logs from 30/10/19.

*Part 1*

#+begin_quote
  The name 'Salazar' comes from a place in northern Spain, which was under Moorish control for some time.

  That area was reclaimed by the Christians around 850ish.

  Hogwarts was supposedly built sometime in the late 900s.

  Salazar Slytherin (or possibly his parents?) was probably a Moor who escaped the Reconquista and fled north, through France and into Britain.

  Moors were mostly Arabic or north African.

  Salazar Slytherin, therefore, was most likely of recent Arabic or north African descent, and had darker skin than most British wizards.

  Slytherin was hated for being "Dark".

  Therefore British wizards are fucking racist.

  Bonus: Racists often consider black people (which Slytherin may well have been) as ape-like.

  Harry described the face of Slytherin's statue in the CoS as "monkeyish".

  Harry is a fucking racist.
#+end_quote

*Part 2*

#+begin_quote
  Related: many of the Moors were from Egypt. In our Potters-are-Egyptian AU, the Potters are an old traditional family. It's entirely possible that their ancestors may have come to Britain via Spain, while clinging to their ancient Egyptian traditions rather than the relatively new Islamic system, which only came about in like the 600s or something IIRC?

  The name 'Potter' comes from English, so it was likely given to/claimed by the family after they arrived in Britain, because most of the locals were uneducated xenophobes who couldn't remember or pronounce their dodgy foreign surname.

  Spelling and grammar were... somewhat different, shall we say? ...to modern standards, so 'Slytherin' is probably Salazar's nickname, a misspelling of 'slithering' due to his snake obsession.

  So could Salazar have been part of the family that was eventually named 'Potter'?!?!?!!!

*Part 3*

#+begin_quote
  Headcanon confirmed: Potters came from Egypt, through Spain into Britain sometime in the ninth century, carrying their talent for Parseltongue (which is significantly more useful in Africa, which has lots of deadly snakes, than in Britain, which has nothing worse than the adder). Due to their tradition of mummifying their dead and storing organs in canopic jars, which were basically fancy earthenware pots, they came to be known as the Potters.

  Salazar was part of the family, but due to his obsession with snakes and his reputation for sneakiness, was given the nickname of 'Slithering'. Spelling wasn't standardised at the time, and he chose to spell it as 'Slytherin'. He used the name for his Hogwarts house to keep with the other founders' alliterative theme.

  The Parseltongue trait became rarer over time, maybe due to inbreeding or something, much like metamorphmagy in the Black family. By the time James Potter was born, it was all but forgotten by the vast majority of the population, and because he was a spoilt little dumbass rich bitch who had his head shoved up Dumbledore's arse, he abandoned his family's fairly Dark history and sided with the Light instead.

  Then 'hybrid vigour' happened.

  Someone of the old Prince line had a kid with a muggle? Boom, skilled wizard, potions genius.

  Merry Gaunt shagged a muggle? Boom, super powerful wizard, smart and skilled.

  Andy Black shagged a muggleborn? Boom, metamorphmagus, super rare talent that used to be more common but died out.

  Potter and a muggleborn? Parselmouth, used to be more common but died out.

  Harry isn't a Speaker because of the scarcrux, it's an old family trait that's reappeared because a pureblood finally decided to fuck someone more distant than a third cousin.

*Part 4* (the blood thing)

#+begin_quote
  I want a fic where the pureblood/mudblood thing is reversed. Muggleborns are 'pureblood' because they're adding fresh, new blood to the wizarding gene pool, whereas the ones of all-magical descent are 'mudbloods' because they're all fucked in the head from hereditary wizarding syphilis etc.

*** Interesting, I don't know if I 100% with everything but enjoyed reading it never the less.

The one thing is I thought that its been discovered and relatively accepted that the name Salazar is of Basque origin. So that would be NE Spain/Iberia, but they were mentioned by name in Roman times so they were there prior to the Umayyad conquest of the Visogoths and Iberian peninsula. Basque County was also the last stronghold against the Moors.

***** Thats okay, everything you said was very well written and well thought out. Its not necessarily a "right" vs "wrong" situation, just another potential variable to discuss. Perhaps Salazar had a Basque father and Moorish mother? Perhaps he originally fled the area because of the war between the Basque and Umayyad Caliphate. The Potters still could have nob white lineage as well as Slytherin, perhaps his descendents intermarried.

But now that you brought it up, I do believe she would butt heads with the Order as well. In the books, the Order existed to preserve the status quo. Hermione however had always been a revolutionary and already ruffled feathers at age 15. She would be the exact kind of person they would say is going too far. But yes, in this case, assassination attempts would be out of character.

***** Ah. The "Old Crowd" is generally taken to refer to the Order of the Phoenix, after Dumbledore used the phrase in GoF:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúThat will do to be going on with,‚Äù said Dumbledore, stepping between them once more. ‚ÄúNow I have work for each of you. Fudge's attitude, though not unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher - the old crowd. Lie low at Lupin's for a while; I will contact you there.‚Äù
#+end_quote

In the time between the publication of books 4 and 5, before we had ever heard the phrase "Order of the Phoenix", the only clue we had as to the anti-Voldemort resistance was Dumbledore's "old crowd" reference. So fans took to calling Dumbledore's anti-Voldemort group "the Old Crowd", which later became synonymous with the Order.

** As a supplemental to OP's headcanon regarding Susan's post-Hogwarts career: she likes to spice things up in the bedroom on occasion by doing the whole 'naughty night-shift nurse' routine.

As for my own headcanon: Harry doesn't become an Auror. Frankly, given everything he went through during the camping trip from hell, I figure he'd much prefer a simple, quiet life out of the spotlight of the Wizarding World as much as possible, by being a stay-at-home father, possibly doing a bit of day trading in his spare time. I recognize that this goes against both the epilogue and Cursed Child, but I don't care.

Yes, I headcanon that either Dumbledore (most likely him. Because it does seem fitting for Ol' Dumbles to visit a Muggle Shop and purchase a leather-bound Diary) or Slughorn gifted Tom the Diary. Obviously, not knowing what to do, or how to respond to receiving a genuine present from someone, what did Tom do? He turned the book into a Horcrux, of course! This would also be YET another reason for why Tom hated Dumbledore and thought so little of Slughorn. They had the GALL to send he, Tom Marvolo Riddle, Heir Of Slytherin, Future Dark Lord and Most Powerful Wizard To Ever Have Lived, a gift! Such an ordinary gesture...Such a...Human...thing to do.
