I think Voldemort had an affair with Eileen Prince back in the 50s and Snape is actually Harry's father? Harry helps his grandad steal the Philosopher's Stone and Voldemort brings back Eileen and Lily using the Resurrection Stone and alchemy? Help!!! I'm going crazy trying to find this story

  Dark!Opportunistic!Harry. Severitus fic and Tom is Sev's Dad, too. Though no one knows that at the beginning. Kind of Crack-y, but (hopefully) written seriously. Turns out it WASN'T Lily's love that saved Harry that Halloween night after all. Voldemort really should've made sure the brat wasn't an Inner Circle Member's kid before he attempted to kill him. In the Dark Lord's defense, though, how was he supposed to know Lily Potter might've committed Line Theft?
