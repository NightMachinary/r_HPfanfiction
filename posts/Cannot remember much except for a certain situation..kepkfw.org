Dumbledore is arrested by the DMLE, but is broken out by a mysterious group we later find out to be the unspeakables. They hold him captive and get information out of him, and keep him in a time dilation chamber. They use a 4-5 person team of legilimancers to break the information they want out of his head. In the end he is designated a dark lord. Does this sound familiar to anyone?
