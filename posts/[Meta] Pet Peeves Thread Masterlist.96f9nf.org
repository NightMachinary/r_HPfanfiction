** I read a Harry Potter fanfic once that referred to snakes as "slimy". Repeatedly. Whenever snakes came up in this parseltongue-centric story.

It was obvious the reader had no experience with or knowledge of snakes whatsoever, as snakes are not slimy in any way, shape, or form. They're actually really dry; petting a snake is kind of like petting a piece of paper.

So that really put me off the fanfic.

** Teenage pregnancy, especially if it is described as "good" (seriously: How about NO! Teenage pregnancy is always shitty and should never be described as OK IMHO - if it happens as an accident? Ok, not that I like it even then! Seriously, I would suggest an abortion to any pregnant teen!)

Canon-Rehash! Especially if the author changes a lot of things (seriously: The butterfly-effect would derail canon sooner or later! Especially if the MC is changed! A more intelligent Harry might not go after the stone or if he did: He might just attack Quirrel from under the cloak or receive the stone and then leave under the cloak, thus avoiding the fight entirely!)! I have read canon, I don't want to read it again! Sorry!

Non-magic AU! Seriously: Why would I be interested in a story that ruins the entire premises by removing the only element that made me read it in the first place (if it's just a coming of age story about a stupid teenager (seriously, canon Harry is a dumb, lazy idiot! I hate Snape, but here I agree with him!)? Boring! Not interested!)! That's like Star Trek without future technology, space ships and techno-babble, stargate without the gate etc. etc.

Magic cores (seriously: I know that some people want to expand on the magic system, but nothing ever suggested there was such a thing and it's just not a plot-device that I like!)

Building mental defenses like a castle (seriously, it's the mind! Visualization is great for transfiguration, but for freaking mental defenses? Come on :( ) or the mind being a library or something!

Harry the poofter (otherwise known as slash! Seriously, no! There was nothing to suggest that Harry was gay in canon and even if you make that adjustment: HPDM? HP/SS? HP/TMR? HP/LM? HP/SB? damned, NO! Call the freaking Obliviators, please! I want those images removed! If Harry were gay then he'd be with a character he at least agrees with! Seriously, nice people aren't with close minded, arrogant, snobbish racists like Draco or murderers like Snape, Lucius and Voldemort!)

Well, that's dumb. People /love/ to vent about what annoys them. And have a discussion whether it's really all that terrible, and authors can have a big long list of what /not/ to do.
