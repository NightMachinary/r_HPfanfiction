#+TITLE: Instead of a sticky post for "best Haphne" which i do whole heartedly support, why don't we have a thread where people can submit their favorite romance fics in general and at the end of the month those fics are listed out and stickied for everyone to look at?

** Because it wont solve the issue. People are still going to make those threads, they dont look at stickies. Removing them will just add additional load on the moderators

And what about fem!arry requests they arent romance fics and still posted daily.

**** Totally off topic but can I just say, Fem! harry is the reason I don't read HP fic on Ao3? I don't despise it or anything, it's just not my jam and it's /never fucking tagged so I can't filter it out/

***** Jfc AO3 is ridiculous. Cross-generation romance is one I don't like, especially Harry/Voldy and similar, and it takes like half an hour to finally filter all that out. And people don't get that you don't have to tag every goddamn character that pokes their head into your fic

****** Tag wranglers exist for that. They make sure that Female Harry, Fem!Harry, etc are the same tag when searching or filtering.

I have never come across a non tagged fem!harry on AO3

****** I mean, you probably haven't missed them, just filter out /looks at filters/ M/M, Harry/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, Hermione/Malfoy, Hermione/Snape and sort by Kudos, and around half of them (or at least the foew pages I've gotten in) are untagged fem harry
