Doesn't matter if it's a crackfic like Seventh Horcrux, which still has some effort put into it. I just want to read some eccentric Luna as a reference for a character.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection]] is one of the earliest, if not /the/ earliest, novel-length Luna-fics in the entire fandom. Effectively, this is Luna's POV of /Order of the Phoenix./

It's also one of the best fics I know.

Luna's eccentricities are treated with a lot of grace. She gets visions, but she's far from Seer!Luna as she barely understands them and even Firenze's advice isn't exactly helpful.

MESR-Luna is bluntly honest, but also kind. Original characters in her housemates are fleshed out--she even develops a tender friendship with one of her housemates who is also the target of bullies.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

*** I too, like to read stories where Snape is doing everything he can to humiliate and abuse Luna Lovegood. Good suggestion.

Luna Lovegood is a prisoner in the Malfoy household. Draco Malfoy is her captor. After months of pain, Luna finally finds some sort of peace, but her safety and security is always under threat. The Dark Lord has plans for Draco, but Draco begins to see the depravity of his family. Their options are limited. Will the force of good finally win, or will darkness prevail?
