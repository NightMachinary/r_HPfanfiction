** Well, I've already recommended It Could Only Happen to Harry.

I'd also recommend (You'll have to search for them yourself):

Nargles in the Air (ff.net)

The Sword of Gryffindor (ff.net)

Crack'd Mirror (ff.net)

Unexpected by simons_flower (restrictedsection.org, requires registering)

If anyone has some suggestions, I'd love to hear them, especially since ff.net did a purge of NC-17 lemons.

** Do you have sort of preference? are you looking for just Nc-17 lemons or what? and also character preferences? short/long?

try [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/search.php?searchtype=advanced][HP Fanfic Archive]] advanced search feature and you can filter to Nc-17 stories and then warnings or characters depending on what you are looking for.

** You might try going to DLP's archive site patronuscharm.net and doing a search for NC-17 fics. They have seventy or so stories of that type last I checked and the site doesn't tolerate M/M slash.
