** Riddle didn't expect anyone aside from the house-elves to know about the room's existence, so he may have felt it was safe to leave it for later.

Besides which, the place was a storehouse of magical trash and mistakes made by students over the last millennium. Picking through garbage looking for diamonds would be beneath him.
