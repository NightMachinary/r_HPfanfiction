I don't want crack either! I want something cute and fluffy where Harry, or somebody in general, likes her. I can see her having horrible self confidence in her appearance because people are cruel to the unconventional, and the love interest squashing her insecurities to dust because they like beings stepped on ü§£

I always imagined her as being big, but not as ugly as the books make her out to be. It's the same for all of the Slytherins for that matter.

Whenever we get a description of a Slytherin in canon, it almost always references a troll, or something not conventionally attractive. While I'm sure there are a lot of troll looking people in Slytherin due to inbreeding, I think there's more than a LOT of bias because Jk projected the hatred of her own bullies onto Slytherin.

I'm sure that Millecent was large, either in stature or weight, but I don't think we can rely on Harry's also biased opinion of her looking like a hag. He never compliments a Slytherin's appearance to my knowledge, beyond Tom being handsom. It's always insults. She may not have been the prettiest, but I don't think she's as bad as the books make her out to be.

But because she's not a dainty cute girl, and instead has a strong build with muscle, she's immediately called ugly. Even Hermione had to fix her teeth and get a makeover for people to realize she was, in fact, a SHE. It's the same with Millicent. There's sooo much vanity to be had in HP.

Times are changing! We've got people simping over absolute QUEENS like Lady Dimitrescu, it's time for the big girls to shine! Gimme Millicent fics dangit!

Sorry that this turned into a rant....

  The tiniest wish can make all the difference. A Slytherin-sorted Harry, a not so soft Narcissa, and a very, very large familiar are just a few things to take note of when Severus does not see James Potter when he first looks at Harry. Hiatus: 1/12-3/12 .

  ‚ÄúI don't have to justify my place here to you.‚Äù Millicent's voice is like ice, and Hermione can't help herself from flinching, pulling back in her seat to put more distance between them. She's faced down dark wizards, but this feels different. Hermione feels her cheeks warm and thinks about trying to apologise, to take back her words or say something to take away the sting of them, but before she can say anything Millicent snaps, ‚ÄúWhy are you here?‚Äù After the war Hermione tries to make up for her wartime by working in the Department of Magical Accidents. She's not expecting to end up working at a desk opposite one Millicent Bulstrode, but she'll put up with whatever she has to, if it gives her a chance at getting her parents' memories back.

** On FFN, author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10223509/Bfd1235813][Bfd1235813]] includes Millicent in a few stories.

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13329524/1/Millicent-in-Bloom][Millicent in Bloom]]" is focused on her maturation and growth to becoming a remarkable witch. Plus it pairs her with Neville. linkffn(13329524)

The "Wheels Within Wheels" series is focused on Harry/Daphne. Millicent is a secondary character that is close friends with HP/DG, works at Hogwarts as the DADA professor and Head of Slytherin, and is paired with Ginny. Millicent is properly introduced in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12883797/1/Part-Two-Wheels-Within-Wheels][part 2]].

  Ever pick up a yearbook, see a photo, and wish you could ask someone, "Whatever happened to...?" Of course you have. Everyone has, except for liars. Hermione transformed herself into Millicent Bulstrode's cat. This leads inevitably, in some cases, to speculation about what Millicent eventually transformed into. One possibility follows.

** I also love Millicent Buldtrode romance and seek it.

On Low Self-Esteem Millicent specifically... I've taken so long to write this I forget if linkao3(219120) was already posted or not, but as I recall it's a story where an unhappily married to Ginny Harry finds happiness with Millicent.

I'm not going to recommend Lord of Darkness. I'll just note it's among other things an Overpowered!Slytherin!Harry harem fic where a signup sheet for Sexytimes With Harry gets posted in the Slytherin common room and he fully commits, method actor style, to girls' fantasy sexual roleplay scenarios. And there's a scene from Millicent Bulstrode's POV where she's finally worked up the courage to sign up, but she's still embarrassed that her sex fantasy is "I have a boyfriend who loves me and actually wants to sleep with me".

Then there's "Surprise Child" by Harry50 where 5th Year she abuses her Inquisitorial Squad authority to get Harry alone in a room where she begs him for a pity fuck so she won't be a virgin forever. And then post-war they run into each other in the Muggle world.

Moving on to where her self esteem is less plot-critical, there's a few stories where Millicent and Harry salvage each other's night at the Yule Ball... in one she's explicitly not part troll but part orc, which was kind of wierd. Basically meant she was more of a martial artist.

Linkao3(493374) is a real good post-war oneshot with Millicent and Dudley.

linkao3(17447231) is tagged as Harry/Millicent but as of the last update in December they were I think still just at the "friends developing feelings" stage. In that one she actually is part troll.

  Harry never wanted to be unique. He only ever wanted to be Harry, just Harry. In one brave, or perhaps foolish moment, someone lets him know he is not alone and that changes everything.

** I can't remember the name of the story but I think there was one where Millicent became a slightly more significant figure when my name is sorted into Ravenclaw And Harry was sorted into Slytherin, Harry became friends with a kid named Terry boot who is in Hufflepuff And Hermione became friends with Millicent. Ron was like a character on the periphery in that story and like Harry's court group of friends became Terry boot Millicent bowl bullstrode and Hermione Granger And Terry boot was basically the equivalent of Ron without the 12 siblings I'm sorry six siblings I can't quite remember how many Weasley's there actually are at the moment I'll have to look it up.

** linkffn(Harry the Weapon by slytherinsal). Harry rescues Millie from the troll, comforts her about her looks, and enters into a betrothal with her. Sounds like just what you asked for.

  Vernon gets the smarts when accidental magic in response to a bellow breaks the compulsion to be mean to Harry. He is well sore with the magical world which is making a child soldier by grooming Harry, so he decides to turn the weapon back on them by teaching Harry all he needs to survive.

**** AU characters don't bother me much, as long as there's an explanation that I can accept. This one uses a reason I can accept, which is right there in the description - resentment at being used, and wanting to upset the plans of whoever treated him so cavalierly.
