** That kind of fic assumes that Grindelwald wanted to break out of prison and continue is reign. So let's look at it.

He didn't even die until Voldemort started looking for the elder wand. That suggests that numengrad is really impregnable or he's completely lost his powerbase.

We see that Numengrad isn't impregnable when Voldemort kills him so that leaves us with an either non existent power base or a severely diminished one. So even if he had a Horcrux he would have almost nobody to rely on to bring him back from a spirit.

On a whole it sounds like a fantastic idea but I've never seen one, sadly.

*** Yeah I wish we knew more about nurmengrad. Voldemort attacking an impregnable prison would have been a lot more interesting than prolonged camping in DH.

** Uh, I'd love to read a fic for this. Where voldi killed Grindelwald and Grindelwald comes to power (good or bad) after Voldi is defeated. I would like to read that from a view from Grindelwald, though.

*** Maybe both HP and GG povs. Cos I'd like to see Harry actually step up and figure this one out on his own without all the good luck and deus ex machina

** I'm more interested in a Grindelwald breaking out of Nurmengard and finishing 'where Albus had left off".

Requires a complete rewrite of DH.

*** Under this scenario, Grindelwald was convinced by Dumbledore during their duel that his means had failed and that his visions required a different approach. So he yielded and voluntarily went into exile in Nurmengard.

Dumbledore continued with a far more subtle approach and had been successful until late 60s, when his efforts were derailed by Tom Riddle. Many times, Grindelwald considered breaking out, but his friend assured him that things were under control.

With Albus' death in 1997, Grindelwald decided that enough was enough. He broke out, rallied his followers and sympathizers, infiltrated into Britain, and began openly contesting Voldemort's rule.

**** That would make DH a lot more interesting and I would love to see how it ends - GG sacrificing himself so HP can get the killing blow maybe or vice versa. And what does the wizarding world look like at the end of it all?

***** I'd like to see Gellert derailing Voldemort's attempt to murder Muggleborns, decimating his Death Eaters and Ministry minions, and devising a ritual that targeted Voldemort's Horcrux weakened soul directly. In the end, he used himself as the sacrifice for this ritual to destroy Voldemort and redeem himself. Far fewer good people died, the children at Hogwarts suffered far less, and the Trio became far more powerful under his tutelage.

** linkffn(Harry Riddle) Grindelwald's Horcrux replaces Voldemort in going after the Philosophers Stone. He also considers Voldemort as a mere upstart. The Dark Lord of the Prophecy was actually Grindelwald, who Voldemort did defy.

  What if Tom Marvolo Riddle was Harry's biological father?
