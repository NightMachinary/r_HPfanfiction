Ok so Harry won. He's just sitting on the edge enjoying his victory but then the Elder Wand starts talking. Harry, having dealt with enough cursed shit breaks it immediately shouting he wanted to stop dealing with all this crap.

Suddenly he's back under the stairs but he's different. He's his same age but his body hurts.

He's now in a world where the Wizarding world died. The war had never stopped with voldemorts death so by the time Harry was supposed to get a letter the entire magical world he grew up in is gone.

You could set this story in any other universe like DC or Marvel.

A plot point could be Harry learning a new magic system or something.

Him having hedwig back as a magical creature egg could be in it.
