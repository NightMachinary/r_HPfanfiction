*** I like him as a scared man that was over his head. He dug himself a hole and couldn't get out of it so he just kept digging. Staying would have been out of guilt, self hate, and depression. He's not frothing at the mouth evil like Voldemort or Bellatrix; he does have empathy. I don't even think it'd be a well thought out plan. He'd just scurry in an sit in a corner and watch these people neglect his friends toddler. No matter what went down, years of friendship and feelings don't just leave and I'm pretty sure he knew this kid as a happy, well-cared-for baby; so watching the son of one of his most obnoxious friends learning to be quiet would be it's own special kind of hell. Peter'd just be the rat that's been in the cupboard all Harry's life who sleeps a lot and doesn't mind being petted. I'd be surprised if Peter hadn't been hanging out there in the first place and had a fantastically terrible surprise when Harry is first thrown in there. He'd expect to be grabbed and manhandled like kids usually do, but this is a kid whose watched his cousin break a lot of his toys and this rat may be fat and smelly but it hasn't bitten him so now he's Harry's rat. The thing is, no one is helping this kid learn to read or cares about his schooling at all. Academia isn't a priority for kids who aren't taught that and encouragement is a key part of kids doing well in school. He'd probably be the smelly kid who never turned in their homework and read slow in class. The bravest thing Peter'd ever do would be turning into a human in order to be someone who cares about this kids wellbeing. Harry'd just think that his rat man, who sort of acts like a dad and accidentally let it slip that he knew his parents, was the only person who loved him.
