Any character changes/additions that wasn't in canon ( or was less exaggerated or shown differently) that you have seen for specific characters and dislike. And how would you prefer them be potrayed? Its ok if your preferred potrayal isnt canon.

For example

I dislike Asshole Ron having his flaws dialled up to 11 and his positive qualities erased or given to others.

I'd prefer his qualities about being good at strategy was highlighted more and him being the best at being a people person in the trio and understanding the culture the best was utilized more much more than it was in canon too. I think it would be a interesting place to take his character.

Its also for the record fine if you do this with characters not well explored in canon like Daphne or Pansy.


** That'd be glittery sugar-high idiotic perpetual child Sirius. I respect others' right to enjoy that kind of portrayal, but I'd prefer to see the brilliance and the dark edge alongside the the warm loyalty and silly sense of humor.

** The Ginny Hate in a lot of fanfiction drives me mad.

She was a little girl who got shy around her crush in the books, that somehow translates into her being an obsessed stalker.

Also one of the main ways those writers justify Harry not wanting to be with her is that she is a LilyClone... because they both have red hair i suppose. Nowhere is it even hinted that their hair is even close to the same shade, never mind all the other physical features that would have to be similar

*** the lillyclone comment i think is a result a bit of fanart

if you just write her description next to lilly's you wont necessarily think they are super similar. The actresses who play them dont look very alike either.

But if you took a bunch of Harry/Ginny fanart and a bunch of Lilly/James fanart didnt label which was which and asked people to find Harry/Ginny it would be kinda a struggle. Unless you could see the color of Harrys eyes. Fanartists individually have different takes on both. Same for Harry and James. But if you look up a crap ton of fanart for both it becomes pretty difficult to distinguish between the two. Compared to say Hermione and Ginny whose distinguishing features arent at all similar.

** Uber-competent Hermione that keeps calm in every situation and knows (how to solve) everything. She is just walking exposition most of the time.

I'd like more of a flawed canon-like Hermione who is emotional and lacks empathy (e.g.: keeping Bug-Rita in a jar, proving her "I-knew-better" when Lavender got the message about her bunny, etc.).

â€‹

I'd also like to see less of "Ice Queen" Daphne. I love what Fanon made out of a character that was only mentioned once, but there should be more diversity.

Though that is something I'd wish for all Slytherin characters (and to a degree all Hogwarts students), because they are students and while the rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin may be bad, it should only be a school rivalry and not like cold war where everyone is suspect of being the enemy. More fics with inter-house friendships where Harry is not the driving factor and it's "oh, so brave" that he tries to close the gap.

** I'd argue for Ron being the best people persob honestly. I usually write him as emotional, but very protective. I almost always have him prioritizing his friends feelings over his own knee jerk reaction. He keeps his friends close but has a certian... Ronness about him that let's him be more open to others. But I digress.

I hate magically forgiven Draco/omgSOsorry Draco

I write dramione so I get it. It is super easy to just write away all flaws to pave the way for a romantic adventure. But like... the whole enemy/ redemption thing is why the pairing is interesting. Otherwise just write a Harry/Hermione

Having the "all was for her" the whole time is weak. Fucking. Sauce. I'll buy that he teased her because he didn't understand his own feelings. I can get behind him realizing and hating her for it. I'll take any post canon reason not based in the past.

I REFUSE the whole 'i joined the dark lord because he promised to keep you safe' bullshit. (Because /that/ worked out so well last time.)

Naw. Draco needs to earn his redemption. He was a shit and likely still is a spoilt brat depending on the new time line. He needs to apologize and make amends or Hermione feels like she's shallow and oblivious.

***** i think it depends on how you interpret Draco?

to me based on the books he was snobbish from the start but also eager to please and since he is 11 at the start easily influenced by his peers.

He doesn't start dropping slurs till second year. So my personal headcanon is while he grew up around supremacists and picked up on his parents disliking muggleborns but they found it distasteful to discuss it. So he grew up indifferent to them and not needing to form a opinion since he never encountered them. Once he got to school he happened befriend more openly bigoted people to muggleborns and after became friends they were more vocal about muggleborns because they had more occasion to be saw them more. Draco went from more indifferent to more hateful. His parents saw and approved he kmew they would since he was already aware of their feelings. He saw no reason to hide it from them. His friends supported the bigorty and with their backing he got comfortable enough to openly use slurs.

A different set of friends could push him in the other direction learning to be more accepting. Doesnt have to be Harry's + friends either. It can be other slytherins. He still is haughty petty prideful and competitive but not a bigot putting him at odds with his family. He feels uncomfortablr being open around them. So he ends up kind of like in Sirius's position with his own family.

***** Yes, it definitely feels weak by itself - even Snape had other reasons for joining the dark lord before he ended up begging him for Lily's life. It needs to be coupled with something else, whether other reasons Draco's not acknowledging to himself, or character growth where he realizes how stupid he was back then. Or, I guess, he could be using it as a lie - in which case Hermione will laugh at him for either being stupid or telling a transparent lie.

***** Thats a bit hard I guess i think I have a better idea on what I wouldnt want

any sort of flaw in wizard society involving supremacy id avoid because others can do it way better than him.

Anything involving jealousy id avoid 1. Because its a thing he already works to keep controlled

1. Its been adressed several times in both canon and fanon so its repetitive

I guess the closest I could think would be being very ambitious and desperate to prove himself leads to him doing some terrible stuff at least for a while.

I think basically looking for potential chsracter flaws he has that people havent repeatedly used before which in the case of Ron is kinda hard to find.

I think part of the reason non asshole versions of Ron is more appealing at the moment ( at least to me) is because I've seen his positive qualities highlighted less. Even if they are highlighted its for when he's a supporting character rather than the main focus. So there is more untapped potential there. Something i havent seen as much of before. Asshole Ron/Bad guy Ron I have and I personally cant think of any flaw to highlight or a direction to go I havent seen already several times with that premise.

That is all very true though, plus it's not like you can't do bad things to a Good Ron too, if that's the thing that gets Bad!Ron writers going. I've been mulling over a thing where Harry dies at the end and Ron gets to gank Voldemort. He gets the credit, the fame, the glory, becomes something more than 'the youngest weasley brother', but loses his best friend in the process. It'd be some fascinating character development to work through. :)

Absoluteky Harry or Hermione dying would do that.

But I think its more of a challenge if Hermione dies from a writing perspective because she's a easy person to make talented and just know things. Though in the feels department both are equal

Any family member i think would do it

though either parent dying I think would hurt alot. And for siblings dying personally i think Ginny or either of the twins Ron was closest to. They have the least age diff especially him and Ginny. But the twins are relevant earlier so you see the relationship more.
