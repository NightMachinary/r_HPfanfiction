** The oldest/first one I remember reading was Draco Dormiens by Cassandra Clare someone might have a link but it was part of a very long trilogy and I remember thinking it was very interesting at the time. Apparently it's where the “Draco in leather pants” trope comes from [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Draco_Trilogy]]
