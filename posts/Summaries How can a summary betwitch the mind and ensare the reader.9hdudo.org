** A description has one job, attract people and give them an idea of what to expect. Flowery language, exaggerations and questions do not help in that regard, so they should be avoided. Stuff like "eternal love", "best fighter"

#+begin_quote
  During the Battle in the Department of Mysteries Nymphadora Tonks finds herself thrown back to the beginning of Fifth Year. With two Tonks walking around and her faith in Dumbledore eroded what's a Metamorphmagus to do? Protect Harry Potter at all costs, that's what! Tonks ends up crafting a new identity for herself and infiltrates Hogwarts to fix the future. Pairing: Harry/Tonks.
#+end_quote

From "Like Grains of Sand in an Hourglass". It makes it clear that the story has a unique concept and what to expect but does not spoil how things will play out.

#+begin_quote
  Due to a shift in turian and quarian patrols, first contact for humanity is friendly; Rael'Zorah and Hannah Shepard become friends, as do their species. But the galaxy is not a safe place, and schisms develop when the Council steps in. As humanity finds new allies among the stars, something darker stirs. The Meek must beware, for it is nearly harvest time.
#+end_quote

From "And the Meek shall inherit the galaxy". Also pretty straightforward. It tells you what changes were made to the universe but reminds you that shit is still about to hit the fan.

#+begin_quote
  Governmental contracts usually go to the lowest bidder. Even in galaxies far, far away. And, here or there, you get what you pay for.
#+end_quote

From "Food Scandal". It's a Star Wars fanfic with half of the imperial high command as tagged characters. It is vague enough to stir interest and there's an odd rift between expectations (STAR WARS, Darth Vader) and the content which follows, which can be intriguing if not overdone.

#+begin_quote
  Mass Effect. Two centuries after the Reaper War, Liara and Shepard live a reclusive life far from civilisation. To the rest of the galaxy the reapers have become little more than a legend, but for those who lived through the war Shepard is still a hero and when the asari decide to reclaim Thessia, she finds herself drawn back into galactic politics.
#+end_quote

From "Living Legends". It teases a rather unbelievable premise (people forgetting about a galactic annihilation event) which isn't that absurd if you think about it. And at that point, the reader is already intrigued because they want to find out what happened for the galactic equivalent of Holocaust denial to happen. I mean, the basic premise is like Admiral Nelson walking into Downing Street and telling Thatcher that he'll reclaim the Falklands and invade Argentina with a few thousand men.

Descriptions which make you think, like the last two examples, are great because if the reader does not outright dismiss them, they are already engaged and want to find out if their thoughts are right.

**** You have basically two tweets worth of characters and the tags to give people an idea of what will happen in your story. For example, my own "Under Guard" has the following description:

#+begin_quote
  If anybody would have told Hermione a week ago that she would find herself enamoured after a shared Kebab, she would have pointed the person towards St Mungo's ward for permanent spell damage.
#+end_quote

That is vague. And yet with Romance/Humor and Hermione G./N. Tonks tags, it tells people exactly what to expect. But if your description says:

#+begin_quote
  Per Aspera ad Astra. Harry had no idea how true that proverb was.
#+end_quote

and just Harry, Adventure and General are tagged, people will have no clue what to do and many will dismiss it as not within their interests. Significantly fewer people will dismiss a story because the description is too blunt.

You can have vague and yet clear descriptions which tell you what overall themes to expect, but not what will happen. For example, my own story "Dawn of Darkness"

#+begin_quote
  When Harry invited Tonks to Slughorn's Christmas party, he never expected to stumble into a relationship with his friend. Nor did he expect to be engulfed by a Web of intrigue and deceit woven across Europe.
#+end_quote

Tagged Mystery/Adventure, Harry/Tonks, OC, Penelope Clearwater. Again, pretty straightforward, Harry gets together with Tonks, shit hits the fan, the action moves to places outside of Britain, a lot of OCs and Penelope Clearwater is involved somehow. But what will happen remains unknown.

** My favourite summary is from Hermiome Granger's Hogwarts Crammer For Delinquent on the Run. For starters it's funny, but I think importantly as well it makes you ask a lot of questions and you really want to know the answers to them. Why hasn't Harry gone to Hogwarts? How will this change the story? And so on.

**** You're right that if you were to see this on a shelf you wouldn't know what to expect. But I think that as it's fanfiction it works better assuming the the foreknowledge of the reader. The reader knows the significance of the events indicated in the description and the reader knows as a consequence some of the things that would be expected.I think adding anything else to the summary would spoil the sense of discovery you get reading it.

So definitely yes for brevity working it's favour. I have found with fanfiction that often the simplest summaries are the most eye-catching, one's that only hint and the story contained within-and make you want answers.

** This thread shows how subjective it is. And in fanfiction---especially as a writer---it's easy to lose sight of the fact that the majority of readers are looking for a very particular sort of fic and if your fic isn't what they want, the sexiest summary in the world won't make them read it. And if your fic /is/ what they are looking for it won't matter how rubbish the summary is; they will still read it.

What intigues and entices one person is a red flag to another, though there seems to be more agreement about what makes a really bad one. Personally, I want the summary to give me an idea what sort of story it is, who the main characters are, and ideally give a sense of the writer's style.

I remember a while back clicking on a summary which really drew me in (I don't remember what it was but I must have seen it on here). The story was a terrible disappointment: nowhere near what I was expecting. I thought the summary must have been written by someone else---which if it was workshopped on a forum, It might have been.

I've seen several people say they don't like summaries which are an excerpt from the story, but generally I do like that myself if it gives a flavour of the writing style.

I've never felt very confident in my own summaries. I've tried several different styles and rewritten some more than once. But I don't know that it ever made much difference.

Out of curiosity I looked at the first page on ffn and most of the summaries seemed okay. (Two I thought were absolutely terrible.) There wasn't anything exciting enough to make me look at a fic with a subject that didn't already interest me but if I liked stories about Hermione there were several I would have clicked on. There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer.

  From my perspective the majority of the summaries on the first page of ffn today are just too generic to interest me. Once you've seen sufficient repetitions of same pattern doesn't it become a little wearing to just look at a list of fics which on the surface of the summary are practically interchangeable?
#+end_quote

I share that perspective, but I'm not really anybody's target audience. I think that a large proportion---if not the majority---of fanfic readers want exactly that. They want more of the same; that's what brought them to fic in the first place.

** Okay, so I'm super biased and thus maybe it's actually bad, but my current short story's summary ("Phantom Pains of Paradise") intentionally embodies the general way I think summaries should be done:

​

" Mortal minds were not meant to see the splendor of the Beyond before their time came, not even the Master of Death. After slaying Voldemort, Harry must find something to help him come to grips with his sojourn to the afterlife lest the temptation of the Veil win out... "

​

What summaries are supposed to do is tantalize prospective readers into reading them. You need to be just informative enough that they have an idea about what will happen broadly, but not enough that they know exactly how things are and how they will end so that they're motivated to check it out (hence having a plan for your story is necessary). So hint at something important to the story (themes, events, etc.) without directly spelling them out and describe it in an interesting way.

** I tend to read stories if the summary establishes the MC, the hook or unique feature of the story, and a reference to some specific part of the conflict the MC will face. Usually in that order. linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel)

I usually avoid stories if the summary is phrased like "In which Draco is confused, Harry just wants to protect everyone, and Hermione is trying hard not laugh." I've seen it used a thousand times and it reveals nothing about why I should read your story. I also avoid obvious rhetorical questions in the summary, like "what would happen if..../story conditions/?" Because they take away any chance at creating intrigue.

One exception is Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time, I haven't read it yet, but I want to because the summary IS ensnaring and has a wonderful cadence. Most people attempt to copy that and fail, so you get uselessly vague and wordy descriptions :/

** I'm not sure any summary has ever enthralled me (though the one from Temporal Knight is one that also caught my eye). For me, good summaries locate the story. They give me a basic idea of the point in or outside of canon that they're set, who the main character is going to be, and a hint at one or two of the main premises.

So, for example, the summary to /A Place Past Loss/ is a nice example. I can tell from it that it's going to be angsty, probably a little gritty at least, and play with canon characters in a new way. Yeah, I'll click on that. linkffn(10621216)

Another good one is the one for /Bungle in the Jungle/. While this is the sort of story you love or you hate, the summary made me decide to read it, just because I wanted to see if it really /was/ the one HP fanfic I should read tonight, and if it really was all that unusual. linkffn(2889350)

Finally, the unfortunately abandoned /Fortune Favors the Damned/ is a great example of a teasing summary. We know Harry, Sirius, and an AU are involved, and the final phrase gives the impression that the writing will have a touch of humor. Sure, let's give it a shot! linkffn(4929285) Compare /Harry Gets Motivated/ linkffn(3427377)

What's most important for me, however, are summaries as the principal way I'm turned /off/ by a story. They're what make me decide /not/ to click. For example, I still haven't read /Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus/ because the prose in the summary really seemed melodramatic and cloying to me. Also, if the summary is poorly written, contains marker words for tropes I dislike ("Totally Bashing!" "soul bond!" "trip to Gringotts!"), or hypothetical questions, I usually move right on.

In general, then, summaries don't tend to recommend stories to me so much as they tell me I don't want to spend my time seeing if a story is worth reading.

** I regard [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]'s summary as a good one:

'As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.'

The sense of humour, clear definition of who the characters are and Lily's part in the story and general style give the reader a clear idea of what the story itself will be like. As you don't know who Wizard Lenin is you're left with that slight desire to discover what on Earth is going to happen in the story.

I'm not sure where you're getting a clear idea of anything, because this summary is nothing but flowery language. It reads like a college freshman trying too hard in their English class. It tells us nothing about the plot, nothing about the characters other than names, and generally fails at everything a summary needs to do. There's being vague and mysterious in order to draw readers in, and then there's this which lays no foundation for anything by being far too vague. Who is Lily? Is she Harry's mother? Is she his daughter? Is she a female version of Harry?

All this summary tells us is that there is a girl who lived and her name is Lily, and she's death personified, whatever that is supposed to mean. Oh and there's some dude called Lenin. That's not a summary, that's just an assortment of statements that only make sense to the author. The entire summary is just nonsensical, which I presume the story is too.

The plot of that story is vague at best, the characters are often little more than their names and the question of who Lily is plagues the character in many ways throughout the story.

​

I love lily and the art of being sisyphyus. A better summary though would probably be one of the more humorous quotes. Like how a movie trailer is a combo of scenes:

​

"I would infinitely prefer it if you referred to me as something other than... Lily, do you have any way of getting out of this cupboard once locked in?" asks the newly awoken voice in her head with acryllic-painted patience...
