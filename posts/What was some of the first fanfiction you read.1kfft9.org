** I started off reading Sherlock and FMA fanfiction. It was those two that I came across my first Harry Potter Fanfiction, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] which is a VERY slow paced story that follows Remus through his school years.

It was not the first I read though. At that time I had no interest in HP fanfiction as I assumed they rated little better than the work of twilight fanatics.

The first one I ever broke down and read was [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2086067/1/Wishcraft][Wishcraft]] because I love Sirius centric stories, the story was pretty good. From that author's favorites list I found [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land][A Stranger in an Unholy Land]]. That took a full weekend to read but it cemented my love for Harry Potter fanfics.

Eventually I returned to read that first fic that I stumbled upon and gave it a fair chance. These days I can't get enough of HP and rarely bother looking at other fandoms.

Also, your link is a little off, this one works: [[http://hopewashere04.webs.com/Story%20List/Collisions/Story%20List.htm][A Collision With Hope]]
