It may be a silly question, but one of the thing that bothers me with this whole "only three schools for Europe as a whole, and one of them is England exclusive" is how the students and the teachers of different nationality would communicate. And it's even worse when you think about the other continents, each having only one or two schools.

So do they all speak English, which would be dumb imo ? Do they have some kind of magic translators? Are they separated by nationality in the schools?

Apart from language, one of the consequences of so little schools is that hundreds of culture are neglected in jk Rowling's canon. If you think about it, a big part of culture, history, language etc is transmitted from education in school, especially if the children are in a boarding school with limited contact with their family from a young age. Even if we consider that wizarding culture and muggle culture are different, they still influence each other, or are influenced by the same external factor (environment, the politics are somehow linked, they share a language),so there has to be way mor wizarding communities than there are schools. So basically in this canon England has its own culture, and all the other continents are grouped in a big bag with nearly no diversity, and that kind of pisses me of the more I think about it.

So what started as a dumb question turned into quite a rambling, my bad. Am I the only one bothered by this?


** Well, seeing as french was the most widely spoken language in europe around the time the statute of secrecy went in to effect, I think it would be the obvious choice. Especially in a french school. The only other option in my opinion would be latin, due to its magical nature, and because it was the original european lingua franca.

Then you'd need probably 1-3 more in Africa - I'd lean towards Ethiopia and Mali myself, as they could add some 'ancient magical history' to add to the world. But in any case there'd almost certainly have to be a ton of less prestigious schools all around

She says that there are 11 prestigious schools the ICW recognizes. This is probably more akin to ivy league schools than normal universities.

With the tiny amount of wizards in the world, several nations probably don't have wizards or not enough to run a big school.

Then you have Africa, with the most cultures and languages in the world... It makes sense there is only one western school. Most tribes probably teach their own.

India is probably the same as is Indonesia and any island nations.

*** My headcanon is following (and largely discards JKR's ideas):

- Hogwarts-style centralized institutions aren't the only possible model (and Hogwarts themselves are modeled after English boarding school, so even there's a lot of room for local flavor), in fact I'd say they account for a relatively small proportion of wizarding students worldwide. Those that have long continuous traditions are rare outside of Europe and Americas, and even the European institutions have continuous tradition that dates back to middle ages at most.

- Outside of those geographical and temporal constraints they are either defunct, largely diminished in status compared to their heyday, or simply historically and culturally weren't a thing to begin with and any schools in those areas are recent developments. The influence of Muggle world on the wizarding one is IMO far larger than either side cares to admit, and only post-Statute wizarding community is truly "safe" from any large state upheavals.

Per area and historical period:

- Mediterranean in the antique and classical era? For Greece and Levant (incl. their colonies) I'm going with the time-and-period accurate "philosophical school" model. One founder, no more than two or three assistants, at most 20 students, school usually dissolved due to founder's death or split into several lesser ones due to disagreements etc.. Romans and Carthaginians might have had a smaller scale institutions, but those didn't outlive their respective empires by much.

- Middle East + North Africa - Might have had actual wizarding institutions dating back to ancient Babylon, Persia and Egypt, plus if we're staying with the culture, a new one would be established in Andalucía for a total of perhaps 4. Generally defunct for various reasons (Reconquista, Mongols, religious fundamentalism etc), any current day institutions are descendants in name only.

- Europe - apprenticeship model continues (although the percentage declines rapidly), plus I'd say that until about 14th-15th century a lot of the older and more established universities (Salamanca, Bologna..) had legit magic faculties, the English universities and Sorbonne being the exemptions there. Total number of schools would be perhaps seven major plus some minor, all founded from 11th to 18th centuries (Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are merely the oldest, being founded to compensate for lack of other viable formalized education), all having particular areas - Hogwarts is obvious, Beauxbatons accepted students from Spain, Portugal and Italy after the Muggle university faculties closed down, Durmstrang is located either in Transylvania or somewhere in the Baltic states, plus there would be one in Scandinavia, european Russia, one of the German speaking countries and last would cover the other spot not taken by Durmstrang.

- Americas - apprenticeships, schools only took off after European colonization (and at least originally were founded by colonists, for colonists). Two in US/Canada (one on each coast), one in Brazil, one in Mexico (Yucatán?), one on the west coast of South America (either Peru or Chile). Smaller institutions may exist in the Caribbean and southeast South America (somewhere in the vicinity of La Plata)

- Japan has one large school that dates back to Meiji era, plus a number of smaller traditional schools (handful of teachers, no more than 20-30 students, modeled roughly on martial arts dojos), and the even more traditional apprenticeship model is still going strong

- India - any pan-Indian institution would be a British created one (again - mostly for the Brits), and either defunct or languishing on the verge of dissolution since Indian independence, but there is a myriad of smaller, regional ones, instructing in local languages

- China - eh. No ideas tbh, but likely some combination of apprenticeships, last vestiges of Imperial-era instututions and new ones of varying ages.

- Sub-saharan Africa - would be a combination of colonial-era schools (with French or English as language of instruction) that are past their prime and apprenticeships, some areas might have had independent schools (Ethiopia..).

******* Right, you'd have to explore when the wizarding society was in a position where such a language would be useful. My thought is the Roman empire, connecting all these disparate wizarding societies that hadn't known each other existed priorly. If apparition came about around the same time (maybe as a military innovation by Roman war-mages) that'd help explain it too.

Thus, wizenglot would be heavily Latin-influenced, but maybe with magical components like parseltongue has. Hence spells being in what sounds like pseudo-Latin, perhaps.

If it's a magical conlang, it could be enchanted to be easily learned by wizards, but impossible for muggles (motivated by superiority and wanting to keep arcane secrets, not by the Statute since that didn't exist until recently). That would make muggleborn integration easier, if the language teaches itself to them.

**** I'm HoH (hard of hearing) and did speech therapy but I also have a BAHA (bone anchored hearing aid) and wear two behind the ear hearing aids as well. So I always wonder about the DHH in relation to the magical world.

I would think most purebloods who has a child with hearing loss would use a spell to make it go away, aka "fix" them.

But what about muggleborn? By 11 many would have hearing aids and communicating in their local sign language. Thet might be offered the spell but many students might have developed a Deaf identity by then and don't see their hearing loss as a disability just that they belong to a different culture.

I know it's a small population but it's got to exist.

***** Yes 11 is incredibly late to change your whole communicating system and for many trying a magical fix could do more harm than good. Ivm not sure how the wizarding world would react to this, but seeing how squib are treated I fear it would be far from ideal.

Also, it made me think could muggle born children accidentally "fix" themselves with accidental magic and I'm not sure about my thought on that matter. What would be your opinion on this ?

****** That's a really interesting point about accidental magic. 95% I think it close to deaf or HoH children are born to hearing parents who aren't familiar with Deaf culture. More and more hearing parents are educating themselves about Deaf culture, new bilingual bicultural (the new method of Deaf ed teach ASL as a Native language L1. DHH children cant acquire English naturally because they cant hear it and they miss the cutoff to learn a full complete language which is a main reason the average Deaf adult reads at a grade 3 level.

I think if there was a case of accidental magic by a child to "fix" his hearing it would be a child whose parents get SUPER upset about finding out their child is DHH. Like end of the world, sadly it still happens If their parents were outwardly devastated and angry their accidental magic would feed off those powerful emotions and might "fix" what's making mum and dad so upset.

***** JKR's take is that wizards just don't develop muggle illnesses and disabilities which begs the question of why some characters have glasses.

Proportionately, very few deaf children use sign language in the UK. Especially if they don't have Deaf parents - there's not the funding to teach it and a very strong oralist push. Two of my BSL teachers - both profoundly Deaf - weren't allowed to use any sign at all until their parents caved and sent them to Deaf schools for secondary. (So, they didn't learn to sign until they were 11.)

If we assume Gryffindor is about average for pupils then we're looking at 280 pupils per year, so chances are that they've not got any pupils with any level of deafness and given there's more mild deafness than profound, we can probably assume that where it does come up the children can coast. Or if lucky get someone to show them a charm/object to function as a hearing aid.

My guess would be that they turf them out like squibs, but I'd like to think there were special spells to convert it speech into thoughts or the like.

I'm an oddball in that I have a moderate loss and was taught and educated with sign as well as English and I can't begin to tell you how much my adult audiologists HATE it because I 'don't need it'.

****** Just a generation before us at residential schools Deaf children were required to go to and oralism ruled classrooms and kids weren't allowed to sigb.

Our generation (I'm guessing you're slightly bear my age I'm 31) Total Communication TC had become the accepted edicatfinal system for children. This included sign systems like Signing Exaxt English SEE2, Seeing Essential English 2, use a mix of made up signs and signs from ASL, BSL, Auslan, etc The idea was to teach DHH children to read English but they finally learned any system based off English wasn't working for children born or very early are profoundly Deaf and recieve no help from HAs, because unless they were signed to in a real language they hadn't been exposed to a full language let alone acquiring a new one in a weird forced way. In the US the average Deaf adult reads at a 3rd grade level, failed by both oralism and to a lesser extent made up fake sign systems made by hearing individuals.

That led to the new model emerging, bicultural/bilingual education. The idea is to teach ASL, BSL etc. as a first language L1 Hearing childrens language development comes from the minute they're born hearing language spoken around them, then babbling then using simple words. This can happen to DHH kids who develop by seeing sign language used by adults around them. Then their L1 is used to teach all their subject throughout school. English is introduced as a second language L2. The higher and more advanced the grasp of their L1 the better their L2 will be.

Most DHH children are born to hearing parents. But there's been a huge change in early years programs in the US, UK, Canada to encourage sign language use even if the parents also use hearing aids or implants. I have both and it's a mistake to assume it gives me perfect hearing. I have to be facing people directly to speak with them using sound clues, body language, context and very minor lip reading. If there's too much background noise, no dice. There are more and more bi/bi day schools and the bi/bi method is becoming adopted by special ed teachers in mainstreamed public schools.

I know theres a strong tradition of oralism in the UK. The disgusting Mary Hare School should be shut down. But on the ground level change is starting.

Sorry for the long answer to your question, many DHH children with HAs and who can speak will also use Pigin at the very lease a mix of English and their native sign language especially to communicate with DHH friends. They may not be advanced and rely solely on ASL, BSL, Auslan, etc. but they have a basic grasp. I'm in that latter category, I have profound loss in one year severe in the other, have a bone anchored hearing aid BAHA implant and use two behind the ear BTE hearing aids., having use signed English in schools, I was able to succeed because I have residual hearing with my HAs. English is my L1 and it's hard going from SE to ASL in my case, I feel disconnected from the Deaf community because of that and it's not by choice. Sometimes I wish I was 10-15 years younger to be able to attend one of these amazing new programs.

Do you use BSL professionally or personally? Or was your class just to learn. I studied Deaf ea and would really like to go to grad school at Gallaudet but my ASL needs to be way better since all the classes are taught in sign. So I'm just curious like that :)

Thanks for such a great response!

******* Do you use BSL professionally or personally?

I used to live in another area where I used sign far more, but here is more challenging despite having a bigger Deaf community - it's harder to get into I guess. I do use it in a professional context as a carer for a person who is Deaf and has LD (unaided) but it's a fairly basic level.

I think it does depend on the area though as the last area I lived in, where I signed more, the Head Teacher of the Deaf (who was in my class when I was trying to brush up again) had held her role for 13 years despite it being a legal minimum and openly coasted as she didn't see any point in learning. A VERY oralist area.

Where I live now, deaf kids are taught sign along which is basically makaton imo. There are only a handful of BSL using children in the entire city.

I would say there was brief swing towards BSL but it was before CIs became particularly good. Scotland has brought out an act trying to get parents fair information, but it's not really taken off. England is increasing in oralism again, except in very specific areas.

I went to a school with a base so we had SSE in class with CSWs (mine was a CODA) but we were taught Deaf culture and BSL and had a 'culture' officer who was Deaf. There were 26 deaf children in my school, with myself as the only one who wasn't severe/profoundly deaf. Against all advice I went to mainstream for secondary because the school I was advised to go to had trouble with knife crime. It was much harder. I know I'm not 'meant' to sign and not 'really' deaf but my word is BSL/SSE easier.

Some of my friends went to Mary Hare. Reportedly they are a bit more flexible on signing out of class these days, but I agree their head is an absolute disgrace of a person.

I'm 24 and the change in Mary Hare seems to have come somewhere between there and someone who is 22 or so.

Not learn. Just translate. So, they still don't know the language, but whatever they're reading/hearing is being translated into the language they're most familiar with.

*** Actually I'm French, and I agree that sometimes we can be a bit too proud of ourselves when it comes to our culture.. Seeing your response, I'm curious if you had a bad experience with some French people or if it's just how other countries sees us?

And I totally agree with the rest of what you said, first because French is a pain to learn (yes even for native speakers) especially if you start learning at eleven for the muggleborns, and also because I can't believe that there is such a disconnect between the wizarding and magical communities of a country that they wouldn't even speak the same language, even purebloods.

At the very least Latin could make sense if it was only Italy, Spain and France, but since a lot of germanic country are also suppose to attend I can't see how that would work.

And even then the cultural difference between Spain, Italy and France, while smaller, is still very significative (see above, I'm french and possibly a bit too proud of my own culture)

** So this answer is based from my headcanon that goes slightly against canon. But, basically, in my headcanon, Beauxbâtons accept students from France, Spain, Portugal, Luxembourg, Wallonia, Italy, Switzerland (Italian and French part), and all the micro states going along. I think that they would have classes separated along linguistic lines (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, maybe Catalan and Basque) and maybe at N.E.W.T. level (the French one, that is) they could start meddling the classes because maybe the school offers language classes as well. That latter point would be logic considering the position of the school.

I think they would do that because it pretty much is canon that there is no existing translating spell as seen with Fudge who struggled to speak with the Bulgarian Minister for Magic in GoF. Hope it helps you!

** The worldbuilding (and scale) inside of Britain is... inconsistent at best (and not making too much sense). Outside of it? It's barely present.

That's most obvious with the schools - Beauxbatons and Durmstrang for all of Europe, entire continents with one school, etc. Personally I would just wipe the slate clean of them myself and rebuild it up with some ... better choices there.

However, to keep it as canon-adjacent as possible, I would put a clarification that Beauxbatons/Durmstrang/Hogwarts are simply the /best/ three schools in Europe. It's just that the magical societies on the Continent are presumably a bit more unified than the British, and so the elites in Spain or Portugal might choose to send their students to Beauxbatons to be schooled in French instead of the local school.

That's not my preference, obviously - but I'm also the type that'd throw in another half dozen schools or more into Britain :P

I read a post on this sub trying to make sense of the wizarding population numbers, the percentage of wizard etc.. and clearly maths isn't Rowling strongest point. Right now I'm more in a "gonna close my eyes and pretend it makes actual sense" team.

The thing that was always the least convincing to me is the no formal education/home schooling before eleven part.. On one hand it would explain why the wizard are clearly behind technology wise, on the other hand realistically with this system a significant part of the students would start Hogwarts barely knowing how to read and write..

** There was never any claim in cannon that there were not other schools in the magical world and specifically in magical Europe. In fact, the number of originally known schools increased from 7 to 11 at one point as JK Rowling talked of others. It is generally assumed that the schools we know of, are effectively the biggest, best, most prestigious, and/or longest established places of magical learning.

So taking that into account, and knowing that there is likely some home schooling along with other smaller schools, the assumption is that if you choose to attend one of the "11" (7 locations known) "better" schools that are named, you likely have to learn the language spoken at the school. For Beauxbatons that is french. For Hogwarts its English.

And then we have to realize that with magic, the simple fact is that it was likely MUCH easier to learn a language, and the only reason many did not is simply because there was no need, or they felt themselves "above" doing so. Plus we are viewing from the point of view of an "English" wizarding world/school story, and as English is considered the global language in the muggle world, its also likely the same in the magical world. Hence, it is less likely for native English speakers to learn other languages, then for non-native English speakers to learn English. So we don't really see language learning outside Runes.

Also, you can't compare the "culture" of the wizarding world from the lense of the way it works in the muggle world. Keep that in mind. While there may be many "nationalities" within the wizarding world, its likely culture is much more merged than in the muggle world.
