I was wondering if there are fics where the dead mysteriously come back to life after the War and beyond that.

Mainly, the plot involves beloved characters such as James, Lily, and Sirius etc. returning to life to a time of peace where Harry and the rest are grown and have their own families.

Thank you:)
