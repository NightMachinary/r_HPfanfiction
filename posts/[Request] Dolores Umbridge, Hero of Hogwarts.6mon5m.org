So I was going through the news and I came across this: [[http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/11/harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix-is-10-10-reasons-why-dolores-umbridge-is-the-perfect-teacher-6760178/]]

Now, obviously, I need fic where Dumbledore really is a terrible headmaster leading everyone into rebellion and Umbridge is the heroine who comes in to save the day and rescue these poor, misguided students from a life of crime and destitution.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390267/1/Insidious-Inquisitor][Insidious Inquisitor]] has an Umbridge who's actually secretly good and putting on the 'bad guy' act to slip in under Dumbledore's radar and investigate Hogwarts.

I think I made noises about this topic ages ago; Umbridge could be a good character, a loyal Ministry employee who tries to keep an eye on Hogwarts and control Dumbledore's economy-endangering fear-mongering about Voldemort, but in order to be that, she can't send Dementors after Harry at the start of the book, and she can't dismiss Cedric's death as 'a tragic accident' to Harry's face.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** I don't think there's ever been a Dolores Harry reconciliation scene in a fanfic. What you describe could allow that.\\
Harry would be so engrossed in Dumbledore he wouldn't see how nefarious he is for the school (obviously, we're in AU territory here) and Dolores could gradually become aware that Harry isn't simply the attention seeker she first thought.\\
It seems very interesting.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
