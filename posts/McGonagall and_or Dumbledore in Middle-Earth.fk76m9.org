Everyone writes about what would happen if Harry or another student gets thrown/goes to Middle-Earth, and every story with Harry or fem!Harry in Arda are basically interchangeable at this point. What I want is someone who we know are canonically wise, smart and powerful to some measure. It could be fun to see Minerva stuck into Middle-Earth and she teaches magic to locals, for lack of a better word, or Dumbledore joining forces with the White Council. Could be either one or both in Middle-Earth. What's your opinion on that?


** Dumbledore is widely inspired by Gandalf. Especially his death and what it means to the characters. McGonagall I can absolutely see chilling with Elrond and the elves in Rivendell
