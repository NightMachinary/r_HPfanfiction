I've seen all sorts of different uses of authors notes, from begging for reviews, answering reviews/questions, promising updates, polling readers, and even rambling rants about the authors life.

Personally, I tend towards using the notes to communicate things I want all my readers to know (IE, if I won't be updating for some time) or to answer questions I get a lot. I've also use them for short jokes or quips at the end of a chapter or to comment on a particular experience I had while writing the chapter. I prefer my notes to be short, and I often omit them entirely.


** As a reader, I appreciate when an author's note keeps me updated on the progress of the fic (so long as the author keeps to what they said). If a story updates after not updating for a long time, and the author includes a note explaining the delay and giving me a good sense that the story will begin regularly updating again, I really appreciate it.

Most other notes I could take them or leave them. I hate the author's note which responds to every review and takes up half the page, but if there is a major controversial plot point the author feels they need to address, that's cool with me.

** 1. Apology for late update (I post after finishing a story and update on a three-day schedule; I've only once unintentionally been late)
2. Warning if I'm intentionally delaying an update (done once because there was a significant time gap between the chapters) or updating early (one story has an interlude chapter that's shorter than the rest, so I posted it a day before the regularly scheduled chapter)
3. Credit if I've used a spell/potion created by another fanfic writer
4. A note if I include a spell using made-up words, just in case any of those words are actually real in another language and mean something nasty
5. On FFN, trigger warnings on the first chapter because there's no tagging like on AO3
6. On the final chapter, I include a brief thank you note and mention any plans for a sequel
7. Very rarely, some comment if I feel it's needed.

When I'm done posting, I take out any notes about 1, 2, and 7 because they're generally only relevant while it's a WIP.

** Long rambling author's notes get on my nerves, especially ones that beg for reviews. If you beg for a review, I will not leave you one out of spite.

If an author feels the need to explain where the story is going in author's notes, then they're not doing a very good job of telling a story.

*** I've quit reading stories because the author was answering every review in the authors notes at the beginning of the story and it was too hard to get to the actual story.

I tend to agree with you on the needing to explain things in the authors notes. I'd prefer chapters stand on their own.

** I think they can be useful to tell readers about other FF related stuff you're doing. Like, if you wrote a sequel, an author's note is a good place to advertise it. Or if someone made some fanart for your story, an author's note is a perfect place to let others know about it.

** I only put in an author's note when I want to communicate something crucial to the reader, whether it's about the series itself (such as a frequently asked question or a note on characterisation, etc.) or whether it's about something that will affect the story IRL (I made an AN when I was in the process of immigrating, when I went on hiatus, etc.).

I've always been unsure about including author's notes as a regular thing just for the craic, because I worried that readers might find that very irritating or that it might draw them out of their immersion. I never like them to be longer than a short paragraph.

** As seen in one story I'm reading recently, it seems to be a place where the author trolls the reader with fake polls ( I'm sure you know nothing about that though).

In all seriousness, I look towards 2 things, it's nice when if the author uses a concept/recommendation/or you Betta for them, they should thank you in the comments. I also like hearing the direction the author took and some of the reasoning behind it.

Indeed simple things such as something like the story isn't going to be updated in a while is a given and should be in the notes.

Outside of that, I really enjoy reading the author's insight into the direction of their story.

I try and keep as much actual correspondence in PMs as possible.

** I think the briefer the note, the better. Apologies for any delay, any content warnings for possibly disturbing content that may be found in some chapters but isn't prevalent throughout the fic, and a general idea of when the next update will drop. A brief thanks for reading may be appropriate as long as it isn't in every single chapter.

I'm trying, with my latest fic, to write the whole thing all at once and then just post one chapter at a time every week at the same time. That way I won't have to worry about delays or life getting in the way. This will make my author's notes even briefer.

I tolerate a lot more in an author's note for fics that I am reading, but I don't appreciate notes of significant length (more than two or three paragraphs), notes that give spoilers for the following chapters, notes that attempt to flatter the readers, nor notes that beg for something (usually reviews).
