There's one fic, War Paint linkffn(10402749), which I read and absolutely loved, but it wasn't super long. I've been reading the Very Secret Diary, the next book club fic, and it's given me a hankering for more stories about the diary beyond sort of the traditional canon. I remembered how much I loved War Paint, and so I'm looking again for other stories about Hermione getting the diary. Or really, any stories about someone else getting the diary.

Thanks!

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

Author replied in my PM that he's going to give the diary to Vector in the next update.
