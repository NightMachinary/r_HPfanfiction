It just gets irritating after a while; every time I see a do-over fic or a what-if-this-happened fic, when they inevitably expose Scabbers as being Peter Pettigrew early, the exact same formula plays out. He tries to run away, gets caught, everyone goes "OMFG this is definitely Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black must be innocent!", then Peter makes the "I hid because Sirius would break out and kill me!" claim, then he's pumped full of Veritaserum and admits to being a wilful gleeful Death Eater. Sirius goes free, Peter's shipped off to Azkaban, and that's the last he's ever mentioned in the plot.\\
The one I saw most recently had him just go "Yes...yes...yes..." to a bunch of leading questions under Veritaserum, which got me wondering if Veritaserum is less of a truth potion and more of a 'say whatever the questioner wants to hear' potion.

...Anyway. Does anyone know any do-over fics, where Peter Pettigrew is sympathetic when caught, because of the serious duress he was under to work for Voldemort or he has really good reasons to believe he'd be targeted if he showed up alive or whatnot?\\
Failing that, are there any do-over fics where Peter is legitimately evil, getting to perform some serious maliciously evil deeds on screen and posing a threat to the heroes before/after being caught?


** Never linked before, so this might take some editing.

linkffn(Promises Unbroken)

It's an AU instead of do over, where Sirius remains the secret keeper, and Peter becomes a death eater because he truly believes it's what will help his friends. There's a good bit about him having regrets and trying to make up for things.

Edit: I can't get it to work, lol.

Let's try this. linkffn(1248431)

It looks like there are sequels as well. Worth a look, it seems.

In Order of Strength: Title, Title and Author, Url/Story ID.

Just the title will sometimes work, adding the author almost always works and linking the ID/URL always works.

In this case there are other fanfics with the title you linked, so even if it did work there is no guarantee it'd be the fic you wanted. Adding the author narrows this down.

***** Moomoogoat has it. I'll add that while your link didn't work, the title and "fanfiction" was enough to get google to spit out the link. Then I grabbed the ID. We got there in the end.

****** Not exactly. While I do second the recommendation of using story ID whenever possible, the reason why their call did not work is because the new reddit style's editor is broken.

***** In addition to what has already been said, there was something about formatting of the bot call being broken if you are using the new reddit style.

Here is is:

*** Alrighty. I see this one recommended a fair bit, but I haven't really gravitated towards it before. I think it's the 'the world is different and nothing is as it seems' in the description, it sets off my cliche-warning alarms or something.

**** I totally understand, but the story is written fairly well. As long as you're a fan of AU, and a fan of Harry not being the center of everything, then it's worth a read. If not, I would at least give it the old toilet try.

**** This was actually started before OttP came out (let along the last two books), so a huge amount of it is actually original. The premise (MWPP focus in a modern-era AU) is actually fairly rare.
