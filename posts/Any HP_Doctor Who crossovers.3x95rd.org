Hi! Was reading the first Hermione Song book and loved it. The second got a little bit to ridiculous for me. But I was wondering if there were any HP/DW stories you guys would rec? I don't like Donna or the 9th doctor. But everyone else is okay. And no slash. Something over 40k wording? Thanks!

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

** Perhaps linkffn(Visited by a Doctor by Tangerine-Alert)? At 635k words (and continually updating), it's somewhat north of 40k words.
