I think it'd be neat to just have everybody's favorite fics in one place, but maybe we can make sure not to post the same fic twice? (Like just make sure someone else hasn't recced the same fick -- for example, *little0bird* is recced a lot in the same thread... for good reason, but just to make my point here!) The fics can be slash, het, whatever. Basically anything goes, so long as it's got good grammar, IMO.

If the idea is approved, it'd be great if people could link to actual fics instead of simply pointing people toward authors. I know that whenever I hear of a great author, I'm never quite sure which story to start first!

Anyone interested? Mods?


** Just something to keep in mind, reddit only allows one sticky post. At the moment this is being used by the bookclub.

Maybe something in the sidebar? The wiki is for this as well though, and I know [[/u/denarii][denarii]] has plans for his own version of a fanfic recommendation aggregation website.

Ooooh, okay, yes. That would be good! I didn't know that about the limit on sticky posts. That makes sense as well. I look forward to that fanfic rec aggregation website once it goes live!

**** No ETA on it as I'm just working on it occasionally in my free time, which is a lot less these days. But I think there really needs to be a better tool for finding and recommending fics. Wikis are terrible for this kind of thing, fics are scattered on various sites across the web and the search tools provided on even the big sites like FFN and AO3 are kinda deficient in my opinion.

***** Yeah, as vast as A03 seems to be, it's really hard to find the kind of fics you want. Every time I try to search for something, it involves something I don't particularly like -- like slash, for example, and searching "no slash" usually only brings up a lot less results, at least in my experience. It's a pretty good database for quality work, but yeah. I like the tags well enogh, but some people just make up tags instead of using existing ones, which complicates things.

And I am not going to lie, I don't understand the whol "chose not to use warnings," and then in the tags, they'll have "explicit," "slash," or "extreme violence." Not that there's anything wrong with this, but just as an example.

****** AO3's ability to list an unlimited number of characters and pairings makes it a pain in the ass to search too. So many authors end up listing like every single character that appears in the fic.

** The TVtropes [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HARRYPOTTER][recommended Potter fanfic page]] covers a lot of the stuff that gets regularly suggested here, it might deserve a place on the sidebar as well.

*** Useful, although not that comprehensive. Why don't we just have a file on Google Doc/Dropbox and stick the link in the sidebar? I know someone had an Excel Spreadsheet uploaded a while ago

*** I remember I was going to add this to the sidebar a few weeks ago because someone asked.

I have no idea what could have possibly distracted me during the thirty seconds it would have taken me haha.

** I actually like seeing the requests for fics. Sometimes they're interesting and I get something new to read. Sometimes it's fun when you know the exact fic they're talking about and you can help them. Maybe the mods could do that thing where you can filter a sub by tabs like in [[/r/wheredidthesodago]].

** I don't see the need. There are plenty of sites out there than have recommendation lists. TV Tropes and the HPFF wiki are two examples that are already linked to in the sidebar. Fanfiction C2s (communities) are another example.

If we have an official thread where recommendations are supposed to be placed, then a) Theres no easy way to see if there are new recommendations available. b) people will be less likely to add recommendations in normal posts because they're supposed to go in the recommendation thread.

Really, I don't actually see a problem in having the same author or story being recommended multiple times. If you don't know what story to start from an author, then ask that question. Having active discussions is much better than having a thread that's going to go mostly static after the first set of recommendations are added.

*** Yeah, that makes sense. I had thought about that after the fact. If there was a rec post it would basically negate the need for any other posts. Noted. Yeah, forget what I said. Haha.
