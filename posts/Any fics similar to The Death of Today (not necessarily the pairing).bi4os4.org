I'm not looking for a specific paring, although admittedly I love how HP/LV was written in DoT. I'm just looking for something well written with a complex plot. Anything with suspense/thriller, mystery, or general Slytherin sneakiness would be great.

Thanks to anyone who has any recs!

  [AU!] After society as we know it collapsed, humanity struggled for survival. Slowly a new society begins to establish. Groups led by lords battle for territory. Young Harry Potter has no interest in joining local politics, but when a new lord with unconventional ideas sees the potential in his unique talents, can Harry remain neutral? (LV/HP, post-apocalyptic, Inventor!Harry)

** I can think of three stories:

The Art of Hidden Personas by Whitedwarf linkffn(5675879), Salvation in Shadow by odev linkffn(9735652) and Consuming Shadows by Child_OTKW linkao3(7040089).

The first two haven't been updated in a while, but I think Salvation in Shadow was almost finished. The Art of Hidden Personas has almost 200.000 words, so also quite a bit to read. Consuming Shadows is still being updated. Salvation is Shadows is not HP/LV but does have lots of Slytherin sneakiness and mystery.

  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.

  It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.

  HP/LV Harry grows up relying on only himself until his adoption, when he is taught the manners and politics of high pureblood circles. Masking his dark intelligence at Hogwarts & intending to escape notice, past secrets and Dark Lords force his hidden hand.

  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included. Darkish themes, no slash, no pairings, some lemons mixed in.
