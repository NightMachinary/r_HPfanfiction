Hi All,

Are there any romance Hermione/Luna fics out there any of you might recommend? I searched through the subreddit and already read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3973687/1/Crazy-Little-Things][Crazy Little Things]]. I enjoyed it a lot, and am definitely open to multi-chapter stories.

Additionally, I'd be super excited to read any stories where Hermione is struggling after the war and Luna is there as a support, and they eventually fall in love.


** Unfortunately Crazy Little Things is really the only big Hermione/Luna fic there is. I can think of at least two more that are over 10k words, but they are not that great.

If you want to find more femslash in general check [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/A-Woman-s-Love-Femslash/90503/99/3/1/0/0/0/0/][here]]. Its almost every hp Femslash story on fanfiction.net.

*** Aww, that's disappointing. I spent some time surfing the net trying to find a good story and hoped that reddit might help the search. Alas!

** I don't know of any Luna/Hermione romances, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heroes]] by Silently Watches includes a three way relationship between Harry/Luna/Hermione.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

*** Get ready for a lot of Harry, Luna, and Hermione just being smarter than everyone else because, and a lot of "banter." Also Luna being lolrandom and use of sex as commical scene openers.

I read it and enjoyed it, but it's not exactly a pinnacle of story telling.

**** Yeah.. I started it a while back due to another recommendation here and didn't make it through more than a couple chapters.
