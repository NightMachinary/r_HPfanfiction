This moment in the film. I remember it clearly like it was yesterday. I still have the palm print on my face from face-palming so hard from it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is trapped on the edge of a crumbled battlement. The fight against the Death Eaters and their montrous allies continues around them. Spellfire and flames roar in the distance, and Harry finds himself cornered, Voldemort's height towering over him, a three-hundred foot drop inches behind him.

  "Come on, Tom. Let's finish this the way we started." He grabs Voldemort's robes in a white-knuckled fist. "Together."

  Harry hurled himself from the battlements into open space, clutching Voldemort tightly with him as they plummeted. A split-second later he found his hands empty, another moment passed and a blur appeared out of hands-reach, Voldemort's crimson eyes dripping with dark amusement amid the smoky apparition as he glided down in mocking mimicry of Harry's suicide.

  "That didn't go quite to plan?" suggested Voldemort.

  200 feet... "Oh my-" ... 100 feet "...god, Ginny, I love--" splat.

  Voldmort levitates his mutilated, broken body to the courtyard where the central fight was taking place. This went much more smoothly than anticipated.

What on earth were the screen writers smoking the day they wrote that? smh. I direly need an animated Harry Potter series just to do the final chapters justice.


** I actually rather liked that scene. So let me try and defend it with the following points:

First: Can he easily extricate himself? He may not be that strong physically in comparison to Harry since he prefers to do things the magical way.

Okay, having watched the scene again at [[https://youtu.be/rBRfVbP1cyo]] for those who haven't seen it and don't mind skipping to the end, he does fly. He seems to have lost his wand at some point though because he puts both his hands on Harry's head, so he wouldn't have been able to stun or otherwise zap him.

Finally, things in canon have convinced me that potterverse wizards are anything but squishy. They seem to have a bit more durability than the average muggle, if anything. I'm not sure the fall would kill either of them.

Yes, he can. In the movies, there's precedent for him being able to escape Dumbledore's "water ball" spell thing during the battle in the Ministry Atrium. I would hazhard a guess that was magnitudes more difficult to escape from than simply having a person clutch him.

He had the Elder Wand at this point in the story. I'm just utterly confused as to why they incorporated that "putting both hands on Harry's head" bit. It just ... makes no sense. None of it makes sense.

I can believe that, up to a point. But we're talking about a drop of hundreds of feet. As a counterpoint, we can assume that when Dumbledore cast "Arresto Momentum" to stop Harry's fall during that 3rd year Quidditch match, he was doing it to save his life, or otherwise avoid significant injury (he spent a decent chunk of time in the infirmary even with Dumbledore slowing his fall).

Sorry to be a "Devil's Advocate", but I just reeeeeeeeeeeeeally hate having a Harry who seemingly gets out of impossible situations without due effort on his part. Utterly ruins my immersion.

** The final fight is an abomination and spits on book. The whole point of their final confrontation in the Great Hall(?) in front of everyone humiliates Tom. The fact that he drops dead cements the fact that at the end he was a mere human, not that horrible turning into ashes bullshit.

*** The ashes thing I could understand (IF it happened in the books). I wouldn't really call him fully human. Sure, he was resurrected. With a dark magic ritual. I would call him an advanced homunculus. Piloted by the mangled remains of a human soul that was held together with dark magic duct tape.

Or, if his body slowly melted into a puddle of blood, a pile of bone dust or w/e, and Pettigrew's hand.

That, and the big bad evil guy is supposed to explode, melt, fall to ashes, burn, disappear, etc. It just sets the tone correctly, says "it's over".
