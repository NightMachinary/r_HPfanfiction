**** It's somewhat similar. If I recall correctly it's a muggle OC that is extremely into dungeons and dragons, so he tries to figure out things using dungeons and dragons magic and what not.

It's a good story regardless, but him using his vast knowledge of D&D for use in the HP world is somewhat like your request.

***** He's /literally/ a D&D character thrust into the HP world, not someone merely into D&D.

** There's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-weasley-in-slytherin-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone-si-au.368097/][A Weasley in Slytherin]] on Spacebattles, which is pretty much what you're looking for, except the SI doesn't get all of their tropes shattered, just most of them. Also, the SI is basically reincarnated as Ron, so that might effect how much you enjoy the story.

** This sounds like an amazing premise for a story! If it's not written, someone should write it. Ooo, someone should write a story where J.K. Rowling was a witch but she highly fictionalized the world she came from and published the stories in the muggle world so the fan gets there and everything is different.

** I've actually started working on something like this. The fic is in its larval stage right now, which isn't helpful to you, but it's a comedic piece featuring a self-insert who pretends to be a Seer. The "prophecies" only muck up the story in new and sometimes calamitous ways.

And since the self-insert is (obviously) based on me, there is drinking, incompetence, and nonsensical tangents galore. It's not a very plot-driven fic, more an exploration of idiocy. And what a normal person's reactions would be after dropping into a supposedly fictional world.

Hint: It's not saving the world. Imagine Lockhart without the suave good looks and familiarity with at least one spell.
