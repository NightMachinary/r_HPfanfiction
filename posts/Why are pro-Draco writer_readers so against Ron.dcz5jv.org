I'm curious as to why some authors/readers who are sympathetic of Draco could be so unforgiving in their interpretation of Ron. It just doesn't make any sense to me that someone will be willing to empathize with Draco's glimpses of morality in a sea of bad choices and decisions and yet condemn Ron for his few bad choices with all of his heroic actions.

It's not always for shipping purposes either. Keira Marcos is a popular author who is primarily writes Harry/Hermione stories and plenty of Keira's stories have positive Draco portrayals. I'm not sure if even one of the stories has a non-bashed Ron (this is from skimming summaries, so if I'm wrong please correct me).

But in general, It seems like authors usually just pick one. If you like one of them, then you don't like the other. I've only seen one author have positive portrayals of both of them ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/256843/Kirinin][Kirinin]]). I especially recommend A Game of Chess and Geas of Gryffindor.

I've seen some arguments that he is a better student(smarter) than Ron, but there's no canonical evidence of that.

People who aren't fans of Ron have problems with his maturity, but I think even they would call Ron more mature than Draco.

So, I'm curious to hear some thoughts on this because I am really stumped.

**** Heron is one of those canon ships among the easiest to break up without the "need" to bash one of them (the 2nd easiest after Remus/Tonks, IMO). There is several moments that imply the relationship as being unhealthy, even without the need to portray Ron as a bad person.

Why people still bash him to remove shipping competition is beyond me, maybe people are just not able to figure out how to break them up otherwise?

***** Harmony is the one pairing that I really want to be a fan of, but everytime I visited their fanbase I never last more than a few hours. It's hard to stay when one of the most recommended fic is along the line of Vox Corporis and The Augurey where the Weasleys are getting pused to the sidelines.

There's a lot of potential in Harry/Hermione. They could be a couple that take down the wizarding world and rebuild a new one, a simple Auror/DMLE, or even a house husband and a ministry of magic. Hermione is one person that always stays beside Harry (almost) from the beginning. It shouldn't be hard to make a believable buildup with everyone else still in character. However, in (almost) all the fanfiction I've found they usually start kissing in the second chapter, cheating on their partner, and doesn't have any contact with all their other friends.

It's sad when I've read a better Harry/OC than Harry/Hermione.

** Generally speaking, there are three types of bashing.

1. Taking a dump on characters for their canon actions. Eg Dumbledore's "ten dark years confession" or Snape's teaching style. So you go through canon and have your cast react negatively to everything said character canonically does which counts as bad in your book. Some people consider this bashing, some do not, but in the end of the day, it still paints said characters very negatively.

2. Exaggerate canon events in order to justify a negative depiction. I think Ron gets the most flak from that camp. Ron did a runner due to the Horcrux -> Horrible friend, Pettigrew 2.0. Ron uses magic on his driving instructor (which is his worst moment in canon IMO) -> Ron considers Muggles his inferior ->Death Eater Ron. Potion Queen Molly would be another example.

3. Completly baseless stuff you throw in just because you can. Wife beater or rapist Ron would be good examples. I mean, I don't see Ron and Hermione lasting, but come on, he was a teenager who did teenager stupid things, he isn't some monster.

The first category isn't that bad as it is usually limited to a few characters and is based more on reactions to canon rather than inventing stuff to put characters down. The second category can make for good humour and crack as long as the narrative isn't serious and does not come across as the author actually believing that, for example, Ron is worse than Hitler. The third one is just simply bad writing.

As for why authors bash characters, the first kind is generally the result of the plot you want to have. Say you want Slughorn come to Hogwarts earlier. So Snape gets investigated by the Ministry and found a shitty teacher simply because you want him out and his canonical behaviour in class would be enough to get him arrested for endangerment at least.

The second type is either done for comedic effect or because the author hates a character and wants to spread the gospel.

The third type is based on very distorted memories of canon, usually heavily influenced by other fics and general fanon. Or because you can't be bothered to come up with a reasonable way to start your Dramione fic, so Ron beats his wife Hermione up before sleeping with at least 4 different witches. Or the authors are so deep into fanon that they forgot about canon entirely.

** You can explain away Draco's treatment of Muggleborns and Muggles. I mean, you really can't, but people have been finding ways to use mental acrobatics to try to present it as 'not a problem' practically since the series began. It's racism, people have been trying to legitimize it for as long as there have been different races.

But Malfoy's insults toward Ron aren't racism. They're /classism./ I don't think I'd be blowing anyone's mind if I suggested that the majority of HP fanfic authors are white. On the other hand, I don't think I'll be blowing anyone's mind if I suggested that they aren't all 1%, never have to work, social elite types, either.

Malfoy's treatment of Ron hits home. They've already decided that Malfoy is actually in the right here, because the cowardly, whiny racist is somehow more attractive as a love interest than the snarky, loyal friend who's willing to face and improve his flaws for the sake of his friends. As a result, Ron has to DESERVE that kind of treatment.

Also Malfoy doesn't have even a quarter of the narrative focus, so the hypercritical fans can imagine that he did no wrong while he wasn't directly 'onscreen,' whereas well-meaning characters with more lines and more focus like Ron get put under a microscope and held to unrealistic standards. We hear the thought process that goes on whenever Harry is about to make a mistake, so we sympathize. Hermione's mistakes are almost always presented as other people's fault. Ron's get raked over the coals because he has neither benefit. Malfoy's flaws are basically his entire character, so to make him /deeper/, fanfic authors have to invent better qualities for him, and as a result he comes off comparatively better. "Oh, but he regrets his evil actions!" Yeah, because *you made him regret them.*

*** That's a /very/ unflattering description, particularly in fanfiction (which invites changes).

People love redemption stories. Eg, one of the arcs in any media that I've seen have the best reception is that of Zuko in Avatar, which is all about redemption like that.

So yes, canon Draco is an ass. But even in canon there are hints towards easy changes - he's incredibly influenced by his parents and how he grew up, and that's obviously something that can make it sympathetic to 'redeem'.

There is a weird undercurrent in much of the fanfiction community in some classist aspects, to be sure - a lot of the 'exploring wizarding politics' tend to have an even more culturally stratified world than canon, and have Harry accept/join it. I'd also point to the way most fans look at and categorize House Elves as another problematic element.

But redeeming a character has its own appeal - as well as the sympathetic 'different' person (eg, Daphne Greengrass as the love interest from the evil slytherins).

Now on Ron's side, he obviously does have a lot more screen time - but there's also a good number of times where we see him being insensitive or causing issues, as well as being prejudiced to an extent himself (towards Slytherins, magical creatures, etc). I love Ron, and he's an important/vital part of the trio in canon... But in fanfiction it's easy to slot someone else instead of him in the group. His flaws can be expanded upon, sure - or he can just have another group of friends. There's a lot of ways to handle it.

Pure Weasley bashing is 99% of the time a mark of a bad fic. But you've gone too far in the opposite direction - after all, the /point/ of fanfiction (excepting continuations) is to imagine the way it'd go under different scenarios. So in that case, redeeming Draco is fine by me as an idea, and making Ron a bit worse is also fine.

It's very strange to me the way that Ron (and other Weasleys like Ginny) are seen as an all or nothing by many people. Like there's those who /hate/ them and those who /love/ them, and then both make kinda strawman arguments/views.

Only because people tend to gloss over his strengths, and the amount he gives. Self-sacrifice? At age 11? I know that an author can write any character doing that, but realistically how common would that be? Would Susan Bones do that? Doubt it. Would Neville? Maybe. Would Malfoy? No. Even Hermione decides that Harry has to be the one to go on, mere minutes later.

You think everyone in the school would be loyal to Harry when it's inconvenient for them? Because we've literally seen that almost all of them aren't. You want to talk prejudice? Ron knows everything about the supposed evils of Parselmouth and the Heir of Slytherin, and doesn't hesitate to stand by Harry in year 2. That's called overcoming prejudice you were raised with. When Ron thinks about the House Elves in danger when his entire life he was raised to think of them as beneath notice, without even the benefit of being confronted with the problematic aspects of it without context, as Harry and Hermione are? That's genuinely changing as a person.

Draco whinges and cries and moans and /maybe/ doesn't try as hard as he possibly could to murder Dumbledore - he only Imperios and curses a fellow student instead. But he still lets Death Eaters loose in the school. Compare that to Ron, who agonizes about not being able to keep his family safe, but stays with Harry for months while enduring painful wounds and, oh yeah, Voldemort's literal, actual soul is eroding his will to continue before wavers. For, like, a second. Then he tracks his friends as best he can for weeks until he finds them again, confronts his innermost demons and kills them.

Fuck Malfoy.

***** The way you mentioned it makes it seem like a /bad/ thing that fanfiction changes things. I mean, it's like saying that Malfoy in canon isn't really a bad person, it's that JKR /made/ him do it. Not particularly relevant.

Like I said, Ron is a character I love, and is vital to canon. But we've got characters who are willing to sacrifice themselves even at a young age to do what's right - Neville, just before that scene, stands up to confront the trio knowing he'd get restrained because he thought it was right. Yes, Ron's actions with the chess game is very impressive, but it's a book full of impressive kids.

I'm not sure where you're getting the impression that I think anyone should be loyal to Harry from the school. In the case of Ron, we do see his jealousy towards Harry poke its head up, and he's not just anyone in the school - he's Harry's best and oldest friend. So there's a lot of extra hurt coming from anything Ron does like the rest of those there.

Ron does start prejudiced, yes - in canon, he gets better about it, but it's still something that's there. It's still something that can be expanded upon in alternate works. You mention that he was raised that way - and that's how the /good/ wizarding family, the one open to muggles and everything else raised their kids. Is that a reason to dislike him? No. Is it something that can be slightly tweaked in fanfiction? Sure. Is the way he develops to get over it interesting to read about? Yeah. In the same way, a fic looking at other characters evolving like that can work wonderfully - and Draco is certainly a character who was raised with an inherent sense of superiority and extreme prejudice, and starts the series as a literal child. A child that we can /easily/ show butterfly effects to change how he acts and evolves later on.

If you're opposed to tweaks to upraising and alternatives to canon's character development/plot, what interests you with fanfiction? I'd find it extremely boring if we /had/ to have Ron as always a great upstanding guy and Malfoy as a horrible terrible evil guy, when it'd be so easy to make very tiny tweaks to it at the start and change /everything/. And that doesn't have to be done with bashing anyone.

JKR made the character. Therefore, when she /makes/ him do things, they are automatically things that the character would do, ten times out of ten.

Remember that this is a thread about bashing. It is specifically about rewriting characters in a negative fashion. The Draco comparison was just to underline how one character gets preferential treatment. Of course you can make him a hero. If you make him a hero and nash Ron, then you aren't applying the same standard to both characters.

Is it possible to write a fanfiction where Ron realistically goes bad and becomes everything bashers say he is, while Draco becomes a laudable hero, redeemed beyond what he was capable of in canon? Probably. I've yet to see a fanfic author I think could even attempt to do it justice, let alone see it actually done, though.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, Ron's actions with the chess game is very impressive, but it's a book full of impressive kids.
#+end_quote

My point is that people tend to attribute Ron's strengths to every character. Hermione gains all the friends she wants, and is always perfectly empathic. Harry can have fun and make jokes that aren't deliberate barbs to people in authority. Everyone is just delighted to study all day every day, because that's what's best for you, and everyone always does what's best for them.

Like, you realize that this entire thread is about bashing specifically, right? It's not just about underappreciating Ron, it's about making him evil and hanging him out to dry for the one mistake he makes in canon, while forgiving legitimately despicable behavior from other characters like Draco.

If you have to make Ron a pathetic piece of trash for your story to work, maybe just write an original story, because you clearly aren't that interested in the actual characters.

It's possible for authors to have a character, and then make them act out of character to further the plot or because they made a mistake. Authors aren't perfect - it's why we have so many people who dismiss all the extended comments JKR makes about the universe and characters.

For the thread, it's not just about bashing, but making a more generalistic statement that I tend to disagree with. Past that, I found your answer to be biased as well, which is why I answered. Eg, if it's just about bashing in general I think that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dcz5jv/why_are_prodraco_writerreaders_so_against_ron/f2daoia/][this one]] is more of a 'real' discussion of bashing characters.

For the change in Ron/Draco, like I said it could start from something very minor. A point of divergence might be Harry's first meeting with Draco - having it go better, maybe mentioning his name earlier so Draco isn't as haughty, etc. At that point, Harry is desperate for a place that accepts him and friends - and a Draco more inclined to be friendly (even if for the wrong reasons) is not hard to write.

Then when he meets Ron, it's again not that difficult to have him overreact to Harry being friendly with Draco. And after that, Ron would have 0 problems finding another friend group that /doesn't/ involve Harry - he already does that the easiest of the trio in canon. And from there, Ron has been shown to have serious jealousy issues towards Harry when they're best friends - is it that hard to see that getting more out of hand if they weren't good friends, and Harry associating with a Malfoy?

I would find that perfectly believable from the characters in question, and requires no actual bashing.

In general though, Ron suffers from being more ordinary in the company of more extraordinary people/friends - and having flaws that many readers will dislike (eg, jealousy). In addition, the way that the books are written (not completely seriously) makes it fairly easy to find despicable actions from, well, everyone - particularly with the tonal shift from the tropes of a book for kids (where the adults have to be incompetent) to a more maturing audience.

(I'll also note that Hermione in the books often /is/ more empathetic than Ron - Ron puts his foot in his mouth all the time. That's one of his flaws - not thinking about casual statements or how he words things that hurt others. )

** I would guess that one reason may be that not everyone needs or wants what you do out of a fanfiction. I read them with the expectation that the books are a jumping off point (and I prefer that point to be from the 4th or 5th book). This allows fanfiction to be a fantasy, not simply a fairly similar remake of the original. I don't mind OOC portrayals as long as they make sense for the story they are in.

Also, I have the perfect husband (or realistically as close as you can get). I think we know fixers or bad guys aren't what we really want. When I go to fanfiction though, I like to live out different fantasies/realities. My fantasy isn't necessarily yours or the next persons.

** Because they realized that Romione is a perfect canon pairing. So, to make Hermione fall in love with other guys (Harry/Draco/Severus/Tom) they need to make Ron worse than canon. \s

But seriously, not all of Draco's fans hate Ron. Some of the 8th year Drarry I've read has a good characterization of Ron, even if everyone suddenly forgets that Draco is a death eater just because he's hot and rich. It only depends if the author is talented enough to portrays a character they like as a better person without taking down another good character.

One trend I recognize is if the authors worship Hermione, they're more likely to bash Ron. They feel that Hermione is someone that never makes mistake, everyone should love her, and everything that she said is a truth. They know that Hermione shouldn't end up with Ron because he is unworthy for her. The only man worthy of goddess Hermione is only their favorite male character (Harry/Draco/Severus/Tom).

** Ron has legitimate character flaws that are very easy to blow out of proportion to make him despicable. Coupled with this, there's 2 obvious reasons to "take him out of the picture":

- If you want to set up Draco with Hermione. Ron/Hermione is a canon ship, and making Ron a bad person is an obvious way to remove that "threat".
- If you want to set up Draco and Harry, either as friends or more, Ron remains a threat, given he's Harry's best friend. Make him bad, and Harry has reasons to dismiss the friendship.

The reason people want to remove Ron is that he's the biggest hurdle in any kind of friendship or more between Draco and the other parts of the Trio -- he has a clear prejudice against Slytherin and Malfoys in particular (consider the brawl between the fathers in CoS), and even if Draco is portrayed as a good person, would likely be wary with him.

She comes to appreciate his facial shape, and the way he treats her as something precious vs someone useful like her good for nothing former partner who is too busy focusing on his stomach and quidditch to give her the attention and care that she secretly desired from the beginning.

******* Ron's 'prejudices' are against a family who got off lightly for espousing and participating in racial supremacy based terrorism, then went on to sabotage his own family. Like, it's understandable, y'know??

If you mean him not being a fan of Slytherins.....blame JK Rowling tbh. She had a terrible time trying to introduce nuance to the Slytherins, and most or the cast have negative views on snakes, including the always forgiving Harry Potter.

I just think hating a person for the beliefs and actions they've espoused, publically, over a long period of time, isnt the same thing as being a Nazi. We have no proof Draco's changed all that much- still married a pureblood- and why give someone who tried to kill you the benefit of the doubt?

******** Like I said, I was just trying to give a reason other than ‘because Dramione'. I'm really not here for a debate as to which kid is right and which kid is wrong in the Potterverse.

** In my opinion, Ron and Draco are two sides of the same coin. They both hold serious bias against other groups, start a lot of fights, and are not very smart

*** What 'serious bias' does Ron hold again? It's not against Slytherins, in case that's what you're thinking.
