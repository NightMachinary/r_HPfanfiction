"Not my daughter you bitch" said molly weasley At thus moment bella got hit by a curse, she felt like something broke inside her, she felt powerful heat inside her she said one thing before she imploded "ow" Bella was floating in a white space, there was nothing, just white, suddently she started falling with great speed, she got faster and faster as she fell, her falling was stopped by something soft, ger mind was clear ever since she married rodolphus her mind was always like behind a fog, the only thing she wanted to do was kill and torture. But now she didn't want to do this things, she raiilswd herself from the soft surface that she now saw was a bed, she didn't used it since she was 18, when she married rodolphus she was sleeping on a stone, the same was in azkaban,l and while serving the dark lord, she was in a room covered by books, the walls were covered by books, even there was a book on her abdomen, she looker at the only piece of the wall that was not covered by books and had a full body mirror, her hair were bushy like always but something wasn't right, her hair were brown and she had chocolate colored eyes, she saw the girl that she tortured in the malfoy manor, "hmm weird" she said She stood up and went to the mirror "what kind of spell is on this mirror that i look like that girl?" she said She was standing in front of the mirror "wait" bella said She touched her boobs that she was so proud of having, she had the biggest one of ger siblings, but now they were small, sge touched her face, her high cheeks were gone, and her jaw was different, she saw a calendar standing on the table, it said 31st of august 1994 "WHAT THE FUCK!? "Bella screamed
