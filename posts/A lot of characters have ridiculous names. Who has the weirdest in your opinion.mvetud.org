No matter who you vote for (Conservative or Labour), they're still the same self-serving pricks with a different face.

Green Party? Unrealistic goals and aims and they want you to live in mud huts.

BNP? Literally British Nazi Party.

UKIP? Ineffectual and limp -- and they're the better choice of the lot!

SNP? Led by a deluded cow that even her own people hate. Hell-bent on leaving the UK despite the fact it'd literally destroy Scotland's economy in a month.

That Welsh Party (can't pronounce because it's in fecking Welsh)? Pretty much only cares for Wales. Nothing really wrong about these guys, to be honest?

Liberal Democrats? You're better off trying to fuck a rusty hole full of razors -- they'll fuck you over harder if they ever get in power again.

Independents? Yeah, pretty much the same as an Independent candidate in American politics.

And that's not even getting into Irish politics (North Ireland and Eire).

Frankly, we'd be better off if the Queen had all our politicians (except Count Binface) booted head-first into the Thames at high-tide.

Okay, hotshot -- where exactly have I been xenophobic in my post? Have I called any ethnicity or national from another country anything negative? Have I been antisemitic, or did I call Labour out on being antisemitic? For calling out the various parties' typical MOs every fucking year? That they constantly lie to people and do about heel-turns as soon as they're elected? That's life and the sorry state of our government mate, not "xenophobia".

That Labour isn't disgustingly antisemitic (pro tip: the people at the top are)? That the Conservatives are as trustworthy as someone saying, "Hey kid, you wanna see a dead body?" That the Green Party are so obsessed with "going green" that'd they'd ruin the economy and nation while doing so, due to being completely short-sighted? That the SNP are actually disliked by most Scotts because of how crazy they and their leader are? That the BNP aren't British Nazis? If you want xenophobia mate, go look at the BNP and elements of UKIP.

You just knee-jerk reacted to my saying that UKIP is the best of the worst in my opinion -- and given the state of our political system, that's like saying diving into a septic tank is better than diving into a city sewer.

Or is it because you're a Remoaner and I'm someone who happily voted for Brexit, despite the costs, because the EU is a dumpster fire that won't last another five--ten years unless a) they federalize (not going to happen -- Germany and France giving up sovereignty? Hah!) or b) change Germany's material good export policies towards the rest of the EU, which is benefiting Germany and Germany only at an unsustainable rate and at the expense of the rest of the EU nations, which won't happen because then Germany loses a massive benefit? That it was better to lop an arm off and deal with the trauma then than remain and slowly die of blood poisoning as the EU crumbles over time?

But, xenophobia? Pft. Use those two brain cells of yours for a change. kthxbye.

** Fleamont Potter: But I like JKR's humor, because she even said that this guy became a great duelist since so many made fun of his ridiculous name

Tom Marvolo Riddle is also an anagram for "Mr Tom a Dildo Lover". This guys must have gone through endless repetitions of dildo related names before finally getting to "I am Lord Voldemort"

Malfoy means bad faith in French. The Malfoys thoroughly fucked over Voldemort through their selfish actions. These guys would betray anyone and anything to save their own hides, and I'm actually glad they started out in bad guys' camp

Ginevra is the Italian form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinevere][Guinevere, wife of king Arthur]]. I find it creepy that Arthur Weasley named his daughter that way. If JKR is determined to name Weasley kids after royalties, Anne, Charlotte, Emma, Elizabeth, and Victoria are decent choices. Or to go really exotic, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d][Aethelflaed]] was a great British warrior queen.

Remus Lupin, already mentioned here, is just screaming to be the wolf guy.

I don't think Sirius' middle name is mentioned in canon, but fanon generally calls him Sirius Orion Black, which makes his initial SOB.

"Mione" was only mentioned once in canon, and that was when Ron spoke with a full mouth. Hermione on the other hand is nowhere near that rare, even a member of HBP's production team has it. Her name can be seen in the ending credits. The French do love that name though, as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_Hermione][12 of their warships]] were named Hermione. One of them fought in the American Revolutionary War, and has [[https://www.hermione.com/en/home/][a nice replica built in 2014]]. The British Royal Navy had 4 HMS Hermiones.

"SEVERUS!" Severus wakes up (he was sleeping) and he bellows,

"POTTER!" Then Sev and Albus look at each other, shocked, then, they both say at the same time,

"Potter named his son after me?"

The only times he tries to kill Harry without being targeted himself are in book 4, AFTER Harry has attacked him in book 1; in book 5 when Harry attacks his people; and in book 7 when Harry's conducting a guerilla war against him. Most of the aggro comes from Harry, at Dumbledore's urging. Dumbledore's the one who keeps saying how horrible Voldemort is, and targeting Harry at him.

*** I knew because my mom somehow knew, despite not being a native English speaker (she might have looked it up or something idk) and when I first started the series, I was the age where I couldn't really read on my own, so she read the first two books to me. Once I started reading on my own, I just kept pronouncing it the same way in my head.

I have a friend who I recently learned pronounced it “Her-Mee-Own” until she saw the movies.

** Honestly, Hermione has probably got the 'weirdest' name, in context. Magicals have a reason for their unusual naming conventions. That being that they're magical, and because of that they have a different historical context to draw from.

Hermione, with her non-magical parents, is an unusual name, in that it's so rare. Her name is the sort of name where if you met a Hermione in real life (at least before that HP books were published anyway), that Hermione would likely be the /only/ Hermione you'd ever meet.

That said though, an explanation of her name at least makes sense.

What doesn't make sense is the amount of seeming nominative determinism there is in the magical world. In Hogwarts alone, there are at least five teachers who have names that directly relate to what they teach (Pomona Sprout, Aurora Sinistra, Bathsheda Babbling, Septima Vector, Sybill Trelawney). Not to mention the dozens of named magicals that have names relating some aspect of themselves, whether they're writers of in universe books, their profession or simply what they are.

While nominative determinism is 'a thing' in reality, it's certainly not so strongly correlated as is depicted in the books. [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/naming-seers][And is something that JKR had to address after the fact because it was such an obvious phenomenon in the books]].

**** Eh, it's toss up really. They're both rare names, that's for sure, however, Dudley was certainly the better known of the two. When Dudley was named Dudley Moore was fairly well known and definitely getting into his stride in films (which is not to mention the nearly two decades he was on TV before that). In contrast the only time most people would have heard of the name Hermione would have been reading Shakespeare in school.

Personally I've know a Dudley, I've never met a Hermione.

As mentioned they're rare names. I wouldn't really call either name actually weird, but of the two Hermione is certainly the most unusual, particularly when coming from non-magical parents.
