I'm looking for a fic where students have magical pets. Magical creatures seem to be smarter than their non magical counterparts (for example owls and kneazles) i'm looking for that taken to the extreme, students with strong and useful creatures, I quite like the idea of a familiar bond but the main thing is the rare/powerful magical pets.

​

All recommendations that heavily include magical creatures are welcome.
