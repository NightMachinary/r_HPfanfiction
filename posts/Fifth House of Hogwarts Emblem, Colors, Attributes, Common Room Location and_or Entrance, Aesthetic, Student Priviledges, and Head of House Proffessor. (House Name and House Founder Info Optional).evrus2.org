House Fairfawn

Emblem depicts a Hart

Colors are White with Lavender

Attributes: House of Whimsy, Art, and Culture.

Common Room is located in a secret branch of the castle which leads into a beautiful area of the Forbidden Forest. It is a whimsical grove with safety barriers to trap a pocket of thermal/weather controlled space in lieu of real walls. Students can often be found snoozing on the forest floor instead of in their bedrooms. Nobody minds.

Friendly creatures and beings can and do waltz through (Unicorns, Fairies, Hippogriffs, Pegasus, the odd visiting Centaur or Phoenix, etc.). Two or three House Elves can be stopped and addressed in the open, if you can catch them. Some obscure ghosts wander in and regale students with tales of what life was like back in their day. A great White Hart lives in this area. It guards the students from danger, sometimes lets them ride or climb all over him, or sometimes curls up next to a sleeping student and acts as a great white Pillow or teddy bear.

There is no real furniture in the Fairfawn Common; but there are plants to sit on-or-by and the ground itself is perfectly comfortable. There are plenty of fun plants and fruit trees growing about (including patches of common floretic potions ingredients) but venemous plants must be grown in a specific room off of the Common. The Common room is never dark due to bioluminescent plants.

I imagine there being a waterfall and medium-sized pool, also, which serves as a freshwater source, a Library, and a Lost&Found area all at once. Reach your hand through the water and silently summon a book (or anything, really; including a magically-updated index of all of the books and items currently in there) and it will emerge perfectly dry.

There are actual hallways (their thresholds existing just inside of the safety barriers then extending outward) and scenic bedrooms for students to retire to. Portrait-magic (whatever it's called) is used to depict different kinds of animals and magical creatures watching and following after you and checking up on you all up and down the hallways. They alert a teacher if a student is ill or in trouble.

Each bedroom is magically painted to portray a different natural environment (e.g. a beach, a meadow, a desert oasis, etc.). There are /EITHER:/ No beds - only the most comfortable patches of earth ever camped on with pleasant-smelling flora surrounding. /OR:/ Maybe their bed is a giant flower. I am undecided on that.

Students are pretty much given leave to bring with them any kind of pet under the sun, as well as be in possession of more than one (unofficially, of course). A good many delve into animagery. Students are generally open-minded and are permitted the most overt leniency when delving into Olde, Archaic, and Traditional practices - much of which would be considered 'Dark' or 'Evil' or just plain 'Strange' by modern standards. /(I did dream up this house to be a better fit for Luna Lovegood, after all.)/ Students are also taught magical crafts and trades by the ghosts in attendance (such as painting and tailoring).

Head of House would be either a CoMC Proff. like Kettleburn or Hagrid, or the History of Magic Professor Binns.
