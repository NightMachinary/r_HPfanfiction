All I know from it was that he saw his two dead uncles? And then ends up outside in snow?

*** Ah! You're right!ðŸ˜¯ but it seems that Ron can see certain ones I think. Like The Prewett twins

**** I think I know which one you mean! A young woman (Pandora?) is the first one he sees, and then Regulus I'm pretty sure. I remember them practically raising him... I'm trying to find it but I can't remember more than the scene were he meets his uncles as ghosts the first time :/
