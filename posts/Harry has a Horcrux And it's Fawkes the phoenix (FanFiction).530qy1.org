** it's my understanding that phoenixes die quite frequently, they're destroyed so completely that they turn to ash. how would even an intentionally made horcrux survive that. besides, why bother when there's a perfectly good hat sitting just there.

you think after having her soul chewed on by riddles diary ginny is shedding her soul left and right every time she kills a death eater, giant, spider, whatever.?

** This theory asserts far too much without providing support. If you start throwing around terms like 'certainly' or 'we know', what you're saying either has to either be immediately obvious or else it requires something more. After all, if you start from a certain position, you can 'prove' almost anything.

*** I agree with the ritual part. But Harry wouldn't have felt remorse after killing the basalisk.
