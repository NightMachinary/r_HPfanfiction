As it says in the title.

It can be any job, focus on any character and ANY Era.

Can be Het/Slash/Femslash, no pairing.

It can be on fanfiction.net or on another site.

Would rather it be completed but if not it's fine.

It doesn't have to be just about the job, but I'd like it to be a good amount.

No character bashing! Characters hating or disliking each other is fine, but hating is normally a no go.

IF Harry is the main character, no Super powered Harry, no super intilligent Harry.

No Evil/Manipulative Dumbledore, if he's alive.

ANY character can be the main character, but if it's Hermione, please don't make her too perfect.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione


** Teddy is an Unspeakable and his career (& the case mentioned in the summary) is a huge part of this fic, even more than the relationship [Teddy x James] - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/154063]])

DH from Percy's perspective, so very ministry/workaholic centric, I love it [Percy x Kingsley] - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/489003]])
