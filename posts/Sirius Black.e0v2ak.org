A marauder era fic that has the focus on Sirius and his life, growing up as the heir to a powerful family, the struggles of accepting he is different and breaking away from his family. I want to see Sirius growing into his own person and changing from an impressionable child to a man that questions what his family tells him and makes his own opinions about the world. Sirius is a character with the potential for a really deep back story and I want to see it. If there isn't something like this it needs to be written.


** TheDivineComedian has a lot of wonderful stories about the Black family and the Marauders, like this:

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.
