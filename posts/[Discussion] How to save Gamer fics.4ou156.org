Gamer Harry fics often end up going the route of plot-less abandoned horrid stories. While they have potential, they rarely reach that potential, becoming caught up in numbers and skills while abandoning any semblance of a plot. What can be done to prevent them from going into that descent to the giant gaping hellhole of perpetually forgotten fanfiction?

What can be done to improve them?

Feel free to link your favorite one for everyone to read!


** Organization. A game has a lot of logistics people forget about or maybe remember(which makes it worse). This causes Gamer! fics as you call them to become cluttered messes. When does Harry level? What's considered an accomplishment? Do you want to include a skill tree? An inventory? How do you continue to make a Gamer! fic without making Harry incredibly overpowered? Am I straying too far from the actual Story and just focusing on the gamer part? This is much better related in manga or just actual video games.

And so I guess in short the only real answer is that you can save them by not writing them. They poorly translate onto written word in comparison to other methods. There's just too much to account for that if you actually tried to write a competent gamer fic you'd have easily a 700k+ block wall and by then thats a little unenjoyable. Those are my thoughts on it anyways.

*** This can be summed up to "plan an end".

If you set an upper threshold for the characters potential you can then work to fit the rest of the fic in.

*** What if I make it one of those "Illusion of choice games" (Except with actual choice) rather than, you know, An RPG or a MOBA or whatever the kids ar eplaying these days. Harry gets to choose Where he goes, certain actions, pieces of pre fabricated dialogue, but no shit like "You have leveled up! Now choose between these bullshit skills, of which one is clearly superior!" "Your charisma has one extra point now! You may fucking idk use imperius wanlessly because of it, yeah, that sounds balanced and logical"

**** Oh, I don't mean to detract you from writing one. I just find them incredibly difficult to write well.\\
That being said if you are. It would be best to list the attributes from said game that you want to model it after. That way you don't go all over the place with anything and everything from a video game you've ever seen. The first couple of chapters should explain(I believe) the extent of his gamer power and the advantages and disadvantages from there. Create a solid foundation of which to build on. Don't fall into a pit of walls of blocks of text where it's too much about the gamer aspect.

I believe what you mentioned however would be somewhat interesting. A lot of recent video games do a lot of story telling and allow the user to choose what to say,where to go, and what to do and the game develops as you go through making decisions. If you are looking for games to look at I would suggest games like Heavy Rain, Infamous, and Mass effect.

But in that case is it really even a "gamer" fic or Harry just intensely thinking about the decisions he makes.

** Do you consider Harry Potter and the Natural 20 a gamer fic? It could be that table top games translate better into fics than computer games do; table top games have to keep the mechanics just a little simpler because they're intended not to be played on a computer. Plus, they usually have an SRD that you can link to in order to explain how the rules work. This has two advantages: first, the author doesn't have to invent every single thing himself. Second, she doesn't have to write giant walls of text to explain the rules and skills to the readers. People who want to know can check the SRD. Those who don't can just enjoy the story.

I'm terribly confused. Is the author male, female, or both?

**** I hate gender neutral pronouns, because they all sound strange to me. So when I don't want to assume a gender for an author, I switch between male and female sometimes. I could have written "himself or herself" and "she or he", but I'm on mobile and that's a lot of typing. I assumed any gender confusion wouldn't bother people, because the gender of the author contributes nothing to my point, and doesn't matter in any way.

** Almost the only things you can be doing as the reader is to provide good feedback, to show your interest in the genre for encouraging more new authors to experiment with it, and to advertise stories you find to be well written.

The problem with gamer stories (IMO) is that they will inherently be difficult to write. The author of such a story will essentially have to do the work of several people at once: there's the requirement for the usual skills for writing novel-length stories, but then there's also the need for coming up with a thorough [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design#Design_elements][game design]] that will not clash with the plot you are trying to wrap it around.

This includes (but is not limited to) coming up with at least rough (but complete or at least nearly complete) sketches of the game interface, game formulas, game items, etc. In [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][/The Games We Play/,]] for instance, the author eventually didn't manage to keep up with the initial premise (promise) that [slaying a beast for the first time drops a unique item and spell] --- in the later chapters he started ignoring many dropped items and copying spell effects from video-games he'd played just to use them once (if even that) and move on. TGWP started off as a really well-written story, but its ending arcs were a mangled mess. I don't know if it could've been fixed if the author didn't hurry about finishing it so much, but even during the read-through one could see how some game rules would likely come later to bite the writer and make it harder for him to preserve the quality.

If it's a cross-fic with some already established game universe, then the author will also have to be knowledgeable about that game's universe and laws. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryPotterAndTheNatural20][/HP & the Natural 20/]] demonstrated that using the D&D environment can yield a well-written story; [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi][/Dungeon Keeper Ami/]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheTabulaAvatarUniverse][/Tabula Avatar/]] showed the same thing (if maybe to a lesser extent) about the [[http://dungeon-keeper.wikia.com/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper_Wiki][DK]] and [[http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki][BG]] respectively.

** I feel that less is more in those cases. Too often, the stories seem to get lost in grinding - and grinding is boring. I think removing a lot of the game mechanics, especially exact levels and numbers for a lot of the time, would do wonders to let the plot progress. The author can mention levels and ratings when it's important - like "Oh, unlocked X", he doesn't have to write scene after scene where skills are bought and trained that we never see used in important ways afterwards.

Though that would mean there'd need to be a plot in the first place too.
