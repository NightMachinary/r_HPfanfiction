** You know why Granger Enchanted died? Why portkey.org died? Why a few similar sites which names I don't even remember died?

Because there is no need for them. It's inconvenient to search fics outside of big aggregators. And those sites usually had a terrible UI, worked badly with mobiles etc.

The age of those sites is a long past and that's good, because they are not needed.
