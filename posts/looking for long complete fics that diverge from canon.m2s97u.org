I'm looking for fics that start in something close to the canon universe; Harry discovering he's a wizard, learning magic at hogwarts and fighting voldemort on the side. But with a profound divergence from canon happening over the course of the story either as a result of a single major divergence event or a buildup of small changes.

Long and complete please.

Ideally, I want to look at the story about year 2 or 3 and say

"well, the train of the original plot has derailed, those stations of canon that weren't flattened are going to be missed as it barrels merrily through the English countryside, there's 100,000 words left to read and I can relax and continue knowing that the story cannot be abandoned because its already finished"


** Tbh, there are a LOT of these. I'm not one of those "you should just search for ships/topics you want instead of asking here people", but in reality, with nothing to go on other than the fics being canon divergent, you will likely get a lot of suggestions that you may not be into because it doesn't take the story in a particular direction or just ship a particular couple

** linkao3(Seasons of Change: Year 1) is a great For Want of a Nail fic, the changes are gradual but accumulate, especially in the following installations. Year 2 is also complete, while Year 3 is currently ongoing. For me the best thing about it are the interpersonal relationships, but the plot is also very good. It is also on FFnet, if you prefer to read over there.

  It's just before Christmas in Harry's first year. Giving presents does not come naturally to a boy who has never received any. But sometimes, it only takes voicing a random thought to bring changes to one's life.This story is also posted on FanFiction.

** linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) is not /quite/ finished, but has just reached the climax of seventh year and is very steadily updating (Saphroneth posts small chapter segments on SpaceBattles every couple of days, then publishes the whole chapter to FFN when done). The canon challenges are quite swiftly derailed, because the real story here is that he's at a school to learn /magic/! (Also, he's a fire-breathing dragon. His friends are fine with this.)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
