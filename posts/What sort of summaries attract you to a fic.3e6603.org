** This is actually a really good question which I'm not even sure of the answer to myself. But I can tell you what I avoid immediately:

- summaries that have any sentence starting with "What if"

- "I suck at summaries" or the equally annoying "I promise it's good, just read!"

- summaries with spelling/grammatical errors. If you can't even spend the time proofreading your own summary, then you're definitely not going to be proofreading your story. In which case, I'm not going to bother. Same applies with titles. Please capitalize your titles properly. Just please.

- words/sentences in all caps

- also this is probably just a weird thing for me, but I usually don't even bother reading summaries for stories with titles that start with "Harry Potter and the...." I honestly don't know why. I just feel like that's such a boring and easy way to title a story. There are exceptions to this obviously. For example, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Auror is an excellent fic. But yeah, that's just a personal thing for me.

Overall, I like summaries that give enough info for me to know what to expect, but still leave plenty of room for guessing. So on a spectrum, it should be on the more mysterious end, if that makes sense. Mysterious is always more intriguing for me.

** Few things that annoy me are:

- "I suck at summaries". This is just lazy. You can write a story, but can't write 2-3 sentence description?
- "more info inside". Your summary should entice me to read the story and often if I have to open the link just to see what this is about ... forget it.
- "No slash". Why so many people think they need to point out explicitly "no slash"? I very often search stories with word "slash" filtered out. Like many many others. We missing out on many potentially good stories!
- List of acronyms about relationships in your story. I saw a summary that had nothing, but long list of every "romantic" pair in the story!
- Quotation from you story. This is a particular pet-peeve of mine. Many summaries simply are a quote that some character supposedly says. Usually cheesy and out of context. I prefer simple description.
- bad grammar. Try to get at least your summary right. Please!

*** There was one story, not HP, that had a summary that was a quotation from the main character. Actually, I don't know if it counts as a quotation since he never actually says it, but it's in first person, so close enough. It was quite literally the greatest and most enticing summary I have ever read.

** This is my personal Dont do list when a summary is there. 1) If the summary contains the phrase "FemHarry" Nine times out of ten this fic has the character paired with Ron/Draco/snape. 2 If the summary says "I suck at summaries" or "more indepth summary inside" 3 Grammar mistakes that are extreme. (I am not a grammar nazi.) 4 Character name misspellings. (this means that I will loath the fic.) 5 If the phrase "up for adoption" is in the summary. These means that the author stopped feeling pride in their work. 6 the summary only uses Trope lingo/ pairings. I dont care if its Dark!Ginny and Dark!Harry. H/G R/Hr D/P N/H or anything like that if there is no summary.

  What makes a summary appealing enough to click?
#+end_quote

Easier to say what I avoid:

- "I promise its a good story!"

- "I suck at summaries."

- I actively avoid any teacher/student or adult/child relationships.

- Anything that has been done to death and undeath.

- Fem!Harry (I have never seen this done well enough to my liking or in a way that didn't leave me feeling wierded out).

- Stories where the summary doesn't tell me anything of what the fic is about.

** Rather than being a negative Nancy I thought I'd try to describe what I actually like to see in a summary.

- Proper sentences. This is self-explanatory.

- Some evidence of imagination. If the summary makes the fic sound like a regurgitation of another fic I'll probably give it a miss. Do something unusual! It might not work, but at least you tried. If I see a bizarre crossover then I'll almost certainly give it a go. Yet another copy-pasta of some SilverAegis fic will be skipped.

- An indication that there is a plan. 'What if' fics fall afoul of this rule more than the others. The premise isn't enough, you need to give me some idea that you've actually got an idea of what will happen in the story.

- A bit of mystery. So I want to know that you have a plan for the story, but I don't want you to tell me it. Give it to me in the vaguest possible terms. Just enough to pique my interest without spoiling anything.

- Tags are a strange one. Specific tags will ensure I don't read a story (like slash) but deliberately leaving them out of the summary will just make me annoyed when I get further in. Tag the stuff that's obviously ymmv.

Of course you can do all this stuff and I might still skip over the story but at least this time it'll be because I don't want to read the story and not because the summary makes it sound like crap.

** Usually if I'm looking for something, I've got a pretty good idea of what I want to read, and I look for keywords, certain pairings, ages, rating, trigger warnings, etc to see if it's something I'd be interested in, and specifically look for things marked "complete", since I really hate waiting for updates. I know I'm not going to enjoy an M rated story involving sexual violence towards an 11 year old Harry, or an incesty smut fic as much as I might enjoy a nice little friendship/adventure story between Neville and Luna, so that does usually take precedence.

After that, I typically don't care about the summaries, but it does really put me off to see comments like "I suck at summaries", as I take it as an indication that the person is not very confident in their own writing skills, which makes me not really want to read. If there's bad grammar or spelling (unless obviously stylized), that usually indicates that the story is going to follow suit and is usually a huge turn off.

Things that do occasionally hook me: Lyrics or verses from a song or poem that I know well and love, riddles or the like, mysteries (ie. "What Harry and Hermione are about to uncover may change their world forever..." "Well, I wasn't going to read it, but now I've got to find out what the mystery is!"), writing style, unique or interesting plotlines and pairings, detailed and interesting banners/images where relevant, recognizing the author from another story ("Well, I didn't think I was in the mood for twincest, but this is the same guy who wrote that cute Luna and Neville friendship fic I liked so much...").

Things that usually put me off a story I was going to read: Song lyrics to music I really dislike, crappy or overtly angsty poetry, anything that seems to glorify self harm, crappy banners or images that are obviously badly photoshopped (if you're going to invest 6 months of your life in a story, either leave it banner-free, or take more than 2 minutes to attend to those details; I don't mean lack of artistic skill, I mean just clearly not trying at all), Non-canon OCs that seem like they're definitely Mary Sue/Gary Stus from the description alone ("Violet Adorée, the latest tranfer from Beaubaxons is beautiful, smart, powerful and hiding a secret; she's Harry Potter's twin sister! (and also a multi-animal animagus, and part veela, and the only one who can defeat Voldemort and win the heart of Draco Malfoy)), actually Marys and Garys in general, recognizing the author from a story I disliked ("Oh, it's the twincest guy... no thanks."), really long, waffley summaries and/or intros before it gets into any real story, and crossovers (I'm just not a fan, I like my Harry Potter to stay firmly Potterish).

Basically, put a bit of effort in, try to be a little creative if you can, but if you can't just be as concise as possible, and try not to give too much away. Take pride in your work, and spend a little time presenting it nicely. Make sure to tag anything that could be triggering, or simply age inappropriate clearly. If you write a lot, and within very different genres, maybe consider creating a second or even third account in which to publish things that wildly differ from your normal style. Try to keep things more or less consistent and more people will follow you as an author, as opposed to just your stories, because they know what to expect. And the golden rule: If any part of your story, in any way resembles that of My Immortal, please scrap it immediately.

** It's way easier to say what you don't like in a summary than what you do like, as all the other responders can attest. But I'll give it a shot.

Summaries should actually inform the reader about the type of story they'll be reading. On a basic level, is it AU or canon-compliant? Does it make use of tropes -- time travel, soul bond, hidden magical inheritances, etc? Is there any bashing -- this is a divisive one that I think most readers appreciate knowing up front, whether they want to then avoid the fic or they enjoy bashing and are specifically looking for fics that have it. Is it a ship fic -- if so, what's the pairing? Are there any OCs? Does it take place in Hogwarts or after Hogwarts?

These are all the kind of things that readers like to know so they can decide whether they want to read the fic or not. No one likes having to stop reading a fic midway because a major trope/pairing/whatever that they hate suddenly appears. On the flip side, many readers go looking for certain pairings or plot tropes and appreciate having that information when deciding what to read next.

All that said, if the summary only consists of these types of warnings, like this: "Dark!Super!Harry Weasley!Bashing H/HR Soul Bond" then the fic just comes across as incredibly generic, as there are tons of fics that have the exact same type of summary. So while it's nice to know these things up front, you also want to have something that sets your fic apart from the masses. Something intriguing, something that hints at the direction your fic is going in.

I think that [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/536450]["The Never-ending Road" by laventadorn]] has an excellent summary that captures all of this:

"AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet"

** For me, it's a bit harder to explain. Good grammer is pretty much a must, and the "What if" ones annoy me, but the more unusual descriptions are always fun.

I'll just link a few and you'll see what I mean. While I don't care for the second two as much as the first, it's these type of descriptions that catch my eye and drag me in. Hope this helps.
