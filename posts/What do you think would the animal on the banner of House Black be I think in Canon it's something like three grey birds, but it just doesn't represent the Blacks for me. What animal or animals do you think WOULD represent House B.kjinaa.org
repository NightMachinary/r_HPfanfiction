#+TITLE: What do you think would the animal on the banner of House Black be? I think in Canon it's something like three grey birds, but it just doesn't represent the Blacks for me. What animal or animals do you think WOULD represent House Black and its values? A wolf? A tiger?

** Three crows or ravens (it's all corvidae) is presumably either a reference to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morr%C3%ADgan][Morrigan]], or one hell of a coincidence otherwise. Thus the whole proclivity for war and madness and doing terrifying things to anyone who fucks with their family, as well as the occasional gift for shapeshifting.

** Wolves and tigers are too associated with nobility and honor. To represent the Blacks you'd need something with the same symbolism as a snake - respectable to the people within it and yet ill-reputed to outsiders.

I like the fanon/movie canon of crows or ravens for them. Intelligent birds, tool users, associated with wisdom, and have gothic Edgar Allen Poe vibes. But also, they're carrion eaters, associated with black magic (pun not intended), and they attack viciously and carry grudges for years.

** Something that can fly or related to the night sky. I can see a thestral as an option, maybe a hippogriff or some other kind of flying horse.

** Well, in the movies it's three black ravens over white under a golden arm proudly holding a wand over red, so I'll take that as their coat of arms.

** I've given this some thought, since my fic is long on House Black, and [[http://arenaillustration.com/news/new-house-editions-of-harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-phoenix/levi-pinfold_harry-potter-and-the-order-of-the-pheonix-black-family-crest/][this is my favorite illustration I've found]]. No ravens, alas, but I love the greyhounds (skinny and a wee bit inbred).
