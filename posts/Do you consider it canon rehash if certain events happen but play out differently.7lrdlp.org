For example, a graveyard resurrection that doesn't have anyone die, where Harry gets away using a different method, etc.

A Department of Mysteries battle where different people go, where Sirius doesn't fall through the Veil, where Voldemort actually gets the prophecy.

Where Arthur Weasley gets attacked by Nagini still, but Harry's better Occlumency skills stop him from seeing who was attacked, or the entire vision in the first place, and Arthur dies.

Where Harry and Dumbledore go to the cave, but Malfoy doesn't go through with his plot.

A Gringotts break in that plays out differently, but is a Horcrux break in regardless.

** It depends on whether the events that played out differently actual butterfly to effect future events. If they do then I'm pretty sure thats considered a plot divergence.

E.g. Cedric doesn't die in the cemetery, he witnesses Voldemort being reborn with Harry. They manage to convince the minister that he's back, so Voldemort doesn't have enough time to gain his power back. This could lead to a different 5th, 6th and 7th year.

** If you "change" things, but still hit stations of canon, then your changes are worthless. Like fics that put Harry in a situation where he conceivably wouldn't go to save Hermione from the troll for whatever reason, but the author still forces the fic on canon rails so that Harry saves Hermione.

** According to the dictionary, a rehash is a reuse of old ideas or material without significant change or improvement. I feel as long as the event had a reason to happen (no matter how different the characters are, Hermione always seems to run to the bathroom crying) and there are at least a few changes to make it interesting and original to read, that's fine.

I think all your examples are perfectly ok and I would go as far as to say adding some canon events make the fanfiction better and more realistic. I mean Voldemort wouldn't suddenly stop having an interest in the Prophecy or try to change his horcrux hiding place if Harry befriends the slytherins or something like that.

On a side note, is this spoilers for you own fanfiction linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise)?

Yeah, this kinda thing makes me struggle with trying to avoid canon rehashing. Sometimes there's just no reason Voldemort would suddenly stop caring about the prophecy, or suddenly not want to get resurrected.

Nah. I just made the examples up on the spot. I mean, I'd kinda have to scrap the majority of my outline if Voldemort never got resurrected, so I shouldn't say that /none/ of it happens. The examples weren't taken from my story, though.

**** Avoiding canon rehashing isn't the same as avoiding canon motivations.

For example, you could write a story where a much lonelier Harry winds up with the diary after Lucius attempts to stick it to Ginny. That story would play out extremely different even though canon motivations are pretty much the same.

Can do something similar with the prophecy. Harry, for whatever reason, isn't bothered by the horcrux in him, or it doesn't exist at all. Suddenly Voldemort needs a different way to get Harry into the DoM or even go himself, both of which can play out way differently than canon regardless of wanting the same thing.

tl;dr - Characters can want the same thing while changing the reason of why they can't have it.

*** I'm of the opinion that the stone always appears in Hogwarts in year 1 and someone gets the diary year 2. Harry's actions or lack of it wouldn't stop Lucius giving someone the diary, maybe not Ginny but someone, and the stone shows up before Harry does. Lots of scenarios where 3-7 don't happen though.

  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Life never stops trying to tear her apart, but as everyone soon learns, Iris Potter bites back. Five unique tasks. Animagus and eventual reasonably powerful fem!Harry. Fourth year.

** I would say it depends on how the scene is written. If the events leading up to it match canon exactly and you use the same or similar enough dialogue and descriptions as in the book, but Cedric lives, I would still consider it a canon rehash. On the other hand, if the actual details are totally different and Harry's internal dialogue is totally different and events play out differently I would not consider it a canon rehash.

One of the most frustrating rehashes I see tend to replace one character for another but the events play out exactly the same. Such as Harry is in slytherin and Draco is his side kick for some reason and they still go and rescue Hermione from the troll. Or Draco still steals the Rememberball, slytherin Harry catches it and Snape puts him on the team (Really? There is no way he would do that considering how he feels about Harry). I would say in your other examples, I would prefer you skip the cave scene or any parts of battle if you are going to keep them the same. Or at least put a new spin on them so it's not boring to read.

** That's not really a rehash you are describing. There's nothing wrong with using the stations of canon as long as you do your own spin on things and it makes a difference.

Having Neville instead of Ron go after the stone, just to reveal that Neville is a Chessmaster and he sacrifices himself for Harry and Hermione to go on, is bad. But if he suggests using the brooms from earlier and simply flying over the chessboard and the fire so the final showdown is 3vs1 and having Neville actually die in the process is no longer a canon rehash.

I think it comes down to choosing the right starting point. For example in one of my stories I have Harry hang out with Katie and Leanne because Ron and Hermione are fighting over Wormtail. Therefore a different confrontation with Pettigrew occurs and he ends up kissed. However, my story only starts at the end of the year and after a quick flashback the story goes on from there. Harry dropped Divination for Muggle Studies but that is only mentioned in Chapter 4 instead of dedicating an entire chapter just to show that scene. And a lot of stories choose the wrong starting point. If you are just changing a couple of minor details in Book one and nothing in CoS there's no need to show us the first two years. Just drop a line or two somewhere, which explains the changes.

** If there's no point of deviation (re-using a few canon scenes? Sure, but you have to make it clear how the characters who are very often unlike their canon counterparts get there! An intelligent Slytherin or Ravenclaw Harry for example needs a different motivation to confront Voldemort than "Doing the right thing" (the Raveclaw would IMHO rationalize that this is NOT his fight, he's a child and fighting is adult business, while the Slytherin might just want to survive and couldn't care less for "doing the right thing" without there being anything in it for him!)) and it's just one canon event after another?

Yeah! Boring rehash and illogical! If you influence stuff a lot then the path of events is disrupted and the other events will not happen like this (especially events the characters can directly influence! So an intelligent Harry could not stop the Tri-Wizard-Tournament from being restarted, especially if he doesn't know about the effort being made, but he might not save Sirius from the dementors or see any reason to go after Peter because he might have ignored to clues in favor of more studying!)
