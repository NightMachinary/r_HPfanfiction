Looking for the best muggle AU. I read one recently where harry is a police officer, and it was a murder mystery type thing.

I've also been interested by the stories that place harry and co. in America, or he comes to America after the war to get away from the press, etc. I tend to prefer post hogwarts fics for whatever reason :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/The-Granger-Principle][The Granger Principle]], linkffn(13312738): CI5 officers Harry Potter and Ron Weasley have to investigate and protect a mysterious Doctor Hermione Granger. Nothing about that woman's story and behavior makes sense.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.
