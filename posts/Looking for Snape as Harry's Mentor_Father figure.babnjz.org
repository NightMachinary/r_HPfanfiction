I'm feeling sentimental and would love some recommendations of fics where Snape (or another adult) mentors/becomes parent to Harry. I just finished Emancipated Minor and want more to read.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] linkao3(10588629) - arguably the most in-character mentor!Snape fic out there, covers all 7 years, has a WIP sequel

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/278297][The Guiltless]] linkao3(278297) - set 6th year, has a complete sequel

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/598019][Digging for the Bones]] linkao3(598019) - set during 3rd year, Snape is Harry's biological father, note the trigger warnings

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  When Harry appears at the Welcoming Feast wearing a glamor only Snape notices, Snape decides to find out what the glamor is hiding. You, the guiltless, will pay for your father's sins,Roman, until you repair the decayingtemples and shrines of the gods, and theirimages, filthy with blackening smoke.When you act as servant of the gods, you rule:from them all beginning, leave them the ending.Horace, Odes, III-6

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

** The first Sevitus (Severus adopts Harry, not biological father) I read and liked was linkffn(Fixing Past Mistakes by DebsTheSlytherinSnapefan). It covers childhood years and /isn't/ set in Hogwarts (which might be a good or a bad thing for you). It also very early gives Severus proper closure with Lily, so the fic never has him get mentally stuck on what could have been as some fics do.

** I love Mentor Snape fics, half my HP bookmarks are in this tropeland.

The Best Revenge is a Hufflepuff Harry, Snape as mentor/dad fic, has a sequel and is really good read. Maybe not the best best written, but the concepts are worth it. Pretty sure Snape ends up with Charity in book 2, but its primarily a gen fic with that being a minor thing in the background. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge]]

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7646305]] Snakes Start to Sing is good, if you don't mind Drarry (Mind, only book one is finished, so they are 11 and there isn't much Drarry there). Book two has only 1 chapter and hasn't been updated since Nov tho.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225/chapters/21128351]] Meaning of Mistletoe is an amazing story (its Sev/Lupin, with the sequel being Drarry) where Snape kidnaps Harry from the Dursley's at 4 and him and Lupin raise him in secret-its a LF with 1-2 sequels if I recall, and really well done, I rec it to everyone I know.
