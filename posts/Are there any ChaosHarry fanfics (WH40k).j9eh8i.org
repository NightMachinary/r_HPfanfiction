I've read linkffn(Thousand Shinji) recently and loved it.

I wonder if there are any similar fics set in the HP universe, with Harry becoming a Chaos Sorcerer/Daemon or interacting with Ruinous Powers in some other way.


** Not that I'm aware of. linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow And The Godemperorless Heathens by littlewhitecat) has Harry as the exact opposite, with a serious case of the arse as regards the ruinous powers.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

  Shinji is his father's son, and with a little mentoring from an unlikely source, he will learn the ways of plotting and scheming, along with a few other useful skills. Gendo is so screwed. And so is everyone else. Crossover

** I had to look up that wh40k is a video game and Chaos is a thing from it. There is a fanfic where Harry is General Chaos of the Chaos Legion, but it's not related to wh40k. That isn't the fic you're looking for. It can go about its business. Move along. The Force gives you control over mismatching fics.

*** WH40K is actually a miniatures wargame. The videogames are based upon the setting. There's also Warhammer (discontinued) and Warhammer Age of Sigmar, which might be alternate universes based on what I've briefly read. They also have videogames too.

**** Warhammer Fantasy Battle (Just Warhammer when it started out) was the original miniatures ruleset for tabletop battles in an Extruded Fantasy Product setting (which eventually got fleshed out into a quite good late-medieval/early-early-modern mostly-Europe fantasy setting.) Factions are your standard Elfs/Orcs/Men/Dwarfs with sub-variations for flavour and a couple of unique-to-the-setting minor factions.

Warhamer 40,000 was the sci-fi spinoff of Warhammer Fantasy (literally the same rules in the first edition) that eventually ended up way more popular and got its core IP licensed out for video games. The factions are: Catholic Space Nazis, Catholic Space Nazis in Power Armour, Catholic Space Nazi Nuns With Flamethrowers, BDSM Space Elves, Machiavellian Space Elves, Space-Fungus Football Hooligans, The All-Devouring Swarm Of Bugs, Five Different Flavours Of Omnicidal Chaos Maniacs, Robot Space Pharaohs, and the Happy Smiley Sunshine Space-Caste Cult. There are some minor factions and variants, and the sadly-retconned-out-of-existence Space Dwarfs, but those are the main ones. Whole thing was a Bungit Stew of every other sci-fi setting from the previous century of genre fiction, which evolved into the current setting once they hired some actual writers.

Warhammer Age of Sigmar is the sequel to the now-discontinued Warhammer Fantasy Battle, and is its own whole new setting, but it came out after I got bored of it all and sold my toy soldiers, so I'm hazy on the details.

**** Oh cool. Those sorts of games interested me more than video games, back in the day. Thanks.
