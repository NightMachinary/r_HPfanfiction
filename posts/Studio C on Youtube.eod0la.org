Has anyone seen these things? Studio C, a comedy channel group on Youtube, does a whole bunch of Harry Potter joke sketches.

Harry Potter Family Names - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIexDBVjpic]] A Homeschooler at Hogwarts - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HwZ0hIMJBU]] Harry Potter and the Mirror of Erised - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flz2y15vZas]]

There's a few more, but those three are bloody brilliant. I kind of want to see a fic based on Ron's view of the Mirror of Erised now. :D


** Have you seen Lord of the potter by them? It's the best one in my opinion. If you haven't you need to watch it

*** Agreed. It may not have been my introduction to Studio C (Tint Wizard was), but this is by far the best.

*** I had not, but I have now and that was magnificent. I kind of want the fandom to send it to Ian McKellen and see if he'll do one. I bet we could get him to do it at a convention or something. :D

*** Oh my. That one with the Creme Brulee was hilarious! I love it. Seems like something Nonjon would come up with. :D
