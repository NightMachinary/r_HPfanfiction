Does anyone here ever remember reading a fic/author profile of the Sliding Scale of Evil Dumbledore?

I remember it was on FFN and ran from 1 to 11 with 1 being every bit the perfect grandfather figure he is meant to be in canon and 11 being full evil bastard hell-bent on Harry's death and subjugation of the magical world.

It had some great tidbits in it but I only bookmarked the page instead of copying the text, and now cannot find it in my bookmarks.


** I think canon Dumbledore is like 5 or 6 on that scale. I've seen fic dumbledores who don't let Harry stay with the Dursleys, have better reasons for keeping him there, who try to get a trial for Sirius, etc.

*** Those points question the competency of canon Dumbledore, not his morals and intentions. I don't remember a single thing in canon he did out of selfishness, outside flashbacks.

**** I agree, it's pretty clear in canon that Dumbledore is intended to be an unambiguously good wise magic grandfather until the maturation of the story reveals that he, like all adults, is fallible and has made mistakes. The various plot holes that Dumbledore is responsible for are not meant to be read into. On a sliding scale where 1 is Willy Wonka and 10 is LOTR, the series starts at 1 and ends maybe at 6. Character actions in a Willy Wonka universe need to be evaluated by the logic of that same universe and obviously once the hero has been orphaned he needs to be left with his horrible dreary Muggle family until it's time for him to discover his origin story.

*** He's probably asking after my scale ([[/u/Tenebris-Umbra]] linked it just below), the scale was designed to put canon Dumbledore at 0, though it should be mentioned that canon actions /with malicious intent/ do earn a point, where good intent does not.

**** It's missing the classic 'bound Fawkes to himself'. It's a good selection of nasty traits the fandom like to give him. I wonder what the highest-scoring fic out there is.

***** Probably Partially Kissed Hero. It's got an absolutely insane over the top evil Dumbledore who still manages to get outwitted by Harry at every turn

** Are you thinking of Leyrann's profile with "The Manipulative Dumbledore Scale"?

*** That is a very interesting scale, but definitely not the one I'm looking for. Though I will be noting it down for reference too. Thank you for suggesting it.

I am certain this was a scale from one to eleven where it gave brief summaries of the various levels and their actions. I'm so miffed that I lost it, but back then I had no manipulative Dumbledore stories so it was just interesting rather than useful.

** I vaguely remember a story like this - the harry was some sort of time traveler that switched universes on the regular, which is why he had the scale in the first place. I /think/ it was some sort MoD!Harry, or least, that trope usually has a universe hopping harry happen to it the most.
