So recently I was watching a vid on how whale hunting in the 19th century f****ed us all up, by reducing the amount of fishes and reducing the carbon absorption capabilities of the ocean.

So my point what would be the magical solution to get whales back to pre hunting levels.

** Well the obvious solution would be to travel back in time, find a pair of humpback whales named George and Gracie, and bring them back to the present to repopulate the species.

** The obvious answer is to use transfiguration to turn fish into baby whales and then release them into the wild.

** Well, first you steal a Klingon ship and slingshot around the sun to go back in time...

Oh wait, wrong franchise.
