Story: The Heir of Gellert Grindelwald [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10850467]]

This puts an interesting spin on how a fairly different Harry would be raised. I has angst and intrigue. It puts a different spin on different characters. Its not complete but its something worth reading because it wants you to read more it tempts you to read more. the writing is superb but im not the best english student. The plot is a bit like scrubs if you've ever watched it. It has comedic points where you question if this is a parody and other points where you think this is a serious fic.


** If you can't be bothered to explain why you think it's interesting, why should I be bothered to read it?

** No explanation? No praises to the quality of writing and extraordinary plot, that keeps the reader either on edge or in fits of laughter or tears?

Not sure I can be bothered to be brutally honest
