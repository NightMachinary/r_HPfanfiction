Cool. Yeah, there's about another five chapters on the Dark Lord Potter forums, but you need an account to access it.

If you get an account and log-in to it, then click the 'Link WbA' on the link below, it should bring you to those chapters. It's still unfinished though, unfortunately.

****** Try log out and log back in again. It can happen sometimes if you leave your profile logged in - something to do with lagging updates in how your computer interacts with the website, IIRC. If that doesn't work, then I'm afraid I really don't know.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
