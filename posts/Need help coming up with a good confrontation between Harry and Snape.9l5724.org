I'm currently working on a story where Sirius is freed and Harry actually does well in his classes. Harry is still in first year, he's in Slytherin but is not political and gets along with his housemates. I'm trying to minimize bashing but in my story Snape has mental health issues he needs to get help with. I left the last chapter at this:

"Severus Snape could feel the bile rising up his throat to choke him. They were idiotic enough to let that rabid dog out of his cage, and even celebrated the act! Black had been capable of murder at fifteen, did no one realize he deserved to be in Azkaban? McGonagall had started crying over her breakfast when the news came out, and the other dunderheads had looked in similar states. Dumbledore had looked ashamed, but only because he had contributed to getting Black imprisoned in the first place! As if that was something to be ashamed of! Dumbledore had been at the trial, he could have kept Black away, but no, not his precious Gryffindor!

Severus threw the offending newspaper into his private fireplace and fell into his armchair.

Damn Black! Ooh, how did he do it? How did he always manage to avoid his just punishment?

A hate-filled snarl twisted Severus's face. It was all the Potter brats fault! He used Lily's own words to set that monster loose on society! Well, he'll show him! Potter will learn a lesson his father should have learned a long time ago - Princes were not to be trifled with!"

So, I kind of built up the confrontation between Snape and Harry, but I'm not actually sure what that confrontation should be. My Harry is very normal for eleven (not an uber genius, not a magical prodigy, etc.) so he could easily get hurt in an outright attack. Harry does have a lawyer in his corner, but everything I come up with feels flat. I'm not good at writing confrontations or action scenes anyway.

Edit: Also, not being uber intelligent or cunning myself, I can't come up with a Snape worthy idea.


** You say that your Harry is just a ordinary 11 years young so why do it like a confrontation? Make im act like any 11 year young. Just Snape screaming at him and Harry just does not know how to respond so he just stay quiet and then get him too right a letter too Sirius explaining the whole thing. And then have Sirius storm the castle to kick the shit out of Snape because what fucking asshole scream at a 11 years young?

*** Thanks, and that would be a good idea if I hadn't already done something like that earlier. Harry reacts by studying harder for Potions and leaving Snape nothing to complain about. And since Harry is a Slytherin, his roommates are on his side so Snape doesn't really have an appreciative audience for his bullying.

** What's the story title? I want to read this.

Depending on how your Harry is characterized, you can have him not react and sneakily get revenge later, explode on Snape (with some aspect of snape preventing him from cursing Harry), he could be bewildered and quiet and let it go, he could storm out of potions, file a restraining order against Snape, etc. It really depends on what type of person you want him to be (and how realistic of an 11 yr old, because frankly most 11 yr olds are going to get their parents involved) and what resources he has to fight back.

The thing is it needs to be big enough that Dumbles and the other profs force Snape to get help... Maybe I'll have him blow up during potions, scare the students, and have them all run away screaming.

**** Having him lose control during a class would definitely make people look very hard at his behavior. Maybe toss in some characteristics of Harry's that remind Snape of either James or Lily, so he thinks Harry is mocking him?

** I just read this earlier today!

One of my biggest concerns with your fic so far has been Snape, actually. He comes off as exceptionally unhinged, though if you're making that a point of the story then it's much less of an issue, and, depending on the way you go with it, could be a boon to the story overall.

You could have Snape get his revenge by sabotaging Harry in some way. Slip the wrong ingredient into a potion to mess it up so he could have a real reason to critique him. Once the potion goes wrong, have Snape go off on him. Have him release the months of built up potter-hate. Make it waaaaay too personal. Have it end with harry just staring up at snape, just hurt, sad, and confused about how a professor who had never met before could have such a severe dislike for him while the rest of the Slytherins and Gryffindors just look on with this "what the fuck, bro" type of feeling. Maybe have one of the others (Blaise seems like a sharp kid) tell Harry later that he saw that Snape had sabotaged him. Siruis ends up confronting Snape ("Is this about us? Me and James and Remus and Pettigrew? Maybe we deserve it. Fuck, I know /I/ deserve it. But him? Hes just a kid. Hes just a goddamned kid, Severus. He doesnt deserve any of this.") Snape argues with him, eventually expelling him from his office, but cant stop thinking about it, even after Sirius leaves, and eventually comes to term with his behavior and decides he needs help. The final straw is when Harry himself confronts Snape ("One of the other students, I won't say who, saw you slip the [ingredient] into my Cauldron. I just want to know why?" "...I don't know, anymore...") And snape decides to get help. Maybe he asks Jackie to reccomend him a muggle therapist (assuming your world doesnt have a proper magical counterpart).

One of the other ideas I'm partial to is the Repentant Siruis. I imagine that Sirius tricking Snape into almost killing himself is among Sirius' worst memories as well. I'm sure that, at first he defended it as a harmless prank ("Snivellus is fine! What's the big deal?!"), but over time he realized the true weight of what he did. After all, had Snape gotten bit, Remus would have certainly been expelled and faced significant legal consequences. I'm sure he also would come to understand just how close he came to murdering another student.

Dementor exposure brings your worst memories to the forefront of your mind, and spending 10 years in such close quarters with them surely would have forced him to spend a ridiculous amount of time considering the event.

A sincere, heartfelt apology to Snape could very well be the sort of thing to break him out of his rage, as it's the exact opposite of everything he expects from Sirius.

But ultimately it's your story. Do what you feel is best.

*** Some of this may come as a spoiler, so sorry for that. Thanks for the thorough response! I've actually decided to go with a variation of your first idea. The thing is, Sirius is also in need of serious (haha) mental help, so I'm planning to go with the idea that once Snape gets into the magical equivalent of mental health institute, he and Sirius meet up and work through their issues there. Both of them need a lot of help and while Sirius will start a correspondence with Harry soon, the two won't actually meet until summer before third year (as a sort of nod to canon).
