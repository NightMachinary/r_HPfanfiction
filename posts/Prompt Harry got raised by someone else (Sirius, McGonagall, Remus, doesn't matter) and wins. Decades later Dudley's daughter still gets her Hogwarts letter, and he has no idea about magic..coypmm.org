The bot buggered it up the first time.

FWIW, I'm pretty sure brand-new fics that are like <1 hour old always fail. The bot seems to use Google search to find fics, and it doesn't work if Google has not indexed the fic you want to link yet.

*** There's a glaring error in your story. Dudley's daughter introduces herself as Primrose Alexandria /Potter/ instead of Dursley. Normally I wouldn't react to typos like this, but that's jarring.
