There was a fic I read a while ago where Harry goes back to Egyptian times, but I can't find it. Specific details include a thunderbird at one point, and a cat that sent him back in time. If you can't find the fic, then maybe some like it? I really liked the concept!

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
