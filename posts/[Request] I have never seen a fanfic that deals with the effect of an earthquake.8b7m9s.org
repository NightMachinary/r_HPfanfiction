As in nature earthquakes, not one creates by spells or rituals. Anyone have any fics?


** Well the series does take place in Britain, a place not exactly /known/ for its earthquakes. I mean maybe you have to reparo your chimney stack but that's about it.

*** We had an "earthquake" once when I lived in Birmingham in the UK, I woke up in the middle of the night thinking 'stop jiggling my bed' and went straight back to sleep. Pretty traumatic tbh.

**** I didn't wake up when there was an earth quake where I lived, but the dog had freaked out and dug a hole in the sofa.

**** Oooh, there was an earthquake a couple years ago that a few people in my area felt! I slept on obliviously. A friend of mine thought his cat had knocked something over. That was about the scale of it. People were all over social media with memes about lawn chairs being knocked over (probably pushed over for a photo tbh) and the like, but the hype faded in a day or two. It was boring.

Earthquakes just 100% are not part of the public consciousness here.

#+begin_quote
  The largest known British earthquake occurred in the North Sea, near the Dogger Bank in 1931, with a magnitude of 6.1. It was 60 miles offshore but still powerful enough to cause minor damage to buildings on the east coast of England.

Earthquakes are simply no big concern in that part of the world.
