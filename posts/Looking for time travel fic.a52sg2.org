I'm looking for time travel fan fiction with harry or hermione as main character. I prefer slash but am ok with any pairing. Thanks


** A Long Journey Home meets these criteria you list:

1. time travel
2. harry or hermione as main character

There is some implied slash mentioned in passing. It's a great story but it's incomplete, hasn't updated since March 2017, and may well be abandoned at this point.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

Here's a recent one I liked. Hermione-focused but it's not slash.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** I just started reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12296472/1/][Against My Nature]] by Araceil, and I'm really enjoying it! Bit of an OP Harry, bit of an ooc Newt, but otherwise really fun to read. It's time travel, main character Harry, and slash.
