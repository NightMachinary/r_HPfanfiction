It would be AU. Although if i have nothing against Canon compliant fics ignoring her death and she gets teamed up with him after she gets free.

So in this AU both of them are Partners, but unlike her Canon counterpart, the AU one is a good. Maybe there is some tension between them (thats mostly built up by her, since she is in a way attracted to him or atleast finds him attractive and teases him) or they are even in some sort of Relationship, nothing solid...more like they just have fun. It doesnt matter if there is a Canonlike age gap or if both are rough equal.

But what im also interested in, if the above mentioned wont fit, is that a Good Bellatrix is fighting the Canon evil one.


** The most popular one is Delenda Est

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
