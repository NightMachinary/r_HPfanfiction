Just pls /don't/ have them be one shots or only a few chapters

I ask for atleast good grammar, I bet my friend would be a Ravenclaw and would spot every single mistake there, that is all i ask of you

Thank you.


** It depends on what your friend likes. Are there particular shippings or specific characters that they like? What interests your friend: alternate universes, post-Deathly Hallows, "prequels" around the original Marauders, stories involving Harry's canon children, etc

*** He just asked for different house-Harry or fics that detail into the houses, I would almost bet he'd like some self-made history of Ravenclaw or Slytherin

Oh and he expressed a small interest in Harry and Hermione ships, just because he thought they were supposed to be together.

He hated the cursed child, and said ”honestly i dont care what the MC's kids do”

That also probably goes for post DH unless it's a total AU where Harry married Hermione, but that would need too much explaining, so nope.

Might like marauder stuff but probably just Ravenclaw/Slytherin Harry pulling great pranks or something

TLDR; Would like: History of Ravenclaw and Slytherin and Ravenclaw/Slytherin Harry pranking, also Harmony ships. Wouldn't like:anything with Harry's kids or anything after DH unless extreme AU

That's it, thanks!

**** linkao3(of a linear circle) has the best worldbuilding I know, but not sure if it's for everyone.

I think linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) would be a fun place to start.

Also, I know you said no one-shots, but there's a couple clever ones that would be a great gateway. Demonologist, Harry the avatar, etc.

** Before book 6 came out (and afterwards as well) I considered "Blood Magic" by GatewayGirl (ao3) as a great introductory fic for first readers of fanfic.

It is really good yet it has some aspects/ideas that would never fly in a published HP book such as Snape being Harry's biological father. There is romantic same-sex relationship in the background but it it is not the main part of the story. It is an easy intro to the concept of slash while staying mostly gen.

For me Blood Magic is the perfect mix of canon, speculation on how the books might continue (it was written between OOTP and HBP) and some classic fanfic tropes.

There is lots of exploration on what it means to be Gryffindor or Slytherin. GatewayGirl's description of Soul Magic and the difference between light and dark magic has pretty much become the standard fanon explanation on the topic, so this is interesting as well. Other themes are racism, love and traditional customs and fitting in. In the story Snape is a pure-blood and he struggles to overcome racist bias and ideas while Harry decides to rethink some of his attitudes that come from his Muggle background.

Basically I love this story to death and think everybody should read it. :D

EDIT: There are some great Harmony moments in Blood Magic as well, but they break up again over the course of this fic, partially over Snape objecting to his son dating a muggle-born.[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719610]]

**** It is best if you don't tell him - warn him that he might not like some aspects of it but just let him start reading. It is a great story and will most likely reel him in so that he will continue.

The most common point when people give up on Blood Magic is when they come to the "Harry is Snape's child" part which happens fairly early (by the 2nd chapter).

****** A Snape/OFC story that I really like is the "Darkness and Light" series by R.J. Andersen.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4446/R-J-Anderson]]

I normally hate original characters that are the star of the story bc very few are done well. Too many go into "Mary Sue" territory. But Maud Moody is well-rounded and she and Snape are real adults dealing with real adult problems.

****** Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood by cambangst (ao3)

This story absolutely blew my mind. Like your friend I couldn't care less about what the MC kids do and I hated Cursed Child, but this story got me into fics involving the younger generation. It is a who-dune-it combined with fighting a dark lord. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Draco are old enough to have teenage grandkids and find themselves not just fighting for their own lives but for the lives and happiness of their children and grandchildren.

It is a bit jumbling at first bc the story jumps around in the time line, but stick to it and it will grow on you.

** For Harry/Hermione stories, I'd suggest two by Potato19, though the first one is just 3 chapters long:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12149290][Imagination]]
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12296750][Baby, It's Cold Outside]]

For a darker Slytherin Harry with Hermione, I'd go with /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283][The many Deaths of Harry Potter]]/, though it's a very long story.

For a somewhat atypical though brilliantly written story, I'll also suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871][Blindness]] by AngelaStarCat.

** Magical Relations by evansentranced is really good and definitely not short. It's also not complete and likely never will be, but it gets the characters better than the vast majority of fanfics. Harry is a Slytherin in this one too, which I'm reading your friend is interested in. linkffn(3446796)
