I was reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11790377/56/Champion][Champion]] and wanted something similar with a Severus/Hermione ship where Hermione meets him earlier on (3rd year or sooner) and before Lily and the Marauders have that confrontation with him. I know there's a bunch where she shows up in their 5th year or later but I don't really want that (he's usually too distrusting and harsh by then).

Any recs?

Thank you to the author for writing such a lovely fic for our fav ship!
