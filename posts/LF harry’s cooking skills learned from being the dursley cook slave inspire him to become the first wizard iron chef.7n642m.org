  A basic rule of time, it will fight change. Harry, Hermione and Luna return to stop Voldemort thanks to the last of the fae. But they are not alone and time will not bend to their will easily. They will fight, they will prank and they will be followed through time. Dumbledore, Ron and Molly bashing. Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith"

  AU Start to Sixth Year. What do you do to stop a genocidal dark wizard? Try appeasement. If it sinks your entire economy, well... That just makes things more interesting.

  *The reports of the Doom level of this cookbook are greatly exaggerated! Harry Potter wrote a book. It's not what anyone expected. He has revolutionized cooking by combining potioneering and cooking by utilizing the skills of a potioneer in a kitchen.

  Magic is about intent; so when Harry unconsciously starts pouring magic in to his cooking, he creates something magical no one can resist. At 16, despite being the owner of a 5 star restaurant, his life is normal...until Tony Stark appears with his band of misfits and refuses to leave. Gods, magic, prophecies, bonds, Harry's life will never be the same ever again. SLASH.

** I get that this is something of a joke or you want to see it taken to the extreme, but I'm really surprised that Harry isn't better at Herbology or Potions given his chores. I guess Snape makes Potions class worse, but I'd think that Harry would be a bit better.
