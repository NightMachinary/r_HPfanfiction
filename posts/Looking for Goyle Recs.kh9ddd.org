Are there any fics where Goyle is the main character? He can be paired with Ginny, Luna, maybe Hermione. I read a marriage law fic (I feel like marriage law trope is not too popular here but I enjoy them) that was actually a Snape/Hermione pairing (again what can I say I like this ship) but it had Ginny/Greg as a background pairing and I really enjoyed their parts of the fic.

So ya... just looking to see what else is out there! Thanks.
