I'm having trouble finding good, dark Dramione without bad writing. Most seem to have the heavily recycled plot of obsessive!stalker!Draco. A dark!Hermione would be neat, or both, or Draco. I don't care about length.

+Also long time ago I read a one-shot about Draco raping and killing a bunch of children, by force of the other Death Eaters, and having a mental breakdown as he's about to kill Hermione, who forgives him and stuff. If anyone's seen that...+

I found the fic I'm looking for. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2647761/1/Unfeel][Unfeel]] by Lucifer's Garden.


** Over at Dramione fic lists on Tumblr, they have links for different Draco characterizations. You could browse through that to see if anything sounds interesting to you.

** I definitely sort of remember the second one? But I could not tell you how to find that. I'm thinking it was on H&V, darker stuff over there. Maybe search using their yew list filters?

*** Thanks! I read it on FF.net for sure, but it might be posted there too.

** I recommend [[http://www.dramione.org][Hawthorn and Vine]], a moderated Dramione site. You can browse by character type as well as story category.

** And here I thought that Dramione /was/ creepy, dark, and disgusting. But to each their own. :-)
