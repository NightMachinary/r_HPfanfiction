Looking for stories that focus on either Neville, Dean, Seamus, Parvati, Lavender, Padma, or any other relatively minor character in the Golden Trio Era.

Would love to see it be either in what would have been their seventh year or after Hogwarts.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash
