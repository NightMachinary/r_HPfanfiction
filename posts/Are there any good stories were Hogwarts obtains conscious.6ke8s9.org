Most stories it's a sort of side note that is touched on but then never used for anything interesting. But I would love to read a storie were hogwarts gains conscious and then goes on a quest to become the best school and safest place in the world. With her directing her army of house-elfs to do her bidding.

What upgrade do you think hogwarts would make in her quest to become the best school in the world?


** Not exactly what you're looking for but Hogwarts is conscious in this fic: linkffn(12132374)

It is brilliantly written

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*

** This excellent fic qualifies. It is unfinished and doesn't update often, though.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging]])

It's not a minor plot point, but it's not to the level you're asking for either.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** Not much home improvement, but it revolves around Hogwarts having a body.
