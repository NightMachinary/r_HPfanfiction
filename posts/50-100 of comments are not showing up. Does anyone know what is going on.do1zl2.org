My post from earlier today got 4 comments, two of which I can see publicly, and two of which I can only see by going to either my inbox or the users profile. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dnxpe9/harry_and_hermione_goes_to_mahoutokoro/][This post]] has two comments, which both are the answer, but only show up to me in an [[https://snew.notabug.io/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dnxpe9/harry_and_hermione_goes_to_mahoutokoro/][alternate reddit viewer.]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/do0pos/the_bestwritten_bffs_to_lovers_fics/][This one]] has ten comments, but only three show up no matter which reddit viewer I use. I checked other subreddits I go to, and they have similar things happening... So, don't trust the comments to be showing you all the... comments.

*** Nope... though of the two comments I have gotten so far on this post, your's is the one that isn't publicly shown...

Edit: And your comment just fixed itself.
