The majority of the female Harry fanfics I've read have either been complete shit or mediocore stories filled with smut. What are some really really good Fem!Harry fics out there?

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game.

** This is right up my alley, I have the same problems weeding through all the crap but I've managed to find some really good ones. A Long Journey home, Lily and the art of being Sisyphus, and Moratorium have already been mentioned so I'll leave those out.

I recommend checking out Tsume Yuki, she is one of my favourite authors and writes a lot of fem!Harry fics including various crossovers. She uses A03 as well and tends to post some there first. Elle Roche has a few Fem!Harry one-shots, in fact she has a lot of genderbent works, Of Power and Prestige being the longest.

This blog has all her work: [[https://saelethil.wordpress.com]]

Works from FFN:

One Soldier, Two is an enjoyable read, it's a crossover with Captain America. linkffn(11537017)

Aurora is a Twilight crossover, it's not complete and hasn't been updated but another good read. linkffn(11092104)

Nia River has two one-shots that are worth a read, linkffn(11448474; 10412157) I love these two, especially Finding Mr.Right.

A Life Once Lived is one of the best. linkffn(10855282)

Arya Lily Potter is alright, a little long for where the narrative is at but decent enough. linkffn(11009412)

Looking Beyond doesn't get enough love and I absolutely adore Serpent Tongue. They're both well written and the former is complete. linkffn(9883718; 11488630)

Riddled is another good one, decent enough and written well. linkffn(10697365)

A03

Wands and Arrows is a crossover with the Avengers. linkao3(5105105)

My Best to Be Everything You Need is another Twilight Crossover. linkao3(3838513)

Again, I would check out Tsume Yuki she's a gold mine of Fem!Harry although not many are complete.

Edit: Slexenskee also has quite a few Fem!Harry fics both on FFN and Ao3

***** The problem is that they're very minor/immediately removed.

Example: When Dobby closes the portal to Platform 9 3/4, Hope uses her teleporting ability to take both her and Ron to the school immediately. This should be able to drastically affect at least two events in the story, but they don't. Ron's wand is randomly broken during a class so it can backfire on Lockhart, and Hope can't use her teleporting ability again since, not only does Dumbledore immediately update Hogwarts' wards, the ability severely poisons her blood, she never really uses it again.

I think the only change that really affects things are the Blood Runes and Hope's willingness to kill.

Agree with you about Serpent Tongue 100%, though.

Edit: Finished an uncompleted thought.

****** I agree completely with what your saying. To me, however, the little changes that dont really change anything, add to the character. I find that a lot of times the characters are never fully developed as a different person from canon, they're mirror images or just a new hobby or something for plot convenience. Then when canon is rehashed its all boring and im basically reading the series over again. In this one, i find those small 'twists' to mean a lot charactwr wise even if they're not that influential on the over arching plot

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

Snape is also bewildered and disgusted by her crush, his only seeming motive is that she's as safe as possible.

All in all it's a competent deconstruction of a potential student/teacher romance - at least in the first fic, where nothing romantic actually happens - though, I don't know about the sequel.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

** I'd be remiss if I didn't mention basically everything ever written by Philosophize. The purely HP series starting with linkffn(Yule Ball Panic by Philosophize), followed by linkffn(The Power of Love), and finallylinkffn(Heart and Soul by Philosophize).

The Avengers crossover, linkffn(The Death of Natasha Romanoff by Philosophize), followed by linkffn(Iris Potter, Agent of SHIELD by Philosophize), and most recently linkffn(Iris Potter and the Exile from Asgard by Philosophize).

The old school Batman crossover linkffn(Amy Potter is Batgirl! by Philosophize) is also a laugh.

Finally linkffn(Harry Potter Story Fluffle) has several story ideas that I am really hoping get developed on. I am especially a fan of the Stargate SG1 one (chapter 4), and the Firefly one that was just posted (chapter 9). The Buffy and Bourne ones seem fun too.

  Fluffle: A group of bunnies; or, in this case, a collection of 1st chapters of stories which may or may not get written. Most are crossovers. Some are FemHarry. All are interesting, but many have problems preventing me from creating strong plots. None are up for adoption, but if you have ideas for getting past the problems so a full story can be written, I'd love to hear from you.
