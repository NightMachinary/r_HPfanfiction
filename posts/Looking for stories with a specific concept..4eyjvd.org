As I'm reading "The sum of their parts", a story where the trio basically want to change the wizarding world in Britain.

I can't help but wonder about stories about the opposite.

Stories where Harry simply...moved.

I'm looking for completed stories with either:

An after the war story where Britain is still a mess and Harry and co simply leave Britain.

Or Harry leaves Britain during Voldies war, not caring less, considering it not his fight.

I'm a logical sort of guy. If my country ever came under fire I would be on the first plane. I'm looking for a Harry with that attitude.
