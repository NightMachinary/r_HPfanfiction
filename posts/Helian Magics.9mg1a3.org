*** Aww crap. Abandoned? Really? Such a shame.

Edit: Seems the last chapter update was on October 3rd. So maybe not abandoned?

**** Abandoned. At first he removed it from FFN and then following readers' demand he put it back but I don't think he plans to update it anymore. In fact there was another reddit recently concerning it. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9kyap3/the_life_he_leads_is_back/][Here]] (with author answer about the fic "return".

If you go on the reddit link I gave there is the actual explanation from the author as to why he abandoned it and what would have been the overall planning for the fic's end.

***** Maybe it's just my reddit spazzing out, but to me the highest comment is shown as deleted? People are talking to the author in their answers, so I'm assuming it was his. Any chance you remember the tentative plot he shared?

****** It was going to end as Harry/Tonks. H/F was just a teenage relationship to add character growth and plot twists.

Harry dies at the end of the third trial in Riddle Manor after finding the Resurrection stone on the ring to be master of death.

Story follows Tonks and the order through dealing with Harry's death and Voldemort's rise. Highlights how Harry's death changes things through the relationships he had made.

Fluer meets Bill, Remus and Tonks never get together.

Voldemort rises faster as he has no fear of the BWL. He storms the ministry quickly. When he does, Harry comes out of the veil, aged physically from the time spent in the other realm.

Harry learned a lot, he's angry, vengeance on Voldemort. Tonks is the only one to really get through to the changed Harry.

Dumbledore and Harry defeat Voldemort in an epic battle. Dumbledore dies, and Harry becomes a recluse until Tonks finds him.

It ends with Tonks and Harry together, and with main characters having major roles in the wizarding world.
