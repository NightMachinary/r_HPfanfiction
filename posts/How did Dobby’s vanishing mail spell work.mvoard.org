Clearly the mail was somehow being intercepted after it was sent, but do you think if Harry could have sent Hedwig, and Hedwig brought the reply back that Dobby would have wound up with it anyway?


** He would wait for Erol to fall asleep and steal his mail.

** Well, there was a real fear of people intercepting owls and reading sensitive mail later in the series. And elves have pretty powerful magic on their own. I think it would have been pretty easy for Dobby to use some kind of spell to immobilize an owl long enough to take its letters away.

*** Perhaps, that's a good point but it seems like a semi-difficult task to actually find the bird in order to intercept it. I was thinking maybe he uses some sort of House Elf magic that either redirects every letter with Harry's name to him (so the owls show up at Malfoy manor) or maybe just some sort of teleportation spell and every letter addressed to Harry just disappears from the owl and shows up in Dobby's possession.

** Hmm ... while I normally like powerful magic, a "redirect all mail to Harry Potter to Dobby"-spell feels /too/ powerful. Or perhaps, too simple? It shouldn't be that /easy/, anyway. IMO.

I wonder if Dobby mightn't simply have done the old-fashioned thing: We know House Elves can stay hidden (or, at least unnoticed), so I'm thinking he spent his days hanging out at Privet Drive, and summoning all incoming owls and stealing their letters.

And the Malfoys were wondering why, during the summer of '92, all their salons wanted dusting and their shoes polishing and dinner was late °_^

But perhaps Dobby /did/ invoke a letter-collection charm over Privet Drive. Perhaps that's a skill House Elves have, since they need the owls to leave the letters in one place, so they can present the post to their master at breakfast. Either way, though, unless you make Hedwig a super-owl, she's just a regular post owl, so whatever Dobby did should work on her as well as on any other post owl.

*** Makes sense. Poor owls being summoned though.
