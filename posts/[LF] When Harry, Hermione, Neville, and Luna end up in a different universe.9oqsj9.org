They are utterly ravaged by the trials of their own fight and lost Ron (tortured by Bellatrix) and Ginny (Luna tells a poetic story of escaping the wedding at the burrow) and it is all very sad. They decide to help this universe fight against Voldemort... Sound familiar to anyone? I can't remember what it is called. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
