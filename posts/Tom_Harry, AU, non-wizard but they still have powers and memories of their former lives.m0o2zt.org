:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
• something happens in OG verse and everyone is transported into a sort of sci-fi verse

• people just have ONE power

• harry can use avada kedavra, tom has empathy

• they still have memories of their previous life

• it was on AO3, I read it around 2017-18, I think

Help appreciated!


** Found it! Except Harry can't do the Avada Kedavra- instead, it's the Imperius, but everything else seems pretty on point so I'm pretty sure this is it.

  Harry's got the Imperius Curse tripping off his tongue and Tom's suddenly acutely aware of other people's emotions.

** I think I've read that! Is that the one where they get put in some kind of prison/institution and they have to escape?

*** Yes! And they have these tracker things that don't let them use their powers. Ugh, I wish I could find it, I should have bookmarked it when I first read it :/
