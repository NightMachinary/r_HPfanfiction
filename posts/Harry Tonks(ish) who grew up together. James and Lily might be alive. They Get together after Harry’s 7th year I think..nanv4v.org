Harry's parents are alive and he grows up with Tonks (who is older, similar in age to cannon). They keep in touch via mirrors when Harry is at Hogwarts and get together when Tonks apparates into his room after his 6th or 7th year after she breaks up with Remus(?). I think James and Lily were both alive.


** I love harry/tonks, if this is complete I would definitely love to read it, hopefully someone knows the fic

** I think you're describing the epilogue chapters of linkffn(The Peverell Legacy by ReluctantSidekick). James and Lily are both still dead and young Harry is instead raised by a time traveling older Harry and Padma, but everything else matches.

  Harry accidentally missed his wedding and his fiancee came looking for him. Turns out he was in the nineteen-eighties. Big shout out to ClareR89 for being my sounding board
