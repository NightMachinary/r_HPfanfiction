Hey guys, I just published the first chapter of my new fanfiction, Defying Death Again, And Again, And- ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13658028/1/4]]). It's a story in which Harry Potter keeps reliving life, starting the day after Hagrid tells him he's a wizard in each new iteration. I want to co-author this but don't know anyone interested (out of the two people I asked lol) but I think there's a lot of opportunity for development. My plan is to have Harry live life for a second I'm each house at Hogwarts and travel the wizarding world along the way. I want to avoid Gary Sue or OP HP, and I want to create more interesting problems for him to face in each house. So if you're interested in magical theory and culture and you like reading, maybe you'll be interested in writing this universe with me.

Thanks


** I don't want to Co author this I just want to read it

***** I get it, I started reading fanfiction in 07 and I'm still mining the internet for more. I've always been a reader but... There's something about how inexpensive fanfiction is that totally hooked me young. Now, there's just no going back

*** Thank you, I wanted to do something a bit different and haven't seen a particular twist like this yet, so I figured I'd write a story I'd want to read.

**** Yeah, it's a new idea to me as well. Sometimes most fanfiction have nearly identical concepts that make it feel as though you've read them all, it's good to read something new and different.

** A one shot similar to this is The Many Deaths of Harry Potter, great writing, quite quickpaced though.
