Posted this before, somewhere, a long time ago, and I think I read through everything there I found interesting. Still, post your recs, where Harry isn't an exhibitionist wanting to expose himself to the world.

Darker/AU/more "realistic", the better!


** The only fic I remember where he doesn't broadcast his time jumping is "Time to put your galleons where your mouth is".

Sorry, I have a slightly undeserved dislike of OGNA! because it has the worst canon rehash of any time travel story I've read. Jumping through loops to make sure it's essentially the same as canon, while also desperately plugging it's own plot holes that it creates by trying to be different.

Also, all the characters are completely unlikeable - apart from the oddly compelling Gilderoy Lockhart.

** This fanfiction is told from Harry's perspective about his mysterious Muggle Studies teacher, Professor H. J. Prewett. WIP. Technically time travel hasn't been discussed yet in-fic but I think it's pretty obvious Prewett is a time-traveling Harry.

  AU. The best place to start is at the beginning, and Harry supposes it all began with the mysterious Professor H. J. Prewett. Years 1 through 7.
