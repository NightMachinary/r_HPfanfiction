A basilisk fang could destroy horcruxes. Two points to make off of this. Shouldn't Harry's horcrux been destroyed in the second year? And doesn't venom stay in you after an antivenom? I know Harry was healed by the Phoenix but what if the venom was still in him? Doesn't that make him able to destroy horcruxes himself? I hope someone can answer. Sorry if I'm off topic a bit. I have always been curious of this.


** To destroy a horcrux, the container must be destroyed. The mechanics of that don't matter so much as long as it is irrevocably destroyed (be it basilisk venom, fiendfyre, or something else). Harry wasn't. He was healed by phoenix tears, so he lived, thus the horcrux lived.

** The Horcrux resided in or near the curse scar on his forehead. The venom likely did not have a chance to reach that area before it was neutralized. I can't say I know anything about antivenom, but I'm assuming it neutralizes the venom's harmful effects, even if it doesn't remove the venom itself. Removing the venom's harmful effects would likely mean that it lost its magic-destroying properties by the time the venom reached the scar area.

** I'm always wondering how Harry could have been turned into a Horcrux despite his mother's protection strong enough to defeat the Killing Curse.

*** That's a great point. I wonder if it's because the transfer of his powers wasn't life threatening.

** Harry was never a properly made horcrux with all the necessary rituals and protections, but only had a soul splinter latched on to a curse wound.

Therefore, in my head canon, I always think it was significantly easier to remove that soul splinter than to destroy a true horcrux.

** My understanding is that it isn't the venom itself that would give Harry the ability to destroy horcruxes. The reason that worked was because the sword of Griffindor was goblin made and therefore took in what made it stronger. It's the object absorbing the venom and not a characteristic of the venom itself. Ergo it was the sword taking in the venom that gave it the ability and not the venom entering the object, if that makes sense.

*** I think in the last movie, not sure about the book (been a while since I've read them), they went back into the chamber of secrets to get fangs to continue destroying the horcruxes. Also that's how riddles diary was destroyed.

**** You're correct, in the books both the Cup and the Diary were destroyed using a basilisk fang.

**** Right, the venom itself can destroy a horcruxes, but it seemed as though the question was asking why Harry couldn't destroy a horcruxes when he had been poisoned by the venom earlier. I assumed the question came up was because if the conversation that the Sword could destroy a horcruxes because it had infused itself with the venom
