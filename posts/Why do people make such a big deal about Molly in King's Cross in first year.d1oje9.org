*** I mean, there are three things you can dislike Molly for.

1. Her believing Rita's article about Hermione despite previously saying that she is a menace and not a proper reporter

2. Her victim blaming Sirius for being unlawfully incarcerated

3. Her telling Harry that she was worried about the Dursley treatment in CoS to the point where she considered getting him from there but then never doing anything about the Dursleys (legal action, threatening them, regular visits). Giving false hope to an abused child is unforgivable IMO.

But the Kings Cross thing was just coincidental timing. I mean, how would they have known when Harry was coming through? The station is huge and crowded.

#+begin_quote
  Molly was working on a better generic love potion antidote for a Potions NEWTs project. She needed to test her antidote and her then longtime boyfriend Arthur Weasley volunteered as test subject. They carried out the test in an out-of-the-way classroom in private because Molly had to first dose with a love potion (tied to herself obviously).

  The reason why the girls were giggling and Arthur was trying so hard to pretend he couldn't hear them all was because Molly let him make a fool of himself before giving him the antidote.

****** She talked with Hermione and Ginny about making a love potion while she was at Hogwarts. Talking about “date-rape potion” is hyperbole in my opinion, because we don't really know what it was. I believe George & Fred were not selling Amorentia (“the strongest love potion there is”, “strongest” implies there are some less strong), but something less drastic. More “notice me in the crowd” potion rather than Amorentia's “I am spreading my legs right now, do it!”.

(I feel like in the general fandom, the conclusion is that Hermione was wrong for her activism and shouldn't have done it, instead of more wondering at why /everyone else/ seems fine with their enslavement.)

It is a neat thing for fanfic writers though - only a few small, even logical twists would make the Wizarding World go from a place of wonder to a dark, terrible world.

(eg: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/search?q=elves&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all][Harry Potter search]] - the main conclusions of the ones talking about it seem to be that her intentions were good but misguided at best.)

Whereas I'm of the opinion that this is a huge problem with the books, because the logic of 'they like being enslaved' being the conclusion of that is ridiculous, and particularly so for a series (at the time) intended for children. Like we've got real life examples of people saying they were 'happy to be enslaved', but that doesn't mean it's a good thing or that we accept it.

************* I've been of the opinion that House Elves have metaphysically need to serve wizards, that they "evolved" (insofar as any magical creature evolves in HP) to help wizarding households (in the same way as certain parasites intrinsically are tied to specific species hosts, just not in a negative way as parasites, but in a supportive beneficial relationship.)

Wizarding culture (in Britain at least) has twisted that relationship to that of master and slave, where as it's natural state (as presented in the books) is that of lord of the manor and servant.

If it wasn't for the Malfoy's extreme abuse, I don't think Dobby would ever have desired to be released from his bondage to a wizarding household, and that demonstrates just how atrocious the Malfoys were, rather than a demonstration of House Elves being merely slaves by choice. The Malfoys broke the intrinsic metaphysical bond that House Elves have to wizarding households through their abominable treatment of him.

Step 5: Take the train to Edinburgh

Step 6: Harry meets Tonks there (she is best at disguising herself), they apparate to some safe house.

Her strengths were more in tons of time to prepare solutions. So Malfoy was definitely idiot ball, considering he was acting super suspicious. Supermarkets are actually the most logical solution, so I was a bit confused about that. Hotels seem unnecessary with their awesome wizarding tents.

The extraction plan was stupid, but so was quite a few other things done by authority and the trio. in the books. I don't see why it getting challenged would be any different.

Hermione takes the invisibility cloak and public transport to Harry, side-alongs him to France, the Low Countries or Germany, they take Muggle transportation for a day or two before apparating to Grimmauld.

2. & 3. Yes, so? They knew and they did nothing, although I don't really know how much Hestia Jones knew about Harry's home life from standing outside the house for a few hours. Meanwhile, Molly knew and admitted that it was bad enough for her to consider taking Harry away from there in CoS. Ron not doing much is understandable since he was a child himself, but Molly& Arthur? McG? Dumbledore? What is their excuse?

Because we know that there are other kinds of highly effective defences which do not rely on a mother's love. In canon, the Tonks house repels Voldemort's entire force, including himself, and it did not need for Nymphadora to live through ten years of abuse bad enough to count as torture in some regards.

*********** Even in the US it's not all that culturally acceptable to charge your kids rent, unless you as the parent are trying to very unsubtly send the message that you *do not want* your children living at home and sending a clear message that their stay is meant to be explicitly on the shorter end of "a transition phase."

There are tons of kids who are living at their parents homes (the term basement dweller exists for a reason), eating their feed, mom still doing the laundry, and the kid parties his/her paycheck away through their 20s.

Conversely, there are still plenty of kids who move back home, contribute to the household and the shared expenses, and live in a genuine multigenerational household (instead of living merely as a child in the house of their parents as the situation.)

The twins took NEWT Charms (their class was inspected by Umbridge, Ch. 15), NEWT Defense Against the Dark Arts (told off for playing games in class, OOTP Ch. 25), and took at least sixth-year NEWT Transfiguration (in /GoF/ McGonagall tells Fred to be quiet and transfigure his raccoon, Ch. 15). They're not dumb. They just didn't think the formal grades were important for the future they envisioned and they didn't care to get the NEWTs as a backup.

Maybe they should have. Maybe they would have done their 7th year differently if they didn't already have a sizable cushion to rely on in Harry's investment.

**** In the books we don't see international travel. In bookCannon it's possible there are heavy magical protections around nations or land masses that require annoying paperwork.

In the newest movies we do see international travel but they bothered to go as physically close to the edge of land as possible. This was unregistered international travel so we don't see the paperwork required for a legal crossing.

In surrounding interviews JKR describes overseas apparition is described as very dangerous when asked why Newt took a boat to America.

All this adds up to me nitpicking your point saying that Romania is 5 minutes away. Magical travel makes in quicker, but inter national/geographical travel could take enough time that Charlie only would have time for a proper visit on long weekends, if the right paperwork exists and if Charlie can get his hands on it.

Also- I don't find it strange that people from a huge family want to find out who they are outside that family context. With the obvious Weasley hair and small wizarding community, I can understand why two of them felt a desire for international work.

** What I found odd about that scene is the fact that the Weasleys were using the muggle-world entrance at all. Why are they using muggle means to travel from Devon to London when they can floo to London (and probably directly to the platform maybe)? It makes no sense.

Of course, the Doylist explanation is that floo travel was invented in the 2nd book and by that time using the entrance had become the norm. The Watsonian explanation... well something smells suspicious so that's what fanfic authors use when they want evil!Weasleys.

Honestly, I can't see the muggle-world entrance being the only way you could get onto the platform. Nearly 300 families converging on a King's Cross platform, many of them carrying owls and toads will be drawing lots of the wrong sort of attention. The adults should be able to arrive/leave with their kids using the floo and use apparition when they're alone.

After Dumbledore side-alongs Harry he gets asked how it feels by the other Gryffindors.

This indicates that it is not possible to side-along a child / younger person, otherwise most wizarding parents would side-along their kids and they would have experienced it, eliminating the need to ask.

In the epilogue in DH Ron also admits to confunding his driving instructor. To me this indicates that the Ron and Hermione need a car to transport their children - otherwise, why own a car when you can apparate?

There was one story where Narcissa Malfoy tries to apparate away with her husband and son after the battle of Hogwarts but the apparition fails bc she is pregnant with Draco's little sister. I think this one was by Lomonaaeren?

Being pregnant means carrying a child with an undeveleoped magical core, so it totally makes sense that apparating while pregnant would be dangerous for mother and child past a certain point in pregnancy.

I've seen the latter mentioned in Birth of a Dancing Star by asecretchord on Ao3, it is an mpreg story and Harry (who is pregnant) cannot apparate, they need to travel by floo.

Moody mentions Harry is too young to apparate when they're extracting him from the Dursleys in the fifth book and they use /brooms/ instead of side-along. And Bill, Charlie, Percy and Arthur could've side-alonged the twins, Ron, Harry, Hermione and Ginny when traveling to the Quidditch world cup, not to mention Amos could've taken Cedric rather than getting up that godawful early in the morning to catch a portkey.

So if you can make it seem exceptional---Molly doing on purpose for Harry, or some other plot---then you don't need to suspend disbelief as much.

Of course that can also be fixed with enchantments to make Muggle oblivious or whatever.

*** I've always wondered how solid the Statute is -- I always figured there was several muggles with exceptional knowledge just to be able to keep it up for the general public -- such as conductors/guards/whatnot at King's Cross who makes sure most people stay away from that platform during the arrival/departure times.

** I think it's because people usually use it as an example of Dumbledore's "manipulation." I love a good grey/smart!Harry fic as much as the next dude, but almost all of them consist of an Evil!Dumbledore who wants to force a friendship between Harry & Ron, and in doing so has Molly loudly proclaim about Muggles so that Harry can overhear, etc etc. So, I think most people use that then as a gateway to make out how stupid Molly is, making a fool of herself to bend to Albus' whims. At least, that's what I've always interpreted it as (because usually, Weasley and Dumbledore bashing go hand in hand!)

** I think most fanfiction latches onto the behavior of the weasley family because it's a bit abnormal when in comparison to the other wizarding families, which tends to lead them to writing Molly and Ron as being either stupid, manipulative or being controlled/paid by Dumbledore to influence Harry's life in the way Dumbledore wants.

I've seen it used many times then reiterated later on with comments like "Only hang around Harry because Dumbledore is paying me" or "Come on, you know once Harry dies, we get everything. Dumbledore promised us the Potter fortune"

** It's just a fishy coincidence engineered by the author. Whether it's dangerous to talk nonsense on a crowded platform or not, she really should have known where the platform is, and treating her 10-year-old as a 3-year-old, while certainly a possible explanation, is also arguably worse.

You could even say Molly had already noticed a confused kid walking around with an owl, and so decided to spare him some trouble and act the fool in order to help him discreetly, which is closer to what I expect of her, but it's still a contrived scene.

** Some thoughts, feel free to take or leave as you please:

1. Lots of people have an axe to grind with the Weasleys. The reasons for doing so run the gamut, but as someone who has known the feeling of being an outsider, much of it comes across as narrow-minded (no offense intended, merely the appearance I see).
2. The scene in King's Cross, like much of the first 3 books, was not really thought of in light of the larger world. In the early books, events always serve a specific purpose that when put in context of the wider HP world tend to look fairly ridiculous.
3. Many people use the Weasleys as a scapegoat for Manipulative!Dumbledore, and set this scene up as Dumbledore trying to control Harry. This gives Dumbledore way more agency than he could possibly possess without prodigious use of the Imperius Curse, Polyjuice, and divination (of which he was not a fan). Dumbledore is smart, but all his plans hinge not on specific knowledge of coming events. His plans are more in line with what you would call the 'Batman Gambit'. He knows personalities and emotions and people, and he guesses the most likely response of individuals to different outcomes and plans accordingly. But the thing is, these aren't manipulations so much as guesses based on the most likely outcomes. He never forces people down the path, just gives them the choice.

That is one heck of a dangerous assumption to make. Maybe /you/ don't, but be careful with such generalizations.

Speaking from my personal experience, I actually find it quite difficult to concentrate on a conversation with the people I'm with in a crowded place because my mind picks up other people's conservations so easily. If somebody close to me was talking about muggles and transfigurations, I would absolutely pick up on it (assuming of course that there's no actual magic involved to distract me from it).
