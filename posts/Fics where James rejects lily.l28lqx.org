Now, this is an interesting idea....what if James got fed up with Lily and her continual rejection of his affections, I mean it would be AU but,it's interesting as hell. I mean, you see Lily rejecting James in many fanfics in favour of Snape(the obsessed creep) or some other character. So, I have read only two of them by the author ellory,but I wasn't able to find any other.so........


** It's a pretty common theme with James/Lily fics.

Lily can get paired with Sirius, Remus, Snape, Slughorn (smut), Time traveling Harry but James is almost always paired with Lily.

In fics that they do get together, Lily can have a nice, understanding, fulfilling relationship before dating James but all the girls James date are sluts, bimbos and really James doesn't like any of these girls he's only dating them to get Lily jealous.

This one is a quite popular Jily fic! I absolutely adore it, it's has a perfect balance of drama and humour about basically what you described.

James asks Lily out a million times and just when she realizes she might like him, he gives up and stops asking. James is pretty upset and vows to let her go so he's determinedly not picking up on any clues she drops so Lily has to get over her pride and figure out a way to ask him! Highly recommend it.

  As was previously 'Queen of the Crunk'. He asked her to Hogsmeade one hundred and thirty seven times. Then he stopped. And now Lily Evans has to battle her own fat mouth and mad head and the probability that number one hundred and thirty eight's going to have to be on her if she wants James Potter to ever smile her way again. Oh dear.

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.

**** It's so clear how hard it's trying to paint James as this idolised version of the canon character, but even for all that he still comes across as a Malfoy-esque quietly bigoted toff. Laughable.
