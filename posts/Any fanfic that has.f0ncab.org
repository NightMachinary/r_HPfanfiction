1. Competent Harry: Not necessarily OP, but easily more competent than canon. Doesn't need to be smarter than Hermione, but I'll take it.
2. Either a competent Ron: Not more than Harry, but definitely can hold his own. Or Ordinary Ron who's self aware: Just a Ron who has realized that he's an average ordinary Wizard. Not awesome, not terrible, just ordinary. But I think this is too deep for most fanfiction. NO BASHING!
3. Very smart but not as ridiculous as canon Hermione: Simply a Hermione taken down a peg without bashing her.
4. Acknowledgement of Snape's assholiness: A fic that doesn't portray Snape as some secretly great guy who's asshole behaviour is some great cover up(which doesn't even make sense by the way. Should't he be nice to Harry and tell Voldemort that he's doing that to gain the boy's trust. That's how you play a double agent.) or something. Canon Snape was a real asshole. He did all the right things for all the wrong reasons. He was ok with James and /infant/ Harry dying as long as Lily survived. He hated Harry /just/ because he looked like his father. He was a horrendously biased teacher. And the only excuse he has is that he had a bad childhood and was bullied by James(which is debatable by the way. Snape had Lucius Malfoy and other Slytherines. He probably could give James and co. as good as he got. Not to mention that James radically changed himself and became a better man while Snape became a Death Eater. Even if we forget all these things, Snapes behaviour can't be excused. Harry had a terrible childhood where he was basically a House-Elf and he still turned out to be a kind and selfless person like no other.)
5. Different than canon pairings: I think main canon pairing are garbage. So anything different will do, though preferably no Harry/Hermione. And no crack pairings like Harry/Bellatrix.

Got anything people?


** I mean, this one-shot series technically covers most of your requirements aside from the fifth, since it doesn't really deal with pairings at all. The chapter I linked even adds to your fourth requirement in a quite interesting way.

**** I think Ron and Lavender could have worked out if Lavender chilled on the PDA and Ron actually cared (because I do agree that Ron did take advantage of her feelings towards the end). For all Lavender's faults, she showed obvious, consistent interest in Ron which is more than I can say for goddess Hermione. Ignoring the bickering aspect of the 'ship, Hermione never saw Ron's potential and constantly put him down - [[https://www.quora.com/Isnt-Hermione-somehow-harsh-to-Ron][see this link for more]]. If my crush complimented our mutual best friend, calling them 'fanciable' and 'scarred' and 'tall' when I'm all those things as well, I'd take that as a sign of disinterest.

If they had talked things out and made more of an effort, they could have gone somewhere. Even if they still broke up, it could have ended more amicably. It's really sad that their relationship was played for laughs and so that Ron could become 'deserving' of Hermione.

** I think linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has all of that.

1) Definitely competent Harry. He has an actual family, and learns about magic much earlier, including training to use wandless magic for years (plus of course his Animagus transformation, as per the title). Furthermore, his adoptive sister is Hermione, so naturally he's a more diligent student. /However/, the opposition is scaled up, too, especially in fourth year and the sequel.

2) Ron is around, not as close to Harry, but not bashed. His jealousy is short-lived and doesn't cause big problems; he's generally a loyal if arm's-length friend.

3) Hermione is very clever, but doesn't singlehandedly solve everything. She's just slightly ahead of Harry in most subjects.

4) Snape is loyal to the light, but frequently cruel and unfair to Harry, and loathes the Marauders.

5) Pairings might be spoilers, but are not as per canon. Definitely not Harry/Hermione; as mentioned, they're siblings.

*** Really? I read the first 30 chapters or so and my impressions were that is was very much Hermione and muggle praise. If anything it was even more buffed Hermione, what with the convenient family to solve everything and the learning wandless magic parts. I'm sure there's more but it's been a while since I've read.

**** If you only read the first 30 chapters, then yes, it probably seemed like everything is going better than canon and Harry is overpowered.

Keep reading, though, and Voldemort gets /allies/ on his level, who are devastating on their own and also significantly power him up. The sequel is still in progress, but as of the latest chapter, Hogwarts and the Ministry have been simultaneously captured, the Light forces have been driven out of Britain, and Voldemort has a good chance of being recognised by the ICW as the legitimate government of Britain, since he's now the one enforcing the Statute of Secrecy there. Plus, Dumbledore has picked up a nemesis, a Dark Lord with a personal grudge against him. Certainly all is not yet lost, but the conflict is getting pretty epic, and in the midst of all of that, being able to turn into a house cat is pretty minor. Hermione's study capabilities aren't a big factor either.

***** Well I suppose my first response is that I shouldn't be able to read 30/112 chapters for the story to pick up. Secondly, the powerup of Voldemort is fine and all but it still doesn't change the fact that it really doesn't fit the request. It's not really competent Ron; it's a Ron the author ignores. Hermione is OP, not to mention the sheer ridiculousness of her social interactions. I suppose 4 and 5 hold true. The story also contains enough tropes and typical wankfest material that I can't say it's of good quality either.

In short, I think the combination of the poor quality, poor fit to the prompt, and slow pacing means it shouldn't be recommended. Or at the very least, my recommendation is to read the other recommendations first.

****** The OP did ask for either a competent Ron, or a Ron who knows he's ordinary and doesn't angst about it. This fic has the second.

Hermione is very smart, as per canon, but having read the whole thing, I'd say that it's less important than in canon. She plays a big role as Harry's sister, but not so much as the fountain of knowledge.

Pacing is a matter of taste. If the OP wants fast paced, then absolutely, this isn't the right fic. That wasn't part of the request though.
