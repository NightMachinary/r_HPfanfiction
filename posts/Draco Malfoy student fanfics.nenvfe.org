Hey guys! When I was a kid, I read a lot of Draco Malfoy centric fics, and I kind of want to go back to fics like that for the sake of nostalgia.

In a lot of these, he's an amazing student, very pureblood and proper, poker-faced good looking, etc, and really gives off the Hogwarts/dark academia vibes.

Does anyone have any recommendations that fit this vibe? Thanks in advance!
