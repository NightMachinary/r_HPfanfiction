Hello all. I'm really in the mood to read some HP fanfics after some time away. Any good stories out there with clearly "adult prose"? I'm basically looking for stories written in a serious tone with good grammar and clear sense of direction. The genre doesn't matter and but no slash please.


** Tales From Durmstrang: Poisoned Bloodlines

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/story/story_edit_property.php?storyid=13217021]]

"In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy to kill it once and for all."

Since I am a Swedish person I thought it would be fun to write a story about a school that Swedish wizards and witches could attend and in canon that would be Durmstrang. This story follows the current canon very closely.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

*** I've heard a lot of good things about this story but is this an AU or Canon? Could you give a hint about what it's about without spoiling too many plot points?

**** Definitely! It's an AU story. The ending is definitely AU, though you could easily argue that the rest of the plot fits within canon. In order to write an effective mystery, the fanfic author has to make up some things that we don't already know.

The story centers on Regulus. Each chapter shows him a bit older (first chapter is pre-Hogwarts ... he's in Hogwarts by the third chapter ... he's out of Hogwarts by the last chapter). It's mainly about his relationships with the different people in his family. The story explores what it might be like, growing up with a family that embraces Dark magic and that hates Squibs, Muggles and Muggle-borns (and certain nieces who run away to marry Muggle-borns). While Sirius is openly defiant (as we know), Regulus's opinions about his family are more complicated. This story is about his struggle with those opinions, as he gets older and learns more about his family. It's a very "talky" fic, for sure (character-driven story where a lot of the scenes are about the conversations between characters). But there's also a mystery that both Regulus and Sirius are trying to solve on their own.

If you're still unsure, try reading linkffn(The things that lurk in the dark) first. It's only 5,000 words, and it'll give you a good sense of the author's writing style. There are Remus/Sirius undertones in "The Things That Lurk," but neither story is a slash story.

  MWPP era, sixth year. There's something terrifying in the dungeons, and don't they wish they hadn't disturbed it... After two days of Sirius taking his terrible mood out on everyone, Remus reckons someone should probably go talk to him about the things that lurk in the dark. Warnings inside.

******* I would consider that a story within the Canon universe so it wouldn't be an AU in my mind. As long as the main plot points follow the original story it's Canon.
