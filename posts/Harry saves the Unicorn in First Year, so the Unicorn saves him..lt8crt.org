Unicorn Blood was an amazing curative that bore a deadly curse, but what no-one save for the Unicorns themselves knew, was that Unicorn Blood, when freely given, was the ultimate Anti-Dark Panacea, and the perfect restorative. The deadliest and darkest curses could be removed if the Unicorn wanted to save you, as it is truly the greatest creature of Light.

The Unicorn, which Harry had named Uni, though he wasn't the best at naming things, found her best friend and saviour Harry hurt in the forest... Maybe it was those mean Spiders! He was dying, and Harry saved her when she was dying, so it was her turn! Her mother told her that her blood was the ultimate curative, but it only cursed bad people, and no way was Harry bad!

Nicking her paw on a nearby branch, Uni placed her bleeding paw to Harry's mouth, and he ended up drinking, before his scar started to bleed off black and dark magic... that bad Squirrel man must have cursed Harry too! And his arm bled off Poison?! It was definitely those mean Spiders! but after a few minutes of twitching, friend Harry stilled, and was okay, no scars, and he looked much healthier. She saved her best friend just like he saved her. Her best friend Harry was safe, so now Uni had to get nice Mr Firenze, so Harry could get out of the forest.

Unicorns are ungulates, which means they have hooves, not paws.

**** Not exactly. Horses are ungulates, but not all ungulates are horses. For a better description of them than I could give, I recommend the wikipedia entry on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungulate][ungulates]].
