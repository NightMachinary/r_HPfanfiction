:END:
There is this fanfic that I can't find! It's post Hogwarts where author Harry and Ron as well as Hermione and Ginny are met up with a Hermione from an alternate universe where Harry decided to stay dead. In that universe Hermione teaches at beauxbatons and Ron died. She then has them come with her to her universe so Harry can defeat Voldemort again. Does this sound familiar?


** Guys I found it! In case you are wondering it is called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]] by theelderwand1 on ff.net. Here is the link if you are interested! I love this whole series!
