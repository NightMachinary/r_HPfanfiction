Please don't judge me for this, but I was looking for magical girl and Harry Potter Crossovers. I would love a Sailor Moon/Harry Potter Crossover. If any of you have any recs, I'm all eyes and ears. It doesn't even need to have a pairing.


** linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter). Three-way cross with HP, Sailor Moon, and Ranma 1/2, along with very minor cameos from other anime. Has a completed sequel.

Also, there are several Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha crossover stories:

linkffn(Reinforced Magic by Lupine Horror). Has two sequels. I liked the first and second more than the third story.

linkffn(Nanoha Takamichi and the Horrors of Ineptitude by Silent-Scream84). TSAB sends Nanoha to investigate the wizarding world.

linkffn(Lord Over the Night Sky by Triser). I haven't gotten around to reading this one yet, but it's pretty long.

linkffn(Nanoha Takamichi and the School of Witchcraft by Ryvaken Lucius Tadrya). After TSAB Admiral Graham retires to England and has a run-in with wizards, Nanoha and Fate get recruited to attend Hogwarts.

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees. He reacts with an 8 timezone apparition to the Pools of Sorrow in China. Multicross of HP, SM and Ranma 1/2. Harry/Usagi SailorMoon

  How can a single Patronus, cast by a wizard so young he shouldn't be able to cast one at all, be powerful enough to drive off a hundred Dementors? A theory takes Harry on a journey halfway around the world. Post-3rd year, no pairings yet, Sailor Moon English DIC dub.

  She was supposed to die, she was supposed to be destroyed, she was supposed to be completely annihilated, but she wasn't. He wasn't the happiest, nor was he the luckiest, but now a guardian angel all of his own had found her way to him. Let's see what Hogwarts makes of these two. This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
