I mean... yeah, sure, realistically Harry should have been killed by the Darkest Wizard of all times if he were not the main character. Fine, Lily unleashed a deus ex machina who protected Harry for the first book. But he should have still been killed by a 60ft long snake or by a hundred Dementors or by a Dark Lord immune to his mother's protection. But if at any point Harry died, what would have happened to the rest of the story? GRRM can afford to throw in some red herrings and kill off some supposedly main characters because he has so many but Harry Potter is just about Harry Potter so I am quite confused why people hate the plot armor. Any thoughts?


** The problem with plot armor I find it takes the stress out of a situation and breaks the suspension of disbelief. Like because you know there's a fifth book, you know Harry isn't gonna die at the end of GoF, even though he's literally facing a million times stronger wizard. You have to have the suspension of disbelief because it's a fictions book, but you still expect there to be a risk of consequences. Plot armor prevents the stress of consequences, for Harry but not for mad eye or Fred, and it breaks the fourth wall by making me remember that it is a book series. Now plot armor in HP isn't that bad I think, I've hated it in other shows, but I think it was fine or had explanations at least in the HP series

*** But people didn't know he wasn't going to die at the end of the fourth book for example, because the fifth hadn't been released yet. Just because you or someone else might have the knowledge that there's more books to come doesn't mean that people reading it at the time did.

**** 20 years ago, most knew that Harry wouldnt die in book 4 because if he did how could there be a book 5, 6 and 7 which were announce and promised? Harry's fate was unclear in the Deathly Hallows though which was teased by hyping the deaths of several characters we came to love over the years including even Harry himself.

Harry did eventually technically die so

** Because it makes you feel disbelief that he survived since it's unlikely, then you have to suspend that disbelief -- taking you out of the story.

** There is a plot armour and a plot armour. I don't have a problem with finales of PS and CoS (or even PoA), because these solutions generically grow out of the previous story. However, when the wand change ownership rules are introduced just few chapters before they decide the finale of the whole heptalogy, it is too much for me (or when The Trace is introduced just to justify complete nonsensical Battle of Seven Potters and get rid off Ginny again).

The Trace (as a concept) was introduced in PoA when the Ministry found out about Harry blowing up his aunt, and again when Harry got dragged in front of the Wizengamot for repealing dementors on the loose.

**** Actually, that isn't completely correct. From the Dobby-and-pudding disaster we know, that Ministry follows the location for magic, but not who was casting it. That would work for both blowing up Aunt Marge and dementors (and it wouldn't work on many other occasions when the magic was used at 4 Privet Drive).

** Because it murders the suspension of disbelief and desecrates its corpse.

** It isn't really the Plot Armor that's the problem, it's more the way it's expressed. Tropes are tools, as they say over at TvTropes.

As an example, when writing a prequel, the reader can obviously know that a character will survive because they are in the original work, but that doesn't by itself remove narrative tension or immediately cause disbelief. Plenty of prequels are successful stories in themselves.

The problem here is when the Plot Armor is achieved through successive Deus Ex Machina. Or, said another way: when as a writer you need the protagonist to survive a situation, you can either give them the tools to do it, or the support for it---even if they only learn about it in the moment---or have them have a bit of luck this one time, or even just avoid putting them in situations that are /too/ impossible. It's your story, you can just reshape the situation to ensure it works.

Or... you can do none of that, make the situations as bleak or impossible as you originally wanted and just keep escalating the Deus Ex Machina as needed to get them out of it. In both case the character has Plot Armor, the author literally refuses to let them die. But in the first it was integrated in the story, and the second the author just tells the reader "Yes, it works. He survives. Don't question it.".

Look at the CoS climax, for example: almost everything in there was introduced before, including the miracle---the phoenix tears---that made him survive his injury. Only a single thing gets introduced out of nowhere---the sword---and it's simple enough and fits well enough with the setting and what's going on that it doesn't break our disbelief.

Compare with the series ending, where it is the result of:

- a series of plot contrivances (the locket's thief happens to be Sirius's brother, Snape can locate the trio when nobody can to give them the sword, the trio somehow divined the cup's location from Bellatrix, and so on, and on, and on) that got almost no previous introduction, buildup or foreshadowing,
- the most incredibly-prescient long-term plan of Dumbledore (Priming Harry for his sacrifice through Snape's actions and with the inherited snitch, in the very specific way that gets rid of the Scarcrux and also protects everyone else and also lets him survive) that somehow ended up working despite all the mess along the way, despite the lack of Dumbledore being around to adapt or stir things back on track, despite him not being some kind of Seer that could have just known how it would go,
- the Master-of-the-Elder-Wand thing (the whole chain of ownership back to Harry, the fact that it wasn't part of Dumbledore's plan yet Harry would be dead without it, etc.) that ended up accidentally saving Harry in the final chapter battle (accidentally on the part of everyone involved, actually; Dumbledore, Snape, Malfoy, Voldemort, Harry: none of them have seriously thought at any point about Harry getting the mastery of the wand).

Like the introduction of the Sword of Gryffindor in CoS, any /one/ of those many things above would have been fine. And luck and coincidences do happen, especially in fiction. But when they start piling up and combining just to prop up the Plot Armor, people start to notice, and suspension of disbelief shatters.

To more directly answer you question: the whole point of a successful Plot Armor is that it is subtle enough that readers don't really notice or care in the moment. And sometimes it just isn't---especially in fanfiction.
