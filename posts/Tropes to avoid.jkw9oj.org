So I'm planning to write a fanfiction about Harry set during his Hogwarts years.

What tropes should I avoid?

*** u/TheLetterJ0:

  *Amazing Potter-wealth* (clich√©)

  When Harry has multiple vaults or just a huge amount of wealth in general, which often plays next to no role in the fic.
#+end_quote

To be fair, canon did this one first, albeit without the multiple vaults.

The rest of your points are great though.

Kind of but not really. It merely indicates that Harry has a modest but still sizable amount of money left to him by his deceased parents, not enough gold to singlehandedly destroy every single economy in the world ten times over.

***** I'm pretty sure it's never firmly established just how much money Harry has. Definitely more than he knew what to do with as a kid, but it might or might not be enough for him to be set for life.

It also doesn't help that economics is barely mentioned, the actual value of a galleon is unclear, the Weasleys are the only other data point we get, and Rowling is really bad at math.

** do what you want. tropes become tropes because people like to read them.

** would help to get the story as well, but the trope I hate is gringotts, lord Potter, etc. I don't even mind Dumbles bash, but "lord Harold James Potter, well met" is so terrible.

there was actually a fic that used "well met", I'm not making that up. soooo cringey.

also, poor bullied Slytherins. and every ravenclaw bullies Luna.

** No Golden Trio nonsense maybe?

I mean, /I get it/, they were friends, but if you are doing a rewrite, maybe include soemthings different?
