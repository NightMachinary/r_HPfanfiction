As far as I can tell from Google, these fics (based on a romance between Sirius and a Muggle solicitor called Cordelia) were only ever uploaded to FictionAlley. I found a copy of the first three chapters of the original fic, A Sirius Affair, on fanfiction.net, but the rest of it isn't uploaded on there. The Schnoogle/FictionAlley link still comes up on Google, but it's R-rated and comes up with an "are you over 17?" message that just reloads when I click "Yes" instead of taking me to the fic.

I really hope those stories aren't lost forever. Reading them was an occasional guilty pleasure of mine, as I'm a real sucker for the "Sirius gets his name cleared and finds love with a nice woman" genre of fanfiction. If anyone has a copy of both fics, or even just of A Sirius Affair, I would be delighted!
