I tried finding these on a couple different fic search places but had no luck.

There are at least two stories maybe more that I'm remembering.I believe they are by the same author and are Harry/Draco.I have gone through my favs on most of the sites I read but can not seem to find them.From what I rememberthey both have bad Ron.In one Ron, Ginny and others attack Harry ,I think it was at a wedding, and rape and sodomize him.They are caught by Charlie and his boyfriend (maybe be husband it might have been there wedding) I think and at the trial Ginny is remorseful but not Ron.

In the other one ,I think it was a different one and not the same story, Ron and Pansy team up to get back at Harry and Draco for being together.On New Years Eve the Malfoys have a party but Harry is away in New York I think with Sirius.And Ron and Pansy crash the party.

I am not sure if the other parts I remember are parts of these stories or other ones I have read.I remember Hermione ending up with Crabbe or Goyle in one.And Ron verbally attacking her about it.Also I think in the other she ends up with Balise.If anyone knows any of these stories or the author can you please tell me?Even the Hermione/Crabbe?Goyle? one if its not part of the other ones.


** You should also post this over at [[http://drarryficfind.livejournal.com/][Drarry Fic Find]] as well as [[http://hp-ficsearch.livejournal.com/][Harry Potter Fan Fiction Searches]] over on LiveJournal.

You need an account to post there but doing so will increase the chance that someone can help you find what you're looking for. Good luck!
