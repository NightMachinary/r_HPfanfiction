I'm curious about fics where the dementor trial has a bigger effect, either as a turning point or where Harry "breaks free of the chains of the light" or whatever, or it helps him convince the world of Sirius's innocence, whatever. Thank you!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/22/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop][This one-shot chapter]] doesn't even make it to the trial, it starts with Harry:

- Being attacked by dementors and being informed that the Ministry's coming to snap his wand (as canon).

- Coming to the perfectly reasonable conclusion that since the dementors are under the control of the Ministry, that said Ministry has been taken over by Voldemort, otherwise the dementors wouldn't have attacked him.

- Running far, far away.

** *Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor*, linkffn(8914586), has to be the most famous one.

*What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix*, linkffn(5265558), is short, but fairly entertaining. I like the 'Harry running away' theme a lot.

*You're my Density*, linkffn(11033616), is a Robstfic. Before you people tear into me, I just want to say this one is not that bad, and it meets what OP asked.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

  What if Harry had reacted more strongly to the Ministry's threat to expel him and snap his wand? What if he had fled the country rather than submit to the trial?

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.
