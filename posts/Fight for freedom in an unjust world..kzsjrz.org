The Harry Potter world is heavily unfair, Goblins forced to be accountants, elves are slaves, only humans being aloud to use wands, etc, the world just ain't fair and their is no justice, any fanfics where the non-humans fight for equality?

***** Yeah but what I mean is the goblins who live with the wizards, that's like some one from the past saying "Yeah we don't treat black people equally here but its ok because where they come from they probably get treated equally" you see its still racist.

  Harry is an elf. No, he's not a bloody house elf. He lived in a place where they had got him confused with a house elf for nearly six years. They had him doing all the chores and he slept in a cupboard. Not a particularly cheerful cupboard, either. But he's not a house elf. He's a regular elf, thank you. Come on, people. It's like you're not wizards or something. PreHogwarts, NOT a creature fic. Character study.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
