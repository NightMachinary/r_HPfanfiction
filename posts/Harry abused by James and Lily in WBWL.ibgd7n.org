Are there any WBWL stories where james and lily actually abuse Harry; not just neglect, but actual abuse?


** I haven't read such a fic and do not want to in the future. I don't what you were thinking before asking this question but how can you wish to read a person be abused. Neglect is one thing but abuse is on a different level.
