I saw a post recently complaining about how dumb those fics where harry has like 50 different titles are, and I realized that I actually do really enjoy these fanfics.

Any recommendations for fics with OP Harry where he also has a ton of inheritances, and as a result, political power?


** Time travel? Really! Is a fem-Harry fic but she's Lady Potter-Peverell and Heiress Black so... Yeah.

** If you use the politics tag on ao3 a lot of these kinds of fics should turn up. I think there are probably a bunch of other tags too.

**** It might take some time to figure out which tags are used. My tip is that once you find a fic you like you look at the tags and then use those to find similar fics. You can also search using keywords and excluding other words.

I think it's a great system. Better than FF or Wattpad actually.

** ...years from now on, you'll look back on this and /cringe/. But anyhow, FFN should have a ton of such stories. You generally want the ones with indy!Harry, Weasley/Dumbledore!bashing, HUMONGOUS harems -- the larger the harem's size, the more gratuitous fics tend to be... Oh, and there were quite a few Haphne fics that fit the bill back in the days.

*** Maybe we just have different tastes? I've been reading fanfictions for about 6 years now and I've never found myself cringing at my taste even as it changes.

Also, I am well aware that fics with actual character development and struggles are, in general, much better written. But as a college engineering student who is really bogged down by hard and stressful coursework, I get my dopamine release from seeing a character I really like absolutely tear apart his opponents (in more ways than one). It's not fun to struggle in real life 24/7 and then come to FFN for fun and see more struggle.

**** Well, maybe. But then, everything is best in moderation - wish fulfillment included. And I get your position -- I share it too -- but I found that seeing a tough opponent get toppled is much, much more satisfying. That way, the victory feels earned, and its contrast with previous struggles elevates the dopamine rush to greater heights. (*which is also why deux ex machina-solutions are so unsatisfying)

**** That's what I'm bloody saying you....ugh!

I said 'at least, no canon relation' meaning I'm referring to canon not fanon!

So fuck off and stop down voting me because of a fucking misunderstanding that's on your part.

****** Sorry, not talking to you about the downvote if you didn't do it.

It's a logical assumption to make.

I'm in a bad mood and people decided to downvote me to -2. Then someone said something about it being a fanfiction when I said very clearly(or at least I thought I did) that I was talking about canon, not fanon. Sorry for the 'hostility' just know that it's directed towards you, you seem to be nice.
