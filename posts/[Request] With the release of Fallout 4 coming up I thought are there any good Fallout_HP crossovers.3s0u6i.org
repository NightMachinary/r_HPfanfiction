I'll take not so good ones too if they are legible since there doesn't seem to be an overabundance of fics atleast in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Fallout-Crossovers/224/725/?&srt=4&r=10][fanfiction.com]]


** There are currently [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Fallout-Crossovers/224/725/?&srt=1&r=10][only eight]] fics on FFN. :(

But I'm sure there will be more in a few months once everyone has played it and gotten inspired to write stories. :)

** A world where James and Lily fled England instead of just going into hiding. Voldemort secretly orchestrated the war between China and America, accidentally creating the nuclear holocaust. James, Lily, and Harry take shelter in a Vault, one where they end up in a stasis of some kind (I believe that's what happens to the main character in Fallout 4) then emerge 200 years later. Maybe have an Order of the Phoenix vault so other characters survive as well? Or Ron as a ghoul maybe and Hermione never gets her Hogwarts letter so she ended up in a vault as well. Of course Voldemort would still be alive because of the Horcruxes and has been gaining power since the rest of the world was destroyed...

I'm busy writing other stuff but this could be a great story.
