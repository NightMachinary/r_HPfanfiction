I know this is something many consider 'cheap' when it comes to establishing good and bad characters, but do you know any +good+ enjoyable stories where a character is bullied, and eventually rescued by someone else?

Many people can't read another 'Hermione is being bullied for being smart, and only Harry realizes her beauty' or a 'Remus Lupin is a werewolf, and everyone but Tonks (or Sirius, or timetravelled Hermione/Harry, or whoever) discriminate against him' without gagging because of how clich√© it is, but for me that sort of thing will do just fine, so if you can think of a story like this, even if you can't read it for yourself anymore, please be so nice and recommend it to me, would ya?

Yeah, we need more plotlines along the lines of "They tried to bully Hermione. Once. Because, with wands around, 'Knowledge is Power' is not just a pithy phrase."

That said, there's linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), where Hermione gets bullied early on for being Muggleborn in Slytherin. To say that it doesn't last is a bit of an understatement, though.

** This is the only one I can think of at this exact moment and it is less bullying and more about being ignored and then rising from the ashes like a boss. I know there are a few interesting Hermione ones, Alexandra Potter by Taure and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle]] (this other Alexandra one) have some good bullying parts and just non-acceptance by peers. But those are also super AU. You should be able to find some where Tom Riddle Jr. is bullied and it leads to his evilness. If you want to stumble on bullying in its simplest form anything with Snape should have some level off that.\\
