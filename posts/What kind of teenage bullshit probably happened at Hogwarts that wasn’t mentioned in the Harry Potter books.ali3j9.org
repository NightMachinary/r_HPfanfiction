***** 100k RIGHT NOW. How many hpff writers are there writing right now?

800k HP stories posted on FFN so far. So let's be generous and say there's 400k writers (there's probably far fewer).

There are currently over 21 million subscribers to askreddit.

** Using potion ingredients to get high. Potions to improve looks. Potions to make you impressively good at something.

Vibrating fingers or dicks, for obvious reasons. Also, pretty much any other bit of magic you could imagine for improving sex and masturbation. I have to imagine it gets interesting the better you are at magic, giving yourself ridges or flavors and etc.

Teasing and pranks would be a lot more common since it's a little too easy and kids are notoriously bad at putting themselves in another's shoes.

Some would repurpose rooms and other areas for themselves to hang out at.

Enchanted jewelry or other magical baubles to show off with. Magical games/magical challenges.

It always seemed off to me that so many students have political mail delivered to them instead of something like sports magazines. Oh, how do they set up the subscriptions because now I'm wondering if any of them are getting porn delivered? You have to jack off to something and if you're single I doubt you'd be satisfied by just your thoughts. In any case, porn "material" is another thing that wasn't mentioned but definitely existed.

Their version of television. Seriously, what do they do in their downtime to just sit and be a couch potato for?

Listen to music.

Can't think of anything else in particular, though you should probably add in some stupidity done to impress friends and for each person to have their own "thing" that they do.

** Stumbled accross a similar question on Quora, so I'll just post that here, too:

Rape and other abuse using compulsion spells, confundus charms, potions (especially love potions - not everybody can resist them after all, just like most can't throw off the imperius, especially if the caster doesn't have you do stuff you are 100% against - so a Voldemort sympathiser might not be 100% (especially if his life is in danger or he has some latent muggle/muggleborn hate!) against telling a deatheater some ministry information, but he wouldn't do it without the imperius making him do so), memory charms etc. etc.

Seriously, there's enough scumbags (both male and female!) out there that rape people in RL (magic makes this a lot easier, especially with the use of memory charms! I mean Lockhart stole the accomplishments of multiple people and nobody was the wiser and still, nobody knows who did the deeds originally!) - with magic making it a lot easier? You bet it will happen more often! The same goes for stealing seemen (especially from somebody as rich as Malfoy! He might be an asshole, but you bet a girl would be very well off if Malfoy impregnated her! Lucius Malfoy would pay hush money to keep it quiet and probably even set up a stipend for both mother and child!)

Not to mention torture, murder and theft etc. - seriously, the world of magic is a criminal's paradise (especially since we don't know if there are good detection magics...DNA evidence is probably not something wizards use, so in a murder you only have to kill with the killing curse and then have somebody else obliviate you (so you can lie under veritaserum if someone suspects you!), thus you are the perfect killer for hire!)...same for stealing! Obliviate the victim and you are done! They will never even report it because they don't know that they've been stolen from, they will think they've missplaced whatever you took!)

ps: Polyjuice! You don't even need to obliviate people if you look like somebody else while doing your nasty deads (be they: stealing, torturing, killing, raping etc.) :(

Also: Sex with polyjuice involved (you can basically sleep with - the body of - anybody you can get a hair from (or even some other genetic material, I bet that works, too!))!
