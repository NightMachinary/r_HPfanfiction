Life was just shitty for Tom, so in his imagination he became a Dark wizard intent on destroying the world.

Dumbledore may be a superior he never saw eye to eye with.

Harry Potter is an upstart he hated.

The Death Eaters may be his coworkers.

And his death may have been brought on by his own addictions (which in mind were horcruxes).

  In limbo, Harry makes another choice and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them? Time travel, UA but as canon as possible. HPTR - COMPLETE
