Weasley bashing, when it's not all of them, tends to stick to the classic formula of evil Ron, Ginny and Molly, while the rest of the family is blissfully unaware of their evil love potioning deeds.

Does anyone have any Weasley bashing fics where Ron /isn't/ bashed? I'd prefer if he's the only 'good' Weasley, but anything is fine as long as Ron remains a decent friend to Harry.

** What I wouldn't give for a fic that bashes /only/ the Weasley twins. It feels like every single fic has only them not getting bashed.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

***** That was quite a good story, thanks for the suggestion. I'm a bit sad that it isn't finished, but the ending ties up nicely enough for the readers imagination.

** It's not exactly bashing, but Ron-centric stories like Fate and the Red Knight does have characters like Molly and Percy react badly to Ron being sorted Slytherin.

They do get some character development so it's not just two dimensional bashing.

I would recommend Red Knight over Fate due to pacing issues that Fate has
