**** Most people don't consider anything beyond HP as canon. CC was not written by JKR and FB series was just her way milking money from HP world.

****** Lots and lots.

Like Dumbledore secret brother. We know that Dumbledore father was sent to Azkaban when Albus was young. But we have 18 year old young broher to Albus Dumbledore in FB1. It means his brother was born after Albus' father waz sent to jail.

Dumbledore teaching DADA instead of transfiguration.

Leta Lestrange was supposed to be last of her line but we have seen Lestrange family in HP books.

McGonagall in Ootp said she was teaching at Hogwarts for 39 years. That means from 1956. But she teaches Newt. That means around 1910.

******* I never thought about the part he was teaching DADA instead of transfiguration, and was that Mcgonagall? I thought it another woman, isn't Mcgonagall the same age or younger than Newt? As in just a bit older than Tom and Hagrid?

IIRC Albus father got a 5 year sentence right? Even then, the age difference...

I had understood Leta was from another branch of that family, I mean, Bellatrix is a pretty big character in the books, they can't just have forgotten about her and her husband and brother in law.

Yeah, some pretty big plot holes and AFAIK it was written by JKR herself.
