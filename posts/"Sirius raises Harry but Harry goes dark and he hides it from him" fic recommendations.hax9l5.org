I have read a few but I crave for more. Usually with Harry discovering books about dark magic in the Black library

â€‹

Anything but fem!Harry is fine


** If I remember correctly, something along those lines happened in the downward spiral saga.

Here Harry isn't raised by Sirius, nor is Harry comfortable around his godfather, but he decides to hide the fact that he enjoys casting nasty curses from him in order to not disappoint the man.

It isn't a major plot point, but it is part of it nonetheless.

linkffn(12867536) is the first book.

I believe it was in the fourth or so, it's a nice read though, so I can wholeheartedly recommend it. Though it may be a bit /heavy/ with an overtly perverted and psychologically damaged Harry.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

** I've got a time travel SI fic where Harry lives at Grimmauld and uses his invisibility cloak to browse the Black library, although it's mostly to have an excuse for why he knows what a Horcrux is, not to actually use dark magic. Because that stuff is seriously dangerous. I haven't actually gotten around to finish and publish that chapter though.
