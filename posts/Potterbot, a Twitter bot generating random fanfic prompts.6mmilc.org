** This is a bot using so-called /Markov chains/ to generate random new lines. I fed it the complete text corpus of HP 1-7. When I set it up, I was mostly thinking of generating funny lines, but a surprising thing has happened:

A friend of mine has started replying to the prompts generated by Potterbot, to continue the scenes. You can find a good example [[https://twitter.com/winniehell/status/883448911314247680][here]]. I find it hilarious, and it's a good example of creativity produced by human-computer interaction! :3
