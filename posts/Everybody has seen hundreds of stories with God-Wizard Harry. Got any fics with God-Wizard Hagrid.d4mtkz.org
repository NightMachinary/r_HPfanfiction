Or, I guess, anybody else that isn't Harry. I guess I just have HP Fatigue, and I'm looking for a different main character.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

#+begin_quote
  The Chamber of Secrets had been a mystery for as long as its legend was passed on from one generation to the other. When students started to be petrified, its horrible reputation was made much more real. But what if somebody managed to put the clues together? Somebody that knew lots about all kinds of magical creatures. What would that little change lead to?

** IMO Hagrid is closer to being a titan than a god.
