Like the title states. I would prefer a Hermione/female pairing or no pairing, but any would do. I can't find any good stories, so I'd love to hear your recommendations.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** Most of the fics by the author 'robst' have Hermione and quite a few other characters suffer critical brain damage after childbirth, due to which they act like complete idiots throughout the course of the stories.
