Here is what I can remember.

First off this story is several years old. Not as old as Make A Wish or the Mr. Black series. But probably not far from it.

Harry is one of the leaders in some kind of elite magical task force. He is involved with his boss/handler's daughter. Harry was going to propose or just recently had done so. He declares his intent to leave the organization to his boss/handler. He warns him it may not be that easy to leave, but he resigns anyway. Not long afterwards he is attacked at his home by his own team on orders of his old organization. Whom have orders to bring him back immediately to resume his service. He takes them all down and is forced to flee and leave his girlfriend. She is tricked by her father who lies to her and has her thinking the worst of him. He at some point conducts a one man assault on their headquarters.

He hides out in a warded property in Australia for a while. Until they eventually track him down. He also fights and subdues Ron or one of the Weasley males at some point who is amongst those hunting and trying to bring him in. (I think? I am not sure if it is the same story.)


** I found it. It was ~From The Shadows~ by: MK One I had some info wrong so I see why nobody figured it out. It was Hermione who betrayed him not the daughter. I mixed those facts together along with confusing a different daughter from another Azkaban fic. In that one he was hiding as a muggle healer.
