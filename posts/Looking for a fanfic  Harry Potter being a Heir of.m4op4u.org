I'm trying to look for that fanfic I have read back in 2012. I can't remember the title to that story. It's about Harry getting school supplies but Draco decided to bully Harry in front of his mother who stared at Harry in shock as the Heir of Black but she got angry at her son for what his attitude was to Harry.

Then Narcissa introduce to herself to Harry and told him he was the Heir of Black, he was speechless but had no idea that he was actually a heir. As Narcissa agrue with her husband and her son on how impolite Draco was to Harry.

If anyone knows what story was it in please link it to me. Cause I had forgotten to add in my favorites.


** I don't know this fic but just so you know, the ideal tag for a post like this is 'what's that fic?'. Not trying to be padantic but it might help in future
