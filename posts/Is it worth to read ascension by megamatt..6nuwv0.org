This looks like an interesting read, but it's half a million words so is it worth it. What i'm looking for is what tropes/cliches should i expect. What bashing should i expect, and how powerful would you rate harry in this universe.

** Megamatt09 is an extremely polarizing writer. If you like loads of cliches and the same tired tropes, anime style OP Harry with a harem, then he's your guy. If you're more refined and have grown past that stage in your fanfiction career, then you won't like his stuff at all.

-edit- as for the specific story, I haven't read it, but I assume it follows the same general guidelines as his 100 other stories.

*** I will have you know that even some of us who like those op, cliche ridden stories think megamatt is terrible.

** No. Sorry I can't offer more of an explanation, but I'm not going to go through the pains of reminding myself why I think it's crap by re-reading or even skimming.

** I haven't read it myself, but have read a few of his other works. From what I remember, it's pretty mindless entertainment. He loves harems, supergirl, and decided at one point to retire Hermione from all his future works. It's not very good, but I've read a lot worse. Given that, I wouldn't start a half million word story of his myself.

** Megamatt09 isn't a bad writer, by any stretch, but he isn't a great writer either. If cliches and harems appeal to you, go ahead and read it. Do be aware Ascension's sequel is one of the longest HP fics ever written. Harry is also extremely powerful from the few chapters I read.

He also writes dedicated smut (ex. The Breeding Ground) and one of his earlier works (Aspirations) is probably his best story, as it has far less cliches in it and is generally better written and faster paced.

** If you want to read a cliched, OP Harry, where every woman he comes across (except Hermione) wants to become his sex slave, then yeah. Its got quite a bit of incest as well, and just became: Useless Plot, Sex, Useless Plot, Sex etc.

It bashes every single male except for Harry. Harry is the most powerful being in the universe, and his sister was bred for him to be his most ideal mate.

Yeah, the plot outline was most likely written with one hand,

Overall, if you want to read some semi-decent cliched writing with a ton of smut, and an OP Harry who makes woman drool by looking at them, then yeah, have a go.

It is a big crossover with Superman/Supergirl, and all of his fics have Kara in them at some point.
