To add to my request I would also like for Harry to realize that they arent really what he thought them to be. To clarify more i would like Harry to see that the pranks they pull arent always harmless and are sometimes very cruel


** Timely Errors by Worfe is a good one for that linkffn(4198643), although you might have already read it.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

  Dumbledore gives Harry an offer he can't refuse. A year at Hogwarts without constant whispering, life-threatening situations, or Voldemort. How? By taking a trip to when Marauders were still faithful and 16. !Um, make that one out of three!
