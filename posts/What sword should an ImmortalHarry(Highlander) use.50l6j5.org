Obviously not a Katana and not the sword of Gryffindor, but what type do you think he'd use in a crossover?

*** The Sword of Gryffindor was as much a status object as it was a functional sword. When it was created, a wizard would settle muggle duels with swords and magical duels with wands.

** From when is he? Presumably he'd use a sword from his era? If that's 16th century England as in the film he'd use a broadsword. It's a one-handed double edged straight military sword with a basket hilt. Similar to the sword used by Rob Roy but not quite as big. Alternatively he could use an early rapier (actually more of a smallsword), as of then with two edges and a flat profile, which was a dueling weapon for civilian use, or a backsword, basically a straight sabre (long, one sharp edge, simple bowguard).

This is after the era of the longsword, so I wouldn't use that, and slightly before the cavalry sabre (in England). He could use a more modern sword, or an "imported" sword, or maybe he's from the 6th century instead, which would totally change everything.

*** Born in 1980, just removing the foundling aspect of immortals and adding many have various magical abilities.

His teacher will be either amanda, duncan, or an OC. Methos was the original idea but i didn't want to kill him off like harry's teacher will be

**** Hm well then any sword would be an anachronism. In my experience what people are most proud of in terms of English swordsmanship is the 1796 light cavalry sabre, which actually is a heavy sword, and thus was often ground thinner for officers who wouldn't ride it to battle but wanted a more capable weapon than their ceremonial sword.

But I'd actually still go with a smallsword. That isn't an impressive sword - it's a thrust weapon that wasn't designed for war, but more civilised duels and such - but it's almost like a wand in use. You flick and twirl and thrust with smallsword, similar to an epee in sports fencing, and there is perhaps some creative potential here, especially if wand magic is even among the immortals unique to Harry.

Edit: a possible alternative would also be something ridiculous like a Flamberge. That's a head-high two handed sword that was used in a twirling motion to contest pikes. Well paid but short lived mercenaries would literally walk into a wall of spears with those, shoulder to shoulder, and behind them their own pikemen who would then thrust into the now unarmed enemy holding their splintered pikes. I once had a chance to swing that, and without magic someone tall and weedy like Harry probably could hardly move it for long. I think the reconstruction I was allowed to handle had five kilo?

***** I did some googling around, looking at various swords, looking for something like the blade in Ultraviolet(the chisel shaped one is the best way I can describe it) and came across executioner's swords.

Harry will be given a sword---I think a smallsword would be good but he'll be trained in multiple styles of course---to start with then he'll find a well-kept executioner's sword in his family's stuff and elect to start using it.

*** Potentially two different stories. My darkness!harry story may after year seven go highlander/crossover and/or I may do a harry/highlander story someday, making notes for it if i don't accept the clamor for me to do the sot/harry story in my anthologies. Or a potential harry/fallout/elder scrolls crossover. Stupid plotfoetuses!

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_1796_light_cavalry_sabre][British Light cavalry saber]]- made to slice apart enemies, with a strong and agile cutting blade of good length and balance.

Or you can have him use a goblin weapon that has been suffused with the blood of a metamorph- then he can choose the best weapon of the moment.

** Maybe not dramatic enough, but he could have a goblin made rapier imbued with basilisk venom. He'd just use his reflexes to dodge and then prick people with the end of it. It would probably disable them long enough for him to decapitate with magic.

** It's a tricky question isn't it, Sword of Gryffindor aside? I mean on the one hand he is a short-arse, so I get using a small blade like a gladius, but on the other hand, a short, straight blade isn't going to be very good at lopping off heads. Maybe something distinctive, like a falcata? Hmm... Probably too heavy... Oooh, a dao might work...

Yeesh, looking back on that stream of consciousness, I sound like a bloodthirsty Ollivander. If this question is for a fic, be sure to link it here later so I can read it.

*** Harry being short is Fanon not Canon. It's never directly stated exactly how tall he is however it is stated that he was as tall as his father who was also never described as short. So it's safe to assume Harry is probably in the average 5'8"-6'0" range.
