** MoD Harry will be like : DaFug is with the local dementors??, How does that guy have bazillion horcruxes!? Are you a twilight vampire Hermione? What do you mean you're third troll and third unicorn????? What the fuck is going on here!?!? and why is that chicken on fire?

And then he keels over, because HPMOR Harry shoots his glowy white human stuff at him.

** HPMOR would probably just try to finagle the secret of immortality from MoD Harry, thereby permanently completing the circle of life and death by having everyone live as death.

Which somehow fulfills the HPMOR prophecy or something.

**** Hmm, it's not really something I look for specifically. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] is the only one that really comes to mind.

I remember finding it charming and enjoying it.

Another one where Harry is MoD that I read recently is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]], with a slightly unhinged but otherwise swell Harry that ended up in the star wars universe. His status as MoD isn't the focus of the story but it does play a role. It's fun and has it's definite awesome moments so far. It's not a completed story though.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  Harry Potter, Lone Traveler, has accepted his role as the Multiverse's fix-it man. A figure of legend in many universes, he makes his way as directed by Creation to worlds where they could use a nudge here and there. Maybe he can prevent the multiverse from destroying itself in apocalyptic fire. Sequel to Stories of the Lone Traveler.
