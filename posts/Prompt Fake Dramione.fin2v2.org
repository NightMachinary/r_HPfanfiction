Draco hatches a plan to kidnap Harry Potter for Voldemort by pretending to fall in love with Hermione and gaining the trust of the trio. He thinks his plan is working perfectly well but Hermione immediately realized that he's planning something and starts making her own plans on what to do with Draco.

So you have a lot of awkward Dramione romance scenes where both sides pretend to love while actually despising and planning to betray the other.


** I like it! To add extra layers of crazy, have Hermione not mention the real reason she's going out with Draco to either Harry or Ron. Then have Ron be super jealous over Hermione, but because he's a teenager and doesn't want to admit that he's crushing on Hermione, Ron pretends that he's jealous because he's crushing on Draco. Harry, who /actually/ likes Draco, feels disappointed and trapped because there's no way he can declare his feelings without angering both Ron and Hermione, so he takes up the offer to go out with Pansy, who's just trying to make Draco jealous. And then make all of that a 50k word prologue for a Dean/Parvati fic involving time traveling dinosaurs.

****** I just looked up his wiki. The bio is hilarious. No, no I wasn't referencing anything quite so highbrow. The time traveling dinosaurs were just put in there because that's the kind of random I felt the paragraph was building to. I only ever intended the dinos to be part of the plot that drives the Dean and Parvati together. I was imagining something that was half Jane Austen and half Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, but set in Hogwarts.

******* It's all right. I just thought it was, but I find it more hilarious now because it's concidental.

**** If I could do the idea justice, I would. :) As it is though, I can't seem to stop reading fanfiction enough to spend the time actually writing, lol.

** I'd totally read this... so long as it doesn't eventually turn into a real Dramione.

** Idk, sounds like an excuse to have dramonie romance and still stay within canon characterisation. I dislike the pairing so much that Hr/R actually makes sense.
