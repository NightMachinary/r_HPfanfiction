To me, it was Like a Redheaded Step Child. I saw the chapter title "'Yer a Ginger, Harry" and couldn't help but chuckle.


** The chapter titles for Resurrection are hilarious too! For example:

1. SMALL, ABUSED CHILD GRATEFUL TO BE KIDNAPPED

2. LOCAL KID STRUGGLES WITH VIOLENT URGES, FIGHTS HAT

3. WISE OLD MAN NUDGES PROTAGONIST TOWARDS A SIDE QUEST, GETS A FIRM "NO THANKS"

4. LOCAL KID'S FIRST KILL RUINED BY COMMUNITY ELDERS' CONCERN

5. PARANOID CHILD THINKS EVERYONE OUT TO GET HIM, REPEATEDLY PROVEN RIGHT linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23832304/chapters/57268621]])

  It was a bone-deep almost-ache when he opened his eyes and spotted the light flitting through the slats of his cupboard, both a familiar sight and at the same time distant like an old memory. It was a twist in his chest when he sat up, expecting---strangely---to hit his head on the sloped ceiling only to pause when he realized, of course, that he was far too short for that to happen. Harry was struck with a strong sensation---which had no apparent reason at all---that he should not be here.---In which Harry Potter returns to his 11 year-old body after “dying” in the Forbidden Forest, given a second chance to change the ending of his story and the fate of the wizarding world. Except with the memories of his previous life buried deep in his subconscious, Harry must rely on his ever-present sense of deja-vu to guide him down a different path.

  Petunia and Vernon are able to put their grudges aside and raise the boys as brothers, completely equal...so they end up with two spoiled, greedy brats.

** Lord Mortis The Accident, because of the tag 'Three Teenagers In A Trenchcoat Playing A Pureblood Lord' followed by the description of what he's wearing in the first scene had me cackling. The fic is absurd and I love it, and it's been a month since the last update and ngl I'm starting to panic a bit.

  Harry Potter has never been good at lying under pressure, and his latest misstep lands him in deep trouble. He's now the Lord of an extremely ancient, extremely Dark, previously extinct house of Necromancers. Lucky for him, he has friends who can keep up, and enemies who are determined to draw the wrong conclusions.

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) made me giggle all the way through, except for the times I outright laughed. It sometimes clings more tightly to the stations of canon than really makes sense, but the writing quality is good enough to get away with it.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
