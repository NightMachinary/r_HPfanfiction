  “For fuck's sake, Granger, didn't your mother ever teach how to properly pour a cup of tea?” Draco snapped, his grey eyes narrowing at the bushy haired girl who was sitting across from him. Hermione's response, of course, was to roll her eyes as she shoved the china, now steaming, towards the young man.

  “If you don't like the way I pour, Malfoy, maybe you should go annoy someone else during tea time. You certainly wouldn't be missed.”

  She pulled her own cup closer to herself from across the desk, leaving it on her desk as she leaned back into her chair, crossing her legs. She didn't attempt to hide her annoyance, glaring back at him with the fury of a valkyrie.

  “Yes, well,” he started, pausing to press the fine, floral printed china that had once belonged to Hermione's grandmother to his lips, “This may come as some surprise to you, but yours is the only worthwhile company in this entire building.”

I haven't really done any kind of promoting before, but upon the completion of this story I feel like I wanted to help get it out there a bit more. Unplanned is a story that started as Tumblr drabbles and just kind of grew into something of its own. Told in snapshots of Hermione and Draco's life, this is their story.
