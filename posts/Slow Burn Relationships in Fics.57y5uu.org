I enjoy myself some good romance and relationship stuff in my fics. I'm a firm Harry/Ginny shipper and mostly focus on after the battle stories, but do find myself reading some AU fics post OOTP. One aspect of AU fics I find myself seeing too often in the romance subplot is coupling the pair way too soon and way too strongly.

It goes from Harry starting to see Ginny differently in the beginning of the chapter immediately to them declaring their love for each other by the end of the chapter. So with that said:

Can anyone recommend any good Harry/Ginny fics that slowly develop their eventual relationship? While I'm open to any time period, I'd prefer to avoid any stories where they get together earlier than in the actual books.

That's not only a Problem with Harry/Ginny... it's probably even worse in Harry/Hermione fics. I'm not even joking when I say that in a lot of those fics wedding rings or at least an engagement ring is bought in the following chapter. Completely ridiculous and not romantic at all... just silly.

As a sidenote: Since you like Harry/Ginny, can you recommend fics, where I as a reader am not already supposed to love Ginny? Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against her, but to me she's pretty much a non-character and I hate it that she's more the idea of a character ("the spunky red-head who stands up for herself and tells Harry whats what") instead of properly characterizing her as such. The ~3 scenes from canon that are not really enough for me to get her (except by extrapolating what JKR wanted her to be... the 'idea' of Ginny).

  Harry is still angry but this year he has a person to blame. A secret trunk, a kitten with a secret and an secret potion. Complete!
