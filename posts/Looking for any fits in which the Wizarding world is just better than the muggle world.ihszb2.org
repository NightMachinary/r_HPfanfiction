As in anything muggles can do wizards can do better. If this could include purebloods actually having something about them that differed from muggleborns that makes them better. Dark or grey and powerful harry to is appreciated


** Check out Mad Fairy over on AO3. Not all wizards are great, but most are willing to learn and innovate when motivated. Additionally, Wizarding World starts out fully self-sufficient and eco-friendly.

Other than that, you may wish to Google some Apprentice!Harry fics - they tend to develop the Wizarding World without immediately descending into muggle bashing. (I don't remember titles RN, sorry)

Unfortunately, it's something of a niche because most people see the antiquated decor and whimsy, and overlook the many centuries wizards had lived comfortably. And from there, wizard bashing is right ahead.

As for actual value in bloodlines... Happens sometimes in "His Exalted Majesty, Lord Hadrian James Kirk Vader Gryffindor Slytherin Peverell Flamel Black Peregrine Potter" fics... Which may cause issues with digestion :p

** I think linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) has a bit of this--especially in some of the descriptions of day to day wizarding life as compared to muggles.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
