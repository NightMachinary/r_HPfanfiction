[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/page-26#post-3138965][Enter the Dragon]] has an interesting view of Horcrux formation, that it's basically a perversion of an ancient marriage ritual that forms a soul bond between the two parties; the altered ritual kills one of them and attaches the bond to an object instead.

Methods of Rationality takes a different view, that the Horcrux ritual captures the burst of energy that could be used to form a ghost, and uses it instead to imprint the caster's personality onto the object.

What other theories have people seen?


** Cue the evil old wizard:

While unspeakably evil and a perversion of the natural order, Horcruxes, are at their core a simple thing. Why, a sufficiently motivated child could create one.

The death serves as a sacrifice to power binding a piece of soul into a horcrux.

They are almost indestructible for a reason. Pieces of souls aren't supposed to be pulled off and kept in containers.

If the soul fragment wasn't so well contained it wouldn't serve as an anchor, to pervert the natural order of death.

Not being able to sense your own horcruxes is a perfectly normal state of affairs. Being able to sense one implies it's not well enough bound to act as a strong anchor.

Really, you want to be immune to everything including Avada Kedavra, so accept not being able to feel them.

Poorly bound Horcruxes put the caster at risk of dying from the killing curse, and might not even protect one from, for example; magical backlash.

(For a more Egyptian version; If the Ba is not bound, the Ka will leave the world. )

** I like the idea that it can't be an enemy or someone you personally hate, maybe even requiring you to care about the person or them love you.

Another that I just came up with is that when a person dies it creates a release of energy when the soul is released and horcrux ritual harnesses that energy and the soul bonding it to an object. That energy is why horcruxes are so difficult to destroy not even counting other protections that could be laid on it. That soul is twisted to be more similar to the caster (before through horrible depraved acts or after death, I can't decide) and with a quirk of sympathetic magic, it prevents the caster from passing on because their soul tries to pull them towards the “other part” of the soul at the same time the natural order of things is trying to pull the soul to the “other side”. So not only is the horcrux ritual a true abomination to be willing to bind a persons soul after twisting it to be in the casters image, it requires an immense amount of will to prevent the caster from being trapped in the horcrux. By making the horcruxes so similar to the caster it would also cause the twisted soul fragments to be willing to do anything to “survive”.

*** Sorry, Enter the Dragon is on QQ. If you wanted the synopsis, though:

It began with a quirk of timing, and it continued because dragons --- such as the one which an eight year old Harry Potter had become --- were very large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh?​

** One of the theories I like the most is based off of canon but instead of just killing anyone in cold blood you have to kill an innocent, a child. And the reason that the scarcrux was even formed was due to the fact that Tom had planned to use Harry as a sacrifice to form his last horcrux Also that the main body holds a connection to the horcruxes and that Tom broke that connection due to the amount of rituals he put himself through. If he hadn't done those then he could have kept the connection to his horcruxes like he has with Harry and he would have been aware of them at all times and could have used them to attack whoever had them

** In my headcannon Horcruxes are made not by killing an innocent, but committing suicide. The human sacrifice is there to replace the lost lifeforce(as in, the horcrux creator sucks their life away like a dementor.) and prevent the soul from crossing properly. Soul, put under the stress of a partial crossing shatters into many pieces as a result.

Horcrux creator can then relocate some of the broken shards into an animate or inanimate object by giving them physical pieces of themselves(that is why the locket has eyes in it in the film). This is why Harrys scar become a horcrux, Voldemorts soul was already in many tiny pieces, natural for a horcrux creator. This is also why Voldemort was able to Posses Quirell.
