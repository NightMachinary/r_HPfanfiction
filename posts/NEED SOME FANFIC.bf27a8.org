Recently I've had an urge to read fanfic again (the last two years I've been writing more than reading) but the problem is, I can't find ANYTHING to read that'll keep me invested. Here are a few of my requirements.

1. Preferably 100K words plus (80K minimum)
2. Harry must be the main character
3. No weird pairings like Snape/Harry Draco/Harry
4. Preferred parings Harry/Hermione Harry/Susan Harry/anyonewhoisnotGinnyoraDeatheater
5. Completed fics would be great
6. Preferably Dumbledore isn't hated or bashed

If anyone can meet my picky requirements I will forever be in their debt!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petuna Evans, Tomb Raider]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13111277/1/][Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis]], linkffn(13052802;13111277), fit your requirements nicely:

- Long and well over 200k words together. The sequel is updating on a weekly basis and this author always finishes his stories.
- Harry/Hermione
- No bashing, Ron is their best friend, and Dumbledore is totally cool
- The first fic is kind unique in that it focuses on a squib Petunia who is very much accomplished and yet recognizable as her canon version
- Harry growing up with a loving aunt has a somewhat different personality. He and Hermione clicked right from the beginning
- The sequel is Harry centric
- The sequel is a little slow going during several chapters, but is now hinting at something very dark and lots of actions ahead

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** Try mine if you'd like.

140K words, completed, Harry is main, I think you may enjoy the pairing, and Dumbledore is book-compliant. :)

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.
