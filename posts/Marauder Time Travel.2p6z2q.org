I'm looking for a time travel fic where Harry and Ginny go back to the marauders time as DADA teachers.

Also, any Harry goes back to marauder times as DADA teacher fanfics here.


** When I saw the title, I thought you were asking about fics where the marauders (or someone from that era) are the time-travelers and got really excited. I'd love to read one of those.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] by Dius Corvus is a fic where Harry goes back in time to the Marauder era and teaches DADA. From the description:

#+begin_quote
  “I am Jonathan Frost. I was Voldemort and Tom Riddle. I was also Harry Potter.” After the final confrontation with Voldemort, Harry finds himself changed and thrown back into the time of the Marauders and Severus Snape. SSHP COMPLETE
#+end_quote

The first written version of it was amazing and devastating, I loved it. It has since been updated, and I think the ending is happier, but I don't like it as much as before. It's very dark, and also Snarry, just a warning if that's not your type of story.
