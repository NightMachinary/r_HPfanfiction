(the second war i mean)

I would particularly love to find fics with Harry defending survived Snape


** The malfoy case is the only one i've read, and i actually really liked it. Its a bit of malfoy redemption, and im not a fan of malfoy, but i thought it was really well done.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11252584/1/The-Mark][/The Mark/]] by Nargled might not be exactly what you're looking for, but it does focus on the trials following the second war, as well as the corruption that would likely still be present in the Wizarding World. It's a relatively short, two-chapter story. It's also Harry/Hermione, if that makes a difference for you.
