#+begin_quote
  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

**** Great! It was pretty surprising to me how it was an excellent fic with an engaging plot and very well fleshed out characters and character development despite having a cracky premise.

****** Crack is enjoyable, but I don't really like how the characters are inevitably damaged in order to generate humor. Obviously, this is just my opinion(and probably an unpopular one too) and people are free to enjoy whatever they wish.
