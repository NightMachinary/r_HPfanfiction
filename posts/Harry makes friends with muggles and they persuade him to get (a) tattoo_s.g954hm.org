Kids that aren't bad people but aren't exactly model citizens. Rebels, just teenagers and they teach Harry how to really live


** Muggles getting a tattoo for Harry is a big plot point in linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) - even if it's not complete, it's a good read. (At least, if you don't mind a powerful Harry)

**** Define 'muggle wank'.

It does involve a group of muggles that's trying to uncover what's happening in the wizarding world, but for them it's heavily pieced together after being obliviated and stumbling across failsafes that the wizards overlooked. They are also a danger to wizards, but more on the flip side of the normal way it's looked at - by taking wizards by surprise, it's the main/only way in which they're a threat. It's a pretty balanced view of things - but if your threshold for muggle-wank is pretty low, then it might go past it.

It does have a pretty strong subplot of this muggle organization exposing the magical world, and Harry seems to be set on a course of trying to make both worlds integrate in some way - so if those aren't what you're looking for, it's probably not a great idea.

****** It's not 'all wizards bad and poor muggles', I'm not sure why you jumped to that conclusion. The muggle group in question is presented as /very/ bad as well - their tactics are pretty dark, and the lengths to which they go to are not at all put in a good light. (For instance, capturing weak wizards and experimenting on them to find out their capabilities is not presented as a good thing).

Some of it is somewhat explainable (for instance, having your memory wiped by a wizard would be a pretty intrusive thing, if you discovered it again), and the isolation by wizards is also put as a selfish act in some sense (eg, potions and spells that could cure diseases being withheld because of it).

The extent of 'all wizards bad' would be that it looks at some of the ways wizards intrinsically look down upon Muggles, or don't even think about them, and paints that in a bad way - but it's more portrayed as cultural overlooking than anything else.
