** Albus Dumbledore was not happy. After the International Quidditch incident with some idiot's playing at being Death Eaters Hogwarts had lost the the honor of hosting the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

Now it was being held at Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. How the fuck was he supposed to get Harry into the tournament now!?

He had plans for this year, another crucible to remove the slag from Harry. He had no way reasonable way to get the boy to France and it was impossible to blame the boy if he was entered anyways while still being in England.

So intent on his issues he was barely paying attention as he ordered Hagrid to prepare for the trip.

"Hagrid get this cluster of a transportation mess solved would you. We need the 7th years, Flitwick and Sinistra to be at Beauxbatons Academy of Magic by October 30th. I will make my own way there on that night."

Hagrid nodded his great shaggy beard and agreed, heading out of the headmasters office.

Albus waved the whole conversation off leaving organizing the Hogwarts Express to Hagrid.

Hagrid didn't know much about learning or fancy words. He did know animals and that Dumbledore wanted to make an impression.

He made his way into the Forbidden Forest getting ready to get a cluster together.

‐-------------------------------------------------

Flitwick was throughly enjoying the ride. It reminded him of his youth in the tunnels of Urz'Ac fighting off the denizens of the deep dark.

This sentiment was far from shared by the other riders. Hagrid had somehow convinced the Acromantula Colony to consent to carrying the group over to Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.

Flitwick had used a minor charm all young goblins mastered wandlessly fighting in the tunnels. It allowed the giant spiders to easily traverse water ways as land. With the backing of several more decades of power and a wand he easily covered all the acromantula.

Beauxbatons Headmistress had rolled her eyes at the silly ship Igor had brought his students in. She had nearly shut the academy down into war time mode as she saw the gigantic cluster of acromantula swarming towards her school. Until she saw they were being ridden by the students and staff of Hogwarts.

Igor summed up her thoughts quite well.

"What the fuck!"

*** Now I'm picturing Dumbledore hooking a Ferris Wheel basket onto the Whomping Willow's limps, and the Willow just swinging its limbs at increasing velocity.

** I remember reading a story years ago where under the headmasters command one of the towers turn into a flying stone dragon and the selected students climb into it , It justifies the "Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus" . I remember that it was mcgonagall who landed the thing at a very low height to scare the other schools. I think the tournament was in beauxbatons.
