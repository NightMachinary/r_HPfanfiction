** 1) You lost me at useful yet illegal rituals learnt by "gifted" third years.

2) Sounds like typical Hermione fanwank.

3) Nope. What qualifies any of them to be a teacher?

4) Why do they need to be animagi? Been done a million times anyways.

5) Sounds convoluted and contrived

6) What is the timeframe of this where Voldemort is still alive?

7) More Hermione fanwank - magical theory of everything? Really? /really/? Clearly she's the only 'logical' person in the entire series...

*** It's amazing how many writers make Hermione into a researcher and developer who pushes the boundaries of magic, while canonically she was actively averse to non-ministry approved magic (as she said concerning the Prince's book, for example), and didn't invent a thing, at the age when Snape and the Marauders were mastering obscure magic and creating useful, unique items.

But fangirls want their Mary Sue, I suppose. (witness the downvotes)

Just like fics where Harry suddenly masters every kind of magical subject, along with martial arts and usage of firearms in one summer. It's wish-fulfillment. Character development is when, at the end of OotP, Luna talks about her imaginary creatures, and, instead of snubbing her like she did earlier in the book, Hermione acts with some tact and says that it's nice. Though, that might just be because she discovered that invisible creatures, which she doesn't know about (Thestrals), /do/ exist.

No, it doesn't. However, making a relatively smart girl with very limited understanding of magic, and a somewhat close mind, into someone who discovers the secrets of the universe and pwn everything, /is/. Hermione in canon has enough accomplishments, but her close mindedness and by-the-book attitude is a huge part of her character, a flaw which makes her human rather than an R&D machine.

**** Context and circumstances matter. Ministry-approved means that the effects of the spell are actually known, and it means that it won't, say, unexpectedly inflict wounds that only one person in the world knows how to heal. I may have little sympathy for Draco, but as Harry wasn't qualified to determine /what/ the spell actually does without throwing it at people, then, yes, sticking to Ministry guidelines may have been a good idea.

As for who invented what, suppose, very generously, that it takes only 5 times as long to invent a new spell as it does to learn a spell of comparable complexity and effect from a book. If you are having fun, trying to outdo yourself playing pranks on people, or if you are planning to open your own business selling unique products, or if you need to show off in order to get any respect as a mediocre-looking, working-class half-Muggle in Slytherin, inventing spells is certainly worthwhile. If you want to fight for social justice and/or keep your friends alive against Voldemort, focusing on just learning the magic that's already there will probably provide more utility.

I can say the opposite - that being in such an unprecedented situation, would have given Hermione the need to invent new magic to deal with their unique problems. But she didn't. Because she's simply not an inventor, or innovator. As you said, she focuses on social justice rather than the mysteries of the universe, and she uses existing magic to achieve her ends.

It's not about the credentials; it's about the consequences. She knew about Fiendfyre, but also knew that it was too dangerous to use, for example. (Fun fact: there is no canon evidence that /anyone/ can control Fiendfyre.) But, yes, she doesn't like taking unnecessary risks, but she'll still take whatever risks she deems necessary.

Really?

That is partly true. She chose to pursue applications first --- though keep in mind that Muggle scientists have to learn what's already known before they can make a contribution --- but that does not exclude the proverbial mysteries, if there is meaningful motivation in the story. It's the author's job to provide one.

Overall, a hypothetical scientist/inventor!Hermione is a relatively small tweak, IMO, yet it catches significantly more flack than scientist/inventor!Harry, which is almost invariably a HINO. I wonder why...

********* Do I really need to explains all the little details to you? I didn't list things that she could've invented because I have better things to dedicate my time for. Your argument that Hermione couldn't have done that proves my point exactly. No one has full skill before he starts inventing. Inventing, or creating in general, is a drive, and if you really want to do it, you do the research about things you want to invent. Hermione never showed any inclination towards it, despite having so much experience in research. She doesn't have the skill to invent a hat that blocks mental intrusion, prefers aping potion book instructions rather than understand the principles behind them in order to better brew them (a sign of a true innovator and thinker, rather than a blind machine following orders), and doesn't have a skill to invent a machine that performs Arithmancy calculations, whatever the hell OP thinks that is. Yet, so many authors just completely glide over that fact and make her this genius inventor out of nowhere, effectively overpowering an already relatively powerful character.

#+begin_quote

No, no, she literally said "wands aren't stronger than other wands" or something to that effect - something that not only completely disregards Ollivander's skill and advancement of wandcraft, but also shows close mindedness.

This isn't the only example. In PoA, Hermione spent an entire year using a time-turner, yet in one evening, Harry had come to understand (and utilize) time-travel in a way which she didn't understand, and thought mad. If it was up to Hermione to take action, the Dementors would have gotten Harry and Sirius' souls. In DH especially Harry shows both an open-mindedness and an understanding of the nature of magic that profoundly surpasses Hermione's book knowledge, and it is that presence of mind that allows him to perform unique feats, while Hermione could only achieve common, if impressive, ones.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This isn't just a different priority. It's the lack of priority. She shows zero affinity for innovation and closes her mind to things she has not read about, which is a flaw when you want to write a character that is a genius inventor. I also disagree with your last point. It's not hard to write a competent character that still has flaws and isn't legendarily skilled. All you have to do is pair that character with other characters who make up for his flaws. Like Rowling did in canon. But, since so many fanfic authors write as a form of wish-fulfillment, they're averse to create characters who act dependently. That is the essence of Indy!Harry stories, after all. Personally, I'm sick of those Super!Characters.

#+end_quote

If you want to make a case, then yes; my assertion that you were arguing against is that the /challenges/ faced by the adolescent inventors we know about were of a different category from those faced by Hermione --- and theirs could actually be helped by inventing new magic --- which would account for why Hermione focused on learning what's already there. So, I ask, what would a hypothetical adolescent inventor character of the same grade as Twins, Marauders, and/or Snape been able to do in Hermione's place?

I am asking for one good example, maybe two. Your Occlumency Hat example fails because it demands that Hermione learn Legilimency and Occlumency, both considered obscure arts, without an instructor (because she knows of only two, the rest are probably Slytherins and aren't advertising it), then develop an artifact that defends against an attack that originates not from a wand, not from eye contact, but from inside the target's head, which she has no ability to experience first-hand, at least not without a Pensieve and maybe using Legilimency to make Harry relive his worst nightmares (and he would totally go along with that, right?). I don't see any of the others being able to pull that off. If nothing else, consider that neither Dumbledore, nor Snape, nor the Twins (latter three known adolescent inventors) offered anything remotely of the sort.

Oh, and if she invests time in that sort of thing, DA probably wouldn't happen.

#+begin_quote
  Inventing, or creating in general, is a drive, and if you really want to do it, you do the research about things you want to invent.
#+end_quote

Not necessarily. Sure, there are some "artists", but just as often, necessity is the mother of invention. Even if we generously assume that invention of a spell is only 5 times harder than learning from a book, it's still not an efficient use of the time of someone trying to keep everyone around her alive.

#+end_quote

Snape's skills expressed in his HBP book did not come from deep inside his soul --- they must have taken a lot of work and experimentation. Suppose, hypothetically, that Hermione started experimenting with Potions as Snape had, in order to build up this understanding that culminated in the HBP book, in Snape's class, a Gryffindor, and a friend of Harry Potter. What do you think would have happened? Without extensive experience of this sort, following the textbook the first time you brew a certain Potion seems like the only sane thing to do.

Nope. Dumbledore gave Hermione the hint to take them back in time, and some other (then-cryptic) hints about what to do once they got there. Once they did, yes, Harry put together Dumbledore's hints for what to do first, and Hermione was terrified. So, yes, Harry had more courage and nerve than Hermione during PoA, and Hermione couldn't plan as well when tired and under pressure. News at 11.

What unique feats? Voldemort's defeat was luck, convenient properties of wands coming out of nowhere or nearly so, and Dumbledore's Hail Mary planning. Harry got to explore the way Voldemort thinks with Dumbledore in HBP, got to experience wandlore weirdness first-hand, got to see into Voldemort's mind periodically, had access to Hermione's book-knowledge, and he /still/ went to his Death By Voldemort believing that he was just granting his friends a temporary reprieve and eliminating himself as a horcrux. (That was actually a good thing, since otherwise, Sacrificial Protection for defenders of Hogwarts might not have kicked in.)

Just off the top of my head, using an Unbreakable Charm (designed, as far as I can tell, for small containers) to hold an Animagus and keep her from transforming, using a Protean Charm for one-way clandestine one-to-many communication, and the DA parchment Jinx (that Pomfrey could not remove) all seemed like nonstandard uses of magic.

Hermione's mindset is simply not innovative. When Harry shows her a different way to handle a potion ingredient, her first response is "but that's not what the book says".

The series is full of unique feats performed by Harry, and while some were luck, many of them depended on his ability to believe in the impossible, to open his mind to unknown possibilities of desperate actions. I believe that's really one of the most important things to understand about magic, in a world where it can do virtually anything. Here lies Hermione's flaw. She doesn't believe in those possibilities. She's quick to cancel out things that she doesn't know about, whether it's invisible horses or mythical objects. Close mindedness (=lack of understanding of magic) is her biggest flaw, and when authors disregard that, they make her a thousand times more powerful, in my opinion.

Unbreakable charm, Protean charm, and jinxes are not something she invented. She simply applies existing magic, in exactly the sort of way it was meant to be used.

In the end, it all comes down to the fact that Hermione has no interest in invention, and fears experimentation.

No, she doesn't even stop to consider that /Harry/, who barely did well enough to get into the NEWT class (and would not have gotten into it with Snape's standards), who never showed any particular talent for or interest in Potions (for good reason), might have a better method. Something along the lines of "That's not in the instructions" is a nicer way to put it than "You're doing it wrong" (neither of these is an exact quote, but are paraphrases).

This is a mindset of a friend who is trying to be nice, and, frankly, would have been 100% correct if Harry weren't cheating off Snape's notes. If that's not the context, then please supply the actual line so that I could find the context.

An actual quote, finally. However, she wasn't dismissing Ollivander. She was dismissing Xenophilius Lovegood, who was so open-minded, his brains would fall out on a regular basis. Wands being only as powerful as the wizards who use them seems like a sensible rule: an incompatible wand can do worse, but a compatible wand can't do better than the wizard's skill.

So, no actual examples of unique feats due to "open-mindedness"? Also, you were specifically talking about DH; now you've expanded it to the whole series, and still no examples.

#+begin_quote
  I believe that's really one of the most important things to understand about magic, in a world where it can do virtually anything. Here lies Hermione's flaw. She doesn't believe in those possibilities. She's quick to cancel out things that she doesn't know about, whether it's invisible horses or mythical objects.
#+end_quote

Did Hermione dismiss thestrials at some point? IIRC, in OotP, it was Luna who brought them up, and she could actually see them after having witnessed her mother's death.

#+begin_quote
  Close mindedness (=lack of understanding of magic) is her biggest flaw, and when authors disregard that, they make her a thousand times more powerful, in my opinion.
#+end_quote

Perhaps we are using "open/close-mindedness" differently. I don't consider belief without evidence to be "open-minded", and that holds even in a world of magic. So far, your only decent example of alleged closed-mindedness is the Elder Wand question in DH, and even there, Harry had access to evidence that Hermione didn't and hadn't really bothered to convey it to her.

For that matter, one could accuse Harry, Ron, and basically the whole of Hogwarts of close-mindedness for not seeing the problem that Hermione had tried to address with SPEW, however ineffectively. At least she was open-minded enough to see that problem, no?

#+begin_quote
  Unbreakable charm, Protean charm, and jinxes are not something she invented. She simply applies existing magic, in exactly the sort of way it was meant to be used.
#+end_quote

The jinx might have been standard (though Hermione might have put an unexpected twist on it, since Pomfrey would know countermeasures against the standard stuff), but I don't think Protean Charm is normally used for communication.

#+begin_quote
  In the end, it all comes down to the fact that Hermione has no interest in invention, and fears experimentation.
#+end_quote

So far, the case you've made is that she has no time or motivation for invention, and doesn't want her friend to fail Potions.

Really? Would you care to give me some examples of fanon that I had put forth over the course of this discussion?

On the other hand, you seem to take Harry's actual undeniable virtues, talents, and resources (athleticism, courage, indomitable spirit, care for his friends and sometimes enemies, along with the Prophecy, Dumbledore's planning, Hermione's support, magical artifacts given to him, and just plain luck and Hand of Fate) and extrapolate them into some sort of open-mindedness and an amazing insight into the nature of magic; while insisting, despite being provided evidence against it and failing to furnish good evidence for it, that Hermione is uncreative, unable or unwilling to defy authority (even when it's a good idea to do so)... Well, that reads like yet another independent!powerful!critical-thinking!Harry fic. Check your fanon.

I would encourage you to do the same. In your case, I would recommend keeping in mind that it's easy to sink into Harry's perspective and commit what amounts to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error][Fundamental Attribution Error]]: to attribute Harry's successes to his intrinsic talents and virtues while attributing his failures to external circumstances; while doing the opposite for other characters like Dumbledore, Ron, or Hermione. In other words, try to figure out what past experiences (or lack thereof) and what circumstances may have led to Hermione failing where you believe she failed, and which reflect genuine limitations. While you're at it, double-check which of Harry's triumphs are actually due to the above-mentioned actual virtues of his, rather than fanon ones.

The essential part of a plot is conflict, and I'm not seeing the conflict in, say, Harry and Hermione becoming Animagi. It would be difficult, to be sure, but unless someone or something is trying to stop them, or they have internal conflict over whether they're doing the right thing, then...it would be boring. That's what my take on it is, anyway. Sorry if I'm being dumb and not understanding correctly.

The truth is that /any/ idea can be turned into a story.

** The general mistake I see you make in your premises is that Hermione easily disregards authority in them. Yes, you could make her OOC, but if you want to keep it canon, you need catalysts to get her to do something against the Ministry/teachers/written knowledge. So, having said that, heres what I think:

1. Yes to the gifted students. No to her motivating them to learn illegal stuff. If she's dragged into it by someone, ok. But, as I already mentioned, Hermione Granger would never, ever dive into obscure stuff without the help of a Professor. I could see the Weasley twins being the source of chaos here, dragging the brilliant witch into grey areas.

2. meh

3. Done that myself, but stopped after realizing it went nowhere. Maybe a "Slyce of Life"-esque thing, if you want to try it.

4. If you get some truly remarkable "How to become an animagus" magic done, then yes. Simply making it a bonding experience between Harry and Hermione would be just the same ol' circlejerk. But this has been overdone so many times, I wouldn't recommend it.

5. ಠ_ಠ

6. meh

7. Again, like 1, this would be more up the alley of someone like the Weasley twins. Hermione Granger is brilliant, yes, but disgustingly by the book. Her questioning every possible theory on magic is hard to believe, at best. You'd need a catalyst. Either an event or person that opens her up to these possibilities. We know she can do some amazing stuff, like the DA Galleons, but she would need to be motivated to do so. Also she would be godlike with all that knowledge. Knowledge is literally the only limitation to power in the HP universe and having all of it would make her close to omnipotent.

Maybe you could combine 1 and 7 and add some conflict to it. For example, don't use something as abstract as the "Theory of Everything", but maybe make her want to prove to the wizarding society that magical space travel is possible. Then she'd have to deal with ridicule, sabotage and the boundaries of magic. For simplicities sake, cut Voldemort from the entire story and have the purebloods be just traditionalist, reactionary assholes on their own.

#+end_quote

You're right, but it's really not hard to do. Relatively early in the first book, she sets a professor on fire. She is also right there in going after the Stone. In the second book, she deceives a professor so she can get into the Restricted Section so she can learn to secretly brew a potion she shouldn't. In the third book, she misuses a dangerous, restricted magical device (with Dumbledore's wink-and-nod, though does anyone doubt she'd have done it without that?).

The common factor in all these events is to help/save Harry.

Hermione respects and defers to authority figures much more than Harry and Ron, but she's never a slave to them. Give her a good reason, and she'll turn on those same authority figures or rules in a heartbeat.

Except Dumbledore, perhaps. She of all people could have figured out how to contact and write more to Harry after 4th and 5th years. The idea that they could have constant, invisible guards outside his house, but no way to safely communicate with him, was just asinine.

What's particularly noteworthy is that her rejection of rules or authority often turns out to be wrong. The professor she set on fire wasn't a threat. She made a mistake when taking the potion and it turned out to be pointless anyway. Only using the time turner for purposes other than what the Ministry intended worked out well, and that's the one where she got a wink-and-nod from an authority figure who proves to be willing to thumb his own nose at rules and authority figures.

The lesson would seem to be: bucking authority and rules is fine, but make sure it's with for right reasons and be sure you actually know what you're doing. Otherwise, it might be best to stick with them. Hermione has the first (have the right reasons) early on, but takes a while to reach the second (naturally, she's a kid!).

That Hermione and Ron didn't write to Harry is fanon. Rather, what frustrated Harry to no end was that they didn't tell him anything about the Order, Voldemort, and the Ministry.

Sorry, you're right, they did write some, but my criticism still stands - even if muggle post is risky, messages sent by the invisible guards wouldn't be. That's after 5th year, obviously, when Dumbledore stopped worrying Voldemort taking info from Harry's mind. If he could be trusted with the whole prophecy, he could be trusted with whatever little bits of info Ron and Hermione knew.

The fact that Dumbledore forced him into isolation with minimal information from friends after yet another (and even more) traumatic experience, and right after apologizing for making so many mistakes, is incredibly manipulative. It's very, very hard to interpret such behavior in a positive manner.

** 1. As much as RuleMonger!Hermione is bad fanon that needs to die, this needs very careful motivation: why /would/ Hermione be motivated to do that, when there /so much other magic to learn that is right there in the non-restricted part of the library/? linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story) does something along these lines, and provides one possible motivation, which is that there is knowledge that the proverbial old families hoard that gives their children substantial advantages, and Hermione gets together with some Muggleborns to try to have a club to support each other similarly. This may include Dark Arts. Another stems from my own headcanon, which is that actually learning and casting Dark spells is /easy/ --- they practically cast themselves, like Secumstempa --- but using them safely for oneself, which is to say not ending up like Bellatrix or worse, that's hard. Which lines to cross and which lines not to, how far is too far, and how to control the magic without the magic controlling oneself is something best taught by supervised practice, and so families that traditionally practice the Dark Arts (like Blacks and Malfoys) have an advantage there (even if they don't do it perfectly). Mastering Dark Arts in a small group of trustworthy friends may be the next best thing to having a mentor. However, this would require Hermione to become motivated to study violent and destructive magic when there is so much other stuff to learn, which would take something drastic at this early age. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28sdce/looking_for_a_plot_for_a_first_try/cij7rg7][I posted one such scenario a while ago, wherein Hagrid does not survive his stay in Azkaban in CoS, nobody is held accountable, and Hermione decides that parts of magical society need to go...]]

2. And? What's the conflict? What's interesting? linkffn(The Snow Queen by Darklooshkin) has Hermione do something along those lines, but then, she's doing it because she is an increasingly paranoid technomage who has, since her first year, been coerced into being one of the few brave and unfortunate souls who help maintain a charming and whimsical veneer over the Lovecraftian horror that Hogwarts actually is in that AU.

3. Again, and? For that matter, if Voldemort never came back, Hermione might have gone that way, but after Battle of Hogwarts, she has a society to rebuild.

4. How to become an animagus appears, in all evidence, to be public knowledge, and even if it's not, what's the point of a plot device like that? For that matter, the premise has been done many times over, sometimes quite well. (Examples available upon request.) The implicit Ron-bash isn't helpful either.

5. Fics that postulate an arbitrary "magical strength", while not all crap, appear to be harder to make not-crap, for some reason. However, the story could be interesting even without that: if you were evil and had 5-30 seconds of access to the mind of every child in wizarding Britain, able to cast Legilimency, Memory Charms, and False Memory Charms on them, then determine the social environment of their adolescence, how would you use it? How would you pull that off under Dumbledore's nose? It could also be written as a mystery from the point of view of some characters (not necessarily the Trio), who begin to discover that someone's been tampering with their fellow students' minds --- including their own. With some thought, it could be fascinating.

6. I suspect that this one might be one of those fics where it'd be more interesting to see how the character /got this way/ (starting from something recognizable) than it is to read the main plot.

7. Again, and? Solving All the Problems sounds boring. I suggest trying to think about what might go horribly wrong with such a project, and have Hermione deal with that. Consider that some books in Potterverse are actually dangerous to read; or if her indiscriminate reading might give her information that someone important might want to suppress; or consider that if she can actually synthesize the knowledge she takes from the books, she might discover something (Wo)Man Is Not Meant to Know --- and that it's only a matter of time before someone else uses her technique to synthesize that knowledge and abuse it. What will she do?

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
