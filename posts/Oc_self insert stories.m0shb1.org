Hello everyone!

I recently got into HP fanfiction because of a royalroad fiction called: Rebirth in a magical world, and I am looking for more fictions like this one. So in short a original character story based in the Wizarding world, that can be related to Harry Potter but do their own thing. I personally don't like stories that mess with the canon characters too much even if Harry, Hermione, Draco or whatever are totally different from their canon personality.

A few stories that I read or are on my list are: Rebirth in a magical world :absolutely love it;

Rose petal red: really really like it, even if the writer changed canon alot, a bit weird actually because normally I don't like that. Its probably because of the transported to another world MC and the exploration of the magic system;

The alexandra Quick series: I don't know what to think of the series, I read the first book but I find Alexandra a bit of a brat so I don't know if I'll finish it;

What's her name in hufflepuff: A bit split on this one, read it for a bit but not sure if I like it;

The wandsmiths: a fun story that is dropped I believe, I enjoyed it;

I know that my request is quite specific and therefore thanks in advance for any reccomdations :)

  “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?” Dumbledore's voice had finally turned cold. “No, I'm saying you're responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.” “I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly. She sighed. “I just think... maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don't have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.” “You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn't sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done --” “Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.” “You are suggesting that we use Voldemort's first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.

  Interacting with Petunia Dursley is an exercise of patience. Without time served in the Eternal Void, Mari doubts she could manage it. Listening to Petunia describe her---their?---family still tests it.“What about our nephew?”Mari asks only when Petunia breaks for a breath after a long-winded personal essay about how her Duddykins hung the moon. Petunia's gaze shutters and her lips twist as if Mari has interrupted her.“The boy is,” Petunia raises her teacup to her lips, “disturbed.”Mari curls her own hands around her cooling teacup and imagines tossing the Earl Grey into Petunia's face at the blatant dishonesty.“Losing both of your parents would disturb anyone,” Mari comments and raises her teacup for a sip.  That's the tea.

She died without ever telling them my name, leaving them to call me the most common one they thought of and my brother's surname.Mary Riddle.Sister of Tom Riddle, the future Lord Voldemort.Someone who was never meant to exist."I am reborn in this world and I change nothing yet everything.

  “Oh, Ursa.” A hand, decorated with fine bands of silver and entwined gold, caressed her cheek. It was warm. “Your Aunt Walburga and I are having tea. I cannot attend you at all times.”“I don't understand why you just won't let the house-elves take care of her, Druella.” Said Walburga, not unkindly.Her heart seemed to catch in her throat as she stilled. Anna reversed the conversation in her head silently, mulling over the frequent use of certain names as a sick sense of dread welled up over her. Oh no, she thought with the desperation of a dying (dead?) man.The woman rolled her eyes out of sight of Walburga, turning back to the woman with an exasperated stare. “My grandmother hand-raised my mother, and my mother hand-raised me. It's a tradition.”“Your grandmother was a half-blood,” Walburga said airily, but there was a sneer in her voice that would have rattled steel.Oh, fuck, Anna stared up in desolation. Or, alternatively, death isn't final and souls are reduced, reused and recycled.
