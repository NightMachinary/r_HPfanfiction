It's a bit odd, really. Out of the Four "Founder Relics", the Locket seems to be only one with absolutely no magical features whatsoever (except /maybe/ the fact that it opens if you speak Parseltongue, assuming Voldemort didn't add that himself) pre-Horcruxing. The Sword is a Goblin-made weapon that can be summoned by a true Gryffindor, Ravenclaw's Diadem increases the intelligence of those who wear it rightfully, and Hepzibah Smith said the Cup possessed numerous powers (although that was never clarified, they're probably Potions-related, seeing how Rowling initially meant for it to be a cauldron rather than a cup). But the Locket? Just an interesting trinket.

So is there any fanfic that shows the Locket to actually do something? Barring this, what do you think it would do?


** I mean, do we know for sure if the Diadem and the Cup actually do anything? There were legends about them, but we never saw them in action. Honestly, I kind of always assumed they did nothing

*** The Diadem definitely did /something/. Helena Ravenclaw clearly says that when she put it on, her mind erupted in a cacophony of madness. Whether it was malfunctioning, was "keyed" to Rowena's mind and hers only, or rejected an unworthy wearer is unknown, but there was /some/ mind-related magic to it.

We do not have any hard evidence for the Cup, but I think a collector like Smith would have /checked/ if it had magic in it at some point, even if she didn't dare use it. Exactly what it does, I don't know. As I said, it may have had something to do with potions, or, as someone from the wiki suggested, it may have been a prototype of the spell that vanishes food from the Hogwarts kitchen to the Great Hall and back, befitting of Hufflepuff's association with the House-Elves and her reported proficiency with food-related charms.

** I have a story I never finished where the locket granted the wearer the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue, although thinking about it now I think I'd go with making the wearer able to speak and understand /nothing but/ Parseltongue while wearing it.

** I personally don't need it to do something. Slytherin having a locket with a picture of a loved one makes sense on a human level. Think of it like Snape: horrible person, but a complex person with real feelings nonetheless. Or if you want a softer Slytherin, he could be not as horrible as history has painted him and was actually the kind of guy you wouldn't be surprised would have a locket. Or maybe like Snape, he too lost a loved one at a young age. Whichever way you characterize Slytherin, the locket could hold a pensieve memory or just a simple picture of a loved one, etc.

Or it could be as devious as allowing him to disguise carrying around a poison or something else that's deadly or dark. Because who would suspect something dark in an object so innocent and associated with sentimental things?

Also, I think it's appropriate that we don't know much about any magical properties. Slytherin is supposed to be sneaky, so he wouldn't advertise what it could do it it did have special properties.

*** In one verse the Lone Traveller visited, the locket contained a lock of hair from his deceased love. (That version of Salazar ended up returning to Hogwarts with Muggle-repelling and Unplottable Charms, and Tom Riddle became the proud half-blood Defense Professor.)

*** I like the Pensieve idea. But who do you think would this loved one be?

***** I was thinking more a parent, in keeping with how Harry and Voldemort were orphans, but really it could be anyone: spouse, child, relative, best friend.

** The resurrection stone was also passed down through the Slytherin bloodline as a kind of Slytherin signet ring, so maybe that would complete the set? Also, the locket horcrux made that illusion of Harry and Hermione kissing to taunt Ron, so maybe some sort of illusion or boggart-related powers?
