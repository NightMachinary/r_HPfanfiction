Some of this is uber generic alas.

- Fifth year onwards (or whenever they get prefect badges)
- Harry/Hermione
- Lavender becomes prefect over Hermione, Ron is a shitty prefect also. Eventually they lose their badges to Harry/hermione
- Ron is only prefect because of some kind of pureblood bias from Dumbledore (maybe...?)
- Harry mentors a load of firsties, who at one point tell McGonagall that they don't want to be prefects because Ron/Lavender are terrible
- Harry gets nicknamed 'professor potter' or something along those lines because of his mentoring in the common room

Whilst I read it recently, it could come from pretty much anywhere in the last five years. Probably was on FFN, but could have been elsewhere.

I remember it being enjoyable, but I'll be damned if I can find it in my history, favourites or follows.

** If I remember correctly Minerva only heard about the Professor Potter thing because two claw first years were talking in her class and she had used her Animagus form
