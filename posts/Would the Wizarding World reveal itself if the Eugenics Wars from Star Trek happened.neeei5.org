In Star Trek, Spock says that the Eugenics Wars resulted in 'Whole populations being bombed into oblivion'.

Not only that, but it is very likely that if the Wizarding World existed at that time, Khan and his fellow 'supermen' would be wizards as well.

Surely even the Death Eaters wouldn't want to live under the tyrannical grip of a madman who is smarter, stronger, and faster than all of them, yes?

Thoughts?

EDIT The war also canonically took place in the 90s.


** My thought has always been that wizards /started/ the Eugenics Wars, as the war against Voldemort (or another country's battle against blood-purist insurgents) spiraled out of control and shattered the Statute of Secrecy.

EDIT: Also, perhaps the tech in Star Trek doesn't just /seem/ magical.

** If they weren't wizards, it would be even more important to hide, even greater risk of being captured and experimented on. If they are, do they know about the wizarding world? Could wizards still hide if they know the entrances and can find the schools? I cant think of any scenario where wizards would choose to reveal themselves though. Wizards existence relies on hiding until technology reaches the level where what wizards can do is no longer seen as covetable.

** "Surely even the Death Eaters wouldn't want to live under the tyrannical grip of a madman who is smarter, stronger, and faster than all of them, yes?"

You can say that, but the Death Eaters basically haven't lived like that since they got the Black Mark?

I mean, Voldemort is not only faster, stronger and smarter than them: he is also a sadistic psychopath with delusions of grandeur, a tendency to megalomania, absolutely hypocritical - frankly, the son of a Muggle with an almost abortion discriminating born - muggle? - who distributes Crucios around as if they were sweets.

The Death Eaters are technically slaves marked as cattle, forced to suffer as Voldemort wishes and without being able to do anything against it. I am not defending them, because the only Eater I like is Regulus - the rest, including Snape, can burn in hell for all I care - but just saying that they are already more or less in that situation.

I think that of everyone on the "Dark Side" of the wizarding world, the only ones who would not like that would be Voldemort himself and his most fanatical servants, like Crouch Jr. and Bellatrix.

** I'm sure more people would find out magicals exist but I doubt they would deliberately out themselves. Some would no doubt die in the crossfire though. There isn't much information where the wars took place iirc.

That episode from voyager with Sarah Silverman took place in the 90s and the war wasn't mentioned at all, you'd think 30m deaths would be worth a comment.

I'd like to know how late 60s early 70s humanity managed to created genetic supermen, it sounds like temporal war enemy action that wasn't fixed.

THAT was an alternate universe caused by Captain Braxton being stranded.

** I recently read a TNG-era "immortal master of death" fic where governments tried to grab wizards during the Eugenics Wars (and successfully grabbed harry temporarily) and so the wizards were like "... nope!" and took one of the generation ships and settled their own planet and still hide from the federation.

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.
