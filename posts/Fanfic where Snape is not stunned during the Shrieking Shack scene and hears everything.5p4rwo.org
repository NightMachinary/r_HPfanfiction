This came up in a thread on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] and I really want to see if this exists.


** If you re-read the scene, snape comes in when the door mysteriously opens when he's under the invisibility cloak. He hears everything but chooses to ignore it because he hates Black and Lupin.

  And that's assuming Dumbledore isn't a conniving manipulative SOB primarily interested at this point in keeping Harry away from his godfather. My reading of canon suggests otherwise.
#+end_quote

lol

the reasoning used in this fic. is wonky. at no point that we're supposed to believe snape is in the shack did remus even mention that peter's animagus was a rat, or that he was scabbers. if snape thought remus was helping sirius, why would he bring him wolfsbane, which would make him into a conscious werewolf aid to a murderer? or, you know, he just rushed off. he only heard that they became animagi, and that's how sirius got into the castle- which would convince him even more that he was right

#+begin_quote
  And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along.‚Äù
#+end_quote

is what he heard. he also obviously assumed that they're lying to manipulate the trio. 'my friend is a rat who framed me for murder' is pretty easy to dismiss

*** There's this fan fiction I've read, I'll see if I can find it, where it addresses that.

*** If anything, I would see Snape being more angry at Black because they shouldn't have switched secret keepers in the first place.

With Fudge, the only thing that might change is the prophet starting to dislike Dumbledore early on if Dumbledore decided to say that Black is innocent. Snape would likely end up siding with him, which could lead to problems with Malfoy, ect.

*** But if Snape wasn't working against Black, Lupin, and Potter, do you still think that Pettigrew would have escaped? Lupin transformed, Black ran after Lupin, leaving three children alone to deal with the traitor. If there had been another adult there to take charge of the situation, they all may have made it back to the castle...

*** Um, the life debt was canon. Sirius deliberately trying to kill Snape is strongly implied, but not certain, I think. (I believe Snape already suspected Remus, so he should have known better than to fall for it.) But pureblood politics in general is mostly fanon. Dumbledore covered up the incident because it would have gotten Remus (who was innocent) expelled or worse, not because he favored Sirius.

Snape wanted Sirius dead because Sirius tried to kill him, and he thought Sirius was the traitor. Snape also tried to kill Remus, with premeditation, by leaving the Wolfsbane Potion at the castle. He doesn't like Remus in general, but I suspect his immediate motive was seeing the Marauder's Map and thinking Remus and Sirius were colluding.

If Snape had been restrained and still conscious, he would have seen Pettigrew alive and heard a plausible story about switching Secret Keepers. Snape hated Sirius so much that he might well have believed Pettigrew over him, or he might have gone after all three of them.

Fudge does believe in Dumbledore, but only when it's politically expedient. Snape probably couldn't convince him that Sirius was innocent if he wanted to, but he probably could have made breaking Sirius out easier.

** well not exactly what you're looking for but linkffn(run that by me again?) chapter 1 does have the characters look at Sirius' attempted murder attempt from a different angle, with hilarious (and a particularly smug Snape) results.

  Ever wonder 'Why don't they just do that' "A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic." Harry and Hermione, however, were raised in the muggle world and are therefore fully capable of thinking things through...A collection of of one-shots
