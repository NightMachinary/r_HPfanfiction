** I know I've seen fics where the Quibbler's articles look different when read upside-down, and are actually hard-hitting journalism. In one of my fics, I had the Quibbler full of thinly-veiled political commentary and satire, at least prior to Pandora Lovegood's death, but that was just mentioned once and not plot-relevant.
