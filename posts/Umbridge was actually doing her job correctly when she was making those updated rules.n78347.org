** Harry is actually cracking under pressure as a celebrity child. His prolonged potions abuse makes him paranoid that Voldemort's after him (even though he's been dead for fourteen years). Dumbledore is old and senile. Fudge knows that Voldemort can't be back since he double-checked that his body was in his grave once Harry started telling all those stories.

Umbridge is there to put a stop to senseless fearmongering spread by the two. She has Harry write lines indeed, but Harry decides he needs more attention so he starts carving those lines with a knife on the back of his hand.
