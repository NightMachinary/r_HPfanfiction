I have seen a lot of fanfics that say that mention that muggleborns can't go back to the muggle world because they lack muggle education after age eleven. To which I say hogwash! transfigure the Hogwarts records into the muggle version and Bobs your uncle onto University/trade school/etc. If that doesn't work there is always the confoundus charm. Why on earth should a Hogwarts education hold them back?


** I guess it depends on which field they persue. Because their knowledge would be seriously lacking. Take Math related subjects for instance. I think Arthimancy was the closest to Maths and students like Harry that didn't take it only got primary school muggle education. They'd have to catch up or act as a phony ig. But at least they should have mastered writing formally with all the essays they had to do lol.

***** High school sciences are not difficult, apart from the last two years, school is more about getting social skills than education. Besides there are plenty of institutes which offer coaching for entrance exams of college for students who take a gap year, and I know many people who do it. Besides if someone choose to enter STEM after hogwarts, I assume they have high intellect and can do it.

** Also, there's nothing saying that a student can't /also/ get a muggle education. I mean really, if you boil down the course for a regular grade 6 class, it could be done in a few months during the summer. It would absolutely SUCK for the kid, but with rewards of doing magic in the house or going to footy/quidditch matches with the family to keep the kids motivation, it could be done. It would get harder later, of course, and after like 3rd year they'd have to take muggle books to Hogwarts with them and send back assignments, but it could still be done. Honestly this is what Hermione should have been doing rather than trying to take all the Hogwarts classes. There's a LOT of extra time at Hogwarts.

Neverminding the money aspect, Dean's character doesn't lend itself to this kind of extra work, sine he was always goofing off with the other Gryfs. I could see Dean drawing a lot and building a portfolio in order to get into a reputable art school after Hogwarts though. Imagine the advantage magic would give an artist in pure speed. Wave your wand and your art is colored. Wave your wand and your art is copied however many times. Wave your wand and your art is unstealable, uncopiable.

Local councils also put on English and Maths classes for adults to help them get GCSEs in those subjects, and for parents to enable them to help their children with homework.

I did Physics at university (2007), and while almost everyone had done calculus at sixth form, it wasn't assumed, and there were two tiers of maths class at the beginning of first year, which there was an entrance test for. If you got less than half marks, you went to the lower tier class with more contact hours and support. Even the upper tier class went over all the maths from A-level.

Additionally, I changed my subjects half way through my AS year (sixth year) and had to catch up with maths through self-study while also taking the classes for the second half of the course. It was work, but not impossible at all.

Whether their high school didn't have calculus or they just didn't take it, I imagine a lot of them felt like they were behind when they got to college, because I know *I* felt that way. A Hogwarts student almost certainly doesn't have the option of learning any calculus there, and may even learn minimal trigonometry or algebra. We don't know. But their first exposure to calculus will be in college, where they will likely feel that they are behind, especially when they see people their age or younger blowing through Cal 1 like it's nothing because they became familiar with it in high school.

It's not unknown or impossible for motivated students that were well prepared high schoolers to finish a degree in 3 years, but there's a culture of dragging it out for 4 years to have a kick-ass thesis/graduation project/more internship opportunities.

******** This is fair, but frankly, it's also more speculation. What you're saying makes sense. Maybe the goblins do spend time to make sure their money is enchanted to prohibit tampering, or at least imbue the galleon with properties that are hard to replicate to avoid counterfeiting.

But going all the way back to the beginning of this discussion, that only works for goblins and particularly well-informed magical people. (When was the last time you knew how to check for a counterfeit bill beyond looking at it in the light?) Since what you're committing is illegal, or will at least piss off the goblins anyways, just trade with other magicals and let them get in trouble with the goblins.

Or, since you've already obtained real gold from regular people, just use that as trade for other stuff. Gold can't be transfigured without a philosopher's stone, and the goblins use it as their most valuable coin material so it's not like you'd have problems bartering with it.

** I see two main issues with this. First is the competence part - Hogwarts does not compare to a Muggle education in most respects. No science, no non-magical history, no (normal) mathematics from what we can tell, no languages, etc.

So transferring over fake qualifications won't necessarily be enough on its own - there'd be a very limited amount of possible fields that wouldn't require the muggleborn to have to re-study on.

The second issue is legal - I don't think we know what type of magic is or isn't legal to do on muggles. It's possible that for a non-governmental agent, it's not legal to confundus charm muggles like that or to transfigure the records. If that's the case, it's obviously a problem.

** Aside from getting in, which /can/ be solved (albeit unethically) via magic, the primary problem is lacking the basic knowledge to understand the thing you want to learn.

That said, universities generally offer remedial courses in even very basic topics, so as long as you can read and write in /some/ language and know basic arithmetic, you just will have to put in some extra work and stuff... the cost is in the extra time and tuition to catch up.

On the other hand, at least in my state (of the USA), there are mechanisms by which adults who don't have their educational credentials can take classes and earn the equivalent of a HS degree, which, depending on the precise structure of your local educational system, might be a cheaper way of getting the knowledge you need without having to resort to magical trickery.

Also, once you're into the late 2000s at latest, even if you're not submitting these apps online, there are going to be electronic records of everything, so... you might end up with serious problems down the line (like, an investigation might result in people concluding that you drugged/blackmailed/bribed admissions officers).

** Aside from the legal, moral and educational issues already mentioned, the main issue for this to be much harder than a simple transfiguration or confundus is the simple logistics of it all.

I've not been in the school system in a long time, but I'm /fairly/ certain that you can't just get into a university by just showing up with your records/certificates/diplomas and get a place in that school. In the UK, getting into university, at least straight from school/college, has at least [[https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/what-and-where-study/ucas-undergraduate-entry-requirements][these entry requirements]].

If you're coming from Hogwarts then, you'd need to be able to fill most of these requirements to get a placement, many of which can't be fixed with some spell work to make it go away.

In addition to this, it's almost a certainty that all these records will be computerised these days. Suffice it to say /that/ can not be worked around with spell work, unless you're prepared to go to extra-ordinary lengths otherwise (by which time, if you're willing to put that much effort, you might as well just put in the work and just get into higher education legitimately).

For example, if you are opting for an Engineering degree Math and Science basics is a must and I'm pretty you are not getting that from Hogwarts. Even if you have magic in your side it would not be easy to aquire the knowledge that takes years of school education to achieve. Then again it would be easier to cheat during exams with magic and you could top the ranks but it would be pretty meaningless in the long run unless you plan to keep conning your way up.

** I always assumed it was less lack of ability to make it happen and more wizards and witches. Stand out. Heavily. They've become used to an ingrained sense of ability. Sure not everyone would be helpless but I think that many people don't go back bevause the magical world keeps them busy. Plus the whole masquerade and statute means they are afraid of being killed. Probably rightly so. Magical wars would be devastating.

** Kingsley could infilterate the Prime Minister's office. U know... PM likes him LOL

Muggles are just muggles. I don't think anyone except warewolf would seriously think they should live in muggle areas, but if someone is determined, sure they can.

Besides, Wizards live at least twice longer than muggles. They can slowly learn 'Basic Knowledges' while confounding/,obliviating muggles.

** I like the fics that explain or show that Hogwarts education still covers math and writing, it just incorporates them into the magical curriculum. In the UK that works perfectly because you don't really need the classes like you do in the US, you just need to be able to pass the qualification exams, and anyone can take those at any point in their life.

So as long as a Hogwarts student can study for and pass their GSCEs/SQCs and A-Levels, they don't need a Muggle school transcript at all.

That said, I don't think a Hogwarts education includes computers at all (given electronics aren't supposed to work there without protective charms), so a Muggleborn with no computer experience may be at a significant disadvantage in some job fields.

** Once you start using your "education", it would become blindingly obvious that it's fake. They wouldn't be able to prove its fakeness if you were thorough, but that doesn't matter if you strut about with the academic knowledge of a fifth grader at a job that requires college-level expertise.

** Yeah, you can technically get to the university, but you're lacking 7 years of education, it's not so easy to catch up. Maybe you'd be able to live in a muggle world as a janitor or a cop, but unless you'll spent another (about) 7 years doing middle&high school, you can forget about good universities.

** Because it would. Maybe in the present it wouldn't matter as much with the Internet, but in the canon timeline? How much did you know about math/science/whatever at 10/11? They'd have to keep using charms to trick the teachers, study extremely hard (with the use of spells or potions) and/or eventually get kicked out.

** Imagine you have metastatic lung cancer. You confund the doctors into believing you're healthy, and transfigure your medical records to agree. You'll still die, because destroying the evidence of a thing doesn't undo the problems the thing causes. Destroying the evidence that you're not qualified for university doesn't make you qualified for university. It just means it'll be more of a surprise to university administrators when you inevitably fail.

** The answer, I thought, would be quite obvious.

You can forge or fake qualifications and lie on your job interview (by both muggle and magical means) but then...

you have to put your money where your mouth is, don't you? Be it a doctor, engineer, teacher, administrator, pilot, lawyer, businessman/woman, or the other 1000+ vocations not listed here.

You have to actually perform the real job that you faked the qualifications for.

Just how many people would you use the Confundus Charm / Obliviation Charm on and how many times? You as a fellow employee/co-worker/or what have would have to interact with these people on a daily/regular basis. Say it's a small place where you work with just 5 people including the boss. At what point would you forget whom you have Confounded/Obliviated of what and when and what concocted story you replaced it with?

Can you keep your story straight after the 100th time? Times 5 people?

​

In conclusion:

Bob is not your uncle.
