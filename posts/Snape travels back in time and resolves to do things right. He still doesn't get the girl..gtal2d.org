  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

** Time travel but with intrigue; "They didnt know we were seeds" by Lucy_Luna.

It's still ongoing, so I haven't caught up to the newer chapters, but it was pretty good from what I remember. There is brief snily but it doesnt work out. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10394319/chapters/22952862]]

*** YES! Was gonna rec this since Snily was there briefly but the relationship didn't work out, which is one of the reasons that this fic is unique. Usually, these fics have Snape & Lily get together, but this one doesn't.\\

  'I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody--?' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all?'
