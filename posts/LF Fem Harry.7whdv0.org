For years I have avoided Fem Harry stories at all cost. However I think there might be few good ones I am missing out. So help me out and suggest the best you know. However they must fit few rules:

- Must not be only for the sake of romance where writer wishes to avoid slash. I've seen some and in my biased view that's 99% the case for the gender change.
- Must not be simple pronoun change and canon rehash with few girly lines added here and there. I really want to see a story where Harry being born a girl actually has an impact on the story and choices made by both Harriette and others around her.
- Must be interesting and worthwhile read and not just something to compound feminism for the sake of it.
- No unrealistic silly names for Harry's female character. After all they named Harry "Harry".

Any good suggestions? Thanks!

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

*** Thanks for suggestions. However I it seems all 3 stories (at cursory glance) are some bizarre AU where a lot more is twisted / changed than just Harry's gender. They seem to read more like completely OC rather than female Harry due to changed world and circumstances. Correct me if I am wrong ...

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** linkffn(11637611) has a Cassandra Evans as the main character. It is cracky as hell, but hilarious to read once you get through the first 6 or 7 characters where the fic is rather dark with isolation and short, but overexaggerated Dursley abuse. Basically, Cassandra kills the troll and that scares Hermione off and some time passes before Susan Bones becomes her friend (and later lover).

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
