I started it once but never finished it. Wonderingnif anyone here knew it and if it was worth my time to try to finish it.


** Not worth it. The author always writes Harry as a completely unhinged lunatic.

If you are looking for H/Susan fics, check out Forgotten Contract by James Spookie, or some of old-crow's fics (think he has 2 or 3 Harry/Susan fics).

  OoTP Alternate Story Line. Susan Bones has many questions for one of her class mates, and some of these questions lead to a proposition that very well may shake the future of the wizarding world. Read to follow a story in which Harry has some fateful romantic times, and how they will effect his decisions. Mostly Canon! HarryXSusan no slash, no major character bashing.

  - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.

*** I'm reading forgotten contract for like the 5th time right now. And while old crows fics are good he tends to gloss over the romance imo. Not even a paragraph about Harry's feelings after his first kiss with susan in one fic and another treated their first time as a scene in a movie or tv show with the pan out and everything

**** Yea, romance is hard as heck to write. I have hints of H/Susan in my fic, but it is like a paragraph in between chapters full of fighting.

I stand by my opinion of Not Only Redhead though. Harry is constantly SCREAMING AT EVERYONE, threatening people, acting as entitled as a girl from "My Super Sweet Sixteen", and (worst part) everyone applauds him for it because he's Harry Potter and he's /sooo/ grown up and assertive.

***** I dont remember that. What turned me off to it originally I think and I might be confusing it with another fic but the flamels were from another planet or had created another planet or something.
