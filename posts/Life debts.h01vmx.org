Correct me if i'm wrong, but didn't snape owed james potter a life debt? But if snape told voldemort part of the prophecy that led him to attack godric hollows and causing james potter's death is that not a violation of the life debt?


** A 'violation of a life debt' isn't really a thing in canon. The term 'life debt' isn't in the books, this quote by Dumbledore is the only evidence that it's a meaningful concept:

#+begin_quote
  "Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates a certain bond between them... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter... This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry."
#+end_quote

So saving someone's life creates some sort of bond, but it's vague and undefined. It's not clear if there's any actual consequences other than an emotional effect, feeling indebted toward someone.

*** this is what happened to wormtail in book 7 -

“You're going to kill me?” Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. “After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!”

The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He wrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Wormtail's mouth. He saw the ratlike man's small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness.

“And we'll have that,” whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail's wand from his other hand.

Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew's pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid from Harry's face to something else. His own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat.

“No --“

Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes.

So I guess it's still kind of unclear. One of JKR's habitual throw away lines that aren't really intended for deep study.

**** It's funny how we have a different understanding of the same scene.

For me, Pettigrew had a moment of weakness when trying to strangle Harry (because he was the son of one of his best friends and saved his life), and the potential effect of the life debt end there.

For the rest of the scene, I always thought (and still do) that Voldemort left on curse on the hand, to kill Pettigrew if he ever betrayed him again since he told him "/May your loyalty never wever again, Wormtail/." when he it to him.

** u/MeatyTreaty:
#+begin_quote
  a violation of the life debt?
#+end_quote

Then James or his estate can hire a lawyer and go to court with the claim that Snape defaulted on his debt and sue for damages. Or do you somehow believe there are some invisible fairies out there keeping detailed scores on everyone, track the points everyone accrues and score them of like this is some kind of computer game with a rigid value matrix for every possible action?

  Different Ending to HBP. Harry's leaving school but doesn't want Ron and Hermione to come with him. Find out why. Rating it T just to be safe. Will probably be a oneshot. Not a Ha/Hr. Slight amount of what might be considered bashing.

** Though Snape warned Dumbledore beforehand. That move alone could have mitigated the damage. I think that move by Snape is the reason why nothing bad happened to him. Cannon there is no clear cut example of what a life debt can do. I'm willing to see life debts be just a formality to them being tough on the debtor.
