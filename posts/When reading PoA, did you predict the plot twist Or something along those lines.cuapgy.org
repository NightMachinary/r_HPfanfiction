When reading the book I pretty much thought Sirius would be possessed by Voldemort and yeah, another war would begin. I did NOT expect it would get much, much crazier than that and I was happy Voldemort didn't come back until Goblet of Fire (speaking of, did anyone predict Barty Crouch Jr being alive and all...THAT?)


** Yeah, I had guessed Sirius was innocent 'cause I had guessed he was the dog. By then I'd realized classroom scenes were always significant and they'd learned about animagi. I hadn't guessed Peter, though. I thought Lupin would be the culprit. He was the DADA professor and so nice and helpful, so I was convinced he was a murderer.

*** That book just bothered me, because the adults are useless in the name of protecting innocence.

Then Rowling has fudge do straight up summary execution.

** With PoA yes, I saw that coming. But I was already 20 when I first read it and just know from a story telling standpoint that the story was too straightforward with who the bad guy was, especially when we consider that JK aways has a surprise reveal at the end (Quirrell instead of Snape, Ginny instead of Draco). I did not see the Barty Moody thing coming, which is why GoF is my favorite book of the 7.

** I was 14 when I read the book. So, yes. I guessed the plot twist.

Still my favourite HP book.

** Ugh, how I wish I could go back and read all of these books for the first time again!

I can't quite remember but I don't think I saw that coming with Sirius. I know I didn't expect the Grim being Sirius thing.

I did take Divination way too seriously and would try to decipher hidden messages in everything that was said during those classes. Turns out I only needed to pay attention to the finals, ha.

** Depends on which twist. You've got several that tie together - Sirius is innocent, Sirius isn't after Harry at all, Peter was never really the innocent background character but the true traitor, Remus is a werewolf, the map was created by Harry's dad and friends (because its convenient basically), the traitor was with them the whole time right beside Harry, etc., etc.

Hell, even the part about Harry's dad saving him was actually himself from the future was a twist if you want. Personally, I had read a lot of mystery novels prior to the HP series (Encyclopedia Brown is a good example). After the bait-and-switch of Snape, Malfoy and Hagrid in the first two, I suspected that the seemingly likely suspects were not guilty at all (this is pretty much a recurring theme for Snape actually in the whole series). So most of them I had guessed. To be fair though, I knew something was up with Remus, but didn't think he was a werewolf (part of me wondered if Sirius was a werewolf with the dog, but with the animagus stuff being brought up I figured not).

To be fair though, I was still pretty young. By the time DH came out, I could guess pretty much every twist (except for author fiat like Harry suddenly saying Voldemort after months for no reason) based mostly on Rowling's style and thematic tropes (ex. all the founder's objects are stored/recovered in a way relating to the element of the house, trio will break into the three most heavily guarded locations in Britain, Regulus Black because why else would he be mentioned?).

** I did guess Remus Lupin was a werewolf in the book.

His name was kinda obvious.

** My mom would always read the books before me. I asked her if the digit it says Scabbers was missing in the first book was on the front or back paw, and she was way too obvious about not answering the question. Then she reread the first book to find what I was talking about, because she had forgotten.

** It's been 20 years since I first read PoA, so it's hard to say for certain. There's actually quite a few twists (though perhaps revelations is the proper word)

1) Lupin being a werewolf 2) Hermione timetravelling to get to her classes 3A) Scabbers being Wormtail 3B) Sirius being innocent

I'm sure I realized something was up since nothing is ever straight forward, but beyond that, I have no idea.
