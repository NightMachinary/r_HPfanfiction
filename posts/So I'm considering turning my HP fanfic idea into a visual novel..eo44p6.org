** I'd say download Ren'Py and experiment with it. You could pick it up really easily, then end up with a lot more content than you originally thought possible. I went to make a scene I thought would last a short time and got carried away. Dialogue is really easy to add and you can even have presets, like HarryHappy instead of adding each character pic individually.

** I would love to see a visual novel as I find it hard to picture what happens in stories.
