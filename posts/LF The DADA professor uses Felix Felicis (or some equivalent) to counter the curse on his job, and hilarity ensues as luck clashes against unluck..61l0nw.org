** What if the curse isnt directly manipulating luck, but rather has a more sideways of doing things?

The curse sees that lockhart has too much confidence in his own ability to lie and obliviate his way out of trouble. It first tries to kill lockhart by manipulating subtle things at first. Increasing his arrogance just a tad, helping him to beleive his own lies, even if its only subtly. As time goes on, the curse is able to more directly affect poor gilderoy and he starts to notice that people don't like him nearly as much as they normally would.

He tries the usual tricks in his employ to fix it. A minor wordless befuddlement jinx here, a cunfounding hex there. He also employs all of his hard earned people talent and skills to try to win the hearts of the kids over. His future book sales rely on it, and more importantly, his future reputation. If he can win the kids he knows he will be set for life.

Unfortunately, the curse is as subtle as voldemort was in his beginnings, and just as devious. It doesn't even need to out him as a liar to force him from the school. Just a hint of his memory rewriting prowess in a school full of impressionable kids will ruin him utterly and completely.

So, the curse is patient, and continues to hamper his attempts at magic that he is sure he could have acconplished before. It continues to force his words to continue the thoughts he has, even though he knows that saying he once had a cure for werewolfism and botched obliviate into making it unrecoverable is actually a way to make all sorts of bad press. He manages to keep the repercussions of that mistake from being felt too hard, but it takes much more effort than he had expected in a school full of children.

His final straw, the one that caused him to seriously consider that there was an active malevolent curse was when the chamber was opened. Well, not the chamber specifically, but when all the staff literally expect him to go sacrifice himself, after his unfortunate displays over the past semesters, well. He had to leave.

But the curse isnt happy that it was unable to ruin him completely. It wanted death by lynchmob, not this, getting away. After all those efforts to make lockhart say something to get himself caught, and despite its half successes, gilderoy just wasnt stupid enough do it. Not one single obliviation was sent the entire school year.

So the curse went for petty revenge instead. And after a gentle nudge of an easily guided mind, it sends Harry and Ron after him. There is a basilisk loose in the school, after all. Accidents were known to be rather fatal around basilisks after all. Even though the curse couldnt ruin gilderoy like it wanted, it was still petty enough to just kill him.

However, gilderoy knew what the monster was. It took him an embarrasingly longer time to figure it out than he would like to admit, even to himself, but he did figure it out eventually. And, regardless of what his year of teaching may have led everyone to beleive, gilderoy was not a complete fool. It was time to leave before more than the staff would rather he died than stick around the school.

Just as gilderoy was almost finished packing he was embarrasingly beaten by two second years, in the same manner he had often used to steal stories of other heroes. Thankfully, being a famous and rich, if not powerful wizard allowed him to have certain contacts. Contacts that could get him special potions for less than their regular prices even if it was under shady circumstances. He never left his room without a bottle of felix on his person, especially after the werewolf incident. It takes a special type of wizard to kill a werewolf, and gilderoy had made that mistake only once.

Fooling the children into thinking him a complete coward, hemanaged to drink the potion while the children were both staring at the doorway to the chamber of secrets. It was incredibly lucky that he did too. Not just minutes after he drank it, there was a cave in that left the hildren split, and he managed to dodge it completely on sheer luck alone.

It was this luck that let him be on the safe side of the conflict while only the potter boy was on ths side with the basilisk. It was a shame about the weasley girl, but honestly, there was nothing he could do about it. He wasnt a real hero after all. So when he found out that the potter boy had killed the basilisk with a sword of all things, he honestly had a moment of doubt about just how powerfull his potion really was. Normally he had to work hard to silence all the potential witnesses after someone did something worth stealing, but here. By merlin, here, was a situation just perfect for the taking. A basilisk, and he only had to steal a wand from a child.

In his last moments he would admit, even if only to himself, that he probably was a bit too confident in himself. He could almost obliviate people wandlessly, and was not at all worried about using someone elses wand, even if it didnt like him. He hadnt realised just how big of a crutch the weasley boy had been under, and just thought that the spellotape was a style thing. He honestly never considered that somebody would be so ignorant as to use an actual broken wand, their very literal only way of using magic, of being special. Nobody was that stupid or arrogant.

Of course, thw fact that his cheap brand of felix felicis had run out, but the confidence that it gave didn't also run out probably helped him along in his doom. In the end, all the curse had to do to completely remove gilderoy from his own memory was to alter the memory charm to be more powerful and destructive than a subtle liar like gilderoy would ever try to use.

** But what if it's just "luck?" So instead of exceptionallying good luck, they get exceptionally terrible luck?

** Well, abusing good luck could land them in a position that they would rather not be the defense teacher. For example Hubert Nomeson wins a large lottery and decides to quit teaching early and go off on a world's tour. This could happen, but in the hp books we only see the bad luck that the DA teachers receive, I'd guess that there has to be some good reasons before then or the job would have dried up earlier than it did.
