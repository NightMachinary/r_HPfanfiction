** I believe ffn did an update recently that prevented its APIs from working with third party websites...don't quote me on that though.

** Apparently you did, yeah. FFNet recently changed a big thing in how their servers work (not sure entirely what it is - I am not a techhead) but it's thrown off a lot of the downloaders. The local FicBot (ran by our very own Tusing) can still access the site to get its pop-up thingies, so it's possible to get around it - I think it'll just take time for the people who run the various bots and downloaders and such to update them to get around the new protections.

If you do a sub search for stuff around this, there were a bunch of posts a couple weeks ago (I think?) that talked about what happened in more detail, if you want specifics/technical details.
