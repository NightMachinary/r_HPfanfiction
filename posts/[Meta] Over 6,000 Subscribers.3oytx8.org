I've been watching the subscriber count tick up recently, and we've finally made it to the first milestone since I've been here.

Especially as many other areas of the fandom have been declining in more recent times, I'm quite impressed to see the growth in this subreddit that's occurred, even in the relatively short time I've been subscribed.


** Woohoo 6k! Soon we'll be over 9000!

** Since there's already a meta post here about the subreddit, I'd like to point out that CatholicGuy stirred up some shit with the Hogwarts denizens ([[/r/harrypotter]] and the house subs) which resulted in KemistreeKat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3o8gi3/to_the_harry_potter_community/][being removed as mod]] and followed it up with posting screenshots and links to the private staff subs. As far as I can see, most of the users are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3p04d3/head_of_house_ama_series_im_catholicguy/cw1y7la?context=3][against the Headmaster]], and Kat hasn't been on in almost a week. So again, I must bring up my post from before: What bullshit was CG trying to pull with this sub when he suddenly dropped Kat on us out of the blue?

And to [[/u/kemistreekat]], if she comes back any time soon, I'm sorry you're having trouble with one of your internet homes. Seeing as you're no longer following CG's agenda, I'm personally more than happy to welcome you here. My problem was always with CG sticking his nose in places where he needn't have bothered, not with you personally.

*** Let's keep the ugliness out of here. It's been hashed and rehashed. Blame lies on all sides. It doesn't have anything to do with [[/r/HPfanfiction]] moving forward. We have two other capable mods that I'm sure are on top of what's going on with the presence/absence of the third. Like [[/u/mirgaine_life]] (Hufflepuff Head) said, "Please remain calm. Things have blown up beyond what is appropriate."

*** Unfortunately she's still a mod here. I'm still salty that someone who knows nothing about fanfiction was appointed mod and I always will be.
