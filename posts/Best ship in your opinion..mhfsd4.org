I have a taste for Haphne, Harry/Fleur and Drapple.


** I think that the ship is mostly irrelevant. What matters is quality of the plot and quality of the writing. There are good Hinny stories, good Harmony stories, there is at least one good Haphne story, there are plenty good Huna stories. And yes there are crappy ones as well for all these ships.

*** I agree with this. All ships will have awful fics, but there will definitely be good ones too. There are some ships I'm not drawn to for writing or reading, but that doesn't mean others can't like them or write them well.

*** Having said that, there are minor relationships I would like to see explored, but I have never got a good one:

- Ron/Lavender post-poisoning. I have hinted to it at linkao3(20141410) (and basically explained, what I think could be interesting on it), it is somehow suggested (but not much developed) in linkao3(568303), but I have never read it written well and full-length (but perhaps, it is not meant to be the main relationship of the story).
- I am always hungry for good Petunia stories with good redemption arcs, and that certainly includes some good Petunia/wizard stories. I am so sorry [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]] hasn't written another episode after linkao3(13682133), which kind of seems to end in the middle of the story. I would love to see some continuation to linkffn(12551744). Yes, there are plenty of Petunia/Severus stories but most of them are either horrible, unfinished, or time-travelled to the Marauder's Era, which could be good (e.g., linkao3(23090008)), but it usually walks away from the redemption/forgiveness story, because it is not needed.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

** As people said before, any ship can be interesting as long as it is well developed, and it's not like there is a "perfect ship" that can automatically makes a fic interesting.

But when it comes to a favourite ship, I have always been interesting by Harry/Daphne. As a "pureblood of Slytherin" and a blank slate, Daphne gives a lot of possibility to make an interesting story : Star Crossed Lover, that one good Slytherin, or even that traitorous lover . . . Sadly, most story just use that some bland "Ice Queen of Slytherin" persona.

Recently, I have also been pretty interested by Tracey Davis. She is even less developed than Daphne (which is already an exploit in itself) and is technically not canon since she only appears in Rowling notes, but fanon seem to agree to make her a Half Blood in Slytherin. I like the idea of "Chosen One Harry" being with some normal, unassuming girl whose only flaw is to be in the same House than the Magical Nazis.\\
Sadly, the character is almost exclusively used as a +1 for Daphne (ever as the loyal best friend, or girl that comes in package when in relationship) and it's almost impossible to find a fic with only her pairing.

** I like to see the "underdeveloped" ships realize their potential. Let me see Millicent Bulstrode or Pansy Parkinson with Harry Potter, or see Lavender Brown or Pansy Parkinson with Hermione Granger. It gives all the wonderful "enemies to friends to lovers" aspects of Snape and Draco ships with none of the irredeemably horrible person problems of actually shipping Snape or Draco, and your fic would be one of tens instead of one of thousands.

I also have a soft spot for ships involving Padma Patil, Susan Bones, and, uh... older women. The age gap when you ship Harry with Nymphadora, Narcissa, Bellatrix, or Amelia can soothe an angry spot in my psyche. Ditto Hermione with Andromeda or Narcissa.

Bonus points to whoever writes a Harry/Walburga crackfic.

** I adore Cedric/Cho. I would also have liked to see Harry/Cho if they hadn't broken it off.\\
Tomarry/Harrymort: a lot of potential given their Horcrux bond.\\
Lav/Parvati: Loved their dynamic in canon.

I also find myself increasingly intrigued by Padma/Ron. They might not have lasted, but it would've been cool to see.

But there isn't a /best/ ship, just favourites. These are ones I feel would work well together, and enjoy reading. Ships like Haphne aren't really my cup of tea, but a good writer can make them work even though the characters never meet in canon.
