I am looking for fics that don't involve Hogwarts much if at all. Fics where Harry is the focus but he takes a different path. Other options could include:

- Going to a different wizarding school in Britain.
- Going to Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, Illvermorny, or some other school in some other place/country.
- Being schooled in private by the DoM, or Flamels, or some mysterious person.
- Perhaps being self-taught, perhaps on the run, or hiding from those who might use him.
- Perhaps withdrawn, secretive, and with power or memories that make teaching/learning semi-pointless.

*Note*: I am NOT looking for fics that exclusively show Harry pre-Hogwarts or post-Hogwarts, but fics where he does not attend.

--------------

I would prefer fics WITH romance and WITH more mature subjects (violence, smut, dark subjects are fine). However no main-character or main-romance slash please.

PS: please don't recommend Emperor (I swear every request thread I make somehow that gets recommended).

Thanks all!


** So, there's The Boy Who Lived by The Santi, where Harry goes to Durmstrang after one year at Hogwarts. There's Gabriel, which is a wonderful fic showing what Harry would be like if someone took him away from the Dursleys to another country.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

*** Escape to Darkness has been a story I have passed over for some time because it seemed short for its premise and I was concerned it was abandoned or lacking content. Is it complete and worth checking out?

I read the Irish choice a while ago but it was lacking in other areas (romance for example), and I got a bit bored with it.
