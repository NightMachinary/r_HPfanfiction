Something like "back to the future" or "steins gate" where the protagonist actually makes worst the future because he/she messed with the timelines and has to fix it.


** The only one I can think of is "The Cursed Child", where its main plot was basically ripped off from "Back to the Future Part 2".

I personally would like to read a fic in which the time traveler successfully murdered Tom Riddle, only to find out Grindelwald and Nazis won upon their return.

** Walking Across Time linkffn(3266523) isn't exactly "making it worse" but it reminded me of Okabe in S;G a bit.

** Sort of a spoiler but the sequel to backwards with purpose is like this, but you can't really read that without having read the original first.

  Semi-sequel to "In the Words of Ginevra Molly Potter." Voldemort was dead, all was well, but the real enemy had yet to reveal himself. Time-Travel Story.
