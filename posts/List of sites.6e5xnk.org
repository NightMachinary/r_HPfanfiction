I know about fanfiction.net, HPfanfictionarchive, and ao3, but with all the sites going down recently I have decided that I need to make an archive of my own, does anyone have a list of sites which are still up, or an archive of a site which is no more? I would love to know, at the very least so that there can be multiple archives of these sites around.
