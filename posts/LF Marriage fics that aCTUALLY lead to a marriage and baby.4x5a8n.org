Hi. So I've read a few marriage contract stories, but hardly any actually wind up producing a marriage, let alone a baby, which, presumably, is the whole point of the law. This happening while the kids are in school is fine, but it would be better and a bit more unusual to find a story where the law is enacted post-Hogwarts. Is there anything like it? Don't care about pairings, but I do prefer a Harry-centric fic. Thanks!


** Well this one's still in progress. But it isn't bad if you don't mind a few cliches. Its probably one of his only pieces I like though. linkffn(10649604)

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

** linkffn(9415372) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9415372/1/Beltane-Child][Beltane Child]] - A different order as in baby first, than marriage. Maybe what you're looking for. Harry/Daphne. Theres some Ron and Ginny bashing in this though.

  Harry needs some time to let his guard down in the war. So he goes to a celebration just before he, Ron and Hermione plan to get Hufflepuff's Cup from Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. Who could have guessed what the consequences would be?

I do like Beltane Child, though. Exactly how Harry would react to a pregnancy, I think.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** I sort of assumed most of them did. Huh. I'm wishing I had remembered which ones I scanned to discern all the tropes. The one I penned ended up with three babies: Hermione and Draco's, Severus and Ginny's, and Ron and Blaise's---because I sort of thought that was one of the supposed points of the trope, pregnancy, and because I figure you gotta go all in if you are going to write about something that in fanfic gets to be so ridiculous. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11765450/1/All-s-Well-That-Ends-Well]])

**** Well, mine was a response to a crack challenge, but I like tidiness, so resolutions abound. It may be a satisfying premise for some, but it's really not a functional life, and the volumes of chapters to make it so are going to leave a lot of folks abandoning work, I guess.

  Pansy and Justin must marry. What shall become of them and their friends? Will Harry stop looking for Horcruxes? What does Ginny see in Severus? Is Hermione okay? Will Ron stay with his beloved? Four-fifths of these questions shall be answered for you, dear reader, in the only Marriage Law story I will ever compose. Written for the TLX Forum Marriage Law challenge.
