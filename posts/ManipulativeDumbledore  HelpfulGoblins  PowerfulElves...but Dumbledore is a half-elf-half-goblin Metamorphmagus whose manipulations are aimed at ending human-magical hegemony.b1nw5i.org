I think this train of thought started off as 'Manipulative!Dumbledore is taking such a soft stance against Death Eaters /because/ he wants Magical Britain to collapse from war' (because Statute of Secrecy or magical creatures or whatever) and evolved to 'Dumbledore isn't just gay, he's also a xenophile with the hots for magical creatures' and ended up somewhere around here.

(The strange thing is that I could see it working as a serious fic; the most celebrated wizard in Britain (if not internationally) has been hiding his true nature and subtly sabotaging the wizarding world the whole time. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142024/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorting-Hat-s-Gift][AntaresTheEighthPleiade did something with properly evil Dumbledore once,]], though I haven't read it for ages.)


** This is WAAAY too cracky not do be a prompt. I love it.

*** Well, let's see what comes to mind.

"Dorey", a half-elf-half-goblin born when, well, a goblin got a bit frisky with a house-elf.\\
Possessing the immense magical power of a house-elf but lacking their innate servility, he grew to question his servitude to the 'We Worship The Ground The Protagonist Walks On' Clan; eventually discovering his Metamorphmagus abilities, he ended up fleeing Gringotts, setting out into the world with what 'borrowed' gold he could find.\\
Ignoring several wizards and witches who offered to bond him, Dorey went through several bookshops and (metaphorically) (metaphormagus?) devoured them, and in doing so, he learned about how magical humans granted themselves authority over all other sapient beings, and that he would never be able to rise to a position of power due to his race, despite the strength of his magic.\\
Vowing to bring down the humans, Dorey hit upon a plan; by twisting the house-elven 'servant that appears to be just part of the background' power into the Metamorphmagus 'being that appears as anything he wants', he would steal the identity of one of the human magicals, gain power by any means necessary in his false persona, and trick the wizarding world into destroying itself, allowing the other magical races (and himself, in his true form) to rise!\\
With good fortune, Dorey soon happened upon a suitable candidate for identity theft; the recently deceased Albus Dumbledore, slain along with his sister Ariana by Grindelwald; Dorey assumed the form of Albus Dumbledore, modified Aberforth's memory to forget the truth...and the rest is history...

**** Damm. I'd actually read a fic like this. Awesome. I liked the "(metaphorically) (metaphormagus?)" btw, made me chuckle.

***** What could a Metaphormagus do, anyway? A mage with the power of metaphors...would they be incredibly powerful and versatile shapeshifters, becoming a whirlwind that tears through their foes, a lion on the battlefield, or hiding as the thorn in one's side, or maybe measure someone's loyalties with a moral compass...?

Or, perhaps they'd just be able to disentangle all the metaphors that prophecies use and provide a direct translation/explanation. Which would be quite useful in itself, really.

** Since my goblins are already anthropomorphmaguses (yeah, I made that one up: I like it better than metamorphmagus) this could actually be a thing in my AU....

It also involves the fall of the Ministry (and the Statute). So yeah, I might not have Dumbledore himself be this, as I have other plans for him, but consider me prompted. :D
