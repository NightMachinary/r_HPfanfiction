Hi everybody! I was reading a marauder era fic in which Remus realizes, while still at Hogwarts, that finding a job will be complicated for him. With it, I got the idea that if James and Sirius (or maybe an OC friend) created a company of some sort that Remus could participate or run somehow, it would solve his future employment issues. I mean, if you are self employed, lycantrheopy-induced lost days don't really matter. Clearly, there would be some secrecy issues for marketing reasons (some people probably wouldn't want to buy or hire werewolf made/provided things/services because of fear or bigotry)

Any fics where that actually happens??


** The only Marauder's ere fic I can think of that had Remus's future employment mentioned is, I think, Stepping Back. Remus had been instrumental in saving Narcissa's life and Lord Black rewarded him with a guaranteed foot in the door in whatever profession he chose once out of school. And a lifetime supply of Wolfsbane.

In a more general sense, if there's an epilogue and everyone loves, Sirius and Remus (and sometimes Harry) starting a business is fairly common. Harry McGonagall has them start a Quidditch supply company with Back to the Future style hoverboards.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
