** I've always thought that it's not literally love in the case of Lily, but more so a demonstration of love that caused some obscure weird magic to take place about the magic of how human life is astounding and how she's willing to sacrifice herself over something so precious as a life and so on - it was just coincidence it was powered by love. Or, as I prefer to see it, Dumbledore is just saying it to Harry to explain complicated magic in simple terms. I've always liked the idea that it was partly because Voldemort broke his promise to Snape over something as sacred and precious as life and so it backfired on him. That begs the question of why it didn't ricochet of Lily though, and not Harry.

*** Here's sort of how I figure it happened.

1) Voldemort makes an agreement with Snape to spare Lily (or at least offer her to stand aside)

2) Voldemort tells Lily to step aside, and she repeatedly tells him to take her instead of Harry.

3) Voldemort finally decides to kill her, therefore creating some kind of bullshit magical agreement powered by Lily's sacrifice, that he took her life in exchange for not killing Harry.

4) This magic is so powerful it reflects the Killing Curse and burns Quirrell to a crisp when Voldemort is possessing him, but is nullified once he has Harry's blood in his veins. Instead of burning Voldemort's new body, for some reason. Also it doesn't protect him from anyone working on Voldemort's orders, like Pettigrew or the Basilisk, or Quirrell's jinx in first year even though he was being possessed.

5) Voldemort then does the /same exact thing/ at the end of the series by giving Harry a deal: come quietly and we won't continue attacking the school. He did, Voldemort killed him, creating another sacrificial magical contract, then Voldemort turns around and goes to continue attacking Hogwarts. Apparently being spread across multiple people weakens it because while Voldemort could no longer hit anyone with a spell they apparently weren't reflected back to him like the Killing Curse was.

***** There was one fic- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor) that goes through with the whole "power of love" theory and it actually works. Granted it's a smut-comedy (set during DH) but the short of it is that Harry is exceptionally powerful when it comes to "loved-based magic," so when he finds a book detailing love magic and rituals he's able to use it to find all the Horcruxes and ends up using the rituals to make himself and his friends more powerful. It's also hilarious. One scene has Harry pushing his "love magic" into one of Bellatrix's pressure-points to make her orgasm until she passes out because he didn't know what else to do.

***** It would actually not take a whole lot of changes:

1.  Harry, after his mother's protection just obliterated Voldemort, is also immune against random shards of Voldemort's soul attaching themselves to him.

2.  Hagrid casually mentions coming from Hogwarts or an Order safehouse rather than the destroyed House.

3.  One of the teachers actually figures out the Basilisk but their rescue plan fails while weaking Riddle

4.  Dumbledore himself goes back through time to ensure the capture of Pettigrew (wait invisible behind a tree, stun him while everyone else is distracted). Sirius is cleared.

5.  Crouch Jr does not impersonate Moody but someone who is not under Dumbledore's nose 24/7, like his own father.

6.  If Harry is not living with Sirius by now, hr is going to after Voldemort used his blood.

7.  Harry is told about the prophecy so that he does understand what is going on. If you still want the DoM, have Harry actually check but fail to verify that Sirius is safe similar to what happens in Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass.

8.  If Harry has to have occlumency lessons, find another teacher. Anyone other than Snape would be better since the fanon term "mind rape" does quite accurately describe what Snape was doing rather than actually teaching any related theory.

9.  Romilda Vane gets thrown out of Hogwarts for the love potion attempt. Actually, just outright ban them and make using them akin to an Unforgivable Curse.

10. Better provisions during the Horcrux hunt. Stocking up on canned food isn't difficult and definitely better than dubious mushrooms. Just stay away from military grade emergency spam.

11. Voldemort loses most of his forces in the initial charge because he insisted on an uphill frontal assault on a fortified hilltop surrounded by hundreds of yards of open ground. Only he and a few diehard Death Eaters like Rookwood/Dolohov and the Lestranges make it to the walls, but cause the canonical casualties there. Voldemort is eventually overwhelmed and, due to the Hogwarts wards, cannot escape and is defeated by the combined Order/DA/volunteers after a bloody last stand.

** To your second point about Lily: Neither James no Lily had their wands available. They thought they were save, they trusted Wormtail without doubt and were surprised by Voldemort. No Accio without wand, and I'm pretty sure you need a wand to apparate - at least when you're young and inexperienced. Don't forget that Lily and James while brillant were only about three years out of school and while they fought against Death Eaters they didn't have any training beside that. They weren't Aurors, they weren't specially trained soldiers. They were just two 21 year olds who were in hiding for about a year. So they just had about two years of fighting experience.

To the sacrifice - I always had the theory that it had something to do with Snape (not intentionally, mind you). Snape obsessionally loved Lily - Voldemort didn't understand that but he did sometimes favours to his most loyal servants. So Voldemort had the intend to keep Lily Potter alive. We know magic is in many cases intent. Lily Potter offered her own live for Harry. Voldemort took her live and so (unintentionally) accepted the bargain. When he tried to kill Harry he broke the bargain and Magic intervened. So in the end Harry was protected by love - Snapes weird love for Lily and Lilys motherly love for her son. And Voldemort didn't get it because he didn't understand love.

** I think you may be misinterpreting what Dumbledore's saying here. The important bit lies in one of the lines you cut out.

#+begin_quote
  "... and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), *you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become on of Voldemort's followers!*"

  "Of course I haven't!" said Harry indignantly. "He killed my mum and dad!"

  "You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!" said Dumbledore loudly. "The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's!"
#+end_quote

I don't think what Dumbledore is saying is that love in and of itself is a magical protection.The "protection" he refers to here is the ability to resist temptations put forth by people like Voldemort. In short--he is "protected" from the temptation of the Dark Arts by his love for others. This is the power that Voldemort "knows not", because he doesn't understand love.

#+begin_quote
  "But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?"

  "Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort doesn't understand, it is love."
#+end_quote

As such, he cannot understand what could motivate someone to sacrifice themselves for someone else. Just as he couldn't understand why Lily would sacrifice herself, he couldn't understand that targeting Lily would cause Snape to betray him or that the Malfoys would betray him for their son.

Lily's sacrifice was motivated by her love for Harry, but it was the sacrifice, not her love itself, that saved him.

#+begin_quote
  "You would be *protected by an ancient magic of which he knows*, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated - to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of *the fact that your mother died to save you*. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day."
#+end_quote

Dumbledore even explains here that Lily's protection was directly a product of her sacrifice. It was not simply her love, it was an ancient form of magic that she (presumably unknowingly) used to protect him.

** Look, the thing is that the love of Lily Potter worked, because she had the real option of stepping aside, Voldemort was really going to let her live because Snape, the guy who told him about this threat to him asked, and he thought it was fair payment.

So she /chose/ to sacrifice herself, it wasn't just the act of loving her son that did it, but the act of through that love /choosing/ to sacrifice herself for him.

The same thing when Harry /chooses/ out of the /love/ he had for his friends, to sacrifice himself, without knowing he would come back. That's why when he did it everyone got magical protection(you will remember that Voldemort's and the Death Eater's spells started to not work properly).

So yes, at least in HP magic, /love/ when acted upon, is a pretty powerful kind of magic, since the protection made by Harry was no-selling Unforgivables.

** Now, I know this is going to sound Corny but please bear it with me.

When Dumbledore said love, he didn't mean that love is a power or force. By love, he meant it as a supplement.

Voldemort can't feel love. That means that he would never put himself in a situation where he would choose to put his life in a bargain. This sounds good doesn't it? Now to put it in real life, take an example of someone whom you know. Not necessarily close to you, but someone whom you have known for a long time. If his/her life were to be in danger, and you chose to do nothing, even if you could have saved the person, then that would of course mean that you secured your life. However, for the rest of your life, there in the dark corner of your consciousness, there would always be the dreadful thought that you could have done something but didn't do it. It would haunt you till you die, and if you opened up to someone, that would be more disastrous.

For Harry, love was something his childhood lacked. Love was NOT something that would help him kill Voldemort but something that would not let him rest until he killed Voldemort.

Remember the prophecy, one must die at the hand of the other, because neither can live while the other survives. If you understand it word by word, you will find out the main difference is due to the the words "live" and "survive". From what I understand, this didn't mean that they couldn't Co exist. This, simply put, meant that Harry would always be in a constant danger, not able to live his life fullest, while Voldemort survived, lived but barely as a shade. Harry wouldn't live his life the fullest as he knew that until Voldemort died, none of those he loved would be safe.

As for why love couldn't save others, it was due to the prophecy. I know Dumbledore said that it was simply a prediction and wouldn't have taken place if Snape or Voldemort or other people hadn't acted as they did, but it was clear in the prophecy that If Voldemort attacked either Neville or Harry, then he would mark him(Harry) as his equal, who could vanquish him. However was love powerful, it was the Prophecy that saved Harry that day. Love was all but a supporting force in it. If Harry had been attacked by Lucius Malfoy or someone, then he would have died.

So, simply put while Love was a supporting pillar that night, it was the prophecy that saved Harry.

As to why not use a broom, I figured out that Voldemort would not have taken a chance if Voldemort escaped, and would have used anti apparation and anti portkey wards, as well as brought Death Eaters with him, and I remember him and a select few of his having the excellent ability to fly without a broom.

** I don't think Dumbledore was talking about love being magic, though. I think he was talking about how Harry's ability to love gave him the power to do what he needed to do in order to protect the ones he loved.

** Come on! It's a series that started out as a children's story. If you want to use your imagination and make it fit within the universe, just assume that it was the sacrifice or whatever. Magic works like bending nature to your will if you want something hard enough. Some things come easier such as lighting up your wand or making feathers levitate but others, such as wanting your broom then and there, requires a more intense desire. Also something such as wanting to protect your child from the most powerful Dark Lord require an even greater desire, you need to show nature that you are willing to trade your life (even when you don't want to) for the object or your protection.

Edit: also Voldemort did not actively seek to kill either James or Lily, nor the Weasleys (in fact he valued their blood purity). They were all collateral victims.

** It wasn't simply love that saved Harry. It was an act of self sacrifice out of love. In addition to that, she gave her life protecting him from a specific person, a protection that remained exclusively against the person she was trying to protect him from in the first place.

In Ariana and Fred's case, no one died for them. For Remus and Tonks, only one of them could have been saved in this manner, and even then that protection would've only protected one of them from a single death eater when they were surrounded by death eaters.

When it comes to James, he wanted to protect Lily /and/ Harry (as opposed to Lily, who gave her life for Harry, and Harry alone). This type of magic might not be able to extend to multiple people... or it might just be a case of the circumstances not being exactly perfect.

Overall, for something this powerful, I'd assume a lot of pieces would have to fall perfectly into place. It is, in my opinion, a combination of love and luck. Everything from Lily's focus being solely on protecting Harry, verbally asking to give her life, and actually dying to protect him from the person who posed (and would continue to pose) the greatest danger to him all made it possible for that protection to come into place. So it doesn't make sense imo to ask why this hasn't occurred more often. It's more like they were incredibly lucky to have it happen at all.

** I'm reading linkffn(13452914) Loose Canon. It expands on 'The power of love' as light magic, the opposite of dark magic that uses negative emotions like hate to power it. The Patronus is the most common example, but more than that is harder to harness.

Really good and fun fic. Regular updates.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** I find it extremely telling how smart JKR constructed the love argument whenever I read the fics where Harry goes crazy or "old soldier" on everything. The exact point of his love "power" being that even when he suffered again and again and again he never fell that low and kept fighting for what is right not for revenge. The ridiculous ammount of presence this fantasy has just comes to show exactly how exceptional Harry is for not wanting to murder or torture everyone who hurt him.

** You really went through all this trouble to denounce a 'loophole' in HP and expose the 'idiocy' of Dumbledore and JKR when the fault lies with you for misinterpreting what actually happened huh.

** Guns aren't weapons. I'm so tired of people saying guns are weapons!

People with guns die all the time. If guns are such good weapons, how is it people keep getting killed?

If one person hit a bulls-eye from far away and nobody else ever has, why would anyone think it could be hit with a gun?

You wanting to throw up isn't an argument against Dumbledore's conclusions. The unknown success/failure rate of love magic isn't an argument against Dumbledore's conclusions. The unknown capacity/power level of love magic in the various Potters isn't an argument against Dumbledore's conclusions.

An infant survived a confrontation with a powerful dark lord. That infant grew up to defeat that powerful dark lord. Dumbledore is the best-informed magician in the story, and he says it was because of the power of love.

He could be wrong, but he's working with a lot more and detailed information than you are.

** Outside of Harry Potter, magic cast at the time of death, especially if murdered, is considered some of the strongest, that can last generations. Sacrificial magic is also considered right up there. Combine those two things with Voldemort's broken vow to Snape, and it's a perfect storm.

None of the other situations were, as far as we can tell, at the point of death with one sacrificing themselves for the other.

At least that's my take, and explains why the ‚Äúblood wards‚Äù were necessary. Lily's sacrifice was a kind of blood magic.

** I agree with you completely. Love is great and can be a powerful motivating force, but winning by the power of love has always bothered me.

Canonically I choose to explain it as Lily and Harry being given the choice to live and specifically chose to die to protect others. If Bellatrix had told Tonks that if she stepped aside to let them kill Remus then she would be spared due to her Black blood and Tonks did not, then she would have willingly sacrificed herself to protect Remus and Remus would have some protection. Obviously that never happened, but that's how I choose to explain it to myself.
