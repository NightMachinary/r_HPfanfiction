I need new HP/GW fics to read, and would like your suggestions! To be perfectly honest, HP/NT works too. I prefer ones that either don't focus on the war with Voldemort or have them meet after the war's finished. Thanks in advance!


** You may have read these already but these are the ones I have on hand....

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7630045/1/A-Set-Up-Gone-Wrong][A set up gone wrong]] This story has Harry and Ginny not meet until after the war because Harry never went to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7768541/1/A-Cannon-s-Harpy][A Cannon's Harpy]] Similar premise but focused more around quidditch as Harry is a pro player.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5231591/1/The-Hog-s-Head][The Hog's Head]] This one is a continuation of the end of Deathly Hallows before the Epilogue. And it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5826999/1/Ginny-s-House][Ginny's House]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6704664/1/Reuniting][Reuniting]] has Ginny leave Britain for a while and shows the relationship when she gets back.

And obviously if you like HP/GW then you need to read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]].

I have a few more that are set during the war if you are interested and a few HP/NT stories set during the war too.

**** Just a quick list to give you here...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1208839/hermyd][Hermyd]] Has a fair few HP/GW stories that are worth reading.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1251524/kb0][kb0]] Also has a few well written HP/GW

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders][The Return of the Marauders]] is a story set during the war that has Harry arriving at Hogwarts during his 6th(?) year or something like that after being raised by Lily and Sirius.

** Pretty much everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9537818/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nameless-Man][Nameless Man]] is after Voldemort, though the rest aren't. He has more on the siye site.

I don't want to just repeat FMLGrantC so... not too many. If you don't mind the ones preVoldemort kicking it I have a lot more.

** This one's but a wee one-shot. Still, if you're in the mood for some concentrated Harry/Ginny feels, you might like it:
