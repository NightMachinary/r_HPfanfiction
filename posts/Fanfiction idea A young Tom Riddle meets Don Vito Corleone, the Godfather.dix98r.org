I just had a weird thought on how would it turn out when a young Tom Riddle would meet the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone in the cold streets of New York (Frankly, they can meet anywhere).

Also, I'm going with the headcanon that Tom Hagen went to Ilvermorny while being funded by the Don. He graduated and went on to study American Magical and Non-magical law so he could repay the Don for his kindness. Also, he and Sonny definitely would exchange letters.

I wonder how the reaction would be when two Tons, both wizards know of the other. My take, the Don would definitely be amused.
