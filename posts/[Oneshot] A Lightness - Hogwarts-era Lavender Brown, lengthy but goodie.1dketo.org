*** Great stories are also often ones that know how long they should be - sometimes, they're better short, even if it leaves us wanting more. You should check out her other stories!

**** I totally agree re: good stories knowing how long they should be. However, for some reason, I like my fanfiction to be director's cut style... Where there are scenes that might be cut from a published version, but that teach you about the character. I don't mind them being long and exhaustive, because that's exactly why I'm reading... to spend more time in a world I love. Y'know?

***** Oh, I totally get that! I'd roll around in a good headcanon forever. After I'm done with one of my novels (very nearly there!), I'm posting all the deleted scenes in a separate short story collection so it doesn't detract from the main story, especially since the bulk of them are considerably silly :P It's not for everyone though; I'd imagine a lot of authors prefer being more stringent about the quality of the writing they publish.
