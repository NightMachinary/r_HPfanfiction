Anyone who read 'I See The Moon' by hctiB-notsoB linkffn(8212843) know of any fics similar to it? I love the way Harry is characterised in it.

  Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers."

** It is not exactly the same concept, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11513440/1/But-If-You-Close-Your-Eyes][But If You Close Your Eyes]] by MerciaLachesis might be something you'll like. It is also a series called The Under the Moon series which starts off with a chronological series of one shots or two shots that eventually turns into a multi chaptered fic. The series is different from â€˜I See The Moon' in term of story telling and theme, but it still feels like a Luna fic to me. A kind of darker Luna, but still Luna. linkffn(11513440)

This one is a crossover series with the MCU' verse where the story is centered around Luna Lovegood. I absolutely adore the writing. It's like looking at a painting except with words.

  "But Loki decided that only the other moon was really worth mentioning." Luna sees too little(none at all) and then too much. Loki needs a hug. But if you close your eyes (does it almost feel like nothing's changed at all? PART ONE of the Under the Moon Series.
