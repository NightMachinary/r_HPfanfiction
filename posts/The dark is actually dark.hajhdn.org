Kind of specific, but I see so many fics where Harry goes dark but it's actually the light or it's neutral magic or whatever. I want a fic where it's actually dark, evil, violent, whatever, whether Harry realizes it or not. Thanks!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

********** Short answer: Time Travel.

My memory's a bit fuzzy, but If you want MASSIVE YEAR 3 SPOILERS:

Basically:

We only learn this much later, but Harry and Jim(that's his brother) were kissed by a dementor on the train. Fudge was sacked because the BWL got kissed, James completely lost his mind after learning that his two sons had died and Peter (who is a death eater, but nobody besides other DE know that), as the Potters Family Seneschal and James Proxy on the Wizengamot, took control of the Potters votes and fortune. Lily couldn't do shit about it because she's a muggleborn.

Peter then formed an alliance with Dark families (understand DE who claimed they were Imperiused) and elected one of them (Corban Yaxley if I remember right) as Minister of Magic. They started passing laws against those of inferior blood and dark creatures and long story short - life sucks if you' re muggleborn or half-blood.

In this timeline, Hermione got really close with Fred but with Harry and Jim kissed, Blaise having being killed in the summer, Theo having killed himself four months into the school year because he had no friends left and was hated by everyone thanks to the Ultimate Sanction + life being very hard for muggleborns + Pansy being after her because she was seriously injured by Buckbeak, Hermione is planning on leaving the country before it's too late.

Then, one day, two Unspeakables come to school and tell her that, basically, they predicted that the way things are going, 1) Voldemort is going to come back, expose them to muggles and there'll be a war or 2) There's going to be a Dementor Apocalypse (Dementors struck with a deal with a previoius Minister: there has to be a minimum member of people in Azkaban for them to stay there and the Ministry has 3 months to fix the problem every time the number of people is not enough. If they can't provide, the deal is broken and Dementors become free to leave Azkaban and roam the land. Voldemort doesn't know this and and would likely cause the Dementor Apocalypse once he came back by freeing the Death Eaters in Azkaban. The Minister that the Dark families elected, Yaxley, doesn't know this either) .

Time turner don't exist in POS but there's the Cryptohedron. Every time some event that will cause destruction and great loss of life is about to happen, it activates and chooses someone to send back in time to prevent it from happening and the Unspeakables vote on whether or not they'll allow it. It chose Hermione and the Unspeakables voted Yes in majority so they come to Hogwarts and bring the Cryptohedron with them so that Hermione can use it.

Once she goes back in time, she goes with Blaise in the summer and saves his life. On the train, she brings Neville (who learned the Patronus the previous year) to Harry and Jim. He drives off the dementor and boom, crisis averted. They don't get kissed, Fudge stays minister, James doesn't become a vegetable and peter doesn't form his DE alliance.

Hermione is the only one remembering the moments she had with Fred and so decides not to try to get the relationship back since the circumstances that led to it were... well, you get it... and now, as of the lastest chapters, the story is heavily leaning towards Harry/Hermione. No, seriously, there's so much moments between them, if they don't end up together, I'm going to blow my top. This would be an outrage.

AAAAAND that's it.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
