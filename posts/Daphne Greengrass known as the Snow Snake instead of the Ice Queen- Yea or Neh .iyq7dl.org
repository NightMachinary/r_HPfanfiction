Wondering people's thoughts on making Daphne Greengrass be known as the Snow Snake instead of the (in my opinion alone) overused Ice Queen. Even more so when I saw that "/In American folklore, the snow snake is a fearsome critter that, unlike other reptiles, can live in cold temperatures and is only active during winter months." (wiki)/ So I am wondering what readers think of the name. Thanks!


** I personally don't like it, just because the sibilance makes it softer and less punchy. I think it'd be a good pet name in haphne fics tho(my favourite)

** The alliteration makes Snow Snake seem more approachable, which is counter to the intended goal. Besides, that's just begging for the portmanteau Snoke, and I really doubt you want the readers to snicker about backstory whenever it appears.

** I mean, it's a good reference for coining a nickname, even if it is American, but my main point is that the moment I read it, my brain went "Heh. Snow Snek." and you'll have to be prepared for some people doing that as well. :D

Otherwise, it depends on what 'effect' you're going for with this. Are you wanting her to still be her fanon-canon Ice Queen persona? Do you want the name to reflect that in a respectful way, or be mocking?

** As an European, I didn't know there was any folklore about a "Snow Snake". So my first reaction was :

- Snakes are cold blooded
- A snake in the snow would stay still and be a bit useless
- . . . Perfect nickname for canon Daphne (not a nice one though)

** I'd rather people create their own interpretations of characters like Daphne. It feels like focusing on the tree and missing the forest when you say that the nickname a character has in fandom is overused and needs to change, but not the personality trope that created that nickname in the first place.

** Guess it doesn't matter, since I close out of any fic that gives her a dumb nickname.

** Honestly I think it could be a good pet name for Harry to give her (or whoever you pair her with). I do like it however, but I also like the Ice Queen of Slytherin.
