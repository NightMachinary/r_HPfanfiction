I have looked a few times, but i can't seem to find any (decent) fics that use [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejQDwjP_LVU][This]] scene as a launch for Harry/Hermione shipping.

Can anyone recommend any fics that begin a relationship between the pair at this point?

*** Harry and Draco aren't gay in the books and yet that doesn't stop people, does it?

Saying something doesn't happen in the books is grounds for it not being in fanfiction is asinine.

**** No, I'm not saying it should discourage people, I'm saying most people who write fanfiction have read the books and often prioritize them over movie canon.

**** You asked for stories that used the Harry/Hermione dance scene from the movies as the launching point for fanfiction. Except that scene wasn't in the books, and fanfiction in general follows book canon over movie canon. So we don't have many (if any) stories that use that scene as the launching point of their stories.

(And if you prefer the movies to the books, I hate you on principle alone.)

I know a couple of smut oneshots that use the tent scene, but that's all. There are many of those, and it gets quite repetitive. I do remember a fanfic that appeared to start with a Ron/Ginny sex scene in the tent, but they were actually revealed to be Harry and Hermione polyjuiced in the end i.e. Harry fucking Ginny's body and Hermione fucking Ron's, but technically fucking each other. Can't find it though.

Oh, and while I don't like Harry/Hermione, I do infact ship Riddle!Harry/Riddle!Hermione. The Locket Horcrux's versions of them were together in canon too. I kinda wish to read a story in which the real Harry and Hermione are replaced by their demonic counterparts, but I don't think it exists. Does it?
