Dumbledore shouldn't pick favourites, but he loves Harry more than any of his students and considers him family.

So no, he wasn't manipulating events to test his young protégé, in fact he was horrified and genuinely tried to get Harry out of danger.

He only moved the Mirror of Erised when Harry found it. Just to be safe, he switched his Nimbus 2000 with a shiny new one after the curse on the first one (a few modifications made so it wouldn't happen again). He didn't take money from Harry's vault to do this, but he did pay Molly and Arthur to MORE than cover the expenses of hosting Harry for the summer.

And these actions escalated in volume and intensity when his little grandson had a brush with a basilisk in 1993 and Dumbledore couldn't let the brave boy out of his sight...

▪︎▪︎▪︎

Imagine how happy Harry would be, not going back to the Dursley's but slowly realising that Dumbledore has transitioned into some paranoid, helicopter parent...

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** See... when I saw the title of this prompt I was thinking like a completely out of sight not participating apart from odd appearences and not really having much if any of a relationship with the main characters and so I was imagining more along the lines of:

--------------

"Hey Ron, how come the famous Dumbledore is supposed to run this school but we have never even seen him in years?"

"No idea Harry. Strange that is. Oh well, pass the pie." Ron replied

"I heard that hes hidden himself away in order to figure out some sort of lemon mystery or something. No idea what thats about but Parvati and Lavender were gossiping nonstop about it in the common room and I think they heard it from some teacher in the hallway. However, I think hes probably trying to figure out how to free all the elves."

"Not this again Hermione" said Ron. "Can you just pass me the pie already?"

"Great man, that Dumbledore" said Hermione distractedly.

"Barmy she is" said Ron, reaching across her to retrieve his pie.

"Yeah..." Harry said distractedly. There really was something about the lemon mystery that seemed to strike true in his opinion. No idea why, but he just had a feeling. Then again, the three of them hadnt seen Dumbledore but once in the multiple years of schooling at Hogwarts and that was only when Dumbledore randomly showed up to a meal, shouted nitwitt, blubber, oddment, and tweak or some nonsense, turned Filtch into a donkey, stole McGonagall's hat right off her head, and then vanished in a burst of flame.

"Odd man, that Dumbledore" Harry mumbled in thought.

"Whuf wuz at Ary?" said Ron with a mouthful of pie

"Nothing... nothing..." said Harry, going back to picking at his treacle tart.

"Boys..." said Hermione exasperatedly.

--------------

But your prompt seems to be more about working from behind the scenes trying to not be manipulate but ending up doing just that in a round about way.

Interesting nontheless.

  Tom's resurrection party pushes Harry to fight for his life, something he does well enough that Dumbledore decides Harry might be more suited for a world of war and deceit than he originally thought. The Strongest Wizard in 100yrs has found his pupil.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
