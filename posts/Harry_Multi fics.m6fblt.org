Could you please recommend me some good Harry/Multi fics without Hermione or Luna?

No slash please and no stories by megamatt09

I'm fine with smut but there has to be at least a little plot

Thank you!

** The Triplicity Series by idleside, starting with Best Behaviour. Lots of smut, but there is a plot too.

  The wedding was lovely. Really. It was. Harry isn't even jealous that Ginny is marrying Draco, more frustrated that he's wound up at yet another wedding without a date.Pansy, still somewhat of an outcast after the war, has been left behind by her own date/flatmate after Blaise spotted a boy he was interested in.Daphne, having lost her standing in Pureblood circles thanks to a failed teenage romance, has shown up mostly for her own amusement. When these three "leftovers" find themselves without any other prospects at the end of the night, bemoaning their singledom at an afterparty at Daphne's flat makes sense, right? After all, they can't stay on their best behaviour forever.
