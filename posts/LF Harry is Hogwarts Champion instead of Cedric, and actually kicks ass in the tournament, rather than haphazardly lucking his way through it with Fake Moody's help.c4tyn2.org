Ideally not Older Harry and WBWL (As most of them are terrible) and definitely not Slash (Most slash is Death Eater pairings rather than actually logical ones)

Harry actually fighting the Dragon and doing something badass. Harry finding a better way than "Dobby gives him Gillyweed at literally the last minute" for the 2nd task. Harry winning in the Maze without dead Cedrics. Actual TRIWizard rather than Quadwizard. No 4th Champion at all.


** That's what happens in my story "Patron" - although I've changed the tournament so there are different tasks.

*** I'd say you changed a little more than just the tournament.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  This is smart! Powerful! Ravenclaw! Harry; How would the wizarding world react to a Boy Who Lived who is much different from what they expected? One that is set to change the course of the magical world forever? Grey Harry; Manipulative! Dumbledore; Harry/Daphne

  AU What if Harry knew he was a wizard and about the prophecy before he went to Hogwarts? What if he was kicked out of the Dursleys and decided to attend Hogwarts disguised as a muggleborn? Harry Ginny
