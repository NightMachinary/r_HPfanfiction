He refuses and says that even if he wanted to he couldn't because he did so before by sacrificing his mother's everlasting soul to the AK or something like that. The phrase eternal soul or everlasting soul is used specifically


** He isn't summoned by the Order, but that point comes up in Iinkffn(3401052) (one of the larger disappointments of the fic is that the difference between a dark wizard and a Dark Lord is never really explored)

*** I think it was intentionally left kind of ambiguous (and it also bugs the hell out of me) but I did really like the idea that a genuine dark lord requires some kind of esoteric sacrifice to defeat.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Oh, I remember this one! It's written mostly from James' perspective, right? Harry appears on the Grimmauld Place table and Moody freaks out about how weird and possibly Dark the kid is.

But yeah, he talks about how unlikely his survival was and how he needed seven sacrificed nexuses or something to power the spell that let him sacrifice his mother's eternal soul. Gets a bit miffed at Dumbledore, too, I think?

I also remember James comments on how Snappish and Snape-ish Harry is at some point, if I recall?

  Harry is summoned to an alternate universe still suffering under Voldemort less than an hour after his own defeat of the bastard. Worse, he's not the first Harry Potter they've called on this way. Worst yet (at the moment), there is no way back home. But give Harry time, and he's likely to find something that's even worse.
