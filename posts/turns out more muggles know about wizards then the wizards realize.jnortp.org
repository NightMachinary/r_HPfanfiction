The wizarding world is a open secret among a decent amount of muggles especially with those in the goverment they pretend to to not know so they say don't get caught.


** I can so see this happening, both in government and as a grass roots ‘conspiracy theory'. ‘Don't let them find out you know, or you'll be wiped' etc

** There is a fic called with strength of steel wings where groups of muggles set up cells where they can pass on info about wizards. That way if one group gets memory charmed the knowledge isn't lost.
