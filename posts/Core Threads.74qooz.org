** I can't get past the train... It just feels boring to read.

The Dursleys are completely willing to accept some pretty freaky magic and be the family Harry always wanted. Immediately. And Harry's totally okay with this.

Spoiled as all hell Dudley has no problems whatsoever with a smarter, more talented, literally magical cousin showing up out of nowhere.

Harry actually refers to Dudley as his bro to other people. Who does this? "Yeah that's my bro's idea" or some such.

Harry runs into Hermione and is totally going to set up a super trunk discount for this new and random stranger.

Harry meets the girls on the train, and literally refuses anyone else entry to their room because reasons.

Draco Malfoy, "Young man".

He has them casting ridiculous magic in minutes. Of course.

It's a shame because I'm a pretty big fan of OP Harry.
