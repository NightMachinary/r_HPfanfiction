** Could you post some more details about this? Like what [[/u/AvraKedavra][u/AvraKedavra]] said

Where would these be posted?

Do you make grammar corrections to help the stories flow smoothly while speaking it out loud?

How long do projects usually take?

*** Posted on my Patreon. Yes, I edit as I go. I have been doing this for quite a while and I have found that editing is necessary while reading. Projects usually take a couple months depending on the length. Very short stories could be done in a week, though. My time estimates are very iffy right now because I have a lot going on, but I want to try and get to every request eventually.

** This is interesting. I am not familiar with inner workings of Patreon but understand that funding is derived from the patreons. Might this raise a fanfiction "fair use" objection with JKR/WB?

*** I intend to offer fan fiction for free. Some original works will be paid, though.

**** FYI, did some research and came across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/734r62/patreon_and_fanfiction/]]

The following relates to AO3 terms of service. [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/PSA:_DON%27T_MENTION_COMMISSIONS/PATREON_ON_AO3]]

Just trying to ensure that another method of fanfiction publication doesn't result in legal issues.

***** Thanks for doing that! Since I don't plan to charge anything for the fanfics at all, I'm going to try this out. A lot of people were excited to get their fics narrated and I don't want to let them down. Worst case scenario, my Patreon gets banned, which I can live with.
