Hey.

So I am looking for some sort of fanfiction where Harry or another person is sent back through time, say a few hundred of thousand years, not going back to live with the Marauder's or Tom Riddle or the Founders, just sent back through time and working his way through history, not trying to mess it up to much. This could be part of the Master of Death where he is immortal and imperishable, meaning living forever and staying the same age. Going to places that, to the best of his memory, as significant, like the fall of different Empire's and creation of others, becoming a footnote in history.

If anyone knows anything like this, it would be great to know anything.


** The correct flair for this is 'Request' rather than 'Fic Search'.

Maybe those need to be renamed. Eg 'Seeking recommendations' and 'What's that fic?'

*** I tried that. I can live with the various tropes that turned up in the first five chapters, but the first chapter after the time jump made me closebox it immediately.

Basic history[1] is only a few google searches and Wikipedia binges away, and if you can't be bothered with that, I can't be bothered with your story.

[1] I don't need exact historical research, but if you're off by centuries, I'm just gonna point and laugh.

***** Rome was founded 753 BCE, it was one of the many central italian kingdoms for the next two centuries, then started to expand as the Roman Republic from 509 to 27BCE. The *Roman Empire* was only founded in 27BCE.

London was founded around 43 *AD*, yeah there were small settlements there before, but no city. It definitely wasn't around in 650 BCE. (And it would never be called Loandom, the various language shift rules preclude that)

The languages that are mentioned are at least doubtful. Briton celtic languages probably differentiated somewhere in the last two centuries BCE, Latin would not be even a trade language. If you try a trade language around that time, you'd try Greek, Phoenician or maybe Carthagenian. Norse didn't exist either. *Proto-Norse* whatever they called it themselves was spoken around the first century *AD*. Whoever may have lived in Scandinavia definitely didn't speak any germanic language.

And so on.

600AD would actually almost work. It would still be wrong, but not as terribly painful.

As I said, I'm not a stickler for details, I never even checked the details of "The Long Journey Home" because it didn't clash with basic history. But when every single named detail is wrong, well, there's the closebox.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

** I liked linkffn(Voldemort's Last Spell), though it's abandoned, its final chapter is x-over with smth, and if you type any other name instead of Harry Potter, it's still gonna be ok. But I still like it and recommend it. It's a very interesting read. (maybe one day one great person will adopt this story and finish it?..)
