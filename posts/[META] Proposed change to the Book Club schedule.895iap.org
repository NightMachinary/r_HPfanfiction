I like the Book Club. I don't participate in every thread because real life is a thing and sometimes the particular fic on the menu just doesn't speak to me. But I'd love to see greater engagement, as I'm sure we all would. To that end, I'd like to propose a small amendment to the schedule, seeing as the current thread is due for retirement soon.

The current Book Club fic and the next one in the queue are both short by fanfiction standards. I mean, a lot of us grew up reading 200k+ words and treating that as a regular thing. Here's my idea. 50k words is about half of a typical debut fantasy novel and around 2/3 of Philosopher's Stone--seems like as a good a cutoff point as any. So--if the Book Club fic is less than 50k words in total, thread would be up for 2 weeks. If it's longer than that, thread would stay up for a full month.

Since the modship has control of what is in the Book Club next, we could do one longer than 50k fic and then two shorter than 50k in a row, so as to still have a regular schedule and thus not increase the workload for mods by too much. I think 2 weeks is plenty enough time to read 50k words and engage in the Book Club thread, if you decide to participate in the given round.


** I second this motion.

** Great idea! I haven't participated because I don't have the time, but a shorter fic will definitely catch my interest.

** I'd be down for this idea! I've been wanting to be more involved, and having more varied fics with differing lengths gives a few more options over all.

** You “grew up” reading 200K+ stories? WTH?

*** Order of the Phoenix was 257k+ words. Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows were nearly 200k.

*** I have a busier working schedule than most and can fit in a 200k story in a week or two. When I was in school, I /inhaled/ fiction - fanfiction, in particular. Could finish 200k stories in a couple days.

It is, perhaps, less typical in physical books but, when reading on a screen? Without page identifiers? When I can easily carry it to the bathroom, read while going to sleep? Never lose my place?

Yeah. I imagine a lot of people have a similar story.

*** 200k is still short. Like less than a week of 1-hour-per-day of reading.

*** Sort by wordcount on FFN. Find the cutoff point above 200k. See how many there are.

I mostly read shit, but I was younger and dumber. Now I'm much more picky. But yeah, absorbing a lot of (fan)fiction early is how a lot of people got into the fandom.
