I've been in a sirius kind of mood recently. Any pairing is fine, het or slash, Time travel or none. AU's and interdimensional travel are all good too.

​

I'd love to see obscure fics, old fics that haven't been mentioned in a long time, new fics that are interesting- though I'd prefer complete (if possible).

​

I would prefer no harem fics, and no gratuitous violence or rape. And please- no crack fics!!

​

Anyways- give me your rec and let me know why you like it! Thanks :)


** Recently finished All the Young Dudes on A03, it's a very long Wolfstar fic centered on Remus but with lots of Sirius too. Mostly canon compliant and very well written, I really enjoyed it. Hope you do too! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387]]

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Hello from the Other Side linkao3(15241182) Years after the end of the war, the Veil returns all the people sent there. Harry/Sirius. One of the fics I enjoyed most recently: I loved Sirius finding himself and adjusting to the life in the world that moved on from the war and to Harry who is adult and the Minister for Magic, no less.

  Minister Potter has ninety-nine hundred problems. He never would've expected Sirius Black to suddenly become one of them, but when every person lost to the veil is suddenly returned, Harry deals with public opinion, rehabilitation, and long-forgotten feelings as he works to provide a future for a new segment of magical society.

** I'm going to recommend some of my favourite even though most aren't finished and some focus on more characters than just Sirius.

'Into the Fire' is one I never see recommended, it's Sirius/Remus AU of their 7th year. It's got some of the best marauder dialogue and funniest internal monologues for the characters I've ever seen and the plot is amazing. It's also got a Triwizard Tournament in it and so far the author's excelled at coming up with original tasks. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16281977/chapters/38077013?view_adult=true]])

Anything by Montparnasse has got relationship stuff, also Sirius/Remus. It's more angsty and heavy and I believe most stories are set in the first wizarding war. 'Lethe and Mnenosyne' is a favourite, but there's loads by the same author: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10400106]])

A great AU 1st war fic is 'The Hell Where Youth and Laughter Go" linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16417496/chapters/38435513]]) It's got many many many well-executed characters and plotlines. Sirius is a very active bisexual in it, but I'm not sure if there's a proper pairing for him.

'Tangled Strings and Technicalities' has Sirius/Hermione and is an AU timetravel thing. Very engaging storyline and all the main characters are unusually well-written and act like their canon selves. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13552503/chapters/31096425]])

And the Divine Comedian deserves to always be recommended, for instance 'They're Hiding Inside Me'. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12540852/chapters/28558256]]) All their stuff is angsty and funny and extremely well-written. Pairing is Sirius/Remus although there's little actual romance.

'Remain in Light' is an AU on Sirius surviving the MoM fight in OotP. Also Sirius/Remus. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1918284/chapters/4139571]])

  While war brews on the horizon beyond the walls of Hogwarts, the infamous Triwizard Tournament resurfaces just in time for the Marauders' seventh year. It's one more reason for Remus Lupin to pull out his hair and prematurely wrinkle. And another reason? It walks, talks (too much), and chews up Remus' belongings while in dog form.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.
