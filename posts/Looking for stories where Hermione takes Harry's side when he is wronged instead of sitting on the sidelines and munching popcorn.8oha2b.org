I think most of us who read postwar stories came across a situation like

#+begin_quote
  "So Ginny cheated on me with the entire Quidditch League, took my gold, stole a time turner, travelled back to the 20s and financed the rise of fascism under the alias of Eva Braun. Also, her new boyfriend has that odd moustache."

  "I'm sorry Harry, but Ginny is my friend and I am not picking sides," Hermione said and shot him a dark look. "You have to see her side as well."

  "Yeah man, she's my sister."
#+end_quote

And it irks me to no end that in these stories no one but the eventual love interest (Daphne Greengrass in most cases) stands with Harry. We are talking about Hermione, the witch who picked Harry over her to-be husband.

So are there any stories where Harry's wife/mother in law/aunt/neighbour/a random stranger in Cardiff fucks him over and Hermione actually sticks up for him even if that means breaking with the other person/her in-laws/husband/wife/aforementioned Welsh stranger? Preferably something short without too much bashing.

Please no slash, Death Eater ships or Ron/Hermione where all they do is fight.

  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron...and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry. A look at a Hermione who developed the instincts she evidenced with Marietta and Umbridge. AU, but canon-compliant.

** Kind of in The Quidditch World Cup linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup).

She is definitely not featured much, but when Ron/Ginny try to fix things she sticks up for Harry and yells at them. She also is pretty accepting of Luna relative to how she is shown a lot in canon, which is nice.

You know, now that I think about it, the only two characters in canon that I can really see being able to handle a relationship with Hermione (who is a force unto herself) are Ron and Luna.

*** I'd argue for Harry as well. Not because they are a "match made in heaven", but because of the amount of shit they had faced and defeated together. It wouldn't be the most balanced relationship (then again, those wouldn't work with Hermione), but out of all people, Hermione is the one who "gets" Harry the most (we see too little of Luna for her to take that spot). And I'd argue that Harry would put up with some nagging to get that unconditional support because he'd need it after the war.

And if you go with OOTP characterisations, Hermione/Tonks works surprisingly well. (Back when Tonks was a BAMF and not a mopey doormat).

**** I can see it working maybe. The problem though, as I see it, is that Hermione has the strongest opinions of the trio. She is willing to fall upon her sword for her beliefs. Harry does not like to be told what to do. He will do it, but not if someone tries to force him (Dumbledore you clever man). Hermione just doesn't strike me as subtle despite her exceptional intellect.

She would need someone who took everything in stride. Ron and Luna, despite being fervently loyal to their own beliefs, are pretty mellow with regard to what other people think. Hermione sticks up for everything and has an opinion everything, the only people who can deal with that well are people who just accept things the way they are. Arguably, Luna would be even better at this, but Rowling seems to have included Luna originally both as a way have more Ravenclaws and so a third person could see the thestrals.

***** No, Hermione isn't subtle at all. I guess it depends on how you think the war influenced them all (and how much the Dursley abuse affected Harry long term). I see a postwar Harry/Hermione as likeliest outcome, simply because they are the only ones who can relate to being alone vs the world. Ron had his family to fall back to (and the convenient excuse of the faked illness in case things went pear-shaped and he wants to bail out). When he ran away, he still had Bill, and probably a couple other people he could go to. But neither Harry nor Hermione had that option.

Maybe this is my personal experience clouding my judgement, but I don't see either Hermione nor Harry happy with Molly "Well, you shouldn't have been illegally incarcerated for a decade, Sirius!" Weasley as mother in law. And both Ron and Ginny have her as the baggage.

**** Yea, I think GoF and OoTP shows how fully she gets him, especially in OoTP where she immediately spots his personal flaw as being manipulated by Voldemort (doubt Ron would have picked up on it) and was the only one he didn't question knocking some sense into him after seeing Arthur attacked.

**** And while I'm thinking about it, Hermione honestly seems too much of a "stick in the mud" in the books to go that far out of the box with Tonks (8-year older woman). She is probably the only character I would guess that was unlikely with, but don't take what I say as all that meaningful.

***** Hermione had no issues with Krum, who was 2-3 years older when she was 15. Tonks is born in 73, Hermione in 79, which gives you a six year gap, not eight. Add the fact that Hermione is probably more mature than her age and had her rebellious phase during that time, and the relationship doesn't seem that unlikely if Tonks takes the initiative (Hermione wouldn't, that's where I agree with you).

I mean, it's not the most likely relationship for Hermione, but probably the likeliest if you want "opposites attract" without going to deep.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

***** A pairing with any member of the +Magical Waffen-SS ripoff+ Death Eaters. It is 100% unbelievable for Harry or Hermione to get involved with them. It's like writing a Anne Frank/Commander of Auschwitz story. And honestly, those are usually pairings with the actor, not the character.
