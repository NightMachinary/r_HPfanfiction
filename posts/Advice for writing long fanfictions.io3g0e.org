** Hey there!

Firstly, don't worry about your English being stellar; mine certainly isn't. To solve that bit of a problem, try using websites like grammarly or you can type it down on Microsoft World or Google Docs and just correct the words and phrases that have those swiggly lines beneath them. By using this little trick, although my English hasn't improved, the grammatical errors in my book has certainly decreased :)

The problem with writing long novels is that sometimes, you tend to forget or overlook a couple of details. So try keeping a notepad or something and list down the vital details or better yet, summarise the chapter in a few sentences so if you ever get confused, you can refer to it rather than having to read your whole book again to confirm a suspicion.

Next, while a lengthy novel sounds like a wonderful idea initially, it can get tiring to write and if it isn't very well written, read. Also, sometimes, an author has the choice to finish a book early with a nice ending, but still ignores it in the favour of dragging the story on. Make sure that you don't extend the length of the novel just for the sake of it, but rather because it is actually required. The readers are quite observant, and they can just tell when a book tends to do that, so be careful.

Sort out your thoughts. If you are determined to write a lengthy novel, go for it! But make sure you have the ending clear in mind before you do. J.K.R confessed in an interview that she had written the second to last chapter of the Deathly Hallows before she had finished the Chamber of Secrets. Knowing or writing down the ending will make sure that you don't lose track of your thoughts and also, that you know exactly what and all to plot in order to obtain your desired ending.

Also, remember to make sure that your characters have some sort of character change in the end when compared to the beginning; and remember, character change doesn't necessarily have to be positive, so have fun with it!

Whether or not you want to plan out a chapter before writing it is your wish. It works for some people and is considered to be a waste of time for others. Figure out whether you are more of an on-the-spot type of author or the detailed-planning kind.

Don't be disheartened if you lose interest a couple of times while writing a lengthy novel, get struck on how to continue a chapter or even face writer's block. Take some time off and try to write again with a refreshed mind, most of the time, you'll succeed and overcome those hurdles.

Anyway, thank you for listening to my Ted Talk. Good luck with your book!

** A summary is an excellent place to start. Then a chapter-by-chapter outline. It doesn't need a lot of detail right away. Just one sentence is fine, as long as each chapter has 1 main point to help you avoid losing sight of your goal.

The final scene is also a good thing to write early. Gives you a place to get to, even if you just change it later.

Plenty of readers want long fics, but they also want them /complete/, and that's the hard part when you have something really really long and you need to tie up a lot of different plot points.

I'm about half done with my 800k epfic. It will be my first >200k that I actually finish. It started as just a handful of scenes I couldn't get out of my head. Then it sat there for nearly four years until I made a proper outline. In less than half that dormant time, I've now whipped it into shape and I'm almost ready to start publishing with a two-year-long weekly drip.

All that said, a real novel is a lot shorter. My epic rambles are all about savoring the rich magical world in extreme detail, but most readers actually prefer a faster pace and more action. Even the LotR books were each less than 200k, and plenty of people think those were way too long. You'll need to find the sweet spot where your fic is long enough to do what you want but not so long the reader loses interest.

** I do public speaking and write speeches so I think my advice should mostly be relevant...

Consider combining all 7 Harry Potter books together in one. You get about 1 million words. What happens during this time? There is an overarching plot and seven somewhat selfcontained stories each with their own subplots. You could consider this as 3 levels of plot. 1. overarching narrative. 2. arc narrative. 3. subplots.

The subplots are there to build up the arc plots or the overarching plot and the arc plots build up the over arching plot. When writing a 1000000 wc narrative it is essential just as with a short story to map out / create a detailed outline for the entire narrative or you end up with inconsistencies and plot holes. Each subplot should either add to the arc plot or the over arching plot.

You can see why this gets complicated right? The hard work is writing the outline. Afterwards, writing chapter by chapter isn't all that hard, if tedious. Also, I recommend not aiming for perfection on your first draft. Stories like this should take 3 drafts or more.

You might say, gee this sounds like a lot of work, well professional writing is a lot of work if your goal is to create a meaningful piece of art that someone would like to consume. If you want to create a stream of consciousness story that stimulates your creativity with minimal outlining go ahead, but understand it will read like that. Its ultimately your hobby and your time.

Edit: For example, include a light hearted pranking session with the Weasleys that explores prank items. Harry or another protag then uses the prank items in the finale somehow. So bam, you get a breather session and it can tie into dealing with the finale. Including this scene also adds world building, an opportunity to get closer to the Weasley family if Ron isnt a friend, resources for a future scene, a foundation for later subplots not only with a Weasley but the ones you pranked. Etc.

** Don't worry about your English, most native speakers aren't born writers, and you seem to have basic writing skills in your native language.

I'd say make yourself a plan and stick to it. A chapter by chapter plan can be useful, but this is rather personal.

Also, I'd write in English. Translation takes a lot of time and energy that you can otherwise devote to the story.

Good luck!

** Don't.

Write short stories (just few chapters maximum), and only when you learn to manage the basic things like building plot, characters, dialogue, action scenes, etc., you can start to think about bigger things.

*** If only I knew this, I started my fanfiction writing with a 500k epic. I barely reached 50k words before realising that it was shit.

** Plan the entire fic and don't publish until it's done. You don't want to reach chapter ten and realise you have a plot hole in an earlier chapter, or you change your mind and want to redo the fic halfway through.

** Have an outline of what you want to happen. You can make it as detailed or bare as you want, but just have some sort of idea of how you want the fic to progress. Character interactions, character development, plot progression, throwbacks to previous chapters/canon are all things that you can include.
