** For the "abandonment" moment I blame the horcrux, Ron being hangry, and the horcrux. And Harry a little. Besides, he wanted to come back as soon as he'd left (since he'd removed the horcrux), but couldn't find the tent.

Fun fact: Ron was supposedly the most popular character before the movies were released, and people didn't like Hermione much. JKR said in an interview how she was afraid what the film producers would do to "her darling".

  And, did they forgot that the chain almost strangled Harry?
#+end_quote

To be fair, the chain tried to strangle Harry when he was diving to recover the Sword of Gryffindor, around 5 minutes before the Horcrux destruction. The locket was pretty well behaved before that (if you forget the "corruption of the mind" thing).

** Regarding the abandonment thing, you're absolutely right that Harry was a moron. But they're also the only thing standing between an Immortal Racist Dictator and the lives of pretty much everyone they care about.

Even if Harry is a moron (which he absolutely was, the kid has the common sense of a spanner), abandoning the hunt because of that is just idiotic because the stakes are so ridiculously high. The way Rowling had things set up with the Horcruxes, Harry, Hermione, and Ron were literally the only thing that had any chance of stopping Voldemort at all. If they died or their efforts fell apart, the fight is lost. As far as I remember, nobody else even knew about the Horcruxes besides them and 'ole Voldie.

Basically, like most contentious situations in canon, they're all fuckwits who bungle everything they do and nobody is really absolutely 'in the right'. :D

I think Snape knew about them? I doubt he would have been able to do much in the case the Trio died (being hated by everybody from the "Light" side), but he had, at least, the same informations that Dumbledore gave Harry so he could have tried something.

Not the best contigency plan, but it's better than nothing.

***** I would need to look it up just to be sure, but:

- Snape is the one who treated Dumbledore hand after he tried to use the Ring Horcruxe (I think the ring is still on the table while he is working on it too)
- Snape knew he needed to give the true Gryffindor sword to Harry
- Snape knew Harry had to be "killed" because their "connection" can maintain Voldemort in this world.

None of these informations really make any sense if you don't know about the Horcruxe. And I don't think Snape is the kind of person who would follow strange order without any explanation. So I'm pretty sure he knew everything Dumbledore knew about the Horcruxes.

  People conveniently forget how in third year while Hermione was just scared, Ron, even with his broken leg told Sirius that if he wanted to kill Harry he had to kill them all or something similar.
#+end_quote

People here always keep harping about this episode or the first year chess sacrifice (in all the daily pro-Ron threads we have, so much for being a hated character), but I think it's not so much that people conveniently forget about it, as it is a consequence of the series being child lit/YA adventure genre.

What I mean is that stuff like standing up to the perceived enemy and having balls in general is quite literally the minimum requirement to be a primary character in this kind of book (otherwise you just can't fit it in the plot), so it doesn't register as a part of Ron's character, whereas his social misdemeanors are straight up characterization that can't be read as anything else but part of his character.

You may say this is unfair to Ron, and perhaps it is, but ultimately it's JKR's fault: Ron's good qualities only come out during action segments, while his flaws always come out during the slice of life segments.

***** I don't really agree with your opinion, mainly because of Hermione.

Even if we ignore the fact that Ron also has some nice "slice of life" moments (like when him and Harry were messing with there Divination homework in GoF), it doesn't explain why Hermione is not hated because of how she acted in PoA.

Her whole rant on divination while Lavender is griefing her rabbit is a pretty big "social misdemeanors". Not to mention how she went being Harrys back to McGonagall, without even trying to "really" talk with him.

But the worst of all is how she dealt with Scabbers. I don't care that he ended up being a Death Eater, Hermione didn't know abou it. From Ron's (or any other observer) point of view, you have a girl who refuse to control her cat after it made several attempt to kill a pet rat ("/It's a cat, that's what they do/"), and who then has the audacity to deny any responsability when the rat is finally killed, even though all the elements tend to show her cat as the culprit. The closest example I can think in real life is these shitty parents who refuse to admit their "little angel" did any mistakes even though there are videos showing them doing it.Ron basher often flat out ignore Hermione in PoA, or try to justify her actions because "she was stressed because of all her classes". But the point is, PoA Hermione acted like a total bitch, and unlike Ron who had to apologize after every mistake, Hermione never had to deal with any consequences of her actions. She cried a bit in front of Harry, and HE apologized, and Ron also came back somehow to help her even though she never apologized or anything.

​

I wouldn't care nearly as much about Ron haters if Hermione was held with the same standards.

Are you fucking kidding me, there are Hermione hating threads on this sub all the time, and every Ron thread ultimately devolves into Hermione hating to prop up Ron by comparison. Kinda like your post right now. Hermione is hated on every little bit as much as Ron. There are only more bashing fics for Ron because he's tied to many more setting elements the fandom finds unappealing and plot hooks for a separation, so the bashing fics basically write themselves.

****** You also have a dude who knows his rat's in danger from a crazy cat that's not under control and does nothing about it. At least get a cage. But yes Hermione was a dumbass for the whole Scabbers debacle.

But Hermione gets her comeuppance in POA, she's absolutely miserable for months because she's ostracised by her friends. Harry wins the Quidditch match against Ravenclaw, goes to talk to Hermione and then Ron starts mocking her to make her cry. She's stressed out and lonely. She absolutely got her punishment for being a dumb 13 year old girl. And considering that the broom was sent by Sirius and that the rat was Pettigrew, it's easy to see why there's sympathy for her.

What punishment does the narrative give Ron though? He's quickly accepted back by Harry in both Book 4 and Book 7. He still hangs out with Dean and Seamus in Book 4, does some quick grovelling and is accepted back into the fold. In Book 7 he ditched Harry and Hermione on their mission to kill the Dark Lord(after telling Harry your family's dead yikes) and what? He gets to hang out in Shell Cottage off camera in reasonable comfort, we have no idea whether he's miserable. Ron having to apologise after “every mistake” is not near what Hermione went through in Book 3.

Before being given to Ron, Scabber was Percy's pet, it means that in PoA, it is his 7th year at Hogwarts (as a pet rat) without any incident. Why should Ron take any precaution when, clearly, Crookshanks is the problem? Other cat leave Scabber alone.\\
Anyways, that's not really the point since Ron did take precautions, by either taking Scabber with him (in his pocket) or leaving him in his Dorm Room, a place where Crookshanks is not supposed to go. Also a cage? Yeah I'm sure cats love canned food.

Technically, it's Hermione fault that she managed to fight with the 2 only students in the school that can stand her. Ron could hang out with Seamus and Dean because, even without Harry, he is still a pretty plaisant fellow, and is probably the most popular member of the Trio in the school (at least when Harry is not treated like magical Jesus).

​

Concerning Hermione "Comeuppance", did she really get it? When Ron did some (as you described it) "some quick groweling", he at least had to recognize that he fucked up and apologize. Hermione did nothing of that, if anything, it's Harry that has to be sorry about how he treated her, without talking about the fact that he did it for a pretty clear reason.\\
The punishment is useless in itself if the person can't understand what she did wrong, in order to not do it again.

​

- As for Ron "fault" (his betrayals as some say) :\\
  Year 4, Harry is at least partially responsible for the situation. Yes Ron kinda fucked up with his inferiority complex, but the situation would not have been that bad if Harry had handled their discussion a bit better. Also, Ron taking a full month to "apologize" does not mean that Harry could not have done it sooner. The night when he talked to Sirius was the perfect opportunity, but he rather decided to send something at his face.\\
  In the end, the whole situation is just Teen being Teen and unable to talk about feeling and shits (and also Rowling needing some drama).
- Year 7. They were hungry, hurt, Horcrux corruption and once again, Harry partly responsible by saying Ron he could fuck off. Also, Ron would have been back minutes later if not for the Snatchers.

****** Of course. Harry is not at all immune to JKR's, eh let's call them 'elastic', characterizations.

Many people find the conflict between Harry's desire for normality and relatively lackadaisical attitude extremely at odds with his "saving people thing", and you can see the result in the absolutely massive pile of indy!Harry and op!Harry fics.

Harry is the main character so it's hard to bash him directly, but it's not like I've never read fics in which another character leads the narrative and Harry is painted like a worthless little idiot.

- 3rd year: The movie doesn't both mentioning Hermione bad moments (the scene with Lavender's rabbit, or when she went behind Harry's back to have his new broom confiscated), but gives her Ron moment in front of Sirius Black

Also, Ron dry humor doesn't exist in the movies. They murdered the poor boy.

And you're doing the same thing toward Harry that you dislike about Ron bashing. Exaggerating Harry's actions to make Ron look better. If you are going to criticize at least be consistent both ways.

Ron leaving was a mistake he made...a mistake he immediately regrets and admits too. But he abandon them...that is canon.
