As the title says. Fics finished before the last book/movie came out. I say either or, because for some people canon means one of the two and not the other. Holistic inclusiveness, right?

As always, no limits whatsoever. Any pairing, het or slash or femslash, weird shit, tropes and cliches welcomed.


** Not the same as the crack fic, Seventh Horcrux. This was published in 2006, before the last book. - linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux]])

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

Started over a year before DH came out. Ended over a year and a half after it did. It took me a few minutes to notice the release date, since a couple of the horcruxes didn't match up with canon. Gryffindor's Anvil being one of them.

Hard to explain the plot exactly (and it's been 9 years since I read them) - it was written in the Three-Year Summer as a post-Hogwarts fic where Harry and Hermione are adults and together and Ron has died in the battle that finished off Voldemort.

They don't feel aged except for the non-canon-compliance.

First few are one shots but she wrote a mega 50 chap story California Dreamin' which had an interesting turn on Ginny's possession.
