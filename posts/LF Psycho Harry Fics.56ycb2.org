I'm looking for fics like Worthy of Magic, where he's insane/broken/murderous and doesn't turn good in the end. I want a fic where Harry is the (or one of the) villains, not a misunderstood hero. I also don't just want dark Harry evil because the world screwed him over. I want horror movie level killer. Thank you!


** linkffn(Too Young to Die)

Pretty great fic, brother-who-lived fic.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** (linkffn)The Nightmare Man

First one that comes to mind. Harry is a complete insane villain who kills left and right. It's not a premise I like and yet I enjoyed this fic.

*** It has an extremely interesting premise, actually, in my opinion. It's just, that's all that's done properly.

Harry [[/spoiler][spontaneously develops a counter to his only weakness /in the middle of the final battle,/ for fuck's sake.]]

So... eeh. Your mileage may vary, I suppose.

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11826429/1/Worthy-of-Magic][Worthy of Magic by Sage Ra]]: The newest story on this list, Harry is assuredly a psychopath in this story.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3612995/1/Unholy][Unholy by Lady Salazar]]: This is less of a psycho-Harry and more of an amoral-Harry, still its a 6,000 word oneshot, I recall it being fun.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5754212/1/Darkly-Dreaming-Harry][Darkly Dreaming Harry by Lineape]]: Honestly I'd say Harry is more of a sociopath in this story, still close enough imo.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2823892/1/Burn-Baby-Burn][Burn, Baby, Burn! by Dark-Syaoran]]: Not psycho-Harry, but rather pyro-Harry, a bunch of one-shots. I remember this was a fun story.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5502309/1/Retribution][Retribution by prone2dementia]]: If you want an psychopath who just murders people for fun, this is your story, unfortunately this is dead.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1534683/1/Harry-s-Madness][Harry's Madness by SilverLocke980]]: I did a look over of this, it's old as fuck but is exactly what you're asking for, or at least the first couple of chapters are, not sure if it does anything different after that.

Edit: I just noticed that you actually listed Worthy of Magic at the top, whoops. Also I totally forgot this one:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5290178/1/Retaliate][Retaliate]]: Retribution is the sequel to this, great one-shot.

I guess technically this is a fusion of two fandoms, but only by the slimmest of margins. Harry reads Sherlock Holmes as a childand is inspired by Moriarty.
