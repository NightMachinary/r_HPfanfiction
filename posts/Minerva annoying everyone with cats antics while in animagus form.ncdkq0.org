** "Minerva, there's a whole forest. why do you have to crap in my Garden damn it!" Sprout sighed.

Harry was glad that Lockhart accidentally taught him the Obliviate spell. Hearing that conversation is something he DEFINITELY wants to forget.

** "Good luck, little Harry," Dumbledore thought, as he apparated back to his office. He could really have used some solitude and some rest after such a long day, but it was not to be. Professor McGonagall was waiting for him in his office, furiously pacing. Dumbledore decided to pre-empt further protest immediately, hoping to convince his deputy that further discussion on the matter would be futile. "Minerva, my decision is final. Petunia will take care of Harry, and the blood wards will protect them all. One day, our world may depend on it." Minerva pursed her lips and glared back with a ferocity Dumbledore had only seen once, right before she - before he could even finish the thought, in front of him stood a tabby grey cat, tail completely fluffed up and hackles raised.

"Minerva, please, it is late and we've both had a very difficult day, must we do this now?" Her only response was to jump on his desk with a low growl, stalking between his precious instruments. "Please don't-" Only to be cut off by the sound of glass shattering on the floor. "Minerva, you must unders-" CRASH. Dumbledore winced. She finally came to a halt, inspecting a device reminiscent of a small globe, causing the old man to raise a placating hand. "I've been working on enchanting that globe for over a year of arithmantic study, please see reason." The tabby looked at him intently with big yellow eyes and tilted her head briefly as if to consider. Quicker then he could react, a paw flung out from underneath her, sending the globe careening onto the floor. Dumbledore shut his eyes for a moment, recollecting himself as best he could. "Alright Minerva, I have no other choice but to remove you from my office until you calm down," he began. To his surprise, the cat on his desk notably relaxed at this, lifting her chin as if wanting to be scratched. Confused, Albus picked up the tabby gently, and started to walk towards the door as quickly as possible. Looking up from her spot in his lap, Minerva saw her chance. With a devilish glint in her eyes, she lifted both paws, stuck them into the Headmaster's beard, and pulled. Yowling in shock and pain, Dumbledore dropped her instantly, inadvertently causing the falling feline's weight to pull him down by his beard, leaving an old man sprawled on the wooden floor face first, surrounded by clumps of what was once an impressive beard. Albus groaned, looking up at the now innocently sitting tabby as she groomed her paw. Not for the first time, he deeply wished Minerva would find a different way to cope with anger than embracing her animagus side.

  A one-shot based off of a prompt I found on Pinterest. Minerva McGonagall is offended on a personal level that Dolores Jane Umbridge likes cats. So she determines to do something about it. General cat-made chaos ensues.

*** We know a wristwatch works on account of Harry wearing one the first four years of his education, which only stopped working when he wore it into the Black Lake in fourth year.\\
Purely mechanical wristwatches are fairly expensive (and look the part), so I doubt the Dursleys would get one for Harry or let him get away with nicking one from Dudley's Discards.

We also know a Muggle camera either Just Worksâ„¢, or it can be /adapted/ to work - Colin Creevey is rarely seen without his camera.

The electronics inside a laser pointer are really simple - it's a single laser-diode with a battery and a button that completes the circuit if you press it. It's arguably /simpler/ than a wristwatch or a 90's era camera. All evidence points towards them working.
