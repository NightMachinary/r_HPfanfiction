  Neville / Myrtle (pre-death)
#+end_quote

Do you mean, a teenage living Myrtle, or the 6X years old woman she would be when Neville went to school?\\
If it's the later, it seems kinda disgusting, but since Voldemort/Harry is a thing so why not?

** If we're talking about non-crack ships, I love Ginny/Luna/Cho (Chuninny) and Ginny/Cho (Chinny), but they're super rare. Femslash is harder to find in general, which is a bummer.

As for crack ships... I love the idea of crack ships like Snape/Lockhart. Can you imagine how /done/ Snape would be the whole time??? Other crack ships I think would be fascinating or humorous include Rita Skeeter/Umbridge, Skeeter/Ludo Bagman, Fudge/Umbridge, and Voldemort/Quirrell (from AVPM). Snape and Lockhart has a lot of comedic value, while Rita Skeeter has a lot in common with other less savory types like Umbridge or Bagman, Fudge and Umbridge isn't too much of a stretch, and AVPM made Quirrelmort sort of a thing.

** I am intrigues by Hagrid and poppy. The flora and fauna thing is super cute. Maybe they could work on a project together Pomfrey needing to grow some food for some rare creature Hagrid has adopted.

*** Pomfrey is the healer, though. It's professor Sprout who is the aptly named herbologist.

Maybe Poppy healing Hagrid from all his creature related injuries while he tries to flub his way through how he got hurt?

**** Whoops. That could also work. I guess in my mind Poppy was a plant name and thus... but who knows.
