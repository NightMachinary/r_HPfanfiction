  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

  In the aftermath of war, Hermione retreats to the Hogwarts library to repair her sanctuary and herself. Through broken magic, she's given the opportunity to help fix even more when she stumbles across a friendless first year Gryffindor. --- (Short Fic. Rated T for language. You will not like the pairing. Or you will like it, but then hate yourself and me for making you like it.)

I hate how in time travel fics, whomever gets sent back to the Marauder's era immediately sets about alienating Peter. Esp. when they go back young. Fourth year Peter hasn't done shit and doesn't deserve your attitude.

I'd really like someone to write a fic where someone goes back in time SPECIFICALLY to prevent Peter from betraying them.
