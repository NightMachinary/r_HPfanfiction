Do you know any good Slytherin Harry fanfictions? One where Hermione and Ron aren't sorted there? (I can live with Slytherin Ron but I think it is against everything he stands for and Slytherin Hermione could work because her personality but she is a Muggleborn so it should be impossible)

I am not really a Drarry shipper but I think a slow burn romance would be really nice. Hence I would love to see a friendship between the two.

I don't want evil Harry or any bashing of the Weasleys.


** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7508449/1/Session-Transcripts]]) has Slytherin Harry and is way better than the summary suggests

*** This is a great, if regrettably incomplete story. It is one of the first stories I found that made me realize Snape could be something other than generic unrepentant death eater.

  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

From what I remember he is friends with Draco here but he also has a good relationship with the "light" side.

** Why is it "impossible" Slytherin himself was only against including the muggleborn because he feared them destroying the wiz-world, not because of personal hatred! Hell, I bet he'd have loved muggleborns that fit in an strive to be the best they can - as long as they aren't prejudiced against anything wizard and ask first before blindly trying to change things (Hermione and the houself-crusade comes to mind, with her wanting to free the Hogwarts elves, which didn't work and she had to admit defeat in the end! Yes she later changed the laws governing the elves, but she didn't demand that anybody free their elves anymore!)
