So, i think it could be a pretty cool idea to have Neville be quite a bit OOC and be in Slytherin. It will totally change the canon story due to the butterfly effect. Maybe he adapted because we know that Augusta Longbottom wasn't the best guardian for him. I would also like to discuss about how it could work, what changes it would cause, etc.


** I think I remember one where Neville is Slytherin after he discovered that his great uncle was trying to murder him and fought back, I think Harry and Dudley were also Slytherin cause they grew up with Snape who was the only wizard Petunia could ask for help after Vernon got drunk and tried to kill them.
