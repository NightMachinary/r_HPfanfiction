  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

  There are certain segments of the Harry Potter fandom which more or less idolize Hermione. You know, the people who think that Hermione really should have been the main character of the stories all along, because she was the only one of the trio with a brain. Now, I don't necessarily think JKR did a great job portraying her as very intelligent in the series, but I'm still one of those people who wants to see what she could have been if she were actually the main character, and not just the brainy sidekick (or, as in Mary Potter, a mostly-independent secondary protagonist doing her own thing on the sidelines). So this is that story: What happens if you put Hermione Granger's mind into Harry Potter's body, effectively making her the Boy Who Lived?So she wakes up in his body, and vice versa. While he revels in his new-found loving family (which more than makes up for the strangeness of waking up as a girl), she drastically re-evaluates her priorities, endeavoring to act like the story-book heroines with whom she is so familiar and deal with this unpleasant development as efficiently as possible.

  Draco Malfoy awakens in Gryffindor Tower at the start of his sixth year with no memory of how he arrived.Can Draco use Harry's lingering impressions of the world to guide him? Can he navigate the politics of being the Boy Who Lived? And how long before he tips off Ron or Hermione?A bodyswap subversion and bromance, this story features a Ron Weasley convinced they are mates, a Hermione keen on the Dark Arts, a surprisingly friendly Blaise Zabini, and a Luna Lovegood who's just mad enough to find this all perfectly ordinary.

** linkffn(13667470) has an age 35ish Harry go back to around first year in the body of Draco Malfoy. He's from a future where Voldemort was killed several times and kept rising because although they got all the normal horcuxes, they never knew Harry himself was one.

  Harry Potter is a cynical and depressed Auror after fighting three wars. He travels back in time to change history, this time focusing on political and financial power. To complete his task, he possesses the body of Draco Malfoy before he receives his Hogwarts letter. The portrait is of Rupert Brooke by Clara Ewald, oil on canvas, 1911, with the National Portrait Gallery.

** I know of linkffn(Amalgum: Lockhart's Folly), where Harry lands in Lockhart's body and gets blended with his personality. And mentors his younger self in properly managing his fame, with things like making an exclusive deal with Colin Creevey to review his photos and autograph/sell the ones he's happy with (because if there's an official source of photos, people will be less keen to eg snap pictures of him in the shower). And taking control of the political narrative regarding himself so that the Ministry can't just tell any story it pleases. Etc. Quite fun to read, but it eventually moved into Lord Gryffindor-Peverell-Slytherin-Black-Potter territory and I got bored. Also, fair warning, the Harry side of his personality vetoes affairs with students, of age or not, but can't muster a good argument against liaisons with any consenting female teacher(s).

**** Ah, yes, there is a bit of that and I wasn't a fan. Although I would point out that considering he had someone specifically focusing on manipulating him, he doesn't come off in such a bad light. It's Gildharry who's being a real jerk.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
