Hey all! I recently decided to organize my library of favorite SSHG fics on my computer and convert them to ePub files with proper chapters, formatting, some illustrations from DeviantArt, etc.

While doing so, I noticed that I have a few that have been deleted from the Internet and wanted to offer my copies to those who are missing/looking for them.

Also, if you have a copy of a deleted fic that you really love, feel free to share with me/us and I'll be happy to convert to ePub.

My collection so far:

- "The Other Side of Darkness" by Abbby
- "Survivals and Remembrances" by Abby (sequel)
- "A Winter's Fairytale" by Run Wild (incomplete)
- "Taking Over Me" by Snapesforte (not one of my favorites, but it's hard to find)

These are still available online, but I've converted to ePub with art:

- "Hinge of Fate" by Ramos
- "Falling Further In" by Kaz

--------------

There are others on my computer in my queue to be formatted for iBooks. If you want any of the ones I've listed, just PM me.

If you have any you think are rare and want it preserved, feel free to join in! I think it's important we save the best fics of the genre and establish a small private library for ourselves. It's such a huge shame when an author decides to delete their much-loved work without any notification or explanation, and while I want to respect their wishes, I also think it's too much to ask we forget about their magnificent contributions to the ship.


** If you have the most completed version of Pawn to Queen, it would be a good addition. That fic introduced some tropes to the ship.

*** I think I can track it down. That is a classic, even if it's not one of my favorites, and needs to be saved.

** Hi. I have a small request to make. If you don't mind, could you please ask the authors of those stories if they are alright with their stories being publicly shared again? Just drop them a PM. No need to even worry about a reply. Your collection seems pretty compact, so I think it won't be too much of a problem for you.

*** I would be happy to if I knew how to contact them. I've already sent a message to Kaz without a reply, but I'm not sure where to find their contact info (particularly Run Wild and Snapesforte). I'll do what I can to backtrack through the internet archive Wayback Machine to find something for Abby.

** The Five Winters by Anubis Ankh was deleted in a fan fiction.net purge, but the author made a download link available on her twitter/live journal account [[http://www.mediafire.com/view/lmumb3pp7i9ivsr/Anubis_Ankh_-_The_Five_Winters.pdf][The Five Winters]]

** Update: Another user contacted me with other stories that they archived and will share, including Pawn to Queen, so that will also be available - though whether from me or the user who PM'd me is yet to be determined.

Edit: I didn't realize the site I uploaded the fics to requires an account before you can download, so I made a shareable Google Drive folder and can share the link with anyone who wants it. There are other files there besides ePub that I haven't gotten around to reformatting yet.
