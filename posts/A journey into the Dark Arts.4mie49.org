Dear peoples! :)

I've been lurking around here for ages, I have read a ton of fanfiction, I even write some of my own though they are on hold right now because I lack inspiration and motivation (check out fanfiction user 'DarkVibe' or my story 'Blood means everything')

I was wondering the following: I'm currently reading 'too young to die', which takes the reader in a real journey into the Dark Arts. I'm fascinated with the Dark Arts since I came to know of their existence, but I wonder if there are some really good dark stories out there. I have read entries such as Kurinoone's 'The Darkness Within' and its sequels.

Any recommendations?


** "Out of the Night" by Raining Ink. It's not on FFN anymore, but you'll be able to find it with a quick google search.
