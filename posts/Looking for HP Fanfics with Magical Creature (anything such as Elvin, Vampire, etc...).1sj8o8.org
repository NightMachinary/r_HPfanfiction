I'm looking for more excellent fanfics about Harry inheriting a magical creature, race, etc...Elvin, Vampire, anything. Must be updated last few weeks or completed.

One of my example is On Crimson Wings [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8813082/1/]] and its sequel.

I prefer no slash, please, it just not my cup of coffee.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3865302/1/Half-Animal-Half-Man][Half Animal, Half Man]]: Harry is bitten by a werewolf and a vampire at the end of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Harry/Ginny/Tonks. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes][Faery Heroes]]: Harry/Hermione/Luna in which the three are tasked by the Queen of the Fae to go back in time and fix things. They're made into Fae themselves to accomplish this. WIP, last updated 11/20/13.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9173681/1/Fairy-Champions-Tale-of-Time][Fairy Champions: Tale of Time]]: Same premise as Faery Heroes, but taken in different directions. Hasn't been updated since June 26th, but I thought I'd mention it since it's from the same challenge as another I mentioned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2226486/1/Cyfrgolledig-atyn-yr-Dywyllwch][Cyfgrgolledig atyn yr Dywyllwch]]: No, I don't know how to pronounce that either. Takes place 260 years after Harry was turned into a vampire during his 6th year. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8423230/1/Amber-and-Emerald][Amber and Emerald]]: "When Hermione is told her Polyjuice problem is permanent, Harry refuses to let his best friend go through this alone. He chooses to drink a similar potion, and the consequences of that choice are unpredictable and far-reaching." Harry/Hermione as half-human/half-kneazle people. WIP, last updated 11/4/13.

Err, they're changed into Fae? Where in the story does that happen? I just finished reading this, and don't remember that they become Fae. They just become champions of the Fae.

An M-Rated story I've been writing in which Harry becomes a vampire prior to fourth year. He also befriends centaurs, a pseudo-phoenix, and is in the process of starting a harem...

***** I tend to prefer Snarry, but Drarry is all right too if it's really good. I'm not too big a fan of wing!fics or anything too different from human physiology. Other than that, go wild!
