Im looking for an older fic where snape gives hermione tattoos. It starts with a flower that symbolizes wisdom or studiousness or something and he signs as psspm.


** I don't know the fic you're looking for, but I wanted to let you know that the request flair is used for finding random fics that have a certain element in them, the flair you need is "Fic search", which is for specific fanfiction works.

Hope this helps,
