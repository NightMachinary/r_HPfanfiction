I'm not looking for stories about the end of the statute of secrecy, but rather stories in which individual muggles are somehow exposed to the wizarding world.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] by Aesop

The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

Rated: Fiction K+ - English - Drama - Amelia B. - Words: 27,424 - Reviews: 91 - Favs: 315 - Follows: 48 - Published: Jun 22, 2011 - Status: Complete - id: 7108864

A novella about a muggle woman seeking justice for her brother who was screwed over when the Aurors were trying to cover up some magic. No interaction with Harry and friends, but it does happen before book 6, as Amelia Bones is a significant character.

  AU, first in the main Dangerverse series, now complete. Lone wolf. Dream-seer. Bright child. Scarred child. Singer. Prisoner. Dancer child. Dragon child. Eight semi-ordinary people. One extraordinary family, and how they became one. Pre-Hogwarts story.

The main character Danger, is a Muggle, though I think there are some latent seer abilities later on(not sure). It's long, plus it has multiple sequels.

This fanfic proves it all wrong. COMPLETED. +01-03-2011

Just gonna copy and past the summary from fanfiction:

Runs along with the original storyline. Adele Polkiss is the younger sister of Piers Polkiss, a close friend of Dudley Dursley. This way she meets Harry Potter, a curious boy with a mysterious past, and a wonderful secret... Magic! COMPLETE

This is the only fic of the type I think you're looking for that I've read and found it to be really good for a story that focuses on a OC and is from their pov and the romance is well done in my opinion.

** It's a secondary plotline in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/35/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Confirmed Critical]] (dnd xover, sequel to HPnat20). The story's unfinished and the plotline hasn't started having major consequences yet. It does a good job of showing what ordinary cops can do in the face of magic.
