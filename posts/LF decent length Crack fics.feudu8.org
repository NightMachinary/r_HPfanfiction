Feel like a good laugh at the moment. Looking for fics of a similar length and style as Larceny, Lechery and Loona Lovegood and Itachi is that a baby?! Both great fics and had me cackling like a loon several times. Anyone know any other decent crackfics?

** Dude, I dont know if you know of fma but if you do (or even if you dont - [[https://silentwalrus1.tumblr.com/post/190747059733/as-someone-that-never-seen-fma-i-kinda-know-the][the writer hasn't read or watched fma,]] It's insane) you need this in your life.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20644262/chapters/49023794]])

Ongoing, updates incredibly frequently, and each chapter has at least 100 comments because we're all freaking dying over here. 2nd most commented fic in all of Harry Potter and just reading the comments cracks me up. I've never read anything like it before.

[[https://silentwalrus1.tumblr.com/post/190859682288/do-i-have-to-know-anything-about-fma-to-read-99][Theres a bunch of people who have never watched or read fma (like the god damn writer my god) who read this fic anyway]]. Personally, I'm a big fma fan so I'm not sure what that experience is like but. Damn if silentwalrus isn't a comical genius.

The premise is that Amelia Bones has a connection to General Olivier Armstrong in the military in the fma universe and she calls in the main cast of fma to help the order of the Phoenix in book five. Cue hilarious cultural differences, amazing translation spell errors and a dash of "holy shit. Your plot is the same as my plot. Holy fucking shit."

Anyway, I'll stop rambling. No idea if it's something you'll be remotely interested in it but if it is, this fic sure does exist!

  Ed had thought, after the whole Promised Day, homunculus, entire country harvested for alchemical batteries thing, the batshit quotient of his life would have settled down some. He really ought to have topped out the meter with that one. But no. The bullshit is just getting started. “Are you fucking kidding me,” Ed demands. “The wizards?” Podfic available! See notes
