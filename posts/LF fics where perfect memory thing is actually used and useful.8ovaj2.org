I see a lot of fics where when a wizard/witch masters the occlumancy?(is that how you spell it?) they gain perfect memory and it is not used until fifty chapters later when the author finally remembered that he added something like that a while ago and decided to use it as a plot device even though there wasn't any mention of it until that moment aside from when the author first added the perfect memory to the character in the first place. I wanna read a story where perfect memory is actually useful for once and it is continuously used(ie: author not forgetting he added the power in the first place.). I read the mind arts.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

**** Eidetic memory is sort of not real. I mean, there are people with better memory due too differences in brain development, but true perfect memory is non-existent. Now in a magical world, this could be a unique ability, or even some form of proxy from a mind based magic or potion (maybe occlumency, but I suspect that is not actually true).

****** I think you misunderstood. I was saying IT COULD EXIST because it was a fantasy world. The only part I doubted is that occlumency gave a person eidetic memory. I have seen that in a couple of fics, but occlumency in canon really does seem to essentially be placing yourself in an emotionally neutral mindset, thats all.

******* Can we stop arguing about this? This is FANFICTION. Author could bullshit his/her way to gaining the power in question in any way he/she likes. The movies did not give much information on what the fuck was occlumency was to begin with aside from defending your mind from attackers. If the author wants to give perfect memory power to his character and name it occlumency, that is his business.

Your argument is same as when an author writes his MC too different than the original character carrying the same name so complaining about it just because you want to complain.
