Am am looking for stories were Snape takes the mentor role or adopts Harry (or they have generally a good relationship) and it causes major problems with Sirius and/or Remus.

I would also love to read something, we're Harrys obviously isn't similar to James but in looks (e. G. Other house, beign similar to Snape...) , and it is causing problems with Sirius.

I read some stories were Harry is close to Snape, hovewer there wasn't much conflict with Sirius over it, so I would like to read about it in another way.

(I also read slash, so please recommend whatever you want)


** To Recollect the Future has this with Sirius though it's because he was amplified by Slytherin's Locket.

  Hindsight is 20/20, but when Harry's last steps into the forest set him back further than he'd ever thought, he never realised how grateful he'd be to have Snape there to help too. Mentor/guardian fic, time travel, but not cliched.
