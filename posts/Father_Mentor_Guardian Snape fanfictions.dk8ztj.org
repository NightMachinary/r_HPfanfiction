I read every fanfic I find on Fanfiction.net or PotionandSnitches. Have you any recent fanfics you can recommend to me?I don't like so much pre-slash or Snarry, with Snape as mentor. I also like so much time-travel or role reversed, like Harry as young Snape's mentor. If you read one, you can reply with a Father/Mentor/Guardian fanfic in which Snape is Hermione/Ron/other's mentor. Thank you for your comments.
