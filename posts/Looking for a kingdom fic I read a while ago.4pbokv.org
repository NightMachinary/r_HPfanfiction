A while ago I read a fic where Harry started a kingdom, fighting wars, enhancing his technology and magic, gaining more land, ect

It was long, 100k or so,

does anyone know what this fic is?


** Emperor fits all of the things you listed, but it takes a while to get there. It's an /amazing/ fic, and if you don't like the start much, I'd recommend to read on and see if it catches you once the political intrigue starts.

**** I thought for a moment that you were being sarcastic with this, but then I read the rest of the comments. Seriously, [[/u/onlytoask]] and [[/u/Manicial]], what in the world? The first paragraph of onlytoask's post was borderline as it was, and the second one was far over the line, and Manicial, your post contributed exactly nothing.

Take a look at the rules, and the third one in particular.

***** When have you read Emperor? Was it long long LOOOONG time ago? He asked Harry as an emperor, Emperor the fic starts with him being an emperor that conquered fucking Europe, and he goes "he is not an Emperor he is a soldier". Well duh, what do you think being an emperor takes, 4 years college 2 years intern then off you go to conquering the world as the emperor of Europe?

****** I'm not disputing that it was a bit silly to judge a 600k word story from the first few chapters, but you two were way over the line. You were ridiculing and attacking OP, instead of trying to convince him that he should give it another shot, as a proper fanfic reader should have done.

****** Manicial, I can think of three fics off the top of my head that feature Harry becoming royalty within the first chapter, and they were all fairly good stories.

** Sounds like *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), but if there is another fic like that, I'm definitely interested.

*Emperor* is still WIP and already has 638k words.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** If you're interested in this, you can look at linkffn(10489996) . It's similar, not quite what im looking for, but a good story nonetheless.

*** I've read the first few chapters and don't really understand why people keep suggesting this for fanfictions with Harry as a leader- he is IN the army, but I don't see him doing any land buying, and fighting wars (when I say fighting wars I mean having his own warriors fighting, not him himself) either way, I will try to read this just so I can say I have.

***** Well the answer is obvious. Harry has all the memories of Tom Riddle from his scars so he knows magic, he inherited 4 Hogwarts houses Black, Potter houses, sharingan from Uchiha clan, has super powers because he is from Crypton, got the ring so he is a green lantern too. He was then begged by Cornelius Fudge to take the position of Minister and he invaded whole Europe by himself in a single night so he became the emperor of Europe. I mean how can you not realize that this is THE way for Harry to be emperor? Some people...

****** And yes, actually, I have seen plenty fics where he takes control and they support him because of him being the most powerful there. And before you say that there are no good fanfictions like that, read linkffn(10489996), it is a fantastic story and he becomes the leader of an entire planet and gains everything the previous owner owns, just because he killed the previous owner.
