So from what i remember, harry and some of his friends preform The Tale of The Three Brother to his house(which i think is Hufflepuff) and most of the staff (Harry as Ignotus of course). I think Snape has a love interest with an OFC staff member but i'm not sure. I remember specifically the Dumbledore was watching the play and was really moved by it.

Thanks in advance!!!


** I am almost positive that happened in The Best Revenge linkffn(4912291)

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** I think I read this one. It was really great to see that scene. The dramatic irony of knowing what it meant to Dumbledore with nobody else knowing.
