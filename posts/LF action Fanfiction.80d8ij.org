Hi, I am currently looking for Fanfictions with some good ol' action content.

Please recommend some good fanfictions that DONT include: sappy romance, weird 11y olds that go around and have sex, Snape/LV/Sirius Slash, Ginny Weasley, Harry inherits 99% of the world and all superpowers

Anything? :)

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

To be clear, you mean as separate pairings and... not all 3 at once, right? Or even any of the 3 with any of the other 3... lol

anyway, linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure) has a good fight at the end but then the fic was abandoned I think?

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

*** Yeah, I do mean as seperate pairings. I hate the idea that people think it to be acceptable to pair Harry Potter with the person who betrayed him and his parents OR the murderer of his parents OR the best friend of his parents.

I have read the fic you recommended a few times already, but thanks anyways :)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] by Karmic Acumen The first couple of chapters I admit is quit boring but it picks up to be something of an epic later on. I'll even give you one of my favorite scenes of this monster of a fic. It has a lot of awe inspiring scenes that are action pact.

  Then he gasped and clumsily turned when Sirius made another one of those reality-defying swerves and entered a side-alley that finished in a dead end. Cursing under his breath, he was about to mutter something about Sirius apparently not knowing muggle London as well as he seemed to when he got first first real reason to panic.

  His brother wasn't slowing down.

  It was like watching a train wreck. Horrifying, mind-numbingly shocking and yet somehow impossible to tear your eyes [a]way from it. Sirius drove forward, accelerated to the maximum and then hit the breaks, leaning backwards and pulling the front of the bike along, looking every bit as though he was going to start riding up the wall.

  With a cracking blast of raw magic, the motorbike left the pavement. Sirius pushed the accelerator all the way through, just as his bike slammed into the wall wheels first...

  ...and proceeded to ride up the wall as if it always been meant to do that.

  The roar of the engine got cleared the higher the bike came, like a dragon rising from the depths of a volcanic lair. The bike picked up speed with every meter it ascended and then the 20-story building suddenly came to an end.

  The death eater broomstick pursuit squad broke ranks when Sirius shot up from below like a cannonball, right into their midst. One of them lost his hold on his broom and fell with a muffled scream. Regulus didn't pay attention, nor did he care if he would remember to apparate or cast a Arresto Momentum before completing the process of plummeting to his death. More interesting was the sight of Sirius Orion Black righting himself and spinning on his two wheels as though he were on the highway, outlined perfectly against the half-moon. It was like the sky had chosen to be miraculously clear of London's normal pollution on that particular night just so the scene would be possible.

  Damn, his brother was cool! The definition of the word.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
