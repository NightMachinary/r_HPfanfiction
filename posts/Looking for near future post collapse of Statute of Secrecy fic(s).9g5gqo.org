I was thinking about Xmen and the Sentinels plot line and it occured to me that something similar might fit very well within a near future Post-collapse of a Statute of Secrecy world, but instead of just advanced tech, you would have squibs and disaffected muggleborn leading the charge against magical society, on a global level even, with mixed results.

I have read some of the post HP fics that feature Albus Potter, but found the Global Revelation kinda underwhelming. Are there any fics that blend good scifi with HP magic out there? Especially ones that are not set in the UK.

Or do I have to write this myself?


** This sounds like a wicked cool idea, but I've never seen it in action. You might have to author it.

*** Do me a favor and don't set it in the UK. If you need ideas, or a beta, I volunteer. I proofread for a living anyways.

**** I was planning UK because I'm planning on Hermione as the main character, but as an American, discussing Muggle technology/etc. in America would be easier for me! Though I'm not up to date on No-Maj's and American magical policy. What makes a collapse of SoS in American more appealing to you than one set in the UK?

***** Well, aside from obvious historical parallels, European holocausts have already been covered in fics set in WWII germany when magic gets caught up. In the US, a new racism seems more interesting as its magic thats the target and instead of a skin color. So you could have all the usual Jim Crow tropes, but mix them in with increasing ethnic cleansing tropes and resistance behavior.

Also, when I said near future, I mean near future to today, so a Hermione (et al.) would be in her 50's. I personally love fics that go out of their way to impose the JK Rowling world upon new characters, so that there arent preconceived biases about the people, just the setting.

Also, the UK has been done before over and over, so fresh territory is nice.

** There was a crossover with Avatar (blue people) that had it as back story. They spend maybe a chapter or 2 going over it before moving on to Pandora. It was slash IIRC. Currently getting on a plane, will update with a link when I land if it strikes your fancy.

**** No no, that's a different one. The one in thinking of is linkffn(6281862). I believe yours is the one so creatively entitled Avatar, linkffn(9622291)

  FINISHED. When they went to sleep, they hoped of a better future. But with Gaia insane and Magic as dead as his friends, Harry has no reason to stay. Escape and exist was all he had in mind when he stowed away on a ship to Pandora. Not another war. Slash.

  Harry defeated Voldemort with the power he knew not, a power far more valuable than his freedom. Sealed away until next he was needed, the Wizarding Saviour slept through the fall of his race, of magic and almost the world. Now he has been woken, the last avatar of a dead species and a being whose purpose is so old that only the bones of the Earth remember. Gen. Adult themes.
