** linkffn(Make A Wish) is probably the best known fic of its sort. Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider) and especially its sequel both meet as well; and for a little genderbent dimension crossing curse-breaker Harry discovering lost magic, but a bit less travel (he goes back and forth to a ruined city in northern Italy), there's linkffn(The Archaeologist).

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

**** I'm anti-recommending this, and not just to be contrary. It's written in a weird almost stream-of-consciousness style with way more inner thoughts than action, and even less dialogue (some chapters literally don't have a single line). In the first chapter Harry (Harriet) spends paragraphs musing about ancient cities and Voldemort, and then abruptly she's clawing her way out of a grave with no scene transition or anything. It doesn't get much better after that.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** Linkffn(4186278) is great. Complete, has a sequel and with great characterisation.

References a m/m pairing very rarely and does have mpreg as a result of some ancient magic but doesn't involve another man 'donating'.

I've got no issue with that, but like to give fair warning :)
