** Wait, I have a better theory. Who has a history of keeping deadly beasts inside the school? Who's so good at magic that he manages to do it just fine even with a broken wand, something neither Harry nor Ron could do? Who's loyal to Hogwarts above all and passionate about teaching?

Hagrid is Salazar Slytherin.

He hates the Slytherin House, but that's because it pains him to see what has become of it. Everybody thinks he's gullible and simple, but that's the perfect disguise. In the first book, he played Harry like a fiddle and swindled a dragon egg out of Voldemort, keeping the information about Fluffy until the right moment, despite how easily he blabbed to Harry. He's dating a woman way out of his league.

Already a much better candidate for reincarnated Slytherin than Tom Riddle ever was.

** Where does the idea that Salazar Slytherin was this kind of bloodthirsty, power-hungry dark lord come from? He might have been against Muggle-borns in Hogwarts, yes. But considering how uncivilised most medieval Muggles of that age must have seemed to wizards, he should get more slack for that unlike modern blood purists. And all of this was a thousand years ago anyway. Who knows what he really believed.

The one thing we do know about Salazar Slytherin for sure is that he dedicated decades of his life to building a school and teaching in it. He was a TEACHER. If he'd wanted to kill kids and do general darklording, he'd probably have chosen some other occupation. In the Middle Ages, being a warlord was much easier than being an educator.

The simple answer is 1000 or so years of people essentially playing the Telephone Game on the how's and why's of the rift between Salazar and Godric.

*** I had an idea that the Rumour of the chamber of secrets was started by slytherin as he returned to the castle in his old age to let his friend know about the safety measure he instilled

hell, Slytherin might not have left the castle after a fight but retired as educator to be with his kids and study magic privately

**** It's an interesting idea! I've also always headcanonned the basilisk as a safety measure initially.

Also, the Chamber and, probably to the lesser extent, the spat between Slytherin and Gryffindor are not even facts set in stone in wizarding consiousness. Students had to dug up this legend of the chamber in the books or ask Binns about it, and adults who knew about it all thought it was BS. If it was even barely in the wizarding pop culture, the Weasleys of all people should known it: this legend about evil Slytherin is exactly the stuff generations of proud Gryffindor kids would tell late at night to scare younger siblings

***** I like the idea of Slytherin and Gryffindor having a polite disagreement

and then other a thousand years it becomes they had a fight and slytherin fled the castle in disagrace.

when in reality it could have been a minor academic disagreement between the two, and when slytherin retired for private study the rumour spred

same with the chamber, someone over heard slytherin telling gryffindor about it and it combined with the previous rumour,

And thousand years later, everybody thinks Slytherin cared about wizards' parentage.

******** Yeah, I agree, that's exactly what I said in my initial comment.

Not only literacy, but the gap in culture between your average wizard kid and a muggle peasant must have felt enormous. From personal hygiene to supperstitions to attitude to children and women. Rich nobility was sli-ightly better, but not by much, and they were a fraction of population.

I agree about equality. Suffrage movement in Muggle world started with industrial revolution, when women got at least some opportunities to support themselves. And witches alway have both the tools to survives on their own and a weapon as long as they have a wand in their pocket.

*********** alot of nobles never bothered learning how to read leaving it to the scribes and other people

I belive charlange lamented that fact in his old age that he could never read well not saying they where dumb but alot of the insitutions we take for granted today where never around back then.

Hell even the division of Labor made sense with peasant people

the men would work the farm and do the manual labour, and the women would tend to the homestead cooking and cleaning, repairing the clothing, making bread and that sort of thing. I wonder if one of the major reasons for suffrage was the tech increase leading to instead of it being a fair share of labour that was split because it made sense that way one group started to look down on the other group In the wizarding world all that labour can be done with a few wand flicks.

************ Yes, you're right. Literacy rate in 11th century was probably better than in Carlemagne's times, but not by much.

Although there should have been language classes in Hogwarts anyway. Because even if people were literate, what language were they literate in? Latin, Old English, Old Norse, Anglo-Norman? You had a lot of options back then.

************** Not only spells, but names (Lucius, Albus) and Christianity. But I guess it made sense that even in the parts that weren't conquerred by the Romans wizards would use the language of international communication, like English today.

I don't think the universe necessarily falls apart: the Statute of Secrecy was much later, and before that, wizards and muggles lived much closer together (Nearly-Headless Nick was a court wizard, Hufflepuff ghost was a friar). And even after the Statute, wizarding community is much too small not to be influenced, especially with a steady flow of muggle-borns and half-bloods. There shouldy be some differences in accent and language for purebloods, but that would be tiresome to read except in minor characters, so I understand why JKR didn't go that route.

****************** What could pagan gods give wizards they couldn't do themselves? They shouldn't be impressed by them any more than by Jesus.

Maybe Christianity could give them a vison of an afterlife and comfort of absolution of sins. Do Muggles follow Christianity just because they believe Jesus did cool stuff? It's more complicated than that. Many people turn to religion because they want something that would give their life meaning, and magic is not enough for that. Or they simply believed because everybody around them believed. I've seen enough old people who used to be atheists, never cracked the Bible open and don't know the basic facts about Jesus's bio, but think about themselves as devoted Christians now.

Jesus could have had a horcrux, but why bother going through with the crucifixion at all? Just confound the dumb Muggles and go around your business.

**** We don't know Salazar's bio. Only legends and speculations. The Chamber was a legend before Harry and Co. found it, and not even the one people really believed, more like "alligators in the sewer" theory.

We also don't know how Salazar looked like. Harry described his statue in the chamber as monkey-like iirc. It can mean a lot of things (old and wrinkled?), but doesn't sound much like Voldie. And who's to say it was even his statue?

Where did the portrait in question even come from? The movies? I don't remember it there and don't consider movie sets canon. If we're googling portraits, a good idea may be to google some medieval art as well. Any realistic portrait of Salazar had to be painted centuries after his death.

** I like this idea.

Sort of similar in a way to Prince of Slytherin's whole deal with the Riddle -> Volde about-face. A rational explanation for why an excellent half-blood who almost certainly faced persecution for it, chose to hide his blood status and ally with his oppressors, making an enemy out of Dumbledore, instead of leading a muggleborn/half-blood group that could count on Dumbledore's support and more convincingly claim a justified cause, the right side of history etc.

I've always been a fan of stories that have him start out like that, and then be warped into the Volde we know by some event or situation.

It could also explain why Tom Riddle was charismatic and cunning, while Voldemort was a raving maniac with no plans worth a damn.
