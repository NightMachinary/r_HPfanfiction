Just finished binge reading the entire thing for the first time, what are your guy's thoughts? I thought it was very good and can't wait for the next chapter!

*** Hm, begun to read it. The /Addams Family/ side seems well-handled so far, but I'm not convinced by the /HP/ stuff. A nod to Manipulative!Dumbledore at the beginning, and the “Squibs can do some magic, just not use wands” cliché, don't make for a very encouraging start. Still, fun read.

*** no, it's a crossover fic btween the Addams family and Harry Potter, Wednesday refers to Wednesday Addams. I sent the link to another person in these comments if you want to read it (It is quite good)
