This is a Draco and Astoria centric piece that explores their interactions more than anything else. A bit fluffy, but well written that I think some here might enjoy it.

Summary: It's to be expected in a place as old as Malfoy Manor, that dark things lurk in long-forgotten corners. Astoria, newly betrothed and not entirely happy, takes up exploring her new home. There are secrets to be uncovered, not all of them pleasant, and she might just learn something about Draco along the way.

  Follow the adventure of my OC Draco as he embarks on his adventure to become a Pokémon Dragon Master, all the while maybe he will fall in love with a certain pokemon, that happens to be his partner. Rated M for future violence , blood, swearing, pokephilia, and maybe lemons.
