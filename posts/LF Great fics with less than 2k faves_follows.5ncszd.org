I'm interested in reading some diamonds in the rough, the fics you can't so easily find going through sorting by most faves. Bashing, slash and crossovers are fine. Please no mpreg, genderbending, romance-driven or angst-driven plot and no pottercest. Thank you!

** Under 2k favorites? There's a lot. 2k is a pretty high bar. I'll come after it from a different angle and give you what I think are the most underrated fics. All of these have well under 1k favorites.

/Harry Potter and the Lord of Immortality/, linkffn(10467472): fair amount of Harry/Ginny romance, but it's well-written and has a really original alternative to horcruxes to drive the plot.

/The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House/ and its sequel, linkffn(11280068,11677935): replaces Hermione with an OC who munchkins everything to become a future Dark Lady.

/Albus Potter and the Year of the Badger/, linkffn(4256837): exactly what it says on the tin and *way* better than Cursed Child.

  Under 2k favorites? There's a lot. 2k is a pretty high bar.
#+end_quote

On the one hand, I agree with you, so I Just wanted to run some numbers, solely for FFNet:

#+begin_quote
  Total fics: 723,000

  >2k favs: ~1350\\
  >2k follows: ~1025

  That's fewer than 0.2% of fics.

  >1k favs: ~3825\\
  >1k follows: ~2900

  That's still barely 0.5% of fics.
#+end_quote

On the other hand, I'm tempted to say those .5% make up 90% of recommendations, but I'd probably be wrong so I won't. I can virtually guarantee they make up over *half* of recommendations though, so it's rather understandable that OP is asking to not see the same things again, especially when you can read through the things that interest you in the first 100 pages of search results fairly easily, but finding the gems in the next 28,789 pages is fairly difficult.

For reviews:

#+begin_quote
  >2k: 750 (0.1%)\\
  >1k: 2500 (0.3%)\\
  >500: 6925 (1%)\\

  50% of fics have 7 or fewer reviews.

  Over 20,000 (5%) *completed* fics do not have a single review

I think it's fairly obvious that these numbers are skewed towards certain writers, styles, and cliches, beyond the fact that many stories simply didn't reach as many people. To me, it's perfectly reasonable to exclude from such a high point because the expectation is that's what people would otherwise recommend.

This is also discounting other websites where some stories get fewer */views/* than ffnet stories get favs, follows, and reviews.

**** To be fair, I mostly only read fics that are longer than 100k words. There are 7522 of those:

I've found that 200 favorites is the dividing line between "small chance of being good" and "guaranteed to be bad", so I usually skim that far down the "Updated within 24 hours" list for anything that looks interesting. I'll find something worth reading that far down once in a while.

** Recently found this fic and I absolutely loved it: linkao3(Keep your enemies closer) Voldemort finds out that Harry is a horcrux and tries to set him up as a kind of protege to himself after succeeding in mostly taking over Britain.

The writing, worldbuilding, the plot, amazing characterization of Voldemort and his interaction with Harry just come together to create a somewhat dark but absolutely gripping story. The author manages to portray Voldemort as both somewhat reasonable and realistic and at the same time completely ruthless and cold and absolutely fascinating. Harry's struggle with morality and tough choices is also very interesting. Great portrayal of Snape as well.

  Soon after Voldemort discovers the existence of his human horcrux, wizarding Britain yields to his reign. Harry's kept alive, but what can he possibly offer the Dark Lord in exchange for the well-being of his friends? And what to do about that shard of the devil himself starting to hum inside his head? Dystopia with some lighter parts. AU. Gen. No slash. Grey Harry.
