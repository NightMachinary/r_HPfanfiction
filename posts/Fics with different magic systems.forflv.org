Basically, what fics are there that use a system of magic other than Rowling's? Can be used as well as hers or instead of, whatever. I'm just curious what other systems have featured in HP Fanfic. I'll also accept any recs for fics that expand upon Rowling's system to the point that it's significantly different from what was featured in the original books/movies.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** Here are some I like with magic that is not in the books:

** Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality

Basically it's the Philosopher's Stone rewritten by a scientist, but it functions like a whole story on it's own.

It has an improved version of the original magic system. It's the same at the basic level but there are things like people getting exhausted for casting to many spells, projectiles that change direction, using multiple levels of magical shields, tricks like casting a green stunning hex so your opponent will think it was a killing curse and react differently.

Also the whole transformation system got an overhaul. Stuff you transformed will always turn back to normal, so there are rules like the unforgiveable curses. You must never transform anything into liquid or food that goes into a human body because the molecules will eventually trun back into the original material and kill the victim, transforming living beings is forbidden since there's a high risk of dealing serious damage to them etc.

New horcrux system, enchant system, patronus system, magical blood and nobility system, improved animagus magic and timetravel, altered creatures like indestructible dementors etc.

It's super long and it's super weird at times and the first few chapters are pretty discouraging but it's worth to read. It gets much better about at the point where Harry travels to Hogwarts. Aside the magic system many characters, locations and pieces of wordbuilding have a complete overhaul and a set of new traits and abilities. It deals with psychological things much more than the original which is brilliant in my opinion. Also there's a podfic version if you'd rather listen to it.
