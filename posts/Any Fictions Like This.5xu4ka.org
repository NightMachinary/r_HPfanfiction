I remember reading a fiction(incomplete) like this: a Harry Potter, powerful presumably, defeated Voldemort long ago but somehow destroyed the whole magic folks. In an attempted time travel, he ended up in a dimension where Tom Riddle is prime minister. James Potter quite close to him, there's no death eaters and Harry Potter of that dimension is squib. In short, Tom Riddle isn't the devil Voldemort supposed to be but a cunning manipulative person.

I think the fiction was called - The Sun Dog. Any fictions like similar premises?


** linkffn(8678567) There is Riddled Universe, he is a Healer, still exceptionally smart and very sarcastic. A brilliant fic.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
