** Some people say that Harry was written as a reader proxy character. In other words, he was intentionally written to be as generic as possible so that the reader could identify with him and feel like they were 'walking in his shoes' throughout the story (example article with more about that concept: [[https://www.standoutbooks.com/reader-proxy-reader-proxies/][link]] ).

Personally, I agree with that assessment up until 5th year. Harry starts to have his own emotions after that. But I'm always a little amused when people say that a fic contains an "out of character" Harry, since I've always thought of canon Harry as a blank slate for most of the series.

*** I think this is a little off. Harry is the "why?" character. That's why you might mistake him as a reader proxy, since his ignorance of wizarding things requires people to explain things to him in a way the reader (also non-magical) can understand. But the reason he's not a reader proxy is that Harry did have his own character and emotions before book 5. Even before he knows he's a wizard that we see he's very resilient and tough despite his abusive upbringing (people who get locked in small rooms, fed smaller proportions and berated for a decade usually come out as broken people), he's shy around new people since he never had any friends and everyone he ever knew disliked him, and he has a terrible antipathy towards bullies and those who think they're better than others by birthright (see his internal thoughts in book 1 about how he quickly knew he didn't like Draco at all when he was being outfitted for robes).

Books 3 - 5 definitely crystallized his character I think, but the base was always there imo.

**** This is the first I've heard about reader proxies, which is fascinating. From both of your descriptions, he sounds closer to a mix. Much of Harry's character is a bit flat in the first few books; we really had to infer his character beyond the type-casting “boy-hero” heroism. It wasn't until later, really book 4 or 5, when the basics of the wizarding world no longer had to be explained to him that I feel he became a character in his own right.

***** It's a fair point. I think, though, that has more to do with the general tone of the stories starting with book 3 (or book 4), where it transitioned into a larger, darker tale. You even see this in the films, the first couple are rather more cheery... well, they're brighter anyway, and that even bleeds into the vibrance of the color schemes (later films are literally darker in the colors used).

Well, to be fair, after book four when the colors shift there's a new director, which I partially attribute to the change in colors. But book 4 really marks th shift, because suddenly Voldemort returns and the world is truly out to get Harry.

  he uses the disarming spell and the stunning spell in pretty much all conflicts
#+end_quote

They are literally the most useful, duel ending spells. That's why he uses them, it makes total sense since if they land, he wins. If they hit, he wins unless the opponent is a pro at wandless magic.

#+begin_quote
  never actually makes any effort to learn about his parents throughout all the books
#+end_quote

People volunteer information about his parents all the time, he didn't really need to ask. And as a matter of fact, he did ask about his parents. In OoTP he risks expulsion just to ask Sirius and Lupin about James.

#+begin_quote
  Ron is a slacker
#+end_quote

Well, yeah, but Ron wasn't developed much due to mistakes in how Rowling established his character and niche. Being a slacker isn't the worst trait, though.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is an authority worshipping know-it-all (and I'm generalizing here).
#+end_quote

This is only a generalization if you ignore nearly every book. She breaks rules and laws so often and to such a degree that only Harry really compares among the protagonists.

Hell, I'd say Harry, Hermione and Dumbledore are far from one-dimensional characters. I don't think that's disputable.

#+end_quote

Of the characters, I'd agree that they are the most developed characters. But pretty much everyone else is one-dimensional. That may be a broad over-generalization, but I always feel like they have so much more to give.

In terms of authority worshipping Hermione--- she takes everything Dumbledore says as near gospel. She does break the rules, yes, but that overall aspect of her personality is fairly static. It depends more on who you define as authority. She is far more dimensional than Ron.

OoTP is one instance, to ask about a specific situation. Having thought about it more though, you're right that he does ask questions (though I'd point out that the information people volunteer is pretty much the same), but there's still things that bother me. In the first book, Hagrid tells him that he wrote to friends of Harry's parents for the pictures. Why did Harry never follow up? Why did these people never contact him, if for no other reason than his fame (also why did he never get fan mail)?

I'll agree with you on the disarming spell, but the stunning spell is a terrible option in a fight with more than one combatant or against an adversary that's vastly better than you. It can be shielded with a basic shield spell, and you can be revived by your comrades if hit. Spells that permanently take someone out of the fight, because let's face it, it was a war, would be much better options. Your opponent is aiming to kill and maim you, and you're just going to knock them out and hope they stay out? It seems foolish to me.

**** The problem with this is her acceptance of Dumbledore's words is due to Dumbledore being the undisputed most intelligent wizard on the planet and having over a century of experience in everything from politics to theoretical magic. That's not authority worshipping, that just good sense. Hermione's a stickler for the sensible rules, but not if they violate her moral compass. That's why she breaks so many rules and laws to help Harry, because she saw those things as unjust and Harry was her closest friends and a decent person. I think this criticism only applies to part of book one, where she had no one to be with so upholding the rules was all she stood for.

It's a fair question. However, I'm pretty sure it was really just one person Hagrid contacted: Lupin. And it's a good question as to why he never contacted Harry. It doesn't make a lot of sense in hindsight, even just the occasional letter would've meant a lot to him, probably.

The Shield Charm is not a basic spell. As Fred and George say in HBP, most adult wizards can't cast it at all, even at the Ministry (which is why the Ministry ordered a bunch of their Shield Hats). And it's not easy to tell a kid to kill someone, especially if they have a spell that is usually harmless and puts someone out the fight. If they stop to revive them, that leaves them opened to Harry stunning them too, so it's not easy. It was only against Bellatrix and Snape that Harry actually tried to kill someone, for obvious reasons.

***** You've persuaded me about Hermione :). I stand by my opinion of the rest of the characters though. Their personalities were molded to fit their house or their defining characteristic and never went much past that.

I thought the shield charm was basic magic they were supposed to learn? I can't remember if I ever got that impression from the books, but I definitely got it from various games. I mean, yeah they had shoddy defense instructors, but I still thought they were supposed to learn it. I think I assumed the need for shield hats was due to the general incompetence of the ministry of magic.

Beyond that though, the Death Eaters were by and large skilled wizards who could almost certainly cast a shield charm. As a fighting force they'd kind of suck f they didn't. I'm not advocating that Harry should have killed them, but things like cutting spells or blasting curses (fanfiction favorites) do a lot of damage. Though realistically the reason is probably that these were kids books and that's a bit gory.

I do want to point out that Death Eaters were known for attacking in superior numbers (case in point the department of mysteries. 12 death eaters for a bunch of school kids? Overkill. The fact that they didn't succeed says incompetent). If it's more than one on two, if one goes down they could be revived by another while Harry is still defending himself against the other(s). So the stunning spell is still kind of useless.

** OWLs are considered school leaving qualifications, meaning that achieving one, even with an Acceptable grade, in a subject means you have achieved the standard an ordinary adult British wizard is expected to have. Harry and Ron achieved 7 OWLs each, even if not so many as Hermione. Patronus and shield charms are considered quite above OWL standard, with many adult wizards incapable of casting them properly, yet the trio regularly used them.

In modern grade inflated times, not getting A's in high school may mean someone is a lackluster student. However, the sort of nostalgic colonial period boarding school Hogwarts is shaped from were very different from today. Just passing the exams were proof you were a good student, as many failed outright.

Video games often get the gestalt wrong, because having a tiny arsenal of simple spells would be boring and difficult. Much better for the player to grind or level their way into a huge array of exciting spells and grow their "magical core" much like an RPG increases stats with levels. But from canon we see evidence that while none of the trio are Dumbledore or Voldemort level, by the seventh book they are quite above average, particularly Hermione's spellwork (obliviation and protean charms) and Harry's dueling. While Ron does not get a magical moment to shine compared to them, that he can keep up with them should show an observant reader that he too is formidable.
