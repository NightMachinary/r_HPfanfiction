Ok, so in The Chamber of Secrets the Diary Horcrux kidnapped Ginny for the purpose of sucking out her life force to restore itself to life. So I ask, what would be been the effect of this on Voldemort's main soul fragment? Would it have immediately been summoned/brought to that location and restored to life, with a body and everything, leaving the soul fragment in the diary, in the diary? Or would it have taken just the soul fragment in the diary and restored it to life, presumably as teenage Riddle, and leaving the main soul fragment in Albania to continue to fend for itself? Thus, theoretically leading to a possibility of multiple Voldemort's running around? Or would it have some combination of the above possibilities where Voldemort lose's a Horcrux as he is restored to life as the two soul fragments merge together?


** It wouldn't have any effect on the main soul, that existed as a wraith because Lily's protection destroyed it's body. The Horcruxes don't restore Voldemort's body or anything, they prevent his soul from moving to the afterlife.

The Diary would simply have a physical body of its own to work with. Just red CoS, Diary Riddle could pick up wands and such like any other wizard. Horcruxes do seem to work in the interests for the original (same person, not surprising). I'm writing a story where I'll explore that dynamic between the Horcrux with a physical body and its progenitor as they work in tandem to bring about Voldemort's goals.

*** Yeah I know what happens in CoS, what I am trying to determine is what would have happened had it succeeded (particularly in regards to the Main Sould Fragment), as well as whether it was fulfilling it's purpose or was going rogue. Would Original Voldemort potentially had to deal with one of his Horcruxes going around declaring itself to be Voldemort?

Now you say the Horcruxes seem to work in the interests of the original. But do they really? I mean Nagini is a living thing with a will of it's own, and it seems that being a Horcrux gives Voldemort additional control over her, so with her yes, she works in Voldemort's interests. But I don't think we have enough evidence to declare that the object Horcruxes work for the original (other than the obvious, keeping the original sould bound to earth). I mean, unless the Diary soul meant to join up with the Original Soul, it seems to me it was going rogue, and acting on its own.

** No, it wouldn't have summoned Voldemort! it doesn't work like that. They're separate entities! They're not quicksaves, they're not reloads, they don't get used up!

The Diary Tom Riddle was its own consciousness, its own soul, what little piece it had to call that for itself. Maybe it would have had some kind of mental connection to Voldemort, like Harry and Nagini have with him because of hosting soul pieces, but that's it. They wouldn't merge, they wouldn't do anything like that.

Who knows what his actual goals and motives would have been after getting a body, though. Maybe he would have allied with Voldemort, or struck off on his own.

*** So basically, it was going rogue. And the creation of Horcruxes leads to a possibility of multiple copies/clones of one original person walking around? Scary thought.

** Nothing. The main soul fragment is still the true Voldemort. Most likely, it would have made every effort once reanimating to locate the original soul (in Albania) and work to restore his body. It may even be plausible that Voldemort can reabsorb a soul fragment that has left its container, though that is simply speculation.

But it wouldn't become a "Second Voldemort." There can be only one after all (heh heh).

*** Hermione suggests the only way to recover the soul is to experience true remorse for one's actions, but it can kill you. So I expect he couldn't just take the soul piece back.

**** Yes, but she doesn't say thats the only requirement either. She just says thats necessary. Its plausible you need some kind of similarly symbolic gesture to murder but with regret as well (you know make reparations for the dead, etc.)

It's entirely possible there are other ways not mentioned in "Secrets of the Darkest Art"

*** Ok so it would have simply reverted to being the Diary once it restores the original soul to a body, or re-merge with the original soul? Cause otherwise, yes there would be multiple Voldemort's running around. I mean you can say "There can only be one" all you want, and technically the main soul fragment is the true/original Voldemort, but the Diary soul would still be like a clone that has all the memories and abilities that Voldemort had when he made the Diary Horcrux, with all the same capabilities to become just like the original.
