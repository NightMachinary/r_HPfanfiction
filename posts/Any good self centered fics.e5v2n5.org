Do Any of you know some good fics where main character(doesn't matter if it's Harry or some OC), is selfcentered? In most fics iv'e seen the MC goes full maniac-sadist with shitton of angst or fluffy moron in love with some girl/Guy. I'm looking for a fanfic where character thinks of himself first, he can mess with Canon but he always think about what is good for him.


** I noped out of there after a few chapters because Hermione died, but up to that point, Harry seemed to be pretty cold and self-centered. I don't know if he got better later on.

What if Gilderoy Lockhart was competent, a nice guy, and genuinely helpful, while still being the egotistical bastard he was in canon? It's impossible, I know. Fortunately, Harry Peggy-Sued into the wrong body and has to share with Lockhart.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/better-living-through-magic-harry-potter-si.756754/page-72#post-62771068][Better Living Through Magic]] fits this I think... it's an SI into pre-marauders Hogwarts where he is dumped in front of (headmaster)Dumbledore and succeeds in semi-'bullying' Dumbledore to provide a old Hogwarts classroom as a home...before the fic timeskips 4 years of studying and the actual story begins with studious OP MC doing stuff.
