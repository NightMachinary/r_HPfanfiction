so years ago i read a very well written HP fan fic that featured a Ginny/Lucius pairing as the main focal point, with Snape/ Hermione and Draco/Harry as secondary parings. i originally read it on FanFiction.com but they have taken it down and i do not remember the authors name and could use some help finding it again.


** I can't help you with that as that is not my cup of tea, but have you tried something like DLP's Scryer? ([[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]) It has an Index of ff stories (idk which pages it includes outside of ff.net if any) with a powerful search engine. If the author just changed their name or you only remember some shady details it can be very helpful in tracking fics down.

Good luck finding it again either way!

** Was it a forced pairing, like spoils of war or a marriage law? Imperius? I'm kidding about that last one, we all know Lucius was never under the imperious.

*** no, she actually proposes that they get married to improve his image, and fix her financial problems at the same time.
