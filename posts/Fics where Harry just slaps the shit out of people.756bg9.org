*** I like to assume this just happens in Britain sometimes. A guy doesn't get his noon time tea, he sees a welsh corgi and doesn't get to pet it, his wife moves and tries to participate during sex, and he just starts hitting people until his knickers are settled again

** I, too, strongly wish to see a fic where Harry just slaps the shit out of people, but what made you decide you wanted a fic like that? It seems oddly specific.

*** I saw a co-worker slap the fuck out of someone yesterday at work. It was hilarious. For me, not him. He got fired.

**** We are talking about fanfics not canon. I think in almost every fic featuring Harry and Hermione (as a friend or a couple), she call him at least once this way. Please don't be such a buzzkiller

** I want to read this story! lol. Just imagining Harry or anyone really actually slap someone is hilarious. The closest we got was Hermione punching Draco in the face in the books. That was satisfying, we need more of it though, lol.
