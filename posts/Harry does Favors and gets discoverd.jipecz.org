** I believe it was linkffn(Antithesis)

In here Harry (Adrian) has a bunch of contracts and deals with other students who generally hate him but can't really do anything about it because they owe him. After he is forced to break the contracts the studetns turn on him. It is a WBWL and Harry is raised by Bellatrix and initially follows Voldemort.

Just in case the bot didn't get the story here is the link:

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
