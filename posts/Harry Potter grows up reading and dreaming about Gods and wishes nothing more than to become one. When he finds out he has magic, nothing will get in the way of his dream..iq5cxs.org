Always love fanfics with Harry doing deliberate magic before Hogwarts.


** Maybe you'd like linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter) in which Harry is literally a demigod. It's a HP/Percy Jackson crossover.

**** Not in my opinion. The Percy Jackson characters can just be OCs in your mind. They spell out any back stories that are needed.

***** Ehhh I knew the fic wasn't going to take itself altogether too seriously. It's a good, no stakes, comfort food kind of fic. Although I have a soft spot for any depiction of the gods (in particular Hestia and Artemis) so I am exceptionally biased.

*** It just reads like an OC insert into Percy Jackson - Harry could be literally anyone in the story, his status as a wizard and his connection to the Wizarding World don't even seem to matter. It has this really cringy 'Golly gosh gee willikers' feel.
