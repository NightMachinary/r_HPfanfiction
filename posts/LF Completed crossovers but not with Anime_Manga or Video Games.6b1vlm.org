Movies, TV shows, books, etc, as long as it's not a crossover with any manga, anime, or video games. I'd prefer no slash but it's not a deal breaker either.

Complete only please.

#+begin_quote
  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

** Linkffn(2857962) is one of the best known. (Browncoat Green eyes.)

As another poster put Steelbadger does amazing crossovers and while a lot of their stuff isn't finished its still worth a read. There are several avengers cross overs that are alright but most are unfinished.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
