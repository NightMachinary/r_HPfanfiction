I've seen too many fanfictions where supposed friends and couples send stinging jinxes at each other willy-nilly. The stinging jinx (sometimes called a stinging hex because the distinction is fuzzy) *leaves welts*. On tender parts of the anatomy, such as the face, it causes *painful, disfiguring swelling* (which is why Hermione cast it on Harry when they were about to be caught by Snatchers). ([[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Stinging_Jinx][HP wiki entry]])

This is *not* the magical equivalent of the playful slaps highschoolers give each other. This is assault at best, and domestic abuse within a relationship.

I just noped out of a fic where the love interest cast a stinging hex on Harry's *groin* at point-blank range "to teach him a lesson" --- but aimed /next to/ "Little Harry," so that's okay, right?

No, no it's not.

  You are inflicting actual pain. That it can be fixed quickly does not diminish this fact.
#+end_quote

Meanwhile, the post saying "injuries are simply less dangerous in the Harry Potter universe" is at 78 points.

Is there a way to end a discussion thread, outside of deleting the post? Clearly, my standards of behavior between friends (much less a romantic partner) are not aligned with many of the people on this forum.


** I think the first point is that most fics do not use stinging hexes like in canon. In canon, it's like a bad reaction to a bee sting that disfigures and causes significant pain. In many fics, it ends up being merely a welt, if that. I've read many stories where it's little more than a temporary red mark.

I think it depends a lot on the particular relationship. If someone does not like it, or the hexing occurs in anger, I see the abuse. But if the friends or couples express their playfulness through the equivalent of playful slaps, I see no reason for it. So long as it occurs consensually (tacit is fine in these instances, in my opinion, due to the lack of severity in most fics), I see no reason to consider it abuse.

** It is worth remembering that injuries are simply less dangerous in the Harry Potter universe. Having every single bone in your arm vanished - gone entirely, from the larger ones to the tiny, fiddly ones that allow for your wrists and fingers to work properly, is an issue that gets solved in a single night, with the right potion. A fracture is dealt with in a fraction of a second. Injuries, thanks to magic, simply mean /less/.

This doesn't necessarily excuse casual violence from a moral standpoint, but it makes it much more believable and understandable that for children, who very often don't consider the consequences of their actions, to simply go "Ah, it's easily fixable by the infirmary. It doesn't matter, really." Because it doesn't, looking purely from a long term damage point of view. Those painful welts and those disfigurations are not even a minute's worth of inconvenience if you have any sort of medical proficiency. They're actually /less/ damaging in the long run than punches and slaps can be in real life.

That said there's still aspects that might not be pleasant and could be explored, and considering it would add for some useful context and discussion between people - it would make a lot of sense for people raised in a Muggle environment to have a different view on injuries than those raised in a magical environment. But it is, simply put, not the same in both, because magic inherently makes injuries mean something different.

*** While I agree with your point (a child raised in a magical society would not view injuries the same way a muggle child would), I don't think it should be translated by "couples could use stinging hexes on each other because they can heal it quickly without leaving any marks".

It may sound stupid, but pain is pain, and nobody "want" to feel pain. We (humans) accept pain as a byproduct of a different goal. We accept the posibility of being hurt when playing a game, but the main objectif is to have fun during the game. Some parents may also hurt their child a little (good old spank and slap) to discipline them, but the goal is to make the child link the pain with their bad action so they don't do it again (yeah not really accepted in current society but it was the goal). Even the masochistes seek the pleasure behind the pain and not the pain itself.

Anyways, my point is that, there are some context where I could accept the wizards being more "violent" thanks to their superior healing system. Quidditch sound like a death sentence for someone with muggle physique and medecine, their child could be more adventurous, and maybe even parent could use some hexes to discipline their child.\\
But, and to use OP example, having a couple use stinging hexes on each other does not sound acceptable, the same way muggle couple should not hit each other (some hit can heal quickly after all). And it's better to not talk about the whole "stinging hexes next to the boyfriend bits" (can't think at any worse tue l'amour than that).

**** I think part of this person's point was less about how acceptable we might feel it is or isn't, but how people in the Wizarding world might view it. Every culture has a different definition of acceptable, so even if their behavior is intolerable, it can make sense for them to act that way and feel fine about it. Basically, due to the unique circumstances of the HP universe, it may be understandable that practices we would find horrify may be far more common and acceptable.

To be clear, I am not saying that any of these accepts are ever acceptable, only that as an author, they may be able to justify it as realistic given the circumstances.

I also think there are a bunch of other points that weren't specifically mentioned. For starters, as wizards are exposed to not only more danger, but also more pain (as a result of their more casual safety practices), so people likely have a very casual attitude towards pain, and most likely a higher pain tolerance in general.

Lastly, as mentioned in another comment, most fanfic's dial back how painful the hex is compared to canon. Most of the instances that I've seen, the hex has functioned more like a shock pen or any other minor pain that is more annoying than truly painful. Obviously if varies, but that's what I've seen.

So, given a more casual attitude towards both injury and pain, and the fact that the pain is often much less severe than in canon, I think it's realistic for behavior such as using the stinging hex casually on friends or partner to be considered socially acceptable. Whether that makes it right or not isn't always the point with fanfics. Sometimes it's more about what makes sense in the world.

As well, in many of the fics I've read the way the spell is described makes it so minor that even in this world nobody would consider it domestic violence or assault.

I've found that this sub does not get this at all. Every week or so, you see a new post or comment saying "oooh, X did this, this is insane, this would never fly in the real world!"

Wizards play a sport where they get hit with solid iron balls - it is also their most popular sport. That is recreation to them. They have /fun/ playing it.

They have much higher tolerances and thresholds for pain than normal real life people. That which is considered life threatening in the real world is a minor inconvenience to them.

**** The issue is, while some laws draw the line when it comes to leaving a mark, does that mean that /the Wizarding World's/ laws do? Healing means that injuries get dealt with faster. It might even be argued that, since it's something so easily fixable by a witch or wizard with a healing spell, it "doesn't" leave a mark.

The abilities are /different/. The technology is /different/. The laws are /different/. The /culture/ is /different/, and /all of that/ influences how acceptable - or unacceptable - things like that would seem to the average child. All of these factors should be considered. Simply applying our values and morals without consideration is a bland, uninteresting approach to worldbuilding that completely ignores that the way things work for us /would not/ be the way things work for wizards with access to magic. The abilities at their disposal make it impossible for that.

******* For sure, (wallball was my jam) but you have to remember a couple of things; one of the three most reviled curses only causes pain, and leaves no marks. There is a definite limit somewhere.

Second, these juvenile games aren't really acceptable as adults. Does the pain get worse an adult? No of course not. One would hope the adults would have a better understanding that even if there is no physical mark, pain is an issue all of its own. The adults we do see playing these types of games is considered immature at best and abusive / mentally unstable at worst.

The way this matches up with the magical world is likely skewed, but the universal hate for the cruciatus curse means that pain is given consideration when discussing immoral behaviors.

*** Getting kicked in the balls was a pretty regular part of going to public school. Getting towel whipped could hurt pretty bad too lol.

One key thing to all of this is that fanon stingy hexes/jinxes seem to be quite different than the canon stinging jinx, at least in the stories that I've read. @OP seems to be missing that. It seems to be more of a light slap/pinch rather than the very painful sting with lots of swelling in canon. Technically both can work simultaneously- just look at Expelliarmis. Depending on how much power you put behind it, it can simply knock a wand out of someone's hand or it can slam someone into a wall with enough force to knock them out. That could easily work with the stinging jinx.

Also, in regards to friends or partners hurting each other, it really depends on the people and the relationship between them. If you're writing a Harry that's suffering from some kind of PTSD from an abusive childhood, then obviously he wouldn't be okay with someone who reacts violently/hurts him, especially over small things (even if it is something like a pinch or a light slap). But I'll use myself as an example of the opposite. I had a friend in high school, and we did a lot of stupid shit. We once had a competition to see who could last longer having their hand burned by a magnifying glass in the Sun. Another time we waterboarded each other, and once I lost a bet and had to let him slap me as hard as he could across the face (it fuckin' hurt). I also paid him five bucks to put his dick in marinara sauce, which apparently hurts a lot. Point being, casual pain between friends is fairly normal so long as everyone involved is cool with it. I won't even get into the fact that BDSM is a thing between partners since this post isn't really about sexual violence, but it's a good example of consensual pain between partners.

All that being said, as stated in a comment above, the wizarding world's culture is quite different than our own, especially in terms of injury and harm. While I definitely don't agree with child abuse being okay under any circumstances (eg Neville being dropped out a window and Molly hitting Fred with a broom when he was a kid), friends doing stupid shit to each other is different. In Hogwarts kids get into fights and cast jinxes, hexes, and curses at each other often enough. While these aren't the same as friends messing around and are treated like actual fights, it's never considered a big deal because, quite frankly, it's not. The spells they use are generally pretty minor compared to what we see Death Eaters use, or plenty of fanon combat spells. The stinging jinx as portrayed in fanfics is less severe than pretty much anything we see in the school fights in canon, so I don't think anyone would treat it as a big deal at all.

With Expelliarmis, we see it go from simply knocking the wand out of someone's hand to throwing the person against a wall hard enough to knock them out.

** The problem at its most basic seems to be that JKR "invented" two spells and called them basically the same thing.

The first, from /Order of the Phoenix/ is a minor offensive spell that causes mild pain, localized swelling, and reddening of the skin.

The second is a much more aggressive spell that should probably be more rightly named the Anaphylaxis Jinx or Swelling Jinx. The debilitating pain would be caused by the rapid, massive swelling in the target area.

I imagine that there are some relationships wherein the /OOTP/ spell wouldn't be taboo but it's not for me.

Someone who used the second spell against me should expect both a termination of our relationship and reciprocation of some sort that may or may not include burning their home down.

** Huh... Oops. I just wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i0a9pn/harry_potter_thug_life/fzp9lnp/][a snippet in which Mobster!Hermione and Ron were punishing Draco for informing on them about the dragon, and Hermione shot him in the eye with one]]. I should probably fix that.

** Seriously guys it's just unethical to use a stinging jinx anywhere in your fic if it does not pertain to kink. If so stop kink shaming the kink fics using stinging jinxes in a playful manner ALSO think of adding your own non-canon, less painful jinxes of your own into fics, for example use psychological horror elements to make a non painful attack mentally painful. My favorite is the knee reversal hex concept where your knees aren't in any pain but you are unable to move immediately after and it breaks someone's will to live a little bit.

MUCH better than a welt overall.

*** There's no rule that we're only allowed to write about healthy relationships. A lot of canon characters are so messed up, it seems likely that they'd have unhealthy relationships.

**** Well duh, yes, but the problem is people writing unhealthy relationships and not realizing it's unhealthy! It's spreading problematic depictions. Like how all those stupid romance movies have made men think stalking and not taking no for an answer is romantic too.

***** Now you're making it the responsibility of fanfic writers to fix the real world's domestic violence problem by writing only examples of healthy relationships, which is ridiculous. It's never been fiction's job to provide the world with only wholesome examples for readers to imitate. We're not writing instruction manuals, we're writing fiction.

***** So you advocate censorship? World is dysfunctional and stories who ignore this too often end up as boring or self-righteous reads. I find some of the gory fight scenes disturbing but I don't try to tell the authors they shouldn't write it.
