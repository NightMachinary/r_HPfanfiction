I was thinking about this lately. I've been reading The Arithmancer, and I really like it because the characters and situations read as both very realistic but, importantly, as very AGE-APPROPRIATE.

I am an adult now so maybe I'm looking back at HP canon with the wrong eyes, so to speak, but I was thinking. PS/SS is very firmly a children's story. Yes Harry is an abused child; but we meet moral Harry, loyal Ron, and wide-eyed muggleborn Hermione, and they become our friends too. Skip 7 years later; and that same Hermione is literally being tortured by being CUT INTO with a knife, by the Harry Potter world's equivalent of a racial supremacist. That's heavy going for a book originally aimed at 11 and 12-year olds.

What got me thinking about it though is that present and future kids reading the series won't have time to 'grow up' in between reading the books. They aren't going to age with them. So anyone reading the books one after the other in one sitting might be a bit disturbed or upset with where the story goes and what happens to the characters JK makes you love so well. With all the deaths that happen in DH sometimes it makes you miss out on the lesser disturbing stuff when you think back on it.

What does anyone else think? Sometimes looking back at canon after fanfic, much as I love it, I do worry that bits of it might not have been well thought-through.


** I feel like JKR started with a children's tale in mind, but then wrote a story which grew up with that starting base, with harry, so could make it darker and add deeper themes.

just me though

*** Isn't that the whole point? We grew up with Harry, it was one of the series main selling points...

**** Mm, that's kinda my point though. That works for us; the Harry Potter generation; but for future kids the parents will have to maybe think twice about giving their kid the series to read as a boxset.

***** I am planning to give my kid one book each year from their 11th birthday on. - if they are anything like me as child they will not wait and borrow the books from the library, though.

*** Yup. Exact opposite of Star Wars, really. Lucas spent 30 years making a movie series for 8 year olds- by the time he was done, the original fans were complaining.

Rowling made the tone and style mature along with her readers.

** Books 1-3 were clearly for tweens and early teens. 4-7 were aimed at square at the newish YA category. They were written latter and logically seem aimed at the same readers, as you say. I'd still suggest most kids ten or older could handle it, all the way through the series.

People do die "on camera", get tortured, and deal with really heavy issues. Given those themes, the series could be comfortably classed as YA in all but the stuffiest library systems, as even the early books don't talk down to the reader and deal with tough issues -- a major reason the series was so subversive and became so famous in the first place. Some people argue that Young Adult novels means late teens, but they are stupid. The people claiming that, not the teens. Not /just/ the teens.

Late teen readers are off finding the smuttiest stuff they can in the mystery and fantasy/sci-fi sections of the library with their new adult library cards. Or, this generation, on Amazon Unlimited with their Kindles.

** Ehh, none of it really bothered me when I read it. Bearing in mind that I was given the entire series as a gift shortly after DH came out, and I was around 12 at the time.

I read through all of them in a couple of months and the final book didn't really bother me. Granted I didn't quite understand some of the finer points, but it certainly wasn't disturbing.

That's mostly because the last book /isn't/ aimed at 11/12 year olds. It's aimed at 17 year olds. The fact that kids can read all the books back to back now doesn't change how JKR originally meant for them to be read.

** I've noticed the same thing about a lot of other, lighter series actually. Until I was a young teen for example, I could not get through the high school aged books of the Betsy-Tacy series. Now, reading the earlier ones is so incredibly boring. I personally like those kinds of series, because there is so much more depth you can get when you're older.

** I love Doctor Who myself almost as much as Potter, and I feel like there is the same question. What is the audience of a story that's fantastical but strives to explore many complex themes like love and the nature of evil? I thinks he two series are similar, though Who has the advantage of thirty more years of existence, but Potter is more famous. I think I would keep loving Potter ten years from now just as much as I did ten years ago, but the appeal would be different. I think that Who and Potter both draw a young audience and can keep us in love with the series because of the complexity of the stories. I hope this means Potter ages as well as, if not better, than Doctor Who.
