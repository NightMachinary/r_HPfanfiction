I am a long time user of ffn.net and I'm stagnating in most of the same fics at the moment (happens to the best of us).

I want to start using AO3 but struggle with user friendly-ness as I use my android for all my fanfic needs.

My question is: How do you access Ao3 if you're reading on your phone? Do you use just a browser or are there some half decent apps out there like for ffn.net?

Any suggestions/help is always appreciated! Cheers buckos


** Just browse on the internet site works better than any apps I've found (I'm an android user)

** I also use browser.

One question though: what app do you use for ffn? Cause the official ffn App sure as hell doesn't work for me

*** I had a really good app on iPhone before I switched to android that I miss dearly. I use the official ffn app on Android and I have to admit I've never had any issues with it. The mobile ffn.net webpages are still pretty decent though I have to say

** I use the browser. It's almost as good as the desktop version

** Android. Browser.

When I'm looking for fics I use my computer because it's easier to use the search function when you can see everything clearly. I search by exclusion... Tapping out what I don't want rather than highlighting what I do. I get better results that way.

But for reading I just use the browser on my phone.

** I find the fic I want to read in my browser on my phone. Definitely easier than any app. Then usually download them to my phone. I'm an iPhone user so it goes straight to my books app. I'm not sure how it works on Android.

** Firefox with [[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages][Reader mode]], but mostly I download EPubs with [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][FanFicFare]]. Generally I think AO3 has hugely more readable web than FFnet, but that's probably just an opinion.
