Hi All,

I am looking for some fanfiction with good quality Dumbledore. Not necessarily Dumbledore-centic but where he is funny, powerful, good, protective or badass in some way.

I am not looking for Dumbledore bashing fica but something that I can read and think "hell yeah Dumbledore!"

Thanks


** I give you “Last Chance” (linkffn(4457149)). Have fun with it.

** So..... This story is a huge crossover, with a Harry so OP it actually gets kind of boring, but the Dumbledore in this fic is so funny I almost died laughing. This is really the epitome of not-giving-a-shit Dumbledore. Linkffn(itachi, is that a baby?)

Also, the crossover parts aren't super relevant, so you can skim/skip them.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

Even though it's not exactly what you asked for, I'll take any opportunity I can to recommend [[http://letterblade.net/thirty-five_owls.html][Thirty-Five Owls]]. It's a correspondence between an imprisoned Gellert Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore, and the writing is top notch.

** I've written several stories where Dumbledore shows why he is the only one Voldemort ever feared, matching wands and wits with the Dark Lord in a chessgame of moves and countermoves, both on the political front and in the field. I generally write him a tad more ruthless and a tad more protective of his students than in canon. A man weighted down by his past mistakes, but willing to do what's right rather than what's easy - and willing to kill rather than let others shoulder that burden. He's a central character in "Patron", together with Aberforth, in "Uncle Quentin's Spy", "The Dark Lord Never Died" and in "Divided and Entwined".

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
