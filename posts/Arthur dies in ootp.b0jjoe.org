** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/][A Cadmean Victory by Darkness Enthroned]]

Not only does this contain what you are looking for, but it is my favourite fic of all time. It starts at the beginning of fourth year so it will take awhile to get to Christmas in ootp, but it is very well done.

**** It's not just you, the ending was rather odd. That said, that doesn't mean it is bad. It fits the theme of the story very well, it even meshes with the title. "A Cadmean victory" is after all, a victory at the cost of one's own ruin.

**** Author wrote a short epilogue to finalize it. It's on his profile in FN, easier to digest.
