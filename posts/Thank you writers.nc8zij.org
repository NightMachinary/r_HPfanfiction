To all the fanfic writers out there, thank you for writing and sharing your work.

Aside from the new ideas and fun that I get from your work there is a greater benefit for me.

Reading your stories allows me an outside perspective on thoughts and feelings I am having. It often helps me see things more clearly and learn to consider aspects of my psyche that would otherwise just sit in my mind or subconscious eating away at any chance for happiness.

HP fanfics are so numerous that I can usually find at least a few for whatever mood I am in or whatever idea I feel a need to explore.

It has been lovely, and sometimes heartbreaking or infuriating, exploring so much of what comes with being human through your stories set in this fandom and the vast universe of fan-created content.

Again, thank you.

** It is weird, on its own the Harry Potter series is not really that special. It happened to catch the public eye and achieve fame and fortune, but from a purely technical standpoint, there are so many children's books out there which are just as good, or better.

Yet the contribution that it has made to human society in inspiring others to think and imagine and to write is almost unmatched. For some reason (IMO probably something to do with the shear number of plot holes) it seems to have caught the imagination of fanfiction writers like nothing else. While some of this is frankly [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Snapewives][horrifying]], it has still allowed countless people, both writers and readers, to indulge in their creativity and just enjoy life. While I doubt that this was what JKR intended, I feel it is far more important than anything which people just read and put down could be.

*** I don't know about the first half.

I still to this day have yet to find any YA/children's books with as cast of characters as good as Rowling. Individual characters, yes, but the whole cast? No. Not at all.

And while I have read better worldbuilding, I rarely see it in the whimsy way she writes it. It's almost always much darker in tone and serious.

Her mystery elements of the first few books are a rarity in children/ya fantasy too. Most are 'boy/girl has to save the world' with no hidden element or mystery to solve.

Add all three of these together and you get a very unique series that deserves praise. I still can't find much in the way of YA novels that have the overall great quality HP has, even though the technical writing might be better.

**** I'd have to say anything by Rick Riordan is better. It's actually planned from the beginning, or at least more so than HP was, so you don't get clear plotholes like the absence of Apparition in the early books.

The cast of characters is /far/ better. The supporting characters in all his books are actually characterized, rather than the rather weak characterization that I feel HP suffers from. Sure, the Weasleys, Hermione, and Ron are well developed supporting characters, but Draco is a poorly developed bully stereotype at best, the Death Eaters don't have a well-developed or convincing motivation, and half the Order are just names.

The whimsy in HP is pretty great, admittedly, but that's about the only part that's well done in the worldbuilding. I get that's it's a soft magic system, but a lot of the worldbuilding is just facades, without depth. Ooh, Grindelwald was evil, and he was a far more impactful Dark Lord, but nobody ever talks about him. Voldemort and his ilk are poorly motivated at best, and he's a stereotypical Dark Lord, who does everything a Dark Lord shouldn't.

The mystery of PJ is better than the mystery of HP, by far. Most of the mystery in SS is just them waiting to get exposition from Hagrid, whereas the LT prophecy sort of leaves you guessing until the last moment.

HP is most definitely a middling series with some standout elements that got hella lucky.

***** I completely disagree.

The characters are not nearly as complex. You don't get debates if so and so is a good person, as you do with Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore and Snape. I've never felt connected to the characters as I did for HP.

Nor do I think the series covers the same emotional impacts as HP. The books don't mature as you go on. Each series is written for the same ages with similar storylines.

I also feel like there is significantly less loss as well. Percy never really loses anyone he cares about. All the secondary characters survive. Luke is the only somewhat gray interesting and debatable character with a tragic storyline.

Lastly, HP is one of the best plotted YA series I've seen in ages. If you reread the first couple books you see the major hints she was dropping about plot lines not revealed until the last couple books. Yeah some magic is inconsistent, but actual plot, nah. Plus apparation appears in the very first hp chapter, so idk what you are talking about.

This being said, I've only read the first two series with Percy, none of the other series in the world. I never wanted to. So perhaps they are better and more impactful.

Now, I don't think these are bad books at all. In fact, they are some of the better YA. They just didn't resonate with me as HP did.

****** Just like HP, Percy Jackson gets more gritty towards the end, though not as gritty.

Rick does have loss in Percy Jackson series as well. You said you just read the two first books so you don't know about that and I won't spoil them to you. While the characters that die in Rick's book are secondary, just like HP, they are far more meaningful. Again, I will not spoil this to you. The next installments, there is more loss though it doesn't affect Percy as much because there are many other main characters.

If HP was released later around 2005-2010 it wouldn't be half as popular as it is now. The series popularity comes more from nostalgia and how it was the first read of the genre for many people.

******* I read the first two /series/ not the first two books. I believe that is about ten books. I can't remember any death being that impactful for me, nor the story getting much darker. It has been quite a few years since I've read them though.

As for HP being popular in the mid 2000s...I think it still would be quite popular as it was very unique. Especially as HP massively changed the YA and fantasy industries (before no one thought kids would read 250 plus pages). As popular though, I'd agree with you. The rise of the internet played a large roll. Nostalgia may be a reason why it's /still/ popular but not the reason it gained popularity in the first place.

******** Oh god you are right. I am sorry, my brain parsed this as /first two books./

I mean, it's a matter of opinion and preferences I guess. It tells a lot that the only death really impactful for me in HP was Hedwig's and Lupin (for the only reason of leaving a child behind).

Then in PJ, we have Zoe, Pan, Luke. And in the Heroes of Olympus series, we have the titan and the giant. Foes bear arms to the Doors of Death.

You got what I meant about it's popularity, the only reason HP has so much fanfiction is because it released at the advent of the digital era, people had a outlet to better express themselvesz

And yep, we all got preferences. Zoe was the only one that I felt anything for in PJ, while Sirius, Dumbledore, Lupin/Tonks and Fred were all tragic for me. I remember almost crying when reading Harry seeing his parents before walking to his death.

******** Why do you think she failed at transitioning to YA? I think she handled it beautifully. Topics became more mature, characters had questionable choices and the characters overall matured and changed. It's still better then most YA fantasy with star-crossed lovers, Gary and Mary sues and predictable plot lines.

Also, pretty sure I read somewhere that the original process for creating Horcruxes involved eating the corpse of the murder victim, but the publishers cut it since it was /too/ gory.

********* She failed at transitioning because the early books still exist. Unless for some reason you take books in a series independently, you have to carry forwards all of the Roald Dahlesque parts of the early books into the 'serious' setting of the final ones, which is the root of most of the bashing fics. This along with generally poor planning gutted what little world building she did through an utter lack of internal consistency.

*** I think a lot of it is because there is an astounding amount of worldbuilding in the HP series, all following the tried and true [[https://fritzfreiheit.com/wiki/Iceberg_style_of_worldbuilding#:%7E:text=In%20the%20%22iceberg%20style%22%20of,keyhole%20effect%22%20is%20generated][iceberg style]]. There are names and hints and references and books and spells and people and this whole big world... but almost nothing is explained in great detail, because we are reading from Harry's perspective. So all those little details that don't get fleshed out? Well, you can expand on it in fanfiction.

Also, JK's magic system and worldbuilding is internally consistent.... but only for the book in question. Why is Dumbledore flying to London on a broom? Why aren't timeturners all over the place given they can allow you to be in two places at once for hours every day? Why are certain spells used in specific situations but never brought up again? This is incredibly frustrating for a savvy reader, and once you get to book 7 you start to wonder why the adults were so incompetent in book 1....

Which leads me to the adults being incompetent. The Ministry is either woefully incompetent given what we see school children able to accomplish, or corrupt as hell, or both. Dumbledore is simultaneously a puppetmaster and supreme doofus. Sure, it's a trope in children's stories, but you can fill a lot of plot holes by just making everyone over the age of 17 somewhat more rational, and I'd argue you can tell a good story about kids solving problems even if the adults know what they're doing.

So yeah, combine all that along with the fact that Harry Potter is one of the best selling series of all time and the advent of the internet and nerd culture in general being more socially acceptable and you get a big ol' pile of people using the characters and world to tell their versions of certain stories.

*** For me, visual art is more of a feeling piece, something that captures a moment or fixed mood.

Written pieces usually move through time, or show different aspects of something through different passages. There is more of a “development” feel, even if there is no actual development.

Hmm, so maybe a short single experience vs seeing something happen over days or years.

**** I just wrote out a whole spiel about art, ans fandom, and accidentally deleted it because I'm the worst (and it became really apparent I haven't needed out in so long) but I actually got into fanfic through art because I was researching something, so the differences and similarities of this kind of feedback have been something I've thought about a lot.

In the end I think the biggest difference isn't actually how I'm making the work or even how people are responding, because I'm pretty much using very similar parts of myself, which I generally express no matter whether I'm making a cake or writing smut or embroidering words into linen, but there's this whole highbrow lowbrow thing going on.

While esp in HP there seem to be quite a lot of authors who take this kind of writing very seriously and I'm in no way disparaging them, the history of this medium and fandom itself is considered trashy and even taboo, and because of that foundation and a general expectation and acceptance of anonymity I think people are more likely to say things about what the work makes them feel, where are even people who know the highbrow label on visual art is bullshit and the art market is distressingly artificial, people feel like they have to use certain language to communicate their response.

If I ever have another remission I would be doing a masters project on it, because I find it really awesome and interesting!

But also the point you said about time is a really interesting one. One of the reasons I do post my work is because it has become quite a visible record of my health's deterioration as well as several discoveries about myself, and as I don't have much visual art anymore because my hands are so sore all the time, it's been very valuable to me for that reason, even if the very marked failure of my brain annoys the shit out of my readers sometimes because spelling and grammar annoy certain people a lot

Oh sorry this has apparently turned into another spiel!
