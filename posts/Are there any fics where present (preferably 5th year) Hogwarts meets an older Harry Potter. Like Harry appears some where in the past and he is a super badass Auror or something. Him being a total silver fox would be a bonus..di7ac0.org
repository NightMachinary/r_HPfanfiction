What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in OOTP. No paradox.*What We Lost* is the sister fic without time-travel.

Seing as (I'm pretty sure it's cannon) magic people live way longer natural lifespans, it's quite probable that menopause comes lateer (or there is a spell that fixes/delays it)

***** It's actually mentioned in the fic. She started menopause but still gets pregnant with his last child. Also James' parents had him really late in life, like very late, so it's totally possible for witches to get pregnant later than muggles according to canon.

  What happens when Harry Potter at age 29 is transported back in time with his family by a meddling phoenix? Well, when four of his kids are metamorphmagus, his better half is Andromeda Black and his sister-in-law, Narcissa Malfoy is on their side; the Wizarding World will not know what hit them. Begins in Prisoner of Azkaban, the start of book 3.

** Book three in the Dark Prince Trilogy, Deepest Reflections, by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1034541/Kurinoone][Kurinoone]] fits this request pretty well. linkffn(3959072)

It is the third book though, and the other two don't fit this theme at all. That said, this trilogy is one of my all time favorites so I think it'd be worth it to read all of them. xD
