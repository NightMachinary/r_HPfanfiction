** I could be wrong but I believe in the novel it's implied that only Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students who were of age to enter even traveled to Hogwarts.

So presumably huge, as Harry would be at Hogwarts. Which would make his 'I didn't put my name in' defense even better as he was, you know, not on the continent.

Assuming Moody is still hired as Dumbledore may have wanted more security given he likely would have been with the students at whatever school the tournament was held, it would probably make it fairly easy for Crouch to get Harry to trust him then kidnap him whenever for the ritual.

*** As far as the contract is concerned, HARRY can say a huge number of times he did not enter, it would not change the fact that his name has been chosen by the Goblet and so bound by the magical contract. The Boy Who Lived will never be just Harry.

** I don't think any teachers besides the school headmasters went to the Tournament so Harry would be left at Hogwarts with Crouch trying a different plan to get him to the graveyard, Dumbledore would be absent and McGonagall would be in charge

** The age restriction, if I recall correctly, was Dumbledore's idea. But that's just me being a know it all as Harry would still most likely be left at Hogwarts.

Unless Dumbledore sends McGongall in his stead, that leaves Hogwarts, and Harry, pretty vulnerable. BCJ could sneak in, kidnap an unsuspecting 14 year old, and sneak out.

But if you're trying to see how to get Harry in the TWT, imperiused Karkaroff or Dumbledore feels uncomfortable leaving Harry vulnerable.

** Well the crux of the problem is whenever Voldemort needed Harry to be tested by the Tournament for his ritual as an element or optimisation ? Because even at Hogwarts with Dumbledore it would have been easy for Crouch to kidnap him. I don't recall if in Canon there was any mention about Harry needing to do the task for the power of the blood forcibly taken to be supercharged.

But it would have changed nothing after, the British ministry would still stick its head in the sand. And the ICW as always would do nothing to try to reel in the British Ministry of Magic.

** Maybe have it were most of the seventh years are away from school. Only the ones struggling or who are two busy studying (overachievers like percy or Hermione) stayed behind. It starts out with harry thinking it will be a easy year with just school to worry about. The night of holloween harry gets a bad feeling and in the morning g he gets called to the headmaster's office becaus this name came out of the cup. It's actually moody at the school and Barty is polyjuiced as a teacher from the school they are hosting from. People are in an uproar because they know there is no way he put his name in the cup being in a different country.

** A bunch of 17 year olds travel with Dumbledore. Minerva stays in charge at Hogwarts. Assuming Moody is still Hired as DADA teacher, Crouch Jr and Riddle don't need an overly complicated plan to kidnap Harry now.

So I'd say it's a pretty big change. Crouch Jr can just vanish with Harry and Dumbledore could be none the wiser for ages, unless you know, some serious deus ex machina.

** presumably harry would get a chill school year for once, unless theres another fanatical death eater at one of the other schools, remember Karkaroff had no intention of returning to voldemort after giving up his fellow death eaters
