I'm looking to read more Marauder Stories, but the thing is people tend to ignore Peter Pettigrew, as though he weren't a Marauder.

He did betray them and have them end up dead, while leaving Sirius to Azkaban, but he was with them.

He became an Animagus, something that is said to be difficult, much like a Patronus, he might have struggled with it (who knows), but he was still able to do it.

No Remus is super addicted to chocolate, I see that a bit too much with Marauder stories... it was funny at first, but a bit too much after a while. Much like the twin speak with Fred and George, funny at first, but annoying after a while.

Peter can be smart in some classes, bad at others, be a ladies man, make sarcastic remarks, just something where Peter is used more in a Marauder's centered story.

Peter doesn't have to be the main character, but he has to be more then just simply mentioned occasionally.

Can be as Canon or as AU as possible.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.


** I'm surprised no one has mention Prince of Slytherin yet, so I guess it's my turn. Pettigrew plays a larger role there as solicitor/ lawyer/ barrister for James Potter. (I'm not from the UK and I never did bother to learn the difference). He's also secretly evil and smart on the side.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I can't recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2658132/1/Happy-Birthday-Mr-Dark-Lord][Happy birthday Mr Dark Lord]] (Linkffn(2658132)) enough, be patient and wait for Wormtail to show up, he gets his moment, even if the start is rather bizarre. It's short, so you won't be out that much time.

There's another lovely fic I don't have bookmarked/can't find,, so alas, no link, in which Pettigrew goes back in time and seeks redemption, he's still /him/, he's just not a brave person at all, but it works out to a lovely story. Longer than the above. Perhaps someone else knows it?

  ONE SHOT. Lord Voldemort announces that he's going to celebrate his birthday with Sugar Quills, PintheBeakontheHippogriff, and Death Eaters in hula skirts. Has he finally lost his mind?

** Impose linkffn(11732213)

Year 3 of the Innocent linkffn(9469064) series. With Sirius free and raising Harry, 3rd year is a bit different than canon. Wormtail had hooked back up with Voldemort earlier and makes a suggestion to the Dark Lord, collect the Hallows. He happens to remember a cloak his old friend had, and has a pretty good idea who has it now. Peter's fairly competent. Infiltrates Hogwarts, uses the RoR as a base of operations, captures the kids, defeats Sirius...

  It was still called the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black", though it had been years since any of the Blacks that approved of that name had lived there. Sirius Black would be a disappointment to his parents, but Harry Potter - the home's other resident - was a credit to his. Both were proud of that. Sequel to "Innocent", "Initiate" and "Identity".

** I really like the Peter from Anthem and The Hell Where Youth and Laughter Go. He's very insecure, but also funny and falls in love and has issues with his family and his interaction with James, Remus and Sirius all differ. The later part is completed, the school one is wip (updated yesterday). The school one has more Peter chapters. The second story is AU.

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from December 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.
