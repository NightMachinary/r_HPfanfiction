"He's seeing someone else?" Harry's jaw dropped as he stared at his friend Ron.\\
Ron nodded, mangling his Stetson, scuffling his feet, blushing.\\
"God damn!" he swore, throwing his own hat down.\\
Glaring at Ron, he shook a finger in his direction. "I want to know every detail and every god-damn name!"

"Draco's dating someone named 'Alex' and he's from Sweden, I think," Ron replied quickly, as Harry bent down to retrieve his battered hat. "They've been seeing each other for about three months, according to Ginny." Ron's little sister Ginny was Draco's personal assistant, so of course she would know everything about his private life, who he had contact with and etcetera. "Draco's holding some kind of black-tie affair tonight. That Alex person should be there." Harry nodded.

"Good. We're going. Now." He spun on his heel and started for his truck. Ron gaped at his friend.

"Wh... wait! Harry!" Ron cried, taking off after him. Harry was already in the truck when Ron yanked the door open and scrambled in. "Harry, you're mad! Absolutely starkers!" Harry looked at him and he threw the truck into gear and hit the gas. The expression on his face was the one Ron had been hoping to see for the last ten years. "Let's go knock that bastard down!"

//Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots\\
And ruined your black tie affair.\\
Last one to know, last one to show\\
I was the last one you thought you'd see there//

"This is the place," Ron said, peering out of the window at the mansion. It was drizzling a little outside as Harry pulled the truck into the massive driveway of the house. Floodlights lit up the Romanesque facade of the building, but it reflected off the white-wash onto the fifteen or so limousines parked in front of the house. "Looks fancy," he murmured as they parked a little away so as not to draw attention. Another limousine pulled in behind them and drove up to the house. The driver got out, and rounded the nose of his car. Harry and Ron exited the truck as the driver opened the door of the limo. "Look, Hermione and Ginny just arrived," Ron said, touching Harry's shoulder to draw his attention to the new arrivals.

"Good," Harry replied. "We're right on time then. Let's go." They proceeded quickly up to the double doors. He pushed them open, and strode boldly into the hall. Everywhere around him was monochromatic color, and Harry's dark blue flannel shirt, light blue stonewashed jeans, black boots and white Stetson stood out. Ron walked in meekly behind him, green flannel shirt, blue jeans like Harry's, black boots standing out just as much. He whipped his black Stetson off his head in deference to all the women in the room staring at them in surprise. The live band, only now coming aware of the interruption faltered to a halt.

//And I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes\\
When I took his glass of champagne\\
And I toasted you, said "Honey we may be through,\\
But you'll never hear me complain...//

"You Alex?" Harry demanded of the tall blonde standing next to his ex. The man, swallowed and nodded. Harry looked at Draco, whose expression of stunned and shocked surprise was exquisite. He sauntered up to the Draco's new flame. He tensed, and Harry could read the fear there in those clear blue eyes, and smirked ever so slightly. He reached out and pulled the flute of champagne from his nerveless fingers. Stepped back a bit, and raised his glass mockingly to Draco. "This is to you. We may be through, but you will never hear me complain about it, sugar." He then winked, and downed the champagne. "Aw, that was horrible. How you drink that horse piss is beyond me! C'mon Ron. Let's go somewhere they serve /real/ drinks." He handed the now-empty glass back to the tall Swede and turned on his heel. Ron jammed his hat back on his head and followed Harry out.

"Damn Harry," Ron said as they neared the truck. "I think Draco's jaw hit the floor!" Harry smirked.

"It better have," Harry replied as they climbed in. "That really was a disgusting drink!" Both men laughed, the truck exiting the driveway.

//'Cause I've got friends in low places\\
Where the whiskey runs and the beer chases\\
My blues away, I'll be OK.\\
And I'm not big on social graces Think I'll slip on down to the oasis\\
'Cause I've got friends... in low places!//

Draco stormed into what had to have been the seventh bar that night. He glared around as the man at the door checked his I.D., seeing not a hell of a lot past the men packed into the place, and the peelers on the platform. One glance at his clothing, and two waitresses immediately were at his side. He waved them away. Slowly, Draco made a slow round of the room, made even slower as the peeler on the stage tried to catch his attention with some very interesting moves.

\Maybe I'll have some poles installed in the bedroom,\ he thought, watching the woman slide down the pole, upside down. Shrugging it off, he returned to his cruise around the room. Then he spotted them, in a booth tucked away in the corner. Ron looked smashed as he was laughing uproariously and spilling his beer. At least, Draco thought it was beer. He made his way to them.

"Oi, look," Ron cried over the music, spotting the very disgruntled and not-entirely pleased Draco. "It's Malfoy." The disgust and contempt was both audible and visible. Harry looked up at him with a blurry expression and a stupid smile.

"Ah, the snake hath returneth," Harry quoted accurately. "How's your beau?" he sneered, as the waitress came back to them with new drinks, and took the empties away. "Waitress, bring the Ice Queen here a whiskey. Double." The waitress glanced sideways at Draco, but shrugged and left.

"I don't want your double whiskey," Draco snarled. "What the fuck were you doing at my party?" Harry looked over at Ron.

"That was a /party/?" he asked loudly. "Seemed more like a god-damned funeral to me!" Both men cracked up while Draco glared furiously at them. Suddenly, both men sobered as if they had not touched a single drop of alcohol all night.

//Well, I guess I was wrong,\\
I just don't belong\\
But then, I've been there before\\
everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight\\
and I'll show myself to the door\\
Hey, I didn't mean to cause a big scene\\
Just give me an hour and then,\\
I'll be as high as that ivory tower\\
that you're living in//

"Fuck off Draco Malfoy," Harry snarled. "What we had is over. We just don't work well together, and we never will. We tried it once before we graduated. Remember how that turned out? Crash and burn, baby. Crash and burn. Come on Ron. Lets get you home," he said, urging the drunken Ron out of his seat. Around them, a few of the waitresses noticed that they were leaving the table. Once Ron was shakily standing, one arm around Harry's neck, Harry summoned the waitress. "Call a cab for us, would you lovey?" He winked at her, she blushed and nodded. Turning back to Draco, he shifted his grip on Ron. "Join in the fun, Draco. There's even a seat in chicken choker lane for you." He jerked his chin towards a seat recently vacated at the stage. He began shuffling towards the door.

"You ruined my party, Harry!" Draco insisted, catching up to the pair. "You embarrassed me, you embarrassed Alex, and you embarrassed Hermione and Ginny!" Harry's head snapped towards him, eyes flashing warning signs. Draco saw them too late.

"Come down out of your ivory tower Draco! We're through!" he barked. "I'm sorry if I caused a scene that 'embarrassed' you; it's least that you would have done for me! Now leave us the fuck alone. We're going to finish our pub crawl. Maybe we can even get as high as the damned ivory tower you seem to be living in." Harry pushed through the crowd, literally dragging Ron down the stairs and out the door. Draco simply stared at them in shock.

//'Cause I've got friends in low places\\
Where the whiskey runs and the beer chases\\
My blues away, I'll be OK.\\
And I'm not big on social graces\\
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis\\
'Cause I've got friends... in low places!//
