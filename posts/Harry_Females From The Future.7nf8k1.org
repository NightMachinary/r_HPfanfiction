  Astoria Greengrass wants to set up Harry Potter with her sister, Daphne. But her plans don't really go the way she wants them to. Not your usual Harry/Daphne/Astoria fic. Rated for some language and some adult content.

*** Honestly I read this and it somewhat goes over my head. Don't get me wrong it's a great read, but I feel like there is something deeper I'm missing.

**** It's a time loop, I think. Astoria is looking at her daughter in the end, thinking that she's going to grow up to travel back in time and marry Harry too. Astoria realizes she and Harry are going to be killed, since her father (Harry) and mother (herself) were killed when she was younger.

At least, I think.

***** Been a while since I read that fic, but IIRC it's quite the opposite, she sees her daughter, and it's NOT her, time is not a loop. She feared that her daughter would be her and all that, but when the girl is two, Astoria realizes that's not the case.

Edit: Just re-read it the ending. Definitely think that's what the author meant.

****** The sequel kinda points it in that direction though. Lily has her parents killed and she travels back in time.

***** I thought that may have been what was implied but it doesn't make sense for a few reasons. Daphne didn't marry Harry and the daughter's name is different.

Astoria makes a pretty big deal about having one eye from each of her parents so then both having heterochromia would disprove a time loop.

**** Astoria is Daphne's daughter with Harry. She goes back in time, and tries to make them days each other.

Daphne is not interested. Astoria ends up dating her own father.
