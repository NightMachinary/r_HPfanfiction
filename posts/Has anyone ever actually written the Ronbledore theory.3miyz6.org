For anyone who doesn't know, it's the fan theory that Ron is a time-traveling Dumbledore (or that Dumbledore is a time-traveling Ron).

Are there any fics (oneshots or long fics) that explore this?


** Oh man, thanks for clueing me in on this theory. It is some of the most hilariously out-there bullshit I've read in awhile.

  1. Foreshadowing

  Ron makes it very clear on several occasions that he hates the color maroon. Could it be because he will eventually be ‘marooned' in time?

  In OotP, Draco composes a lovely song -- Weasley is Our King. If that isn't foreshadowing, I don't know what is. One line in particular is given significance by Draco. He is heard singing it loudly during the game by Harry, and Draco later quotes it in italics -- born in a bin. While Draco likes to make fun of Ron's poverty, the phrase has a double meaning. ‘Bin' is also a prefix meaning ‘double' or ‘two' -- think ‘binary'. Was Ron ‘born' twice? Leading a double life? Is Draco trying to tell us something important?

You couldn't make this shit up if you tried.
