** Yes. A good story is a good story and when it was posted/completed doesn't impact whether or not I review.

*** Yes, I feel the same way. I don't care if a story is old, I will do my best to leave a review.

** One of the reasons I prefer AO3 is that it allows threaded discussion on reviews. FFnet “one review and that's it” is horribly limiting.

*** Yeah that's definitely true. Though sometimes If I leave a review and had trouble understanding a certain thing in the story I will pm them privately about it, though rather the author answers often depends.

** I regard reviews of WIPs as a way to help keep the author motivated so I'll usually leave them every so often. All of my best encounters with authors have come from leaving thoughtful reviews. Also my worst encounters with authors, but I guess that's the rough with the smooth.

If a story is WIP but I just read 50000 chapters to catch up or it's finished then it'll be one review at the end unless there's something I particularly want to say.

** If the author is still active, yeah. If there has been no activity in years I don't bother.

Also if a fic is completed I'm only gonna review it as a whole, not chapter by chapter.

** I have to have either like it a lot and if it didn't have a lot of reviews, I might give one so it's found easier (also might give one if I liked it a lot). Or if I think it was good idea and would have liked it but it wasn't well written (wrong grammar) or had some spacing issues well basically issues that would make it really hard to read the story, I would usually give a review to give constructive critism, so the writer would know that those issues should be looked up to ease of readin it.. But I never give negative reviews, only good critisism so author can fix up things that might be unintentional or impact if other would read the story etc..

** I once left a comment about the writing quality and over all story of a fic that hadn't been updated since 2004, this was a month ago. A good story is a good story!

** I only leave review if I have more to say than ‘I liked it' or ‘good work' and that applies to complete works, one-shots and wips alike. If it's a complete story or a multi-chaptered wip that I cached up with, I would leave a comment on the last published chapter with my overall thought on the work.

*** Wow, imagine working hard on a story only for the reviewer to leave a review, not because they liked it, but because they hated it.

In that case, if you absolutely felt the need to tell them, I would PM them privately.

Writers of fanfiction are not paid, they get very little credit, only the ones a lot of people like, or are controversial enough, constantly seem to get recommended or talked about.

Giving a person concrete criticism is fine, but if all you have to say is stuff that you disliked/hate, it'd be better doing that more in private with them, and if they say something like criticism is welcome.

**** ...at no point in that sentence did I say I told them the story was terrible. And the invitation for any sort of criticism was when they posted the story, but thanks?

Your comment makes it sound like you reviewed it and told them their story was terrible.
