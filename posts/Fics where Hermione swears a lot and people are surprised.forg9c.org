As the title says, I just want to see some fics where Hermione swears a lot or particularly creatively/emphatically and the others are surprised by her vocabulary. It's amusing.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Thanks in advance. :)

*** Heh. You updated that comment real quick. Noice find. :)

It's also a fair point. Wizards only seem to have two insults - Mudblood and Dunderhead. They really need some originality. :D

***** True - and that does bring up an interesting note. Why are all the insults Pureblood to Not-Pureblood? There's no insults Muggleborns or Halfbloods get to use against Pureblood types. 'Death Eater' is more of a description than an insult, since pretty much all of the people who get called that actually are one, and 'scum' is a Muggle word too.

Where's the exclusive Wizard anti-pureblood slurs? :D

EDIT - We need to get that person who's doing word-count patterns of Goblin Gold and such throughout the series to do one on Slurs, too. :D

****** I think the reason we have no anti pureblood slurs is because the series as a whole is pretty light on swearing. Except for the slurs, I don't remember anything worse than 'shit' and the Merlin related ones.

****** That's pretty much how the world operates, though. Those in power are the ones who comes up with the racist/sexist/bigoted monikers for those seen as beneath them. That's how the words get enough power behind them to stick. It's why the worst ‚Äòracial slur' against white people is cracker, despite not a single white person in history feeling insulted by it.

******* I mean sure, it's a crap insult, but it still exists. There's also times when old powers and new powers have come into conflict and the new has created slurs for the old as they become beneath them. Plus, if you're one of those people that conflates national/class slurs with ethnic slurs (which would be possible, given how Blood Purity does cross those boundaries with 'Blood Traitors' including lifestyle and traditions/culture as well as consorting with Muggleborns), then there's a significantly larger breadth of resources to draw on there.

(EDIT - changed the word opportunity to resources because I realised that was just a weird fucking phrase to use in this context, egad).

***** I remember a post from like twitter or something yonks ago claiming Rowling meant for Ron to swear a lot more severely & just a lot more than usual but her editor told her to cut it out real quick. It's probably fake but if memory serves Ron is the one who curses the most (stuff like bloody hell, Merlin's various body parts or under clothes, etc. not slurs. Most slurs is probably like,,, Bellatrix)

****** I mean, the worst swear is technically Molly with 'Bitch' in the final battle, but yeah. Bellatrix is probably the most slurs, or Draco Malfoy by dint of being the racist representative for longest/with most screentime.

It wouldn't surprise me if that twitter story was true, though I think the lack of constancy throughout the series is probably indicative that her editor wasn't too present in the actual editing of the book. :D

I love many of this author's other stories too (Men Who Had Mothers is a sentimental favorite - it's very odd though! - Haute Allure is a cute riff on the fashion industry and veelas, and I also love Golden Age, which is the best Hufflepuff story ever), but none as much as this one.
