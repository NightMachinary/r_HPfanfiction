:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm basically looking for fics where Harry either learns of the magical world other than Hagrid, is more abused than he is, or gets different guardians, thus changing how the story progresses. I feel like I've hit a block and I can't really find any fics.

I've read a few where Harry befriends a snake, so I'm interested in those. I've also read a fic ffn(What is Right: Year One), where Harry from an AU timeline goes back in time and is severely traumatized and he's kinda taken care of or whatever with the Malfoys, so that's interesting, as well. There's a fic that I've read, as well, where Snape goes back in time and takes it upon himself to change Harry's future, giving him a magical coral snake called Coral, and Harry being put in Hufflepuff.

I'm also interested in abused Harry fics, too. (P.S. I'm not interested in bio dad Snape unless it fits.)

)Thanks for all the help!


** Welp I can give you my shameless self promotion. AU in magic, with leaning on cannon events. Different teacher and a different acting Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter enters the wizarding world unaware of the dangers that lurk beneath the surface. Struggling in class, he can barely make a feather float, how can he fulfill the destiny everyone expects of him from this? His only hope in tipping the balance in his favor is to delve in the more esoteric magics. With a Harry Potter focused on divination, mind magic and necromancy.

** I really enjoyed the series A Very Slytherin Harry by geoffaree, where Harry discovers that magic exists from a snake, and things diverge from there. linkao3(737220)

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  In a rash act of self-sacrifice, Harry saves a dying Muggle by magically transfering the man's cancer to himself. Now, going through his fifth year with a terrible secret, he begins to realize just what he's given up. H/G, R/Hr. Warning: abuse
