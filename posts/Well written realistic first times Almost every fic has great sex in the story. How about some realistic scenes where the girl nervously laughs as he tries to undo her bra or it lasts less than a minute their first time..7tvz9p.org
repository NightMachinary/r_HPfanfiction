*** I think it really depends on circumstance. I did a bit of studying around for a book I'm working on and found out that most people lasted between one minute and two minutes their first time. I also learned that if it's a quickie, it can last forty seconds if the male is quick.

Even then, if the male is uncut, it can be shortened again because uncut males feel more pleasure than their counterparts. Also, if the male has masturbated before or has masturbated before sex. Even then, I know people that can finish in 30 seconds if they sit the right way and do it fast enough.

I gave this way too much thought.

Not everyone is the same, some people can last ages, some not so much. I say have fun with it. If someone lasts a minute, makes sure it makes sense for them to do so. A simple, "it's been awhile" will make most men just nod in agreement! xD

** Call Me has a quick first time but it is just a paragraph. Still, a very enjoyable story since the characters act like teenagers (sex in the first chapter without a strong, established relationship) instead of doing "cartoonish" angsty monologues which span three chapters.

** There's is a one shot about this exact topic that I can't find right now. It's a one shot of Harry and Ginny's first time the night before Harry leaves the Burrow to go Horcrux hunting.

I thought it was by a well known, probably female, h/g author, but I've checked out my first guesses (little0bird, Northumbrian, and Deadwoodpecker) and come up with nothing. Maybe someone else knows
