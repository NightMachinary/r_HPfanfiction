Just read *The House of Potter Rebuilt* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1228238/DisobedienceWriter][DisobedienceWriter]] and I really enjoyed how calm and clear headed Harry was in this, how he has a clear goal to restore his house and wish I could find another fic like it. I always wanted more of a mention of the Potter House considering its a noble house, inter house politics, and seeing Harry deal with the Ministry with the reputation of his house, along with the history and worldbuilding that exists outside of just Hogwarts.

​

Any recs?

​

edit: Come on guys, I know it's not canon compliant, I was speaking in the context of AUs with the house system. Anyone want to not point put smth I already know and give some ACTUAL recs?...Please


** Um... you do realize that there was no such thing as a "House of Potter" in canon, right? Or any sort of inclination that they Harry came from a "noble house"? Hell, the term "noble house" is complete fanon.

Yes, Sirius did once mention the "ancient and most noble house of Black," but since he was at the time presenting Harry with a family tree of bigots and murderers that he personally detested... he was PROBABLY being sarcastic.

*** To be specific, the "noble and most ancient" phrase was his dear old mum's. And yes, I'm pretty sure the intent of canon was that it was nothing more than her own self-important turn of phrase. It's crazy to see fics treating it like some official title that everyone knows.

As a worldbuilding nerd I really appreciate fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], which basically asks "if the wizarding world were really as regressive and traditional as fanon thinks it is, what would it /actually/ look like?" It's a sharp contrast to all the fics that try to have that world but keep everything the same.

**** Yeah, I always read that as members of the Black family (and Walburga specifically) calling themselves that as a way to stroke their own egos about just how much better and more important they see themselves as than all the other magical families.

I was baffled at first bc I had no idea where it came from, but now I kind of really like the idea? Idk I think I got tired of the re-hashing of canon plots and I wanted something different, something that fleshed out the world separate from Rowling's own and added to it even if it wasn't "exactly" canon compliant. So yh, agree w that second point

​

edit: wow Patron sounds fun, do you have any other fics that expand on worldbuilding like it?

**** Well, when OP said "I always wanted more of a mention of the Potter House considering its a noble house," it certainly sounded like they were commenting on what they thought wass canon.

***** Bad wording? I started off talking abt a particular fic and fics I wanted LIKE it, so everything said after was in the context of an AU where yes, the wizarding world would have some sort of house system.

​

Now that thats cleared up, DO any of you have any recs like that? I really was hoping to find some similar fics ...

*** Uh...yes...I am aware of that. I didn't think I needed to specify I meant "fanon" when this sub is specifically for "fanfiction." What I mean is there's so many fics where they introduce the "house" thing, but hardly any of them go INTO it with details and it would be nice to see

****** Sorry, but no... I'll admit it, I don't like fics where Harry is a noble, or where "noble houses" or "wizard houses" play any sort of role. They tend to be written by people who don't have the first idea how nobility works and just write everything as pompous and hyper-formal...

*** I remember reading Mad_Martha's Two Houses fics when this trope was new, and it was interesting and cool to see how Pureblood society might function with Nobility, Manors, etc.

Now it's just played out. I think there was one fic where the Hogwarts Epxress was literally segregated by "Dark" and "Light" families and I just noped out.

**** The thing I don't like is that it's become a trope and everyone uses it on the surface, but very few fics go in detail and really hammer out the worldbuilding those tropes could entail. Its just "oho Harry has 2 great noble houses, he can get all the money and harems he wants, screw the light/dark houses" and I wanted smth more intelligent than that. shame
