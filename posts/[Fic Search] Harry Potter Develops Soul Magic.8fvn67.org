Hello All:

I've come seeking your help! There was a story I read on ffnet that I unfortunately didn't save as a favorite :(.

In this story, Harry is somehow transported (possibly via veil of death) to an alternate universe which I believe is part of a crossover (possibly Wheel of Time, but not sure). In this universe, Harry tries to learn their magic, but they have magic that is much more suited to very epic proportions.

Harry isn't from their universe so can't use their magic, instead he's basically the weakest person there except that he learns about/develops Soul Magic, which is basically the type of magic in the HP world.

Eventually with his soul magic he's able to reopen the veil and get back to his world in time to defeat Voldemort.

Sorry for the long post, and thanks for your help! :D
