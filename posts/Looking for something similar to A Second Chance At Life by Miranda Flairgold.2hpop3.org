I thought this FF was fantastic. I love how independant, AU, grey Harry stories with a lot of OC characters, and different types of magic (I was a huge fan of the bloodmagic in ASCaL). Does anyone know anything that's similar? Alternatively does anybody know if the 3rd story was ever finished anywhere?

This is the ff I mentioned: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]]


** I can only assume [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][this]] is the fic you mentioned, OP. Might want to add the link somewhere visible for people who don't immediately know what you're referencing.

**** Happy to help. Are you looking for new schools from the beginning, or Harry leaving Hogwarts to go to a new school?

I did like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2400483/1/Anarkia][Anarkia]], it was one of the first fics I read if I remember correctly. It's a new school from year one, but the main focus of the story is after graduation.

***** As long as it's a good story line with a logical transfer I would probably enjoy it. I'll check that out. I appreciate it

** Although none of these are as detailed and AU as Miranda Flairgold's stories (which I agree are fantastic, and so disappointingly unfinished) here are ones that come to mind in a similar vein.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1779719/1/][Harry Potter and the Marcello School]]- Complete. 180k words. Harry goes to a new school post 5th year, new powers, OCs

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3771102/1/][Harry Potter and the Irish Choice]] Harry switches to another school after only a couple days at hogwarts. Not the best written story out there, nor incredibly complex. But an entertaining short read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3095579/1/][Mist Brook Academy of Magic]] I haven't read this, as I don't like slash at all. But it seems to fit somewhat.

I will look for some more because I am sure that I have read some others.

*** I just finished Harry Potter and the Marcello School. That was fantastic. I just wish there was some type of epilogue for closure lol

Harry Potter and the Irish Choice was fairly good as well but not on the same level.
