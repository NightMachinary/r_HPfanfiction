** OP Fixfics. Everyone else thinks there boring, but I like a nice "Good Guys win, Bad Guys lose, and it was never in doubt" story quite often. Too many stories nowadays need the protagonist to suffer (and suffer...and suffer...) for the end goal no matter what.

*** Yea. I can understand if they give Harry the Slytherin lordship, because of the whole "You defeated the previous Lord Slytherin," But giving him all the founders lord/ladyships, not to mention Black and Perevel (I can't spell for shit)... it just gets out of hand.

Actually, while I'm on the topic of Harry being related to Hogwarts founders, is there any good stories where Harry is the descendent of Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, rather then Griffindor or Slytherin?

**** There was a founders heir fic where Harry was Ravenclaw, Hermione was Hufflepuff, Ron was Slytherin, and Neville was Griffindor.

Can't for the life of me remember it but knowing the crud I typically read, it probably wasn't very good.

** You can say what you want, but soulmates are my kryptonite. I absolutely /adore/ soulmate stories.

Also arranged marriage fics where people just have to make the best of things, I like those but I can understand that the idea of arranged or mandated marriage squicks some people out. In real life it kind of squicks me too (although I have thought that having my parents arrange a marriage for me would have saved me a hell of a lot of trouble) but in fiction I must admit I'm sort of fascinated.

I also love very emotional stories, not necessarily angsty but with the Big Feels all over the show, and I get very upset when a writer misses an opportunity for a Big Feel. For example, I have never read a scene where Hermione returns to Malfoy Manor done the way I'd like to read it, although IShouldBe's Ribboned-Witch comes pretty close.

Since I'm here: One thing I hate that a lot of people seem to like is ambiguous characters who /stay ambiguous/ throughout the story. I mean, as a Snape fan I can understand the allure - Snape was pretty ambiguous throughout the series (or so I understand, I think the longest I doubted that he was a good guy was the first ten minutes or so after I read HBP the first time, but it was 6AM and I was seeing the sunrise from the wrong side, so I wasn't thinking straight) but I do feel that you should resolve which side your character is on /before you end the damn fic, okay?/

On that note, I don't have enough words to describe my hatred for ambiguous endings. I feel like they're the stories where the author couldn't choose and just sort of went "okay I'll just write THE END and then they can think what they like and it'll make me look all literary and stuff" and meanwhile I'm over here going "no, you utter titweasel, it just makes you look like a /tease/."
