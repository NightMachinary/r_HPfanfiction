[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/806133/SilverAegis][Anything by SilverAegis]] and the fanmade offshots to these fics made by other users.

So in short what i like is when Harry, he doesn't have to be OP but i hate Pushover!Harry, goes to another world where the timeline is different thus causing another outcome than canon and he then have to deal with it. Iknow HP and the Other boy who lived doesn't really fit the bill but i just simply love it. (And yes i know about the longer version then the one found on fanfiction.net, I've linked the long version)

Peace out, thanks in advance.

PS: Draco, Snape and Ron can go **** ******** with * **** *** ***** ***** up ***** ***!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] - Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry - More time travel than dimension but still an interesting premise.

Argh there was one where the alternate dimension order pulled him out of his home universe and try to make him fight voldemort. He forces them to pay for his schooling, his materials, and to kill voldemort. I just can't remember the name.
