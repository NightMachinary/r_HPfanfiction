  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  "No good deed goes unpunished. Sure, I meant well -well, look at what well-meant did. Since I can not succeed in saving you, I promise no good deed will I attempt to do again. " - When Annie escapes from the crystal, she cannot allow herself to abandon him to a traitor's death. Especially when he's taking the fall for her. [Inspired by "No Good Deed" from Wicked] [AruAni]

*** It seems the bot didn't quite get one of them. linkffn(11756161) So we'll try that (I googled it - I'm always really impressed when people have names of fics and authors - how do you catalog stuff or have you super memory powers?). They both look really well written so I'm quite excited :) I also love the idea of Tonks and Hermione - I think they would be able to relate to each other really well. I love having new fics. Thank you!!

  The moment Hermione ran smack into Bellatrix Lestrange in the midst of a war was the moment she knew things were about to go very badly, very quickly. Rated M for more than one reason.
