I've yet to read a fic with this. But I find it hard to imagine that in all the years this fandom has been around, nobody's made a story with this in it. So send 'em to me! :)

Hopefully this gets better results than when somebody posted the same thing a year ago.

Thanks in advance!


** Oh man I've read one gimme a few min to search and I'll edit i don't remember if the story was in humor or horror section of the library

Linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7206371/1/APOCALYPSO]])

** Not exactly /rebellion/ but...

I really enjoyed linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) in which Harry considers himself a Forest Elf and fights for his rights- and by extension the rights of any House Elves who would rather be Forest Elves with him
