Here i would like to have good Bella and Bad Bella Fics. So lets say, she survives the War but get imprisoned in Azkaban, but repeatedly breaks out....or other dangers happen and Harry has to visit her for her knowledge in Black Magic or stuff like that. However, despite despising her, he finds himself being attracted to her more and more and/or develops a Love/hate relationship with her. It would be good, but not necessary, if she finds out, that he is atttracted to her and tease him...maybe that changes her Behaviour/character in total to a little more caring persona.

​

As for Good Bella fics. Harry travels into AU and learns to know, that she never became evil and possibly did something good with her life (like study or become a Politician or whatever, although a simple Baroness is what i can think the more thinkable), alse kept her Beauty, unlike Canon, so Harry is shocked at first but falls for her over time.

​

Even if can hardly think such exist, if there are Fics with a Canonical married Harry (family included) that falls for Bella is also fine. Doestn matter if it happens in AU or Canon universe.


** Delenda Est is probably the definitive version of this pairing, at least without harems coming into play, which are yikes. If I think of anymore, I'll comment again :)

** linkffn(2896398) Is amazing! Bellatrix is “bad” here but Harry's also been forced to turn morally ambiguous. They have tons of tension, exacerbated by how they're in a new place, and I'm really not doing it justice. But it's a good read!

Edit: I forgot to mention it is AU since it's a lot darker than canon

  In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.

** Overpowered Harry goes back in time to preemptively strike everyone who'll ever do him wrong. Young Bellatrix sees this stranger brutally murdering all her friends and family and is, of course, smitten.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** Love Wind Shear. It's hilarious how little Harry cares that Bellatrix is throwing herself at him.

And to be fair, Harry does not brutally murder that first group... He brutally self-defenses them to death.
