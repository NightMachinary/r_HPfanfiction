Full disclosure, I partly wanted to start this thread out of curiosity, but a significantly larger part of starting this thread was so I could use the phrase "Filling the Yank-Bank" because it amuses me greatly. :D

So, this thread came out of some fascinating answers on another thread I made a little while back asking what detentions in the States were like (link below). Finding out about things like Homecoming and the ways punishments are handled in scholastic situations has really heightened a lot of differences in America that previous threads on the 'Best of British' front haven't shown and now I'm curious. Also Pep Rallies. That level of sincere pride in an institution that isn't the NHS is utterly unfathomable to an English person (and we even complain and bitch about that sometimes, so there's not much of a chance of us Pep Rallying up for them either) and the concept baffles me entirely.

Anyway, as with last time, what are things about American culture and general USA Society that you think would help a non-American person write better fanfiction? (We've often observed just how many fics move Harry to America, after all :D). What beliefs do you have or tones you take to things (eg. That sincere enthusiasm over your schools) that you see as very American? And for those non-US people, do you have any questions to ask? Any general resources of information or novels that you think show the right tone/environment, etc are also valid posts here. Or hell, any fics that you think get it right.

In regard to fics, as always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** Are yearbooks a thing in England like they are/were in the U.S.? From what I hear they're waning in the U.S., but in the timeline of Harry Potter, they would have been super popular. Yearbook signing is a huge thing that happens at the end of the school year. Also, like Field Day? It's like...in-school olympics mixed with a festival kind of?

** While I cannot come up with examples at the moment, I will say this: "filling the yank bank" likely has a VERY different meaning than what you might be looking for.

*** Isn't that Wank Bank? Yank is used as a generic term for Americans here in England. Short for 'Yankee'.
