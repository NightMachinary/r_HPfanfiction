I personally think that Harry was harmed more by Dumbledore's seemingly manipulative nature, but I think Dumbledore manipulating things from behind the scenes was also a major reason they won the war. I also think that Dumbledore dabbled in the dark arts when he was in a relationship with Grindelwald ( yes, Dumbledore has been announced to be gay by Rowling). Dumbledore was obsessed with the deathly hallows and I think he would have used whatever means necessary to get all three of them, at least until his sister died.


** Meh. There's probably plenty of Watsonian reasons for his characterization, everyone's mentioning them bellow.

So for the Doylist interpretation:

1. Rowling just isn't that great of a writer, to get the plot to go the direction she wanted WITHOUT one of the characters manipulating events in the background.
2. More importantly, HP suffers from Genre shift. The characterizations and events during the first few books are pretty much spot on for the classic "boarding school adventure" genre. Of course Snape is evil, there's always the evil teacher. Of course there's an entire house of evil students, because there always has to be. Of course all the adults are useless, because they always are. Those are all staples of the genre. The whole genre breaks down without those tropes.The problem is that in the later books especially, the genre shifts away from that, as Harry and the Audience ages, at shifts more into Young Adult Adventure, and possibly into full out Normal Adult Adventure in the last books.\\
   Those genres have their own tropes, but are generally incompatible with the tropes and assumptions from the first. It's no longer enough to just make it accepted that "Adults are Useless", now there has to be a decent reason WHY they are useless. It's not enough to just ignore that somebody should have been doing something about Voldemorts return for an entire decade, now there needs to be a REASON why nobody did anything. And since the whole series is just that, a series, these questions automatically must be applied retroactively to the fist books, those that would have been protected by their genre tropes, and no longer are.\\
   As a boarding school adventure, it's completely reasonable that the chamber of secrets was never found by anyone, despite fawks being able to teleport to it. But when the series abandons the boarding school adventure genre, it loses that plot protection, suddenly the readers must ask WHY it was never found using similar methods before.\\
   The whole 3rd floor corridor is exactly the same. There's nothing wrong with warning the students to stay away from that part of the school, and there's nothing unusual about the protections being little more then a fun adventure for a group of first year students, despite being meant to keep out a skilled and powerful adult. In a boarding school adventure. In any other genre, it instantly becomes very dumb and rather suspicious.\\
   Especially with the stuff like an Age Line in later books, that could have simple kept anyone less then 100 years old from entering.\\

So really, it's not so much that Rowling decided to write Dumbledore as manipulative, it's that he became such by necessity, both to make the plot work for her, and to explain the genre trope inconsistencies between the books.

*** This is such a good answer that actually coherently explains why I stick with HP even though it does have major inconsistencies. Do I wish Rowling had sorted this stuff out? Ofc. But I can forgive her for not doing it.

Dumbledore was well meaning. It just turned out he had to plot Harry's murder to end the war.

**** I would be able to forgive Dumbleore (maybe...I would still have a hard time!), if he had really tried in the war (just try to kill Voldemort - if it doesn't work or only throws him out of his (new) body? Then at least you have time to prepare for him regaining it again!), if he had prepared (he didn't, the order was only re-formed after Voldemort's resurrection) and if he had tried to remove the horcrux! He didn't! Instead he raised a sacrifice! He didn't have the guts to kill Harry himself and then go after the 'cruxes!

Why are you presuming this was a goal of hers? You can't just presume the goals of a person without any insight or at least attempt at reasoning. Rowling may have been very well fine with Dumbledore being "manipulative".

I'd argue, and many others would, too, that this isn't something the books in general "suffer" from. The feature that the books grew up with the readers is an amazing one - and Rowling pulled it off extremely well.

In fact, I would say without the genre shift, the Harry Potter phenomenon would have been considerably smaller, and the series would have been less successful and memorable.

Sure, the shift might introduce a few inconsistencies, but in general they are well-addressed in the books, and only when you really dissect the books and characters the problems come up.

But you know what? Reading the books, that doesn't take away anything from them, it doesn't affect my ability to suspend my disbelief at all - and I bet for most people here it didn't either. Let's face it, most of us got into HP fanfiction because we /liked/ the overall series. And sure, now that we look at canon with a magnifying glass that has the lense of 12 years of fanfic, we spot a few small flaws.

**** I don't disagree but it's a pretty big LOL @ "a few small flaws."

You just gotta roll with the fact that HP ain't some rational, meticulous Sanderson universe, and that the bizarre whimsy of HP's world leaves logic at the door. HP's world doesn't deal in facts, it deals more in emotional truth and the journey of a flawed, ignorant child everyman.

They won because of sheer dumb luck, nothing more. The plot of the last two books was, for the most part, a lot of author's fiat and deux ex machina.

Dumbledore's "plans" amounted to laying down some clues like a bread crumb trail for a treasure hunt and /hoping/ that everything happened as he wished even though he simply didn't know all the variables or had even the remotest control on most of them.

*** It's almost hard to believe the last two books were written by the same person or that the editor/publisher let them go out the way they were. The books just kept getting better, with either 3 or 4 being the high point (I /loved/ PoA). As aggravating as 5 was to read, it had a core of emotional truth and gave us the brilliant hate-sink that is Umbridge. But man. Any time I re-read the series, 6 and especially 7 is such a fucking /slog/.

** Personally I've always seen Dumbledore as sometimes being misguided, but never maliciously manipulative. He did some very poor decisions at times (lack of actions against Riddle during school, not taking the Marauder-era Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry seriously, giving Harry to the Dursleys, not properly giving Harry the tools he needed to defeat Voldemort -- he only managed to anyway due to sheer luck), but I don't think he was ever being malicious/manipulative.

One thing that a lot of people like to bring up in terms of Manipulative!Dumbledore is the PS debacle. I very much like the headcanon someone posted on Reddit a while back -- the challenge being deliberately easy and nonlethal to give students an interesting exercise with the Mirror of Erised as "reward" in the end, while fooling Quirrel into becoming arrogant in the lack of difficulty only to stump him at the end with the Mirror with Dumbledore then being able to simply stroll down and catch him red-handed.

** Rowling didn't try to make Dumbledore manipulative: unlike what the Manipulative!Dumbledore trope seems to portray, Dumbledore didn't go out of his way to shape Harry into a perfect martyr. Albus Dumbledore is first and foremost a human being: Rowling wrote flaws into his character. These flaws are what separate a Mary Stue from a well written OC, they are what make him human and not some curly-moustache twisting villain.

He may have dabbled in the Dark Arts, just as many people make bad decisions for the ones they love. Altogether, I think the most important thing is that Dumbledore came out wiser from the whole experience.

As for Dumbledore being a puppet master: I don't really think it's plausible. In the first few books, Rowling wrote him to be a kindly old mentor figure, and eventually as the themes of the series matured, so did Dumbledore. Instead of being portrayed as a saint who could do no wrong, it was revealed that he was a flawed human being.

And while he held on to James Potter's cloak, it was more symbolic that an obsession: as he gave Harry the Cloak of Invisibility, he also abandoned the idea of holding on to the Hallows.

*** Did he really? He knew who had it and he still had the wand (he didn't give that away)...so if he found the stone? He could probably re-gain the cloak ("Harry? I need that cloak of your's for an order mission! We don't have enough of them, so will you lend it to me (not that I will return it, ever!)?" - or if that doesn't work, he can sick Moody on Harry who can see through the cloak!)

** Dumbledore is undoubtedly manipulative, not in the way he is potrayed in fanfic where he's an evil mastermind but more in the sense of engineering society and people around him to their betterment. From a story perspective I think Dumbledore was written as such because it makes for a more interesting character and helps the plot play out as it does.

Dumbledore's machinations were both a hindrance and a help. Lying and secret keeping were second nature to him and keeping the Hallows from Harry probably did stop him going down the wrong path in part. And he ultimately did prepare Harry for the necessary path by giving him the snitch and avoiding telling the truth once again about Harry's sacrifice. On the other hand, keeping secrets was harmful to Harry, Ron and Hermione and endangered them at various points.

** I think Dumbledore might have dabbled in dark arts when he was younger till his sister's death, he might have studied it more academically in his older age refusing to use it but reading the Hogwarts books about it

I think Dumbledore did not want to manipulate harry, I feel deep down one of dumbledores sorrows was that he could not finish the war off in time

and that the younger generation would have to be thrust into it

dumbledore is not all knowing and can make fuck ups its rather human of him, everyone sees him as this wise ageless wizard but in reality he is just a person trying to work things out the best he can

** Dumbledore was manipulative because one life (Harry's) isn't worth as much as the lives of everyone. He is acting like a good General, who knows how the war will look like far before it happens. And even then, Dumbledore tried his damnest to keep Harry alive at the end.

As for the Dark Arts, I would say he dabbled in them when he was younger. It seemed he was quite arrogant and thought he could handle the dark arts with ease.
