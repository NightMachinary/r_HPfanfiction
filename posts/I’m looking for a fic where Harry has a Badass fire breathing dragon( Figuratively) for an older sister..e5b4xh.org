** Is it a specific story you're looking for? Because I've just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11269078/1/To-Be-a-Slytherin][To Be a Slytherin]] and it's about Harry's twin sister who's an absolute badass and she sometimes uses dark magic. She's very protective of Harry. It's monstrously long though so it's a commitment. But I recommend it. It's amazing.

**** Yeah. Harry's sister is paired with Draco but he has a genuine redemption arc.

***** Will do! I'm intrigued by an actual redemption arc for Draco because I don't like him one jot normally. It's a reason I avoid Dramione- he's a racist prick who tormented Hermione and her friends at any chance he got, and honestly, if he could kill her without getting his hands dirty I feel he would. He was just too scared by the thought of having to kill Dumbledore himself in canon.

****** Oh yeah, he's a prick alright but only a for few years. And then he really makes an effort to change. That's why I love his character arc in this story.

******* I can deal with that- I'll accept him being a result of his upbringing up to a certain point, perhaps 14/15 years old. By then he's more than capable of forming his own opinions.

There's bashing and m/m relationships though so it might not be to your taste.

** Oh boy do I have a good rec for you . White Heather For Protection linkao3(7228006) is so damn good. She's ridiculously protective of Harry. Harry's sister is two years older and they were at the Dursley's together for a bit. The fic is long but the pacing is great cauze doesn't drag anything out too long. Give it a go!!
