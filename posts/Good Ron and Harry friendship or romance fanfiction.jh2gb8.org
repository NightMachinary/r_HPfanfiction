Ron was Harry's first and best friend ready to give up his life for Harry n the person Harry would miss the most in the world! Ron have him family friendship and loyalty to no end. It annoys me so much that there are so many fanfiction that have a great story but just so full of Ron bashing and putting Hermione up as a flawless goddess. Like did u even read the books? All the characters had flaws! Even 'perfect' Hermione! Ron and Hermione were both ready to die in order to save harry!

So m looking for fanfiction that do justice to Harry n Ron's friendship. It can even be romance idc as long as Ron's not the annoying background character or the secret antagonist or worse not even mentioned!


** I can't remember much right now, but here's my favourite Ron and Harry friendship oneshot-

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13106128/1/A-Clean-Shave][A Clean Shave]]:

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry's being an orphan has an unexpected side-effect, and Ron helps him out---learning a lesson in gratitude along the way. (Harry-Ron friendship fic, because Ron doesn't get enough credit and Harry needs a hug.)
#+end_quote

Might come back to this later if I remember some more.

** For Harry/Ron slash, I'd recommend linkao3(Or the Look or the Words by LullabyKnell; Prelude and Fugue)

If you don't mind Harry/Ron/Hermione poly relationship, there's linkao3(together or not at all by ballerinaroy).

  Goblet of Fire AU: The change in their relationship happened during fourth year, when an exhausted and dateless Harry groaned out the important question of, “Why can't we just go together?”Pure fluff for the 5+ AU Headcanons game.

** It's not just focusing on Ron, but linkao3(the sum of their parts by holdmybeer) is a post-war story about the Golden Trio in which Ron is brave and loyal, I highly recommend it.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

** This one is supremely underrated, but I found it and loved it. It's a gem. The Black Library by Rokesmith. Canon pairings, solid Harry and Ron friendship.
