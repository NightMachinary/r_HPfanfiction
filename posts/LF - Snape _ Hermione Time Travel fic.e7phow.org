:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, I am trying to track down a HG/SS fic where Hermione goes back in time to save Snape. Together they create a potion that will eventually save him from Nagini's bite. I also remember that at one point Hermione asks for PHOENIX Tears from Fwaks, and gets ingredients from a unicorn? HELP! I think Hermione's also in Ravenclaw in this fic?


** Sounds really familiar apart from the Ravenclaw

** I read this like a month ago! I've been combing through the book club threads on here. You can probably find it that way. I'll reply here if I come across it again.

*** OMGOSH THANK YOU! I don't even know what the book club threads are though! I think it's kinda similar to -- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4013385/1/Hermione-Granger-And-The-Point-Of-No-Return]]

But I know I read it on AO3?
