The curse on the DADA position only ended when Voldemort died.

Edit: Therefore the person who cursed the elder wand isn't dead.


** Isn't it pretty much canon that the Elder Wand usually ends up getting its owner into lethal trouble pretty quickly? The only exception being Dumbledore who rarely uses it and manages to keep it for half a century.

*** Not really. The legend around it says it does, how true is it? Grindelwald was going to get into trouble he got with or without the wand, and Gregorowitch before him just studied the wand. Both died because of it, but around 50 and 70 years later after they lost it respectively.

Draco, another once owner of the Elder Wand, also seems to be doing fine, unless you count him balding as the first symptom of this incredibly slow-ass curse.

*** Yes, but the DADA curse died with Voldemort.

That's the implication I'm thinking of.

**** But the curse of the elder wand wasn't caused by Voldie so the curse wouldn't break when he died

******* Canon does not state that death made the hallows. If anything, it pretty much has the 3 Peverell brothers as the creators, with death being the myth.

******** I always thought it was either more in your head or the elder wands power caused people to get cocky, believing that with the elder wand you couldn't lose and becoming more reckless. That or my headcanon is that the deathly hallows story is like disney. They made it more romantic and the real way they were made was something like sacrificing entire towns/cities to make them.

********* To be fair, we have very little to work on.

I liked it operating like the defense curse because otherwise someone savvy would shut up.

Rowling makes such an excellent adult author, that it's a pity she didn't go more in depth with some of her ideas because she wanted to keep the rating down. Corrupt governments with summary execution and state sponsored torture deserve more than they got in canon.

** Given the information from the tale of the three brothers, the wand was cursed with lethal misfortune from the very beginning, so it was probably designed that way by Death.

*** Who said it was designed by death? That's ambiguous and meant to be so.

Of course, the consensus is that it was the 3 brothers in the book.

**** In that case it's likely that the curse is something of a malfunction or a side effect of the amplifier.
