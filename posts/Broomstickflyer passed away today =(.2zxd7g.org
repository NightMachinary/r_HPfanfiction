** I have always loved her stories. I am a huge H/Hr fan, so her stories always made me smile if for nothing else. I think I am going to go back and re-read all of them again in memory of her.

** I'd been meaning to go back and read many of her stories for a while now. How sad that she's gone. May her memory be eternal!

** Not everyone gets to reach others just by telling stories. I'm glad her words are still out there.

** Damn, life is too short. In retrospect she is one of the people that I wish had naturally longer life's simply so they could continue doing what they enjoy because it was to the benefit of others as well. I have spent many hours reading stuff from her profile and in tribute I shall do so again.

*** With the amount of frankly amazing authors we've lost over the past two years, I cannot help but agree on this. The world is a poorer place for the amount of sheer imagination that has been lost to it.

** This is really sad, but I thought the story's summary of your link was wonderfully sweet. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

She was without a doubt my favourite Welsh author of HP fanfiction.
