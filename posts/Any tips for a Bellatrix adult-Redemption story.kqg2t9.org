As in, she is an adult, and not a child.

I am writing a story with her being redeemed. Its a crossover with the SCP Foundation, and through years of working with the Foundation, she gradually relinquishes her anti-muggle views. And she gradually realizes just how far she's gone into darkness, and decides that her work with the Foundation is her penance for what she has done.

Any advice for how to write this?


** Uhhh...to be honest, that's such a heavy job I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole without heavy AU elements - what canon Bellatrix did, is so out there crazy it's hard to imagine her as something else than absolutely insane, or as a result of heavy mental illness, and I can't begin to think how she could approach anywhere near redeemed and not be too disgusted with herself to live. In any way, I'd advise against too upbeat a happy ending for her, and minimize humor, because if treated without AU explanations for why she did what she did (and I have a feeling that's what you're going for, from your post?) too cheerful a happy ending might leave a bad taste overall...

I think for something to work, you'd want to try making her in her early years likeable, and do a good job explaining her descent into darkness - it'd help go through the 'how in the world can she even BE redeemed' mental jump on the idea of redeemed adult Bellatrix. Don't take me wrong, I'm not in the 'you must hate the magical nazis' camp here, I love stories about HP villains, I love reading dark/evil scenarios, and it's interesting to see redeeming scenarios for when they're younger/still starting, but writing redeeming after the attempted genocide, enjoying torture, and all the crazy around it sounds really, really hard. Anyway, goodluck!

*** I was actually thinking of having Voldemort rape and crucio her and her sister. I know that's dark, but her getting a big dose of her own medicine might just do the trick.

**** Nah. If anything, it would drive her even further down the hole.

***** Well, OK then. What event would enable her to start down the path from insane maniac to a decorated soldier fighting for humanity?

****** I honestly don't know. Perhaps find something that sparks a need for some introspection? Have someone show her a kindness, and she begins wondering if there might be a better way? I'm no good when it comes the really dark stuff.

** im not sure exactly but linkao3(we shall all perish if the dark lord comes) should be a goldmine for you as it already does all the work of getting into her head doinga real analysis of the psyche of canon bellatrix who is decidedly different than fanon bella
