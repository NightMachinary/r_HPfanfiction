I am looking for this fic where Hermione and Neville- at the urging of Harry if I am not mistaken- ask for a resort. ( Hermione goes to Ravenclaw and Neville, to Huffepuff, but I might be misremembering)

​

Do you remember it?

​

EDIT: No luck yet :(

Thank you! I will check as you suggested, but I had the feeling it was not Robst, but perhaps I am wrong, he has so many stories ...

** I read a fic recently where they all return for 7th year, and due to the war, /all/ students are resorted. Ron is a puff, Draco and Hermione are ravenclaw, Harry and Ginny are Slytherin, Neville stays in Gryffindor. It's a DH fic, which isnusally NOT my thing, but I was really intrigued by the idea and the way the relationship develops was almost ... Natural. I think it's called eagles nest or Ravens nest or something like that. It's still ongoing and is on FFN

***** The premise sounds interesting, but it's a lot of words if it will end up abandoned.

Do you know if it's finished and just currently being posted on a schedule, or if the author has a history of complete/incomplete stories? I'm trying to decide if it's worth diving in or if I should hold out for awhile

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's eighth year at Hogwarts is already going to be difficult in the aftermath of the war, but it is further thrown into upheaval when Headmistress McGonagall orders a re-sorting of all students to promote inter-house unity. But when the Sorting Hat sends Hermione to Ravenclaw with Draco - and without Harry or Ron - how will she cope? [AU, Dramione] Prevalent alchemy. WIP

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

*** No resorting in this one, but it was worth the reread :)

Hermione is in ravenclaw and Neville is in Hufflepuff, but they were sorted there at the start.

Overall review: starts strong, but ends weak. The general feel I got was the author went in with a solid pre-hogwarts plot, and then decided to keep going but lost the "spark". It's still worth reading though.

** This is really driving me nuts. I feel like I remember this, but it's been a long time. I suspect time travel was involved (some difference to the communication on the train) and I was thinking maybe Regrets Collect Like Old Friends because the sorting hat does a lot, but I think there's only one sorting and Neville is not in Hufflepuff. I was also thinking Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, but that doesn't seem to be right either. If i had more time I'd look through the time travel threads from 2-3 months ago. good luck

** Isn't this The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville? Hermione definitely goes to Ravenclaw in this, I don't think Neville is in Hufflepuff here though. Harry is.

I don't know how to link things.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
