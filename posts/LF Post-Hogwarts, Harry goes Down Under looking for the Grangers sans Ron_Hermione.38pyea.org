My brain's been making me annoyed as I thought I'd bookmarked this fic, but I can find hide nor hair of it anywhere on the web, yet I know I read it.

Era: Post-Hogwarts

Summary: Harry goes looking for the Drs. Granger to return their memories, sans Ron/Hermione. While in Australia, he doesn't find them, but falls for/ends up romancing an older lady who, shock of all shocks, is the former Mrs. Granger. Hermione ends up dropping Ron for some reason or another, goes to meet up with Harry in Australia and then starts angsting about what she should do re: returning memories now that she knows he and her mom have been cohabitating together.

If anyone could supply a title, author or URL, it'd be much appreciated.

*** No, that's not the one, but was a good read.

I think the mom's name was changed to Victoria post-memory alteration, but that may be my own Obliviate functioning.
