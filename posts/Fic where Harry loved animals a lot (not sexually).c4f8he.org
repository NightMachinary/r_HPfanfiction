:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
1. As stated above
2. Voldemort asks him to join. In return, Harry asks Voldemort whether he will support animal/dragon rights (one of these, can't remember the exact one). I think Voldemort replied with a confused "What?". This was probably at the end of the Triwizard Tournament.
3. In final battle/ battle of Hogwarts, Harry calls his dragon to help him. This might or might not be Norberta. It probably was a different dragon but I can't remember. What I mean is that I am sure that there was a dragon but I am not sure whether the dragon was Norberta or a different one. Also, he may or may not have ridden the dragon.
4. This was on fanfiction.net
5. This was probably not a crossover.
6. I am not sure of this one. Hagrid, Ron and Hermione became afraid of Harry's love for animals (and Harry himself).
7. He bonded with Buckbeak and the other hippogriffs too.
8. This was either a oneshot or a twoshot.
9. It was extremely humourous.

Any and all kinds of help is appreciated.

Thanks in advance


** I love how fanfiction in general is so fucked up that you had to add (not sexually) to the title

*** I happened across one where it was Ron raping Hedwig. It needed to be said.

Also a one-shot where Harry is a dragon animagus who solved the first task that way.

Also remember Aberforth exists. For the Greater Goatâ„¢.

***** linkffn(13056439).

The rest of the author's oneshots are actually pretty funny. Especially linkfn(Your Patronus Is What?)

  A tribute to all the fics that prefer to have Harry cope with the trials and tribulations of his fourth year through overwhelming firepower. (Parody. Crackfic. Oneshot.)

***** I did not search for the fics. The first was from a Reddit thread of the most disturbing fics you've read, and I was morbidly curious.

The second author actually has some pretty funny oneshots.

I'm not apologizing for the Aberforth joke.
