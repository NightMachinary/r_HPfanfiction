** Care to leave a description?

Also, if it's a WIP, are you looking for constructive criticism on how to improve your story, or just to bump up your review count? (I am happy to read and review if the former, not the latter.)

*** I actually am looking for constructive criticism, as its my first fanfic.

The story is about a muggle-born witch, that comes in possession of a very powerful wand, as it chooses her. The story revolves around her adventures with her friends.

I know its vague, but I can't give away too much detail :3 Its concurrent with whats going on with Harry Potter in england, but its all OC, with mentions of HP and other characters.

** "When Maria receives a letter by owl, finds out her parents are a witch and a wizard, her life is turned from introverted bookworm, to that of a heroin. Follow Maria as she becomes the character she only read about! (OC, Cannon, AU, Nicholas Flamel & Harry Potter indirectly.)"

Step one is do basic spell check. At least do this for the story description. 2 spelling errors and 2 grammar errors right in the description are going to turn away most readers.

This is particularly important if you are trying to write a "bookworm" main character because this usually means you are trying to appeal to readers of same type who take spelling/grammar seriously.

her life is turned from [one/that of an] introverted book worm

Follow Maria as she becomes the character she only read about! > Follow Maria as she becomes the kind of character she only read about! (unless she was actually reading prophecies of her future)

Cannon = type of artillery. Cannon>Canon

I feel like an obnoxious grammar nazi and yet I just can't help myself.

Anyway - you will need to find yourself a literate beta who catches this kind of stuff so readers don't get distracted from the story telling. Fanfic readers don't expect perfect spelling/grammar of course, but at a certain density of such errors even stories with interesting plots become a pain to read.

***** Do you want to do it? :3

I would like to let you know, I do use word when I type up the stories, so there are no spelling errors. :P

****** I suck when it comes to paying attention to grammar and spelling over long stretches - get to engrossed in the book. Try the forums on fanfiction.net - there are usually threads going for requesting/getting to know betas.

I think even most browsers spell check by default these days - problem are the similar looking words like heroine/heroin and cannon/canon. Till we get a reasonable AI, have to spell check for those.
