Polyjuice would be a little boring, but Veriatsserum should do the trick. Or even proper surveillance since four/six eyes see more than two.

Please, no stories where Malfoy turns out to be innocent/not punished once the truth is revealed and preferably no Ron/Hermione pairing. Also no m/m main pairing.

Short, but complete. I honestly can't think of a story that fits exactly what you mean, but this is as close as I can get.

*** Just got to the funeral, and it's struck me how damn close it was that that didn't actually happen. Could've been Katie, and/or Leeanne, or Rosmerta, could have been Harry, or Ron, or Slughorn, or all three - if they'd toasted and drunk simultaneously, no one would have lived.

Which leads me to the conclusion - the Gaunt ring was still cursed. It, or the Stone(which, like the Wand, likes to lead people to death), must have affected his judgment. There's no reason Dumbledore would continue wearing it after having already fallen prey to its temptations. Especially since he was so insistent that Voldemort not be tipped off about the Horcruxes. To continue to let Draco threaten the lives of students (he did escalate to trying an Unforgivable) was so illogical, that it's unbelievable.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

*** That would be up for the author to decide. Doing polyjuice again would be a little boring compared to slipping him Veritasserum in the Great Hall, but it'd do.

**** Veritaserum wouldn't work, I think, at least not well enough. Draco was sufficiently competent at Occlumency to stave off Snape.

***** Is it canon or fanon that Occlumency can prevent Veritaserum from affecting you? I am pretty sure that it is just fanon, and Veritaserum is about as illegal as polyjuice.

****** It's canon. I don't recall if it was ever mentioned in the books, but JKR has said it.

Edit: from an interview: "Skilled wizards can avoid its effects by using antidotes and charms. A gifted Occlumens could also resist Veritaserum."

******** The books were obviously written with this lore in mind, so I disagree. Beyond that, it simply makes sense; it would be less logical if occlumency /didn't/ protect oneself from an invasive truth potion. Think as you want, though. I have negative interest in changing anyone's opinion.

****** Because truth serums don't automatically have the drinker spouting out everything the good guys need to know. Someone would need to question him, which would put him on guard immediately, especially in public. I don't imagine the sensation of having swallowed it passes unnoticed, either.
