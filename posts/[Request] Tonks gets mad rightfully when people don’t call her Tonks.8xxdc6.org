For instance, leaving the OOTP?


** Is it "rightful" to quit the only resistance against magical Nazi-ripoffs because people use her legal name? Because that sounds rather pitty TBH.

**** I mean, I get where the resentment for a name containing Nymphs comes from when you can become everyone's wet dream in the blink of an eye, but rage quitting the resistance against Voldemort over that seems rather stupid.

***** I dunno. If I was an operater in an illegal organization where I had to voluntarily put my life in danger based on my trust in the leader's judgement and character, and they repeatedly refused to learn to demonstrate even a modicum of respect for me, I think I would be looking for some other way to survive.

It's not the reason to quit, it's an indicator of the reason to quit. You don't die from the rash when you die from smallpox.

****** Tonks is by far the most "overpowered" character in the series. Her metamorphic abilities make for a perfect disguise and, judging by how she can shape skin and bones, regenerative abilities. She is magically skilled and has to have some power to back it up. Of all the people, she would have the easiest time to get away/survive. She joined the Order because she did not want to just survive, but because she wanted to fight Voldemort. Therefore it was the Order or nothing.

Then again, I doubt Rowling realised the implications of that character when she wrote about pig noses.
