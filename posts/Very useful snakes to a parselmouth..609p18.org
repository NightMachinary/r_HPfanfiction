Anyone ever done a fic where snakes are Harry's eyes and ears, they come and go and if they bring good intel Harry throws them a mouse.

Assuming they have near Human intelligence they would be far more useful then Canon Harry made of them.


** The thing is, Parseltounge is just the ability to speak to snakes, not control them. Maybe Harry could gain the trust of one snake by speaking to it regularly or something, but I doubt that he would be capable of controlling a whole army of wild snakes, just because he can speak to them.

*** I like to think that it's a magical tongue, maybe not servant-like some people make it out to be. But because of the magical tongue required to speak it I think snakes would maybe have like a light compulsion to obey. Considering we're talking about magic.. lots of things are possible

****** What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little muggle? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in Defence Against the Dark Arts, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on the Death Eaters, and I have over 300 confirmed stupifys. I am trained in magical warfare and I'm the top Auror in the entire Wizarding armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another Death Eater. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Floo Network? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Wizarding World and your fireplace is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, mudblood. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my basic spells. Not only am I extensively trained in muggle combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Ministry of Magic and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn squib. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking Snape'd, kiddo.

  follows canon events loosely
#+end_quote

Really? No canon events happen in that story. There's a reference to the Chamber of Secrets happening largely the same way, and there was a Tri-Wizard Tournament that Harry did not participate in prior to the start of the fic, but everything else is different.

Also, it's hard to have heavy Ron-bashing when he's barely in the story. Ginny-bashing, I'll give you. Although she's portrayed as damaged by possession, not inherently bad. The Percy-bashing was thorough.

No need to offer an epub, btw, she made her fics public again. Now only commenting requires login.

** I mused about giving Harry a Sning---a SNake rING---like in one of Piers Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality books that could slither off his finger and act as a spy or potentially a significant number of them if he joins his nascent intelligence organization as an operator.

In A Black Comedy, Harry uses them as a spy.

In another story, Harry searches out snakes to investigate DE activities. I forget the name but I believe it's the one where he swears on his magic he won't perform in the tournament and loses magic then gets it back.
