  Unafraid of hard work is what they say about Hufflepuffs. Which sounds solovely and sweet. The hard working house where you will be accepted even if you have no brains or brawn or talent as long as you are willing to work. So nice of them!Until a Hufflepuff decides you will master the Vanishing Spell and makes you practice every waking moment of your existence. You will finally get it right on the five hundredth and seventy-fourth casting attempt, when you are a sobbing sweating mess kneeling on the floor. Then you will discover that Hufflepuffs are demented and despite your tears and the fact that it is hours after dinner time they will say “again” and make you do it once more practice until you get it right every single time.

** I heartily second this rec. It's actually part of a three fic series and the whole thing is pretty breathtaking. Do yourself a favour though and read the whole series from the beginning.

The things I loved:

-The characterisation of /everyone/.

-The treatment of divination, and seers, though one seer specifically I suppose.

-The connection between music and magic.

-The lack of bashing, of characters I care about anyway.

The things I didn't love:

-Technical issues of grammar, usage, odd word (especially prepostition) choices, missing space between words, missing commas and other punctuations. There are examples in the excerpted text and the linked summary.

The thing is, this technical stuff was pretty forgivable because everything else was of such a high standard. It all made for an incredibly gripping story and I was reluctant to put it down so I could sleep or work.

  The stupid hat was stupid and refused to help Harry. The whole school and its division in houses was stupid too, and the teachers.Harry was in Hogwarts, but he didn't want to be. He wanted to go back home.

** It is kind of interesting, but I am not sure I can finish it. The writing style just seems so distant, even action scenes (or I think they are supposed to be action scenes?) don't provoke any kind of feeling in me. I find it very hard to read when everything feels like description after description of events or even feelings without much substance.

Also, I am really not a fan of Snapes character here, he is just portrayed as way too nice and pleasant. Even in AUs, I don't feel like Snape is Snape without the cynism towards everything including those he cares about, lots of bad attitude, dry sarcasm and some emotional distance or instability. Even in a better environment, I just don't believe he would lose all of his bad qualities that make his such a great complex character. Although maybe it's also the fact that I just don't believe a pairing between him and Remus would ever work considering just how much he hates werewolves and the marauders.
