So I've recently been reading next-generation fics, but a lot of the one's I've seen are about James.

I need a well written Albus fic, that are finished (it's annoying when the story has been left halfway through. Can be scorpius x albus , but I don't mind if it isn't.

Recommendations?


** Here are some of the best, none of these are Albus/Scorpius but all are highly recommended. The three series I've recommended are all about the same length as canon, so you should be able to keep yourself going for a while if you like them.

linkffn(Albus Potter and the Dungeon of Merlin's Mist) Completed seven-book series, Albus-centric, very good and pretty in line with the original series tone-wise.

linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) Albus-centric Completed seven-book series, AU epic, very good. Often compared to the previous series, a bit larger-scale and a bit less cohesive. Ridiculous plotting and twists.

linkffn(Snake Bites by sheriff1985) Slice-of-life told partly from the perspective of a professor. I think it's quite good but certainly less at stake than in the first two.

linkffn(Ignite by Slide) - Completed three-book series, Scorpius-centric but Albus is a major character. Like NoahPhantom's series it's a large-scale adventure epic. There's also some well written romance.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

  A first-year full of Weasley cousins in Albus, Rose and Louis takes its first steps into a wizarding world that suddenly feels all too close to the muggle Britain that's still clear in their new friends' memories. Meanwhile, a new Head of Slytherin finds himself meeting old friends and facing old enemies as the reputation of his House hangs in the balance (M for Language).

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
