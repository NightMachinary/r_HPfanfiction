Just realised its probably the one pairing out of the main six characters I've rarely if ever come across. (I've seen a fair chunk of Hermione-Luna and Ginny-Luna) And I mean with Hermione and Ginny both as girls, no gender-flips.

You have? Where? I need recs, especially of the latter pairing.

** I enjoyed linkffn(In The Long Run by Spectrum24), though it's more about them fighting to /stay/ together than them starting a relationship in the first place.

Linkffn(Image Of You by angelic1hp) was dark as hell, involves cheating and a lot of angst, but I thought it was weirdly beautiful. Two people utterly destroy their comfortable, complacent lives in the name of a passion they can't contain, leaving them a little broken, inside and out, but ultimately together.

I wish I could think of more, but a lot of HG/GW stories I've read follow the same pattern of 'innocent love where everything goes well and the conflict comes from fighting Voldemort together', which is nice, but gets kinda old after a while. Hermione/Fleur is full of stories like that, too. The more I read romance, the more I feel that the truly interesting stories are the ones where there is conflict within the pairing, rather than a perfect relationship where the conflict comes from without. So if light fluff is more your thing, sorry, I'm not your guy.

Edit: Maybe give [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/A-Woman-s-Love-Femslash/90503/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][A Woman's Love]] a trawl for HG/GW stories? It's one of the larger HP femslash communities on FFnet.

**** I... honestly don't really remember any specifically. Maybe it was hyperbole to say 'a lot', because there really aren't that many HGGW stories as a whole, but I definitely remember reading fics that bored the hell out of me with their lack of romantic tension. Problem is, when that happens, I tend to just delete them off my kindle and forget about it, so... I don't really have any recs, sorry. My memory is pretty awful, and after a while, it just sort of blends together and I end up re-reading the thing a year later by accident. If it wasn't good or bad enough to make me care, I really do tend to just forget about it after a while.

In fairness, my tendency to switch quickly between fandoms probably doesn't help matters. Searching is hard largely because femslash authors often don't seem to tag their pairings, only the characters involved. So odd pairings we might want to find get lost amidst a sea of other, more common pairings.

****** Oh gods yes... I edited that when I realised I was mostly talking about FFnet, which can only tag a small number, but AO3 makes finding a specific pairing an absolute chore in a different direction unless you're very specific with your search terms xD

** *Here and There*, linkffn(7525570): pretty good until the last few chapters.

*If You Can Meet With Triumph And Disaster*, linkffn(7199645), is another HG/GW fic by the same author, although I haven't read it yet.

** I read an /awful/ one a while back. I remember being able to tolerate it when I first read through it, but upon attempting to re-read it a year ago or so, I realised it was horrendous. The plot was clunky, the dialogue was stilted, and there wasn't any overarching theme. It pretty much just turned me off on HG/GW since then, which is a real shame, as I'm a fan of both characters.
