** Linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane by Eilyfe)

/"...did you really think I would include them in a war if they had nothing to offer?"/ - Albus Dumbledore

Arthur got his NEWTs in many subjects including transfiguration, arithmancy, and Defense. Was an Unspeakable for several years and worked in Defense for a while. He only went into the chilled lifestyle after having kids. A total badass.

Molly is similar except specializing in Ancient Runes. The Family Clock was made by her when getting her Mastery in Runes.

None of which makes sense with their financial standing, unless they are incredibly foolish and careless with money... which, I suppose, is pointed to by their immediate splurge of their lottery money on an exotic vacation when they can't even afford books, robes, or a proper house.

And, in your universe, their inability to use such vaunted, supposedly advantageous skills to their advantage.

Twenty years a master enchanter, and a clock is all she has to show? An accomplished graduate at the Newt level, capable of fighting and with a history in the unspeakables - yet he works what is, by all accounts, a menial position in a small, overlooked Ministry department.

I don't believe for a second that two people of such supposed ability and with such high motivations in and right out of school were completely incapable of raising position, even accounting for Arthur's eccentricities. And if you're going to pull the "purebloods have total control to obstruct muggle lover" card, then how did he get into the unspeakables to begin with?

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** When I just saw your title, definitely came here to tell you Northumbrian only to see that you agree!

The Mind of Arthur Weasley remains one of my favorite one-shots in fanfiction.

*** I agree, the Northumbrian Weasleys are awesome (or slightly more dynamic linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50)). I really like some more complicated ones (NO BASHING, that I hate):

1. Just finished reading linkffn(6782408). Yes, it is Severitus, but not that bad, because it keeps him sufficiently bad person. Mrs. Weasley is just pure gold.
2. Surprisingly almost canonical (yes, Molly is killed by Voldie in the final battle as a revenge for offing Bellatrix) character of Arthur is in linkao3(13682133;12305793;11676102) and my own second level fanfiction story linkao3(18770464). You may be very offended by the most unique pairing in the history of fanfiction (well, from those meant seriously ... Harry/Giant Squid is just not in the same category), but it is truly shocking how little of what's in the story actually contradicts the canon. Almost nothing.
3. Certainly a noteworthy Weasleys are in linkffn(12373273) (which is for me very much headcanon for the two main characters) and Mrs. Weasley is surprisingly non-sympathetic (I am still looking forward for some resolution of her story).

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** Oh fuck this reminded me of this one fanfic. I can't remember the name but I had this one AWESOME scene. In it, Arthur has caught peter pettigrew and he starts acting a bit off.... like saying super ominous stuff to pettigrew, but like things he has said before. He ends up torturing pettigrew cuz “you, a full grown man, snuck into my home, ate my food, slept in MY baby boys bed. ” I'm pretty sure he tortures him. It's heavily implied but the torture is not written out.
