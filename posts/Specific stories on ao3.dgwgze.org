Looking for fics on ao3 where Harry and/or Hermione travels back to first year/Marauder era/to 1927 to adopt Tom etc. Fics with pureblood politics, Hermione being a pureblood or pretending to be one. Harry being a lord. Good Malfoys etc just basically guilty pleasure fics. No Snape/Hermione, Snape/Harry, Harry/Ginny, Hermione/Ron pairing. Just Harry and/or Hermione being MC

I've tried searching the tags on ao3 but found nothing interesting so I'm hoping you guys have recs that aren't tagged as what they are.


** Try birds of a feather on ao3 Or a maurader's plan . Both have a lot of politics,
