Not quite what you'd think, I'm looking for A fic where Albus Potter becomes a Dark Lord. Optional for the awful name his dad gave him being a motivation


** And when Harry defeats another dark lord with an anagram as their chosen name and discovers his son under the hood, he yells "I sometime wish you weren't my son."
