** You should write it. Even if it ends up not so good - the only way to get good is to do it anyways.

** To make it believable for me to read it, you'd have to do a bit of AU back story build flash blacks to retcon things, if done properly I'd read it if there was an interesting enough protagonist and Albus had an interesting enough problem with him psychologically since he has at least one ptsd parent and many relatives who probably have some similar stuff. You'd probably have to take out the whole scene where Harry meets dumbledore in the train station, bc that really takes away the fear of death to Harry, knowing that there is an after, and makes the threat of voldy a bit trivial and just scary because of the pain he would cause you.

*** Well it's true that the overall themes that this is going to have will be similar to cursed child but the plot is completely different.
