** I don't know of any, and I imagine it would be quite hard to write given the multiple endings/storylines you'd have to write simultaneously.

Interesting idea though.

*** Yeah, this type of story is really hard to pull off. I figured, though, this fandom has so many good writers that maybe there's been one who was ambitious enough to give this a try. Hopefully I'll find something.

** FWIW, pretty sure they're not allowed on FFN (which has never stopped anyone, I suppose), but i'd go take a look at AO3 or one of the forums like QQ

*** They're really not allowed on ffn? How come? That's such an odd thing to ban

** I'm not sure if anyone has written a CYOA in the style of the original books, where you jump to X chapter for decision A or Y chapter for decision B.

The typical style of CYOA, where the readers vote on or write in actions, is banned on FFN. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/]]

One of the guidelines is no interactive stories, presumably to prevent review inflation. A CYOA needs reader responses. You could use the forums, but the majority of readers don't browse those and they aren't linked directly in the story. The review button is. So, everyone votes by reviewing, boosting your fic in one of the major categories used to sort and discover fics.

On forums, it works fine because it's a forum. Discussion occurs between chapters anyway, the author can even reply without publishing a new non-story chapter and sending an alert, they can pin a poll at the top, and actual content gets threadmarked so people can stick to just the story if they want. So there's a bunch of these on SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity, but those are major hubs for Worm fanfics more so than HP.

FFN just isn't built for interactivity and doesn't want to support it anyway.

** There was one, but I can't remember the name. If it jogs anyone's memory: There were different chapters when you choose your own house, but if you can't decide it would ask you to roll a dice or something. You had to roll a dice to decide your Int, Wis, Str, etc. (In the beginning) It was on ffn.

** I dont know exactly what you mean by that but this is a fic about harry if it turned out it he was in a videogame, and he ends up exploiting until he goes from very very weak to pretty powerful for a little kid. I enjoyed reading it but its not finished and last updated sept 2017 so i wouldnt get your hopes up. Linkffn(9708318)

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS

*** Ah, sorry. I didn't think to elaborate on what that means. Choose your own adventure stories are the ones where the reader is given the choice to decide what the main character does next. For instance, if Harry sees someone acting weird you could get the choice of a)to follow that person, turn to chapter 2, or b) to return to the common room, turn to chapter 3. I hope that makes sense. It's essentially an interactive story.
