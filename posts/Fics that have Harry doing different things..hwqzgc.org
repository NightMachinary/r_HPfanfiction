I want some recommendations on Harry doing different things and canon isn't really a concern.

I just read Dragon Chronicles and a fic where Harry goes to live in a forest with the sorting hat?

Kinda like these.

I really liked how Harry had freedom to do stuff and friends and family supporting him.

Any recommendations...?


** Crafting Magic - linkffn(13256217) - Harry is into pottery and that is his focus. It's a good story about bringing art to Hogwarts.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer - linkffn(5915140) - Harry Potter learns about curse breaking and follows that adventure for his summer.

Make a Wish - linkffn(2318355) - Harry just does Harry things while trying to enjoy his vacation.

Serpentine - linkffn(12459242) - Pretty much Harry learning to become a magizoologist.

And yeah, I think those are the best stories I know that have Harry just doing what he wants.

  Magic is more than just waving a stick and saying fancy words. Magic is about life and art. Magic is about the people one chooses to interact with. An artistic Harry Potter decides to live up to his last name and begins to craft some wonderful pottery and ceramic creations. At age 11, he discovers that not only is his work magical but so is he!

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way- by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that seeks to either protect or destroy him.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  For once, Harry has taken advantage of his enormous wealth and used it to talk to a solicitor. He finds out a few things--- namely, the fact that his participation in the Triwizard Tournament has rendered him an emancipated minor and the last Lord of the Potters. Being the Lord of the Potters means a lot of things, but most importantly, it means Harry can get the hell outta dodge, and his friends can come along, too.Thus begins the new life of the Golden Trio. They're in America, they're in California, they're in Berkeley. Let the good times roll.

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.
