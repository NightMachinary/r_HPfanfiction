Looking for fics where Harry is traveling or not in hogwarts. I really enjoyed fics like Bungle in the jungle. I remember another where Harry travels around and at each stop crazy things happen to the death eaters trying to capture him. Any stories like those that involve Harry but not in hogwarts. Please no slash - Thanks.


** linkffn(Make a wish) is exactly the fic you are looking for.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
