I am looking for recommendations for fanfiction where Harry is building magitech (or just using it) and/or magical spaceship. Also Harry building society of magical people on an alien planet or in space (like a space station, for example).

​

Essentially where Harry solves (or leads people that do so) complex problems using magical technology.

​

I am especially looking at a reverse engineering approach to magitech, where instead of just making muggle tech to work witch magic you recreate the effects by purely magical means (runes, charms, rituals, etc.). Or of course, some original wizard magitech (as in not reverse engineered) is welcome.

​

Think linkffn(*Rise of the Wizards* by Teufel1987) approach to magitech.

​

Thanks in advance :)


** To start, the title had me giving with a confused chuckle, initially thinking the post was about Harry having Agoraphobia.

First one that comes to mind is a time travel SG-1 crossover called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125771/1][Ah, Screw It!]] linkffn(12125771), where Harry and allies eventually make a spaceship and spacesuits with magic, though it's not a big aspect of the story, that I recall.

Currently can't think of any others off the top of my head though.

*** Oh ... ups?? :) English isn't my native language so I kinda missed that. Sorry for spawning confusion :)

And if you're wondering I meant "spacefaring" ... and thanks for the recommendation!

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and ideas, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.
