I've read quite a few Snape centric stories and really enjoyed A Difference In The Family. It wasn't quite the Snape story I would've written but it was pretty close and an impressive piece of work given how long it was.

Do you guys have any recommendations of either Snape centric stories or Snape/Lily or Snape/Lucius or Snape/Hermione?

My real love is Lucius with Snape. I guess it's a bit odd but I can imagine him as being gay but keen to keep the Malfoy line going which is why there's only one heir.

But I can see the merits in Snape and Lily if they have a do-over or in Snape and Hermione if he was given the chance to live as I think she's one of his few intellectual equals.

Any suggestions appreciated. :)


** I really liked 'A dream carved in stone'.

It's set shortly after finishing Hogwarts. Lily never got along with the Marauders and her friendship with Sev has cooled because of his choices. The story also has an interesting take on Dark Magic.

*** Yes yes yes 100x for this story! The buildup was amazing.

I responded to a similar thread a couple months ago with several links to Snape/Lily and since I'm too lazy to write it all out again here you go!

** Not sure if you're interested, but I really liked Snape in [[http://www.intertexius.com/_index-harry-potter-fanfiction-and-art.html][A Bittersweet Potion]] and it's sequels. I consider it to be abandoned(though the authors keep saying they're still working on it), but the completed stories are still worth a read. It's Harry/Snape.

If you're okay with some more Snarry, I can dig through my bookmarks. There's one really good, long fic I'm thinking of but can't remember the name right now.

edit: words are hard
