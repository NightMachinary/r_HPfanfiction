I was wondering if anyone knew of any good canon-compliant Teddy Lupin growing up fics, growing up with Harry and the rest of the Weasley clan, going to Hogwarts etc?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] by Inverarity is probably the best one I know of; 200k words, complete.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

*** Thank you, I've only just begun to read it and I love it. It is exactly what I was looking for. I also had no idea that it was written by the same author that wrote the Alexandra Quick series. Thank you!
