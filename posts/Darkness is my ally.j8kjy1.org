-Harry Potter isn't the boy-who-lived.

-Albus is using Harry as an elaborate trap to protect the true boy-who-lived. Prophecy is still recited. Same events as in canon but with different context. Albus essentially wants to make sure that Voldermort attacks the Potters to ensure that he has the fake boy who lived he needs. He suggests the switch in secret keepers to Sirius through a confundus knowing wormtail was a traitor. Everything links back to Albus manipulations

- Albus is truly preparing Harry to die as he still does have a Horcrux in him. It's why he sent him to the Dursleys and then had him meet the Weasleys.

-The true boy-who-lived is Neville whom knows this. Neville is pretending to be weak to throw off suspension. Neville after Harry's sacrifice at the final battle jumps in and kills Voldemort. Neville then proclaims, he is the real boy-who-lived. Shows some type of proof

- Albus who is dead or not, your choice, what he didn't know was that the Dark Lord that Neville was suppose to vanquish is actually Harry Potter. And since Harry has died, he all but negated the prophecy.

- from here you can go in to Harry's descent into darkness as his entire life had been manipulated.

The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies....

*** Yeah, the Horcrux marks Harry Potter as the boy who lived. No Horcrux = died to avada kedavra = didn't live.

But still, a way for Harry to be the Horcrux and Neville to still be the 'true' boy who lived is simple - Neville has the 'power he knows not'. Ofc, that power can't be something stupid like the 'power of love'.

How about the ability to teleport anyone you can set your eyes on into the core of the Sun?

***** There would be no struggles for Neville, but since the protagonist is Harry that's a moot point.

But yeah, a revenge fic against a antagonist who has the power to teleport you into the core of the goddamn sun seems like a impossible premise. Even if it was written, it would be more Dies Irae rather than anything like usual Harry Potter novels.

*** Thanks for the feedback. However, I was trying to make it seem like the prophecy was misinterpreted and that Voldermort was never the one it was about

** I think you mean "The Chosen One" instead The Boy Who Lived. Because The Chosen One and The Boy Who Lived not necessarily have to be the same person, right?
