Harry and 3 others come to hogwarts as the new hogwarts 4 and takes over hogwarts before killing voldemort in the great hall in front of reporters and death eaters. I think susan bones was hufflepuffs heir and neville was gryffindors.


** Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse. Good story, I enjoyed it. Wish it'd update though.

*** It felt like the author was trying too hard to make Harry super-serious-man. It really put me off.

**** Is that the one where Harry has the red highlight in his hair and he has a pet crow? If so, I couldn't get past the part where [[/spoiler][Harry feels his crow is giving him a test by making him hide the philosopher's stone in his own stomach, and then he realizes he failed the test because Nicolas Flamel came looking for the stone while he was doing the surgery I think?]] I don't know, way too much edge for me.
