I can't remember how long ago I read it, but there was a fic where Dumbledore is extremely manipulative/evil, so Harry runs away with Sirius, yada yada yada. He ends up going to the International Confederation of Wizards or some such, where Dumbledore tries to attack him and is arrested. I only remember that part because Harry became a magical architect at the very end of the story. Any help?
