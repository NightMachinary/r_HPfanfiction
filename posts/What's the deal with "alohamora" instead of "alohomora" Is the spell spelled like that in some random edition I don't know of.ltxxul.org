#+TITLE: What's the deal with "alohamora" instead of "alohomora"? Is the spell spelled like that in some random edition I don't know of?

I've read "alohamora" so many times in fics that I'm really doubting myself here.


** "Alohamora" tried Harry. "Oh hi to you as well Mr Potter, I'm the Lock, if you want me to open, I don't mind" answered the lock. Magic was fucking weird.

It's just a common misspelling. I'm more confused as to why Durmstrang is constantly written as Drumstrum.

*** u/Avalon1632:
#+begin_quote
  Drumstrum
#+end_quote

That's the international nickname for Durmstrang's music department. There's more than one kind of Dark Arts, y'know - Dubstep is a great, but terrible thing. :)

** "Alohamora" seems to flow better to me, and it has a nice bit of internal rhyme. So people probably just started pronouncing it that way and then assumed it was spelt like that without ever going back to check.

[[https://youtu.be/0CEOotN4Px4][And the pronunciation in the movies]] is quick, and that vowel sounds closest to a \…ô\ sound to me, which could easily turn into an \a\ sound in people's minds.

** I suspect it has something to do with the echo of ‚ÄúAloha‚Äù, the Hawaiian greeting.

** Probably from the Hawaiian "aloha".

I'm more upset about apparition (which is a spirit or vision) instead of apparation. Turns out that it was spelled apparation until like the 5th book, when suddenly the editorial staff changed it (or possibly stopped undoing the autocorrect).

*** I use apparate so much that my autocorrect doesn't say it's misspelled üòÇ

I'm sure ‚Äúaloha‚Äù has something to do with autocorrect as well. Especially if you've tried to type the same spell a thousand times and it keeps correcting to nonsense on your phone. They just slip sometimes.

** It's a nonsense word, adhering to the canonical pronunciation seems a tad daft.
