after reading the first couple of chapters of forever knight, i instantly fell in love with it. i enjoyed the story so much that i think it set a standard for romance stories for me. So i would really appreciate recommendations for any story thats similar in nature to Forever Knight;great story, touching romance,well-written sex scenes and best of all, it avoids most if not all bad tropes that comes with a majority h/hr stories(mainly bashing, lots of it). All pairings of Harry are welcome provided they aren't slashes.

***** No idea. I've never read it; I just googled for it.

How about it, OP? I know you think it's good, but can you elaborate?

****** That's the one, yeah.

A large part of it is that its characterization is done so well; the characters feel faithful to canon, but not rigidly so. Snape's characterization is especially striking in this regard, given that the story was complete before the release of Book 7.

Beyond that, it's written pretty well and the story has a rather grand scale with an epic feel.

Also, it's always refreshing to have a vampire based story (particularly a romance) that isn't at either extreme on the scale of fairy tale to 3edgy5me.

******** No, it's Harry/Hermione.

It's also worth noting that it avoids the H/Hr tropes that people tend to dislike (no Weasley bashing and no helpless Hermione).
