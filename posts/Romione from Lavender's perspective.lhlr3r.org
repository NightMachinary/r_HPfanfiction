Everyone seems to see Lavender as evil witch who dared to offend Hermione, but in fact she was just a girl who fell in love with some guy who, let's be honest, used her "for practice". I felt pity for her when he ghosted her.. because he couldn't take courage and tell the truth. She could be annoying and was too much, but after all, she was just a teenager! And every girl shouldn't be Hermione's copy. Btw, she did much romione ship to develop.

So I want some fanfiction about 6th year with Lavender as main character, her thoughts, feeling, her point of view.


** There was a story from Lavender's POV, where she was trying to make their relationship so ridiculous (e.g., Won-Won), that Ron would finally open his eyes and see Hermione. Plan was good, execution not so much. I cannot find it now though.

**** I didn't say it fits mine. Or headcanon ... I don't dispute the canonical disaster between Ron and Lavender, but I have always wanted a good AU story, where Ron lying poisoned in the hospital would decide, that he actually likes Lavender, but he wants to make it into a proper long-term relationship. I have never found it written well (couple of attempts, which were too silly to read). I tried to suggest something like that in my one-shot “Late Morning Talks” linkao3(20141410), but that was not a serious story, just an exercise, and the story was primarily about Ron/Hermione end of the relationship. I wanted to write a proper dialogue between Ron and Lavender in the hospital, but I have never managed to complete it.

I'll check it, thanks! As I can see it is about romione breaking up, I have many versions of their supposed breaking up in my mind and usually they end on friendly terms)) I don't mind their couple in books, but their divorce is also possible in my headcanon

** I always figured that the reason Lavender behaved the way she did was that Hermione intimidated her. Basically, Ron and Hermione had been friends for years, and there was obviously at least some unresolved tension there, so what chance did Lavender possibly have when Ron hadn't paid her a second glance until now? Thus, she became very clingy as a result.

Personally I don't think Romione would have ended well (they spend a lot of time bickering, and that doesn't seem like a fun pasttime for the rest of their lives...), and I think that a more confident Lavender, coupled with her knowing that Hermione is out of the running, could work much better for Ron.

*** Maybe. Im not sure about end for romione, it can be both happy and sad ending, I just regret that trio was ruined, I liked their friendship much better (to make a friend is more difficult than lover) and wish to see each of them with someone out of trio. But romione as endgame was predictable, make them three a family by marriage not just friendship.

Hell, a lot of blokes even as adults feel intimidated if they see a close, lifelong friend of their partner as being a possible romantic option, even if they see each other as siblings or just platonic friends (e.g. hetero bloke, lesbian BFF), and vice-versa -- the amount of friendships I've seen tested because the new girlfriend considers a lifelong girl friend as a possible rival is just saddening. :(

** Even for her age (16), she was pretty immature -- hence the "Won Won" shit. However, that could've been her trying to forcibly keep things going, even if it had the opposite effect.

I'm wondering what'd happen if she found a muggle magazine that discussed the "Dos and Don'ts" of having a boyfriend (you know, like those articles you see in teen girl magazines/websites/stuff) -- maybe it'd cause her to act differently, or to decide that Ron would be a bad choice because of the Hermione tension.

And all this romantic stuff with stupid nicknames use even adults, if he would really love her, he wouldn't react so (just remember sugary couples from real life). In the beginning he liked it!

This article wouldn't help, she got wrong boyfriend, fell for him, but he didn't care much, learned how to kiss and wished to break up :(

Yeah, Ron did pretty much use her a bit, but honestly? Theirs was actually pretty realistic of a lot of teenagers' relationships.

Lavender was collateral damage of being in the way of the Ron/Hermione ship (which JKR later admitted was a bit nonsensical how it was written, heh). She got a raw deal, unfortunately.
