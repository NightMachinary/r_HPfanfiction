I'm looking for good quality fics about Voldemort, preferably when he was younger (either at Hogwarts or when he beginning his rise to power.) Can anyone recommend anything? (Preferably nothing about him raising Harry to be his heir/ becoming Harry's lover etc.) Thanks!

  More than two decades ago, Headmaster Dippet made the fateful decision to hire Tom Riddle as an associate Hogwarts professor. And now, at last, Riddle's double life as Lord Voldemort is threatening to bring the Wizarding World to its knees...if only he can convince his students to leave him alone.
