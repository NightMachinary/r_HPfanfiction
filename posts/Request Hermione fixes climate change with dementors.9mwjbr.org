If one can safely assume wizards are oblivious to the damage muggles can do to the planet, what if Hermione went environmentalist? Probably crack fic, but please tell me this exists!


** Dementors: Final solution to overpopulation! by Hermione Weasley

As we all know, humankind contributes 5% of greenhouse gass emissions. Mostly because developing countries are exempt of climate targets. Obvious solution is dementors. As they are happily munching muggle souls by the billions we have time to invent solution to inevitable dementor overpopulation.

  Final solution to overpopulation
#+end_quote

That is a very unlucky word choice. Or very accurate, considering that this measure would be nothing short of a genocide which would make any historical look like it wasn't even trying.

#+end_quote

Why am I getting Hermione/Bellatrix vibes from that part?
