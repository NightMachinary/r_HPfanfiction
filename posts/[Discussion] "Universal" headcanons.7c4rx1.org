Are there any headcanons that seem so universal (as in, you can in a lot of fanfictions it not being written as new information) that you were surprised they weren't canon?

I can only remember myself having the opposite experience - there are a lot of canon names and stuff that I thought were fan-made, but I was baffled to find out were actually official (most due to me having read the books in my mother tongue). One that comes to mind is the whole "Noble and Most Ancient House of [insert your golden pureblood name here]", which I totally thought was made up, but is actually an official title that the noble and most ancient houses use... :|

But I'm curious to see if there's anything I accepted as canon until not but is actually not, haha


** That wands are actually necessary. I mean, it is sort of JK's fault, since she teased the casual use of wandless spells in the early books before dropping it and splurging all of that worldbuilding cash on wandlore in DH.

Then we come to find out that European wizards are just stupid or something, because their African and Native American counterparts are Cursing people's jaws off barehanded. So I guess this is more "book canon cum plothole" than anything else.

**** In my mind, it's doable, but very difficult, especially when trying to affect something outside of yourself. The material of what you're trying to manipulate comes in as well. For example, gold is very stable element-wise, so it's resistant to magical manipulation and extra hard when trying to affect it wandlessly. I imagine most witches and wizards they have perfectly fine wands, so why bother?

Also, WRT wandless magic, I can see Harry having a special interest in it since his parents were caught flat-footed without theirs. If James could have done a wandless Shield Charm, things would have been very different!

******* "With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels."

“Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!” He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving. “You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?” he whispered to Hermione. “I did everything,” she whispered back, “Muffliato, Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn't be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.” Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, told them that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time."

I got proof from book seven! :) See? It says no one should see or hear them even if they are magicians or nonmagical! Also it says it is the disillusionment spell but it is cast on the camp? So that /is/ proof that the some hiding spells can be cast on a /person/ or on an /area/? Either way if you want to? So yes that does mean it makes some canon sense that you could cast notice-me-not fanon spells on an area or a person if they wanted to?

Many wizards we see in the books tend to be absent-minded and not very conscientious. If they could permanently ward off an area with a casual sweep of their wand, I doubt many of them would bother to take the protections down once they were no longer needed. So over millennia, Britain would be absolutely filled with these little hidden pockets of space.

****** I think that if tempus did exist in canon people would not wear watches. Watches are going out of style today (except as jewelry) because of cell phones. Just like wands for wizards and witches, cell phones are something we always have with us that can tell the time. Arguably, it's simpler to just glance at your wrist than pull your phone out of your purse or pocket, turn on the screen and look for the numbers there, but because we always have phones with us anyway no one wants to strap on an extra device to do the same thing our phone can do.

#+begin_quote
  Now, there are a few things you should know about Slytherin -- and a few you should forget. Firstly, let's dispel a few myths. You might have heard rumours about Slytherin house -- that we're all into the Dark Arts, and will only talk to you if your great-grandfather was a famous wizard, and rubbish like that. Well, you don't want to believe everything you hear from competing houses. I'm not denying that we've produced our share of Dark wizards, but so have the other three houses -- they just don't like admitting it. And yes, we have traditionally tended to take students who come from long lines of witches and wizards, but nowadays you'll find plenty of people in Slytherin house who have at least one Muggle parent.

It sounds power-levelly on the surface, but Dumbledore also says "unqualified". It could be that when mentions "the amount of magical power", what he means is the combination of knowledge, understanding of magical concepts, and mastery of spells that Voldemort's enchantment is somehow able to measure.

Its all mental, all in the mind (and the wrist...). The only exhaustion you can suffer is mental, the only pool you can run dry on is your knowledge.

It was inspiring as a teenager. As long as you /wanted/, you could be great. Effort, training and learning was key to becoming mighty.

Which is why I /despise/ magical cores so much. They negate all of this. With them you're just born powerful or weak; you never get a say in it. It's cheap, it's stupid and I hate that its such a wide spread element in fanfiction.
