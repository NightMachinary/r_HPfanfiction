NSWF or not, doesnt really matter. Thanks


** Canon has Ron Weasley speaking the magical language by 'guessing.' That sorta fits your request. I'm sorry that no fanfics come to mind straight away. It could make for an interesting plot point in a story.

*** There's a couple Ron Bashers that abuse that little canon tidbit and turn the entire Weasley clan or just Ron and/or Ginny into Parselmouths. I generally haven't saved those though.

**** Ginny keeping the ability after her run in with Diary Tom would be an interesting plot point for a fic, particularly since she'd have no idea until hilarity ensued.

I have an idea: I don't know if you've read smut fics, but parseltongue is often the holy grail of oral in them, and I just had this scene pop in my head of Harry saying some decidedly unsexy things in parseltongue while eating Ginny out and her freak out on him. That'd be a hilarious time to discover she was still a parselmouth.

** There are a few fics where Hermione makes a deliberate effort to learn Parseltongue. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10381381/1/Compound-Interest][Compound Interest]] is one that I can recall.

** HermioneIsSalazar and SalazarIsMisunderstood plot base , you don't get a lot of "parselaction" at the moment but it seems that the pace of the story is increasing , it is updated pretty frequently from what i noticed.

** Cant think of the names, but i think there is one where hannahis a parsemouth. Another, i think has the weasleys as parselmouth, and that is why ginny could get into the chamber of secrets. Maybe this will help your search.
