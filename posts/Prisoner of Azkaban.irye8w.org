Right so Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite book in the series but it seriously stresses me out. In Chapter 21, Hermione's Secret Harry and Hermione are trying to get Snape, Fudge and Dumbledore to believe them that they are telling the truth and the Sirius is innocent. Dumbledore believes them but he can't saying anything about it. What I don't understand is why can't Dumbledore just go up to his office and get his pensieve. Harry and Hermione would be able to extract their memory's and show them what happened. They were able to do it in HBP with Slughorn.

**** Well, Doylistically, Rowling just hadn't invented the Pensieve yet. It didn't appear 'til the Fourth Book, so Rowling hadn't invented it in order to be able to draw upon it as a solution yet. Or possibly just Rowling's obsessive adherence to her plot over all other concerns - the Seven Potters was also an utterly ridiculous plan when there were far better options out there, but she needed something associated with those events to happen for her plot, so she bent common sense to make the characters do it. Likely she just needed Sirius on the run for making Harry miserable and maintaining her plot and just focused on making that happen.

In-world, the possible explanations are numerous. A personal favourite is that Pensieves aren't viable as legal evidence, since memory is so easy to trick/fake that using a memory is pointless. For example, a person in a memory could be a person using polyjuice. And apparently, it's possible to create fake Memories a la Slughorn. Could also be that Dumbledore was caught up in the situation and just forgot. Could be that he knew Fudge was so focused on ending/heavily bribed by Malfoy to end Sirius that he wouldn't listen or believe any evidence to the contrary. Could be that he's secretly a Machiavellian type and wants Sirius on the Run so he can't take Harry out of the Dursley's home and beyond the Blood Wards. We have no in-world explanation or Word of God from Rowling, so all we can do is theorise and there's enough floating around to justify pretty much any conclusion you like.

I'm not really a big fan of the pensieve myself, since the idea that you can draw a memory from someone's head and enter it to see things they never actually saw is ludicrous (like, where does that information even come from?), and memory is foggy and unclear and disorganised as fuck and put through so many layers of personal experience and viewpoints to encode and store, so if you were actually taking a memory directly from someone's head it would be borderline impossible for anyone else to even understand.

****** Yeah, see. That kind of thing makes much more sense than the default vanilla Pensieve. I've seen some good ideas on how they work, which is why I'm only 'not really a big fan' rather than anything approaching actual dislike. I remember another one that said the stuff in places the person the memory belongs to could never have seen was basically the 'best guess' of magic/the people visiting the memory of what was there. That one was an interesting concept, given the brain's habit of prognosticating possibilities by conglomeration of past experiences and sights.

#+end_quote

That's the one thing I don't get about that avenue of explanation. Why would Malfoy preemptively bribe Fudge about Sirius not being a Death Eater and not giving him a trial? Since Sirius never was a Death Eater (and therefore has no secret knowledge), he could not even cause trouble for Lucius since his Imperius defence was already firmly established. If anything, Malfoy would want a trial and the clearing of Sirius as a PR stunt and it would further distance him from the "taint" of "being imperiused".

****** It likely wouldn't be anything to do with the Death Eaters at all. There are certainly other explanations available. Gaming the inheritance from The Black Family is the usual one, I believe.

Before the war, the inheritance would be shared between Sirius, Regulus, Bellatrix, and Narcissa, so there's not much opportunity there and Lucius is far less powerful than he is while Harry is at school, so there's more work to make those limited opportunities happen and thus he just leaves it be.

Then the war happens and the Voldemort shit goes down. Since Andromeda was disinherited, Bellatrix was legally jailed, and Regulus was dead, Sirius and Narcissa would be the last two possible inheritors and thus would have to share said inheritance. To a Rich Guy who wants more stuff, this wouldn't be ideal, but he can live with it (he's on shaky ground with his secret death eater status/imperius acquittal and still not as powerful as he is while Harry is at school, so it's still more work to make happen).

Then, Sirius gets put in Azkaban and is left there, locked up with popular public support and widely-accepted evidence and seemingly guaranteed to stay that way. So it looks like Narcissa is going to get everything without any need to do anything and thus the situation is fine to be left alone. They start to think it's guaranteed and start to get attached to the inheritance and their plans for what they'll do with it. They start to think of it as 'basically theirs already'. People feel ownership over what they think they're owed, after all.

But then Sirius escapes. Which means the once-guaranteed situation is in chaos and opens up unforeseeable outcomes. Maybe he'll prove (/bribe) himself innocent and get the Black Money/Books/Cute Heirlooms that Lucius and Narcissa feel like they're owed and are subsequently now more willing to put in the work to get and more able due to the power/resource increase of ten years in politics. Maybe he is guilty and will go after the Potter boy. Maybe he'll fuck off to Timbuktu and never be heard from again. Lucius wouldn't know, but whatever Sirius' intention, he can control some aspects of the situation by ensuring that, after whatever Sirius does goes down, Fudge will still have him reimprisoned/kissed/executed somehow, which means re-removing him from the inheritance line - and as stated before, removing him would mean Narcissa gets the lot by default (ie. guaranteed to happen) and thus ensuring what they're owed goes to where it's 'supposed' to be.

Though that's all just a single guess and hypothetical progression of events, really. There's probably a hundred more, if you care to keep thinking about it. Anything can be justified or explained if you keep asking 'why' for long enough. :)

I'd have expected Lucius to do everything in his power to regain his reputation after the war and "prove" he was Imperius'd! Like giving to charity and helping orphans and crap! But instead he's threatening governors and bribing board members left and right, and getting RAIDED with dark artifacts like a fucking MORON. Like who's going to believe THAT GUY was ever Imperius'd?!

*********** Especially if Lucius kick-starts the CoS debacle, he doesn't need to threaten board members. He just needs to point out that someone is actively targeting muggleborn students in school and Dumbledore refuses to take action. He hasn't notified the aurors. He hasn't contacted family members. Victims are stored in relatively open access for the perpetrator to hurt them again. The school is open. He has not sent out for any resources to cure the problem, even when a solution has been identified. (If twelve-year-olds are permitted to handle the most dangerous part of the cure, then apothecaries certainly can carry it.)

And then Lucius makes a generous offer to pay for the cures out of pocket, since this situation is reminding him of the pain he went through in the war.

All in all, this is a fairly clear-cut argument for "Who cares if he's Dumbledore, he's endangering the students."

Once the aurors find the diary (because it wasn't being THAT subtle and it's a massively evil artifact), Lucius' Unspeakable buddy points out that it's a horcrux, and it doesn't appear to be the only one. Fortunately, he knows how to use it to locate the others. After all, Lucius wants to be on top, not bowing to a madman who tortures them at will.

After a brief detour to rescue Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived from being abused (and placing him with a proper wizarding family), they've removed the horcruxes from a national icon and several historical artifacts. It's a fantastic story of the downfall of the worst Dark Lord Britain has ever seen in years, brought on by a baby and an ex-enthralled slave.

There's a smart Lucius.

******** True. But it wouldn't earn him the whole lot of the inheritance. And if you've spent ten years thinking you're going to get it because your main rival is in jail, then you're probably going to try for the whole cookie rather than settle for bits, especially if your rival is a social outcast and you can bribe/manipulate the relevant people more easily.

And a fair point, on Sirius' ability to pass stuff to Harry note. All I can say is that the Goblins are weird and seem to swing between independent nation-state and subservient banking service and I don't know enough about canon to come up with a good, semi-backed reason off the top of my head right now. Maybe if the document isn't filed with the Goblins, they don't consider it legitimate; maybe they just don't care about human conflicts and will serve anyone, so long as they pay; maybe inheritances 'get passed', so when Sirius died the Black Inheritance that would've gone to him went to Harry instead; maybe Sirius really wasn't disinherited properly and it was just the tapestry thing with no legal bearing, but Lucius just assumed he had been and got worried he'd overturn that somehow (bribes) when he escaped?

**** My point is that there is no functional difference between giving a statement in words, and giving a statement in memories. If Fudge does not believe the statements, he does not believe the memory and vice-versa.

This is the situation:

#+begin_quote
  “Minister, listen, please,” Hermione said; she had hurried to Harry's side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge's face. “I saw him too. It was Ron's rat, he's an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and---”

  “You see, Minister?” said Snape. “Confunded, both of them... Black's done a very good job on them...”
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  “It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because there is very little time,” he [Dumbledore] said quietly. “There is not a shred of proof to support Black's story, except your word---and the word of two thirteen year old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper.”

  “Professor Lupin can tell you---” Harry said, unable to stop himself.

  “Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little---and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends---”

  “But---”

  “Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see that Professor Snape's version of events is far more convincing than yours.”
#+end_quote

Now assume Snape's story is true, as Minister Fudge clearly does. How does a memory of a confounded person help anything here? It's just as useless as their statement. On the other hand, Fudge has a convicted mass-murderer that's escaped from Azkaban, the Dementors are there, and he's got a chance to deal with him before he escapes yet again.

As Dumbledore says: They're out of time.

Time turner, invisibility cloak, have his Phoenix catch and flash him to custody... Perhaps most importantly, he is Dumbledore.

Except from what we see in canon, they /might/ not have to do that? Technically we don't know for certain if Sirius got a trial or not, but we know Fudge put out a Kiss on Sight order on him regardless, so he can clearly do that without absolute incontrovertible proof Sirius was guilty (since he wasn't).

Most 'legal proceedings' type stuff we see in canon doesn't really seem to show Wizards, y'know, caring much about the sort of 'Integrity in the Justice System' beliefs like that you mentioned. Whether the actual documentation of the law supports them, or they're just all corrupt and ignoring it, they get away with doing it and that's what matters in the end.

And technically I didn't say 'might makes right', only that the law only matters if people believe it does and act correspondingly, and we have plenty of evidence that the Magical Government (or at least powerful/notable members of it) don't care and aren't ever really penalised for not caring.

If the police decided to stop bothering with any illegal drug investigations whatsoever, no ownership, no manufacture, no distribution, no nothing, then the fact that those things are illegal would be completely irrelevant on a practical level. You could openly manufacture, sell, and use/own illegal drugs however you liked and nobody would move to stop you. In that case, making drug things illegal would just be pretty words on paper.

Hell, the original lawyers were forbidden to take pay for what they did, but they still did it and just didn't say anything and everyone kinda went with it. Philosophy and practicality don't always match.

Not very honest, not very nice, and also I really do not like it, but I can understand that people do things like that. However, there are some other decisions about my life in the last couple of years, I just cannot understand. They testify either about problems of his mind or serious problems of his morals.

  OK, let's ignore Professor Binns for now, back to the law. So, laws enacted before this separation should be generally in force unless they were repealed, right?

And why, when no such transcript could be found, why nobody immediately has drawn Sirius to such trial and found him innocent of all charges? Besides, Aurors give rat arse, I am sorry, Professor, Aurors really don't care that much whether you have evidence when you announce them even your suspicion that the crime was committed, right? They are the one to collect the evidence, that's their job.

If he believed Sirius was innocent, the I dont think he would've ever allowed dementors to roam around Hogwarts. Besides, Dumbledore is not all-knowing kind of character in Harry potter where he knows everything that happens and can predict exactly what may happenn in future. Why do you assume he knew that Sirius was innocent.

Coming to the Time Tuner argument, You could have literally saved Lily and James using that thing. Thats why JK was really cautious while using it in the story.

** The easy answer is: J.K. hadn't invented Pensieves at this time of the series.

The in-world answer is: you can manipulate memories. Slughorn did exactly that (not very masterfully, but he did it). Sirius was thought to be the most dangerous wizard only second to Voldemort. Fudge was sure that Harry and Hermione were under a Confundus. Manipulating their memories wouldn't be that much of a stretch - when even Lockhart managed that spell.

That's also the reason Harry had to depend on Mrs Figg as witness in OotP at his trial - Pensieve memories aren't really reliable.
