** I think it would depend on intent. If you intentionally do it with the thought of getting rid of the person forever. Yeah, that's pretty much murder.

If you're like going to vanish your trash and it reflects off that mirror you forgot you threw away and hits your best bud in the head and bam he's gone. Well, probably just manslaughter.

**** A Vanished person can be un-Vanished, so the crime is actually one of illegal restraint.

My headcanon adds that if the target is skilled in basic Apparation, they could escape the be-Vanishment on their own.

****** No one in canon was Vanished, but the OP asked 'if you could Vanish a person...'. The Vanishing class in 5th year Transfiguration included several instances of un-Vanishing. Therefore, 'a Vanished person' assumes that the person could be and was Vanished.

Also, my headcanon is that this is how house-elves travel, which is why they aren't affected by anti-Apparation jinxes.

******** In the broken Vanishing Cabinet, which was more like a teleporter imo. Supposed to teleport between 2 linked cabinets (like in the end of Half Blood Prince) but it was broken so it put you in like a midway place that you can't escape from normally.

I think Vanashing is a bit of a misnomer. It's more like teleporting items somewhere (Vanishing items to the dump or scrolls to somewhere hidden like in lower down this thread) and the cabinet was a special case because it was enchanted to Vanish its entire contents instead of a specific item, which allows for teleporting people.

** vanishing is reversible so probably not, if you survive being cojured again.

Edit: just remembered vanishing cabinets, so its definitely survivable. and you also dont seem to be able to starve considering that one slytherin who took days/weeks to reappear.

*** Since when is Vanishing reversible? The Vanishing Cabinets don't vanish their contents, they transport them to the paired cabinet. If the other cabinet is broken the contents are dropped into some kind of limbo, not Vanished which (at least based on what McGonagall said) is something like being dispersed into everything else.

#+end_quote

the have been instances in canon where vanishing was used to temporarily remove an object. for example in order of phoenix to hide parchment when Harry entered a room.

And I was under the impression that vanishing cabinets vanish you and conjure you at the different end. Otherwise the name wouldn't really be fitting.

I don't remember this instance. Does it say the parchment was vanished or did it say it just disappeared (through means unknown)?

The 'Vanishing' bit simply refers to the fact that the contents are gone from the cabinet they were placed in (and appear at the other), but they obviously aren't vanished since they are teleported elsewhere (or in the case of a cabinet with a broken pair, sent to some kind of limbo). They were used in the first Wizarding War to get families away from danger, hence vanishing cabinet. McGonagall said that Vanished objects are gone, they go into non-being.

“Here, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs. Weasley's charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building. Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill's heavily laden arms. “This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,” she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates. Bill took out his wand, muttered “Evanesco!” and the scrolls vanished.
