*** u/munin295:
#+begin_quote
  An actual description of the story
#+end_quote

Hallelujah!

(not just the point of departure which doesn't actually tell you anything about the story)

#+begin_quote
  and not a bunch of questions
#+end_quote

Preach!

("What if ...", "How will Dumbledore/Hogwarts/the magical world react to...": nope.)

#+begin_quote
  or list of pairings/tags.
#+end_quote

Hold on there Bucko...

(this is actually useful information I/others use to filter stories)

**** I just meant where there's more pairing tags and other tags than actual description. A few tags fine, but I've seen some descriptions that seem like they have more tags than story.

** Enough information so we know when to read and when to pass. You're supposed to sell your story with that. The AO3 approach of squeezing half of the first chapter into it is also a bad idea in my opinion.

Tags/warnings, like 'slash', 'Weasley bashing' or 'Harmony', could be put on the first chapter's A/N, though.

** Something interesting and unique that also gives me a feel for what the story is about. I've seen some authors successfully use a few (note: a few!) lines from an opening and/or early chapter to great effect, but you have to avoid the pitfall of putting in too story, if that makes sense.

** I'll be honest and say that I probably want more in a summary than in reasonable. Aside from the general plot, I want to know:

- ultimate pairing, as well as other pairings. If I want to read a Ron/Hermione fic but it also includes a Draco/Hermione at first, I might not want to read that, so it's good to get the heads up.
- genre. I don't really like adventure fics unless there is some good romance or drama involved. If an author can let me know their fic is 100% adventure, it's good to know.
- triggers. Personally, I generally nope out of fics with sexual assault so give me the heads up if the fic will have that.

*** Well normally the Genre is under the blurg for all fics on FFN.

**** Yeah, and usually its an accurate barometer. But I've read a lot of fics that said there was romance or drama only to find out there is like one chapter worth of that and 95% adventure.
