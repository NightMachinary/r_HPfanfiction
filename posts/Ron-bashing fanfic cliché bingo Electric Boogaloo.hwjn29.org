***** The year was 2177, and names were a thing of the past. Only one being, an entity of untold power, still had one - rather, it had them all. Using foul sorcery, the being once known merely as "Harry Potter" had begun to take, to steal, people's names. In this day and age, one had to identify themselves by strange, incomprehensible strings of noise, generated through a random number generator.

"He's here" said Gdbshyzhebdkd, the witch who had once been known as Hermione.

"We're so fucked." answered Kdhehdkcuennd, the wizard once known as Ron.

The door exploded inwards, shattered like glass along the magic reinforcing it.

"Youuuuuu... have something of mine...." the voice was like an open grave, like the wind howling through an empty cathedral.

"Wow, that's a colorful metaphor, Harry" said Kdhshuxhebf, the witch who was once known as Gdbshyzhebdkd.

"Please... use my full name.... he he he he"

"Kdhevxyg!" shouted Lejebxhej, who had at one point been known as Kdhehdkcuennd.

But it was of no use. Lencahxyje, who had once been known as Kdhshuxhebf, felt the foul witchcraft take hold, and she began to speak.

She would not stop for several days.

**** The funniest thing is where people try and woke and just end up looking even more bigotted.

I am part of a Fandom where a lot of authors decided to make race changes to make the cast more diverse to the points its become fancannon to some people.

There are two boys.\\
The first is blue eyed and black haired. He is a rich kid with emotionally neglectful parents who is constantly left at home in his mansion while his parents travel the world.

The second is a red head with blue eyes. He is homeless because his junkie mother overdosed and his father is a gang member who vanished.

Guess which one the fandom likes making Latino while the other one stays white. Here is a Hint, the Klan would totally agree with the depiction.

******* I know you are joking but it was Flavor Aid and 80% of the Jonestown Congregation was African American.

The thing that drew a lot off people to his cause was him advocating for a mixed race utopia which was not a safe thing to be preaching about in the 60s. Reverend Jim Jones and his wife were actually the first white couple in Indiana to adopt a a black baby in 1961. The reason so many people left the country with him was because he told his congregation they were going to move to a place they could build thier mixed race utopia without government interference. Here is a statement from one of the former members (who left the church before the mass suicide).

[[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/jonestown-race/]["Vernon Gosney was a white man with a black wife. The first church they approached had refused to marry them --- in fact, interracial marriage was illegal in some states as late as 1967. Gosney recalled the difficult climate of the time. “We were not accepted. Her family didn't accept me. My family didn't accept her, and it was really important to us, to have a place --- to be in a place where we were accepted and embraced and celebrated...” Peoples Temple was that place."]]

If you have a strong stomach you can actually get an idea of the racial makeup by looking at the pictures of the compound post suicde. [[https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/14/jonestown-survivors-lost-only-life-they-knew-built-new-ones/][The corpses are very diverse.]]

**** It's pretty much ubiquitous in Lord Potter-Black-Peverell etc type stories. Harry's richest in the world, suddenly going by a title, looking down on the Weasleys for not following “pureblood traditions”, exclusively hanging out with other Lords and Ladies, tittering about people who don't know the proper club handshake, or whatever. All of this is written without an ounce of introspection or critical thinking. Of course the only poor family in the series is made evil. Their main goal? Stealing Harry's money. Come on.

****** Well, that kinda happens too.

Most of the times they depict Molly as the mastermind behind trying to esnare Harry with love potions and stuff. The reason? A lot of the times, her former familly, the Prewetts, which used to be rich but fell in disgrace and poverty (or simmilar events), forcing her to marry Arthur.

So now she tries to trick Harry into a marriage with Ginny to get his fortune and reach aristocracy again, because no matter how she critiques people like the Malfoys, deep inside she hates being poor too and wish to be like them. To the point she secretly can be also a biggot towards muggles, feeling superior for being a pureblood, and only letting Hermione close to Ron, because she knows the girl is brillaint and Ron is an idiot who would never get a better girlfriend.

** I don't remember the name, but this reminded me of it, and made me want to rant

Harry has like future sight or something and he was thinking about all the people he would seen meet.

He then got to Ron and just bashed him for like a paragraph

Then he got to Molly and basically said she had no redeemable qualities, was overbearing, and was the worst... WTF

*** As most of the time with bashing, they use a "canon" trait, but turn it to 11 (or 100 in some cases). Canon Ron is a messy eater, as it's pretty common for an adolescent boy, and can, sometimes, speak with his mouth full. Fanon Ron eating habit are so horrible that half of the Great Hall is disgusted, but can't help but stare with a morbid fascination as he push an unholly amount of food in his mouth, half of it falling on the table.

******** What irritates me are the situations that contradict each other

The writer wants Hermione to be the victim so that when she leaves/cheats on Ron there is never any question that is his fault so they turn Ron into an abusive monster who subjects her to monstrous abuse but then have her go out partying so she can meet her real love and sleep with them.

I think it never makes sense because the writer spends so much time building him up as this absolute tyrant who is is psychotically jealous and controls her every move but then lets her go out to a place where she can cheat and be out from under his thumb.

The writer overdoes it to the point where his actions don't match up with how they are writing him.......why dosent he say no or go with her? Well because they need him gone for a few scenes so she can meet harry/Draco/Neville/blasé or whoever

  Nearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his neck.

  “Sick leave and pensions?” he said, pushing his head back onto his shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff. “House-elves don't want sick leave and pensions!”

  Hermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food, then put her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her.

  “Oh c'mon, 'Er-my-knee,” said Ron, accidentally spraying Harry with bits of Yorkshire pudding. “Oops --- sorry, 'Arry ---” He swallowed. “You won't get them sick leave by starving yourself!”

Now Ron having horrible table manners is a comedy joke that happens in just a few books but not often really and it doesn't had anything besides Hermione saying “swallow before you speak!” While Harry and Ron roll their eyes at her when she stops looking. The “Ron blames Harry for everything” only happened in a few too, it's not usually everything but something big they splits their friendship (should the book go that way). Dumbledore paid Ron to friend Harry once or twice; so barely at all. And finally, bff Draco replacing Ron happened like /once/ because instead of replacing Ron as Harry's bff they're usually lovers and Ron is with Hermione usually or another girl, so they're still bffs. I guess slash has less Ron tropes or I haven't found them. Probably the second honestly, lmao.
