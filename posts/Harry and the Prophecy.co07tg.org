Are there any stories where Harry has a more...well normal reaction to learning that Severus Snape gave the prophecy to Voldemort? I feel like JK and half the fandom always say well, he didn't know it would be Lily but...at the end of the day he told a notorious, mass murdering psychopath who had entire families killed off that a baby could beat him. Snape's basically an accessory to murder---someone once compared him to the getaway driver of a bank robbery where the bank robbers end up unexpectedly killing someone. Did the getaway driver set out for that to happen? Nope, but they were still committing a crime. Should they have realized something horrible beyond a robbery could happen? Yes. And I've always thought Harry's reaction was abnormal compared to his other reactions in the series...sure, he was angry at first but he basically let it go and then ended up naming one of his kids after Snape. There's forgiveness, and even appreciation for Snape's role as a spy, and then there's naming your kid which is on another...level of abnormal behavior.

*Are there are any fics where Harry just drags the shit out of Dumbledore and goes "hey, I don't care if he's a spy or if he feels "sorry", you literally let a man who played a major role in the death of my parents verbally abuse me for years and now you're encouraging me to forgive him? WTF?" Or any fics where he basically reams out Snape and goes "sure, my Dad was a bully to you when you were kids but you played a role in his death...how the hell can you still view yourself as his victim and think it was okay to trash him to my face when I was a kid?"*

Actually, it is worse. The getaway driver didn't expect killing of somebody during the bank robbery to happen. Snape did know (or at least a reasonable person in his place would know) that the murder most likely will happen. And yes, the fandom's excuse that he didn't know it was Potters is the lamest excuse possible. If some other family was killed, it would be OK? So, yes, whitewashing of his crime(s) (you are not a Death Eater by being a law abiding citizen) is something which started with JKR herself somewhere in the middle of the books (Snape started as completely disgusting person, who was Neville's boggart, and only in later books he turned into that sophisticated sarcastic dark intellectual most fanfic authors writing about him prefer). Putting such person into a position where he could affect eleven-year old kids is truly questionable.

On the other hand, Snape being a horrible person, potentially a criminal guilty of many crimes, corresponds pretty much with the real life. Most double agents are quite suspicious persons, they wouldn't do it otherwise. Actually, most people dealing with spies are not very nice people, that goes with the profession. And yet, such horrible persons, are sometime extremely valuable for the war effort. Life is sometimes not nice.

Which doesn't change anything, that it is not correct to whitewash his crimes, or that Dumbledore must be bashed for employing him under blackmail (most spies are to some extent blackmailed into their effort). It of course also doesn't mean anything that having him unsupervised as a teacher is highly questionable (there are many ways how he can be persuasive teacher and even show his partiality for the Slytherin house, and not being so nasty to Neville and Hermione, he would be boggart for the former). Life is sometimes very complicated.

#+end_quote

There's basically no possibility that he was a part of the Death Eaters for any length of time without torturing a few Muggleborns to death, so accessory is basically small potatoes in the grand scheme.

James: My friends are going to get you possibly attacked by a werewolf? I'll rescue you at great personal risk to myself. I hate you, but I couldn't possibly stand by and see you hurt or killed.

Snape: I accidentally sicced the Dark Lord Voldemort, the most powerful and most sadistic Dark wizard in history on you, your wife, and your year-old child? Uh... don't kill his wife, if possible, my master. I'd really like to bang her after he's dead.

*** Snape suspected Lupin was a werewolf, and while Sirius was irresponsible to tell him how to unlock the knot, Snape was also trying to get him exposed.

Snape was never innocent in that situation. In fact he might be more culpable than anyone.

I'd argue with the whole locked in the shrieking shack on the full moon was actually a pretty good security measure, well at least by Hogwarts standard.

******* Again, not the point. Definitely irresponsible of them to roam the grounds at night, although note the changed behavior with animals as opposed to humans.

Snape went in looking to aggravate a very possible werewolf as a human.

********* The one situation involving Snape was the topic. Sirius didn't send him to Lupin. He just taunted him and told him about how to get past the whomping Willow. Snape who suspected Lupin was a werewolf, went after him on his own accord.

** I think Harry's relationship to Snape's crimes is just a symptom of a larger problem with Rowling's writing: she gets an idea of how things are/should in her head, can't move past it, and doesn't really think it through.

Voldemort was an insanely magically powerful mass murderer, and Snape knowingly and intentionally told him how to find the one person (a baby, at the time) who could stop his rise to power. Even if you ignore the wider impact of that, he's still condemning a random, innocent family to death. Dumbledore says that he "made a mistake," but that simply /is not true./ What he /actually/ did was make a conscious choice that didn't pan out how he wanted (and we see in Deathly Hallows how things would have gone if it had). But, despite all of that, Rowling had decided that Snape was redeemable, so she had Harry forgive the man who indirectly orphaned him and spent six years disparaging the memory of a man he got killed /after James saved his life./

I mean think about that. James saved Snape's life, Snape got James and his wife killed, leaving their son orphaned and condemning him to ten years of abuse and neglect, then met that son ten years later in a situation where Snape was in an explicit position of authority over him. He then spent the next six years abusing that authority to insult James (who, and I know I keep saying this, but it's impossible to overstate, /is only dead because of him/) to Harry (who has suffered his entire life because Snape got his parents killed and put him in Voldemort's crosshairs) and bully Harry with impunity.

Harry choosing to forgive this isn't indicative of his character so much as of Rowling having decided that Snape was "morally complex" and either failing to notice or refusing to accept that the character she'd written was actually a villain who happened to be on the heroes' side by coincidence.

Edit: aaaand I just realised that this was a recommendation post, not a discussion, so my whole comment is kinda completely irrelevant. Oops.

** Yes, Snape was a spy that was feeding information to both sides. I cannot help but think what kind of information about the light side or the order, Snape used to give to Voldemort to stay in his good side. I mean Snape had to feed good and correct information to Voldemort right??? Did Snape knew about the plan on Amelia Bones's assassination plan and did nothing or withheld information on purpose. Could Snape have saved some lives if he tried???? Could Snape have forgotten his childhood rivalries and saw Harry for who he truly was????.

*** About the Amelia Bones thing. I think one of the reasons why Dumbledore concocted the convoluted assisted suicide plot at the end of HBP with Snape was because Snape was losing Voldemort's trust and simply wasn't getting information.
