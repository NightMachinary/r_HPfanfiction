I am looking for completed fics that are similar to "Throwing out the Script" by Formulaic. Basically, time travel with Harry going back into the Maurader era unintentionally (or intentionally). Ones where Harry is powerful and preferably grey or darker (not light), and where he to some degree tries to keep to the shadows (either hiding who he is, his powers, his goals, whatever).

I really enjoyed the start of Throwing out the Script, and it's surprising depth, plus I LOVE time travel fics. If you have not read its start its worth a read. It may turn people off as its a multi but its start does not even reach a pairing. It's too bad it seems abandoned.

Back to my request.... I would prefer a pairing but it does not have to be a multi like in Throwing out the Script. No slash please. Mature+ rated preferred.


** Not completed nor has it been updated in some time, but you might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11233445/1/Whiskey-Time-Travel][Whiskey Time Travel]]. It has a powerful Unspeakable Harry thrown back in time and he does try to keep to the shadows a bit, but it's mostly trying to avoid the Potters of the current time if I remember correctly.\\

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

*** Funny you should mention that one. It's literally the next one I am reading after just finishing Throwing out the Script. They had been recommended by someone to me together so I figured they may have similarities. I am hoping for more suggested here though. It feels like it would be a genre of time travel that would be well explored but I have mostly seen trio era time travel, not marauder in terms of Harry being the lead (I know there are quite a few Hermione ones).

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.
