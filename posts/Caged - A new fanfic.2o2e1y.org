Hello HPfanfiction,

I'm a newer author and a first time poster to this sub. I am starting a new story and I was hoping that you guys could help me out. I'm looking for a person or multiple people who could on a regular basis review chapters and give me feedback.

The story plot is based around a female Harry that is given up by the Dursleys and raised to be a lady by a pureblood witch.

Here is a snippet of the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  *Caged, like an animal ought to be.*

  Her thoughts rang clearly as she sneered at the small blabbering infant in disdain. What was she supposed to do with it? It wasn't hers - why should it be her responsibility to raise their mess? Her fingers slid over the roughened parchment as she smoothed the letter back into its compact form. She had read the words a thousand times over.

  /Her sister. Dead./

  /Her brother-in-law. Dead./

  /The creature they created, by some act of God, alive but in grave danger./

  Brilliant green eyes blinked back at her from behind the holes of the worn plastic laundry basket she had placed upon the kitchen table. There was nobody else to take it from her, the letter stated clearly; however, she couldn't allow it to live in her home with her son and her husband. They were good, normal people and had taken great pride in being so. They couldn't even foist the baby off on an orphanage. If strange things started happening it would most certainly lead back to them. No, that wouldn't do at all.

** edited* I would be happy to help but I wouldn't feel comfortable being on in any 'official' capacity or signing the dotted line so to speak. So if you post them to me or online let me know and I will review and give feedback (and if I can't or don't wish to continue then I will try to give a heads up).

**** Sounds good. I saw you other comment about wanting feedback before making it public- I don't know how that is typically handled but I am open to that if you wish as well.
