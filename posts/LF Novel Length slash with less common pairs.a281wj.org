  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Eventual Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. Tags will be updated when it becomes relevant. Updated every Saturday.

  HPTN slash. AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically. Amoral Harry, seven parts. COMPLETE.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7748339/1/The-Boy-Next-Door][The Boy Next Door]] is a crossover with X-Men. It's Harry/Pyro and set after HBP and X-Men: the Last Stand. Magneto, Mystique, and Pyro pose as a family during Harry's summer at the Dursleys and think that Harry is a powerful mutant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/205899/chapters/305999][Two Households, Both Alike in Dignity]] is a Harry/Ron AU where Harry shook hands with Draco and became a Slytherin. It's part of a series, but I started at part 5 (where H/R starts) and followed along fine. There's background Sirius/Remus in some parts.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.
