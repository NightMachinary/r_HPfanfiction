Hermione time travels back or is reborn in marauder's era. She kept her memories. The doctor that checks up on her believes she is a seer. At some point, he says he needs to keep her for observation.

edit: found what I was looking for, fair fortune

*** No, the part where the person thinks she's a seer happens really early, before hogwarts even starts. I think the doctor was part of the Black family. It's unfinished the last time I saw it.
