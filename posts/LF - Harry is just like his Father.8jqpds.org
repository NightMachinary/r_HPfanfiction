Sick of Snape calling him out on something that he isn't, Harry decides to become exactly like James, down to pranking "Snivellus" and Malfoy. Actually becoming competent in school, becoming an Animagus early. Deciding to be the Mini James that everyone always insists he is.

Not the Live i Lived. That IS a good fic, but that's Harry having James' memories, rather than just Harry acting like James.


** There's a fic called Unexpected or Expectations - I can't remember. It had a Harry that felt like what we imagine James to be like.

I also like the Harry from linkffn(Anti-Hyphen)

  Expectations are funny things as the Wizarding world learns when introduced to a Harry that has inherited James' confidence and Lily's charm and a complete disregard to anything that doesn't affect him. Who cares about rocks and stuttering professors when they've got dragons and godfathers who didn't wait thirteen years to break out of prison to play with?

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16

  Spinoff to 'HP: The Lone Traveller'. The story of Harry James Potter, the brother of the supposed BoyWhoLived, and his friends... My take on the old 'Harry the brother of the BWL' & 'Harry the Slytherin' plotline.
