*** Not particularly, and I've read pretty much all of them. I meant more like either Harry summoning, either by accident or on purpose, a demon or a hero or something from another world, or like in Potter Paradox, where a femHarry in her 40s travels to another universe and removes Harry from the Dursleys. Or like in that Intersecting Realities, with an older Slytherin Harry being summoned and ending up helping a young femHarry.

**** Well in Echoes in the Fog, Grey!Harry and Canon!Harry (plus friends) get inadvertently summoned into a universe where Evil!Harry serves as the second in command to Voldemort, who rules most of the world.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13165325/1/Echoes-in-the-Fog]])

Only catch is that Grey!Harry is from the author's short fic For Lack of a Bezoar, which essentially details what happens if Ron dies on his birthday after drinking the stuff Malfoy poisoned. It's a good, quick read (35k words) which helps with the background of the Grey!Harry.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar]])

As it happens, Evil!Harry is from the author's Downard Spiral Saga which was really long and I never read, but I felt it wasn't necessary for enjoyment of Echoes in the Fog.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is.

** If we are talking about summoning, I think Fate's Gamble is a good fic... It's a crossover between fate/stay night and hp. It's a good fic with a powerful harry who ends up summoning multiple servants quite a few of whom like him either romantically(Elizabeth, Frankenstein) or in a family like way(Medusa, Jack). It also has a sequel and a spinoff/omake by a different author.

Original Fic : linkffn(Fate's Gamble by Lupine Horror)

Sequel Fic : linkffn(Fate's Gamble : Round Two by Lupine Horror)

​

Omakes : linkffn(Fate's Gamble Omake edition by roughstar333; Fate's Gamble Omake : Second Edition by roughstar333)

Also harry ends up becoming very powerful towards the end and I haven't read the omakes myself.

  Sequel to Fate's Gamble. Harry has finished with his original world (aside from a few visits) and now it's time to follow through on his promise to Fate to set right another world that her meddling didn't have quite the same effect as in his own. Summoned to fight Voldemort once more, Harry decides to have some fun while he's there. This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
