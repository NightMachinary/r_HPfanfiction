What if Harry met some Death Eaters in King's Cross instead of Dumbledore? (Gen fic)

I'm also thinking about turning this into a series of one shots. Hope the premise is interesting!

** It was really good!

I'd like to see more slice of life for the crew!

Also try ffn, more people use it and it's easier to read on.

Anyway it was a great read!

*** Thank you!! I'm thinking about writing the scene just after Harry's departure first to keep it linear.

I posted it on ffn too but I always get more views/interaction on ao3.

I'm glad you liked it!

*** Thank you!! I'm so glad to hear this. I really enjoyed it myself when they turned out to be tragicomic. I'll write the scene after Harry's departure as the next chapter I think.

** This is hilarious! I've always found that one of the unexplored areas of the prophecy is that 'neither can live while the other survives' which can be interpreted as because Harry killed voldemort, he's now immortal, which was why voldemort wanted to kill Harry in the first place because he knew horcruxes could be destroyed and/or they weren't good for being sane.

So basically Harry visits the afterlife frequently after he joins the Aurors because people seem to be AK-ing him. And DEs get super attached to him that they hatch a plan to make Harry mortal so they can become his followers instead because clearly, they've chosen the wrong side and they're promised that if they keep making right choices they'll be redeemed.

*** Thank you! I'm glad you liked it! Your idea seems pretty fleshed out. I've never thought about it like that actually. I assumed the only reason Harry could come back in DH was that Voldemort killed his own soul not Harry and Harry's soul was merely accompanying Voldemort's soul to the afterlife.
