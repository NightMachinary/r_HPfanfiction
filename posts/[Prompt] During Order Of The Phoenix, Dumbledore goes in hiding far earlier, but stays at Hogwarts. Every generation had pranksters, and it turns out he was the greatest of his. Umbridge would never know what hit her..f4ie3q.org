Above prompt. Extra points for outpranking the Weasley twins and somehow the remaining Marauders. If going for early horcrux hunt, then possibility of pranking the dead marauders is open too thanks to the stone.


** "What did Umbridge do /this time/, Minerva?"

Albus sighed/moaned in his throat. The school year hadn't even started yet and he was loaded with paperwork.

"She had the gall, the /gall/, I tell you, to say that she was afraid of the dropping quality of education in Hogwarts, and that too to a bunch of first years. If you don't do something, Albus, you may just find that one of her paintings managed to scratch her to death."

"Now now Minerva, calm down. We both know that her position in this school is beyond my control at the moment. We must try our best to give the young students our knowledge and teachings, and to follow the ministry guidelines precisely, or they may have enough reason to get rid of us."

Even as he said this, his mind raced through the proper charms and transfigurations required to achieve Minerva's idea. He shook his head. It was time to focus. If he showed any disinterest, he may find his own face with the scratch marks of an angry cat.

Minerva sighed, blissfully unaware of the inner turmoil inside his head. "Yes, I know that. Can't you do /anything/ Albus? Must such a foul woman be allowed to roam the hallways of Hogwarts?"

But Albus heard 'fowl woman,' and his mind produced a series of images with Umbridge as a fowl, each funnier than the last one. He had to use all his Occlumancy to stop himself from laughing out loud.

"Yes, it is regrettable, but the Minister has simply refused any meetings to discuss her," Dumbledore said in a grave voice. "We must bear her burden for now."

With that, and a heavy sigh from Minerva, the meeting was adjourned and she left via the rotating staircases.

Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts, turned his mind to the stacks of paperwork conveniently disillusioned and kept under his desk. His hand got to work, signing and initializing with the efficiency that only comes with experience.

His mind was free to wander, however, and so it did. He constructed step by step procedures to make her look like a chicken to everyone else, complete with squawking noises and weird movements. Soon he reached the end of the stack, popped his knuckles, and stretched.

Long ago, there had been a time when he was the biggest prankster in Hogwarts. But age and experience had deprived him of his pranks. After all, you couldn't be a Chief Warlock, /and/ a prankster. What mischief he had managed to cause, stopped because of Grindlewald, and ultimately, Tom Riddle. He couldn't, in any good faith, be seen doing pranks when the outside world was terrorised and scared. No, he had to be the unflappable Greatest Wizard of the Century, to calm them down and help with the war.

But that was a decade ago.

He used the wand to change his robes to bright, colourful and moving patterns, and strolled through the evening lights to the kitchen. He could have ordered the elves to his office, but this gave him some exercise in his old body, and he got to enjoy walking in his home. The pear turned to a doorknob, and he entered inside a room of barely contained chaos. Perfect.

He ducked his head and strolled inside, conjured a small table and chair, and sat down. One of the elves saw him and quickly made its way to his table.

"What may Professy be wanting today?" it asked quickly.

"A cup of hot chocolate and some biscuits would do, Telly."

"Right away!"

Within minutes, a steaming cup of hot chocolate and delicious biscuits were kept at his table, and he started enjoying his light evening supper.

Until he felt a timid tug on his hat from his back. He turned to find a tiny elf staring at him jumping from toe to toe. He turned his chair fully, now facing the elf.

"What can I do for you?" he asked kindly.

"Uhhh. Tinkly can't say..."

He nodded. "As the Headmaster of Hogwarts, I give permission to you to speak whatever you want."

The elf sighed visibly, but quickly straightened up. "Professy pinky be using bad quill on students."

'Bad quill?'

"What is a bad quill?"

"It be using blood from their hand to write."

His temper flared.

A few utensils dropped from their shelves.

The elf got scared.

He got his magic under control.

But not his temper.

"When did this happen?" he asked rigidly.

"Today."

"And who was the student?"

He knew not to have a preference for his students, but his mind was saying 'Please let it not be--'

"Harry Potter."

The cup on his table vanished and the chocolate spilled all over. A wave of his hand vanished the mess, but his mind was plotting bloody murder.

The next morning, the Daily Prophet had a polarising headline that would change the Wizarding World for years to come.

The newspaper read "Albus Dumbledore has resigned from his positions, all of them! Umbridge to be the new Headmistress!"

****** It's kinda clear. He resigned so he can hide and prank her out of Hogwarts and possibly into the mental ward in St:Mungos. Can't do mischief when you're in a position of responsibility after all.

It removes all suspicions from him, and any shit that goes down in Hogwarts during that time period reflects badly on Umbridge and the Ministry.

** Dumbledore sat quietly in his seat with a grin as he watched the events unfold. It was perfect. Marvelous. Everything was set. She would never expect such an event.

"Hem, hem."

A collective groan was heard around the class as the students ended their conversations and turned to the horrid woman.

"Now class, you are well aware we do not use wands in this classroom."

Many students rolled their eyes and shoved their wands into their robes or bags. Dumbledore made no such movements though. His wand was already tucked snuggly in his robes, his copy of Defensive Magical Theory laid on his desk.

Professor Umbridge scanned the room with displeasure until her eyes landed upon her new student Brian. He was a model student.

"Today we'll be studying chapter five. Can anyone tell me what we should do if someone is pressuring you to do dark magic," her overly sweet voice questioned.

A few students mumbled, "Just say no."

Professor Umbridge beamed at those few teachable children. Her new teaching program would be a success. The woman walked behind her desk to sit down.

"FFFFFFFFGGSSSSSSSSSPPPPpppppptttttt..."

Laughter broke out across the room.

"WHAT," the road woman exclaimed, jumping up, "What is this?!"

Held between her thumb and her index finger, Professor Umbridge held up a deflated pink bag.

Her scrunched nose snear turned onto the giggle teens.

"What is the meaning of this! What is this scandalous item?"

No one replied to her inquiries.

Dumbledore sat without a smirk on his face. Instead, his nose was hurried in the paragraphs about how effective saying "no" was someone who is threatening you with dark magic.

.0.0.0.

Shadows stretched across the stone walls as a chill haunted the air. It was mid December and the snow could be felt through many tower bridges. A modestly handsome brunette leaned against a pillor and looked over the white landscape.

"You sent for me your royalness," a translucent figure mock bowed.

"Yes," the boy began without turning, "I require your assistance Peeves."

The ghost grinned and turned his mischievous eyes up with a squint. "And how'll it benefit meee?"

Dumbledore turned to the apparition, "I have never once banished you. I could easily have you exercised if I changed my opinions of your company."

The grey figure seemed to pale and dramatically gulped, "what do you want?"

Dumbledore gave a wicked grin, "I need your help with something Peeves..."

.0.0.0.

Adorable kittens meowed lovingly at their mistress as she stride into the office. It had been an exhausting day and the woman desperately wanted some tea to soothe her wearing mind.

"Clap, clap."

"Crack!"

"Yes Mistress," the kitchen elf bowed.

"My tea."

"Right away Mistress."

The Headmistress walked over to her cabinet and began riffling through papers. Ah yes. The wretched children today were appalling. They're behavior was increasingly insubordinate during her class. The woman pulled out a quill. Yes, this would be useful.

"Crack!"

"Crack!"

Umbridge looked over at her cup of tea lovingly. The only sensible thing right now. She brought her sugar bowl over to the desk and began to scoop large amounts of the white crystals into her tea cups and stirred gently. She would never leave the most delicate part of tea preparation to those animals.

Sighing, the woman returned her sugar bowl and sat in her comfy chair.

"HHHHHHOOOOOOOOOONNNNNKKKKK"

"YYYYAAAAAAHHHH!"

Professor Umbridge jolted out of her seat with a wail before tripping and falling ungracefully on the floor.

The noise had stopped though. She stared at her chair in wonderment before performing a counter-jinx on the offending furniture. Cautiously, she stood up and attempted to sit down once more.

"HHHOONKKK!"

"What?"

The Headmistress stared at the chair in astonishment. What on Earth could be causing that. She had performed the proper spell. Whatever had been placed on the item should have been resolved.

The woman bent forwards and turned her head to see the underside of her chair. A while cylinder with a red horn was held up against the cushion of her seat with a shiney grey strip.

The professor grabbed the white can and tore the item from the chair, successfully ripping away the elegant fabric with it.

"Aaarrrgggg!"

Forcing herself to close her eyes, Professor Umbridge took a deep breath and reached for her tea. She needed to calm herself. Too much stress was not healthy.

Delicate fingers held the teacup and brought the liquid to her lips.

"SSSSSSPPPPPPTTTTTTTT."

Brown liquid sprayed across the desk and the fragile cup shattered on the floor.

She had been poisoned! By....

Salt?

.0.0.0.

It was the Christmas feast. All among the Great Hall students laughed and conversed. Despite the recent laws implemented by their Headmistress, the teens still felt the Merry cheer of the holiday. There was much to be excited for also. Presents under the tree. Time with families. Pranks on Umbridge.

Oh yes. There was much gossip regarding the recent pranks on the hellish woman. But nothing was for certain. No one seemed to know who was causing the mischief or when it would happen again.

Of course, many assumed it was Fred and George Weasley. Who else could cause such chaos to the woman. Unfortunately, the twins were venoment in stating it was not them. Although the pranks were admirable, the twins were too moral to claim responsibility for such trickery. They did commit pranks of their own though.

"I heard that ants appeared in her food," one Hufflepuff giggled to their neighbor.

A Slytherin grinned across the table, "I was told that any time she says the word 'dark' her clothes flash black,"

"Nah. I heard it myself," a teen began, "she farted right in the beginning of class."

"Every time a new law is hammered into the wall, her nose grows 2 inches. That's why she keeps looking at her reflection, she wants to make sure her disillusionment charm is working," a Ravenclaw said confidently.

"Have you noticed she stopped drinking tea? I wonder why."

"The classroom was covered in cat poop one day. I swear it looked real and smelled bad to. But it was just hard and fake. She freaked out real good though."

Dumbledore sat at the Gryffindor stable eating his dinner. As Brian, he mostly kept to himself, despite wanting to interact with his fellow classmates. Tonight was special though. Far more special than being the Christmas feast. Tonight, Peeves and his plan was to unfold.

The Professors all sat at the long table reserved for them, happily conversing except for those who sat on either side of Umbridge. That was perfect though. It only helped Dumbledore's plan.

Craftily pulling his wand from his trouser pocket, he pointed it under the table and at the most important chair in the room.

"Proluo sedes."

With a great surge of energy, the toad woman was forced up from her seat and landed on the floor in front of the table, smothering herself with food that caught on her body. Her cries drowned out all conversation. Demanding to know who the culprit was and threatening to expell them, Headmistress Umbridge rose to her feet.

No one dared say a word. But the show was not over.

"Time for the icky, picky, twitchy to get all sticky!!!"

At that moment, Peeves seemed to grab a bucket right from the night sky and dump the contents on the disoriented woman. Little did the student know, a shelf carved into the stone outlined the ceiling of the Great Hall, covered by the sky enchantment.

Black sludge fells like a waterfall down onto the woman. Her hair was dislodged and knotted with the goop. It pooled around her feet. Not a single speck of the woman's pink clothing could be seen.

Whether the Professors were too stunned or too amused to assist their boss was never disclosed.

Muffled chuckles joined in the woman's screeching.

'But wait,' Dumbledore thought to himself, 'there's more."

"Pluma nubes," the teen mumbled to himself.

"POOF!"

Hundreds of thousands of white feathers appeared into existence surrounding the distraught woman. They floated down, getting stuck in the gooey black substance.

One Professor with a shred of compassion in her heart stood and attempted a spell to clean the Headmistress. But the sludge and the feathers still stuck to Umbridge. She began flailing her arms and screeching threats and demands at the top of her lungs, looking quite like a chicken having a temper tantrum.

However.

Her wails were soon drowning out by the chorus of hands clapping. Dumbledore slipped his hand into his trousers, thoroughly satisfied with the performance.

Among Umbridge's demands to know who the culprit was, two other voices were also shouting over the clapping, demanding to know how the culprit was and begging to join forces...
