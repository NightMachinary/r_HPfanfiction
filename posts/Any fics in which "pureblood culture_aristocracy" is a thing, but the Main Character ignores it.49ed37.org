** That would be really cool to see actually. Usually when "pureblood culture" features very prominently in a fic it's a slytherin!Harry where he becomes some sort of grey!independent! rascist douchebag.

Having asshole wizards justifying there blood purism with "muh culture" does get pretty annoying.

**** Yes! This is one thing that makes me abandon fics immediately, and more vengefully than any other trope. If anything, it would just turn HP into the next Voldemort, fighting and hating against /everything and everyone,/ for it was the Wizarding culture that threw him away, and left him on a doorstep like rubbish. Sure, the Dursleys were abusive, but they had nothing to do with Harry suddenly appearing at their house and ruining their lives.

**** Well, abused children could have well turned out to be criminals or psychopaths.

It would not make a nice story, but it could be a very likely scenario.

Canon Dumbledore, imho, was an incompetent fool. Dumping Harry to the "worst sort of muggle" (according to his deputy) and not checking up on him was completely and utterly brain dead. The odds of an abused Harry Potter becoming the next Tom Riddle or joining Lord Voldemort were SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER than the selfless and all-loving Harry Potter in the books.

****** 1st book we find out HP lives in a cupboard.

2nd book Petunia tries to hit him on the head with a frying pan and they lock him in a room on starvation rations.

3rd book they invite round a relative that's been known to hit him and who sets her dog on him. They then let this relative insult his dead parents to his face.

5th book Vernon grabs him round the throat with both hands and tries to strangle him for listening to the news. And after the Patronus warning Vernon says that he hopes Harry gets the death penalty.

I think people either remember the Dursleys right or are sometimes even too kind. Short of beating and raping Harry they couldn't be much worse.

In books 1-3 the Dursley's are like something out of a Roald Dahl novel and the tone of the books overall is much less psychologically realistic.

*** I'm trying to plot out a Harry who doesn't think much of Dumbledore (left on doorstep? would you trust the guy who did that?), Hagrid (the dude kidnaps Harry, Hagrid's a nice guy but wth?), Fudge (no trials, summary executions?). A Harry who loves magic but not most magicals and for sure not their culture. Not bashing but a reasonable response to canon events.

I think it ends with a fuel/air bomb detonating over a small graveyard in Little Hangleton.

** "Mr Potter. By our Queen's Edict, I hereby and henceforth introduce you to Lord Balaias, Baron of the Stonehenge area, heir apparent to the illustrious House of the Balaiases, and right hand of both her Majesty and the Minister of Magic himself."

Harry, being who he was, responded in the only manner he found appropriate to combat such a stuffy situation. He eyed up and down the ostentatiously dressed nobleman and his servant before uttering the words that would definitely get him kicked out of the reception.

"Sup, dawg?"

*** Kinda this in combination with Starfox5's reply below. Harry never struck me as a formal kinda guy. I'm somewhat vague in what I'd like to read. But I feel that the whole "Harry finds out he's a Lord of an Ancient and most noble bla bla and heir to supposedly extinct houses blabla" scenario has been done a massive amount of times. Yet in all those I've read, Harry responds by getting with the programme and entrenching himself in the accepted patterns of behaviour and speech. I would find the converse almost definitely more entertaining to read.

There's room for a lot of alternative routes those scanarios could go down, and I'd love to see a story with attention to an underdeveloped route.

Part of that could be an utter rejection of his position. An alternative would be to act somewhat similarly to your comment. Go for a cheeky Nandos with the lords.

*** As I understood it, he's more looking for a story where Harry doesn't decide that purebloods are the best thing since sliced bread, and sticks with muggle values. That doesn't mean he'd have to be rude, simply that he'd not support an undemocratic system where birth and blood decides a wizard's worth.

**** Considering that the "Marriage Law" trope was one started by Snape/Hermione 'shippers as a writing prompt for their own [and also as a method to shoehorn Snape and Hermione into a relationship], that someone took the idea and wrote a work of Hermione starting a revolution /against/ it is hilarious to me. Usually in these works of fanfiction, Hermione completely resigns herself to her fate, or even decides to /support/ a Law that, honestly, she would consider "barbaric" in the books. It's a breath of fresh air to see Hermione actually in-character in a work like "Revolution".

***** The number of stories where Hermione of all people rolls over and accepts letting others tell her who to sleep with was what prompted me to write the story (and my first fanfiction story). To think that the same people who had to save the Ministry from Voldemort would let those cretins order them around is simply stupid - they have beaten one regime, they can beat a weaker one more easily.

** Well, in "Spellcaster" Hermione decides to master pureblood ettiquette and learns a bit more about their culture. She ends up creating and spreading a hybridized form of manners that is unifying to purebloods and muggleborns alike all while fighting Voldemort and trying to overthrow a marriage law.
