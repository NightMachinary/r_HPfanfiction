Hey all! I'm looking for drarry fics where one of them thinks they are dreaming and tries to get with the other one because they think its a dream. One example of this is in the fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/359705][Draco Malfoy, It's Your Lucky Day]] on ao3, starting from the text string "A line appeared between Potter's eyes"... I really think these fics bc they usually involve a lot of mutual pining and an unwillingness to believe that the other would ever like them, which I am all about. So if anyone has any fic recs with a similar concept I would love to read them.


** No offence but I think you are better off in [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]

There are many who read Drarry.
