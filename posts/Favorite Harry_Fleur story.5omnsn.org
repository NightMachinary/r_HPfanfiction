** Linkffn(What you leave behind) is probably my favorite one and it doesn't even pair them before the writer went on hiatus.

I like it because they orbit each other, but Harry is too young to understand his interest. Fleur also has proper characterization. Her snobbery is played off Harry's snark/sarcasm to great effect.

Linkffn(I'm Still Here) also seems to be heading in a H/F or H/multi and is /also/ on hiatus. Fleur's interest in Harry is justified in the narrative, rather than your typical soulbond nonsense.

Linkffn(Letters) takes time to develop a connection between Harry and Fleur before any romance occurs. I didn't finish it however. Still it avoids the soulbond that pollutes the pairing.

Linkffn(For Love Of Magic) has a Harry/multi thing going on but Fleur is a large part of it. Here she takes a turn at the 'Succubus' trope but the story holds itself together well enough.

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10191925/1][(How Fleur Delacour Seduced me]] is one of the better, smuttier ones, with good, if slightly OOC characterization.

Apart from that it's basically riddled with Greater Good Dumbledore, Harems, Soulbonds and Dark!Harry (read: Asshole!Harry).

*** You keep mentioning soul bonds as a negative thing, but it doesn't have to be. The idea of Veela latching on/bonding to someone /could/ be written very well and lead to some very tense and interesting relationships and plotlines.

It's just that no one has ever fucking gotten it right yet. I don't know how it's so hard to get that if you make a soul bond relationship perfect from the start, it takes all romantic tension out of the story.

Making the "soul bond" an involuntary one (or at least a situation forced by circumstance) is such a better idea. There's so much fucking potential.

If I wasn't an awful writer, I'd take a crack at it myself.

This is a time travel story of Harry finding himself in the past after passing away in his sleep. What I love about this is that Harry actually ended up marrying Fleur prior to him being transported in the past. And now Harry is conflicted if he should go after Fleur or not because of complications. One is that Bill is still alive in this timeline (Fleur married Bill first but he died in the war) Two is he's conflicted if it's fair for him to after the younger version of Fleur when he's in love with her older version. And three is that the method of his time travel might cut his time short once he completed a certain mission. The Flashbacks is really the Gold in the story as we get glimpse of their time together.

**** The Weasley Twins situation was written as a throwback to James' own school time and how a harmless bit of fun can quickly escalate into something worse. The twins look up to the Marauders so it isn't that farfetched that they fall into the same issues.. But yes, it was the weakest point of the story.

I actually liked the Remus/Lilly part. It showed that their relationship wasn't perfect after they got together, canon and a lot of fics act as if they never had any issues after James grew up and they got together. But they were in a war, they were young and their entire lives were thrown off the rails because they had to go into hiding.

Their dreams were suddenly out of reach, their son was seemingly destined to fight against the Dark Lord and their friends were dieing around them.

Really, it's surprising something like this didn't happen. I at least suspect there were some major fights while they were hiding.

***** So rather than depend on James and gain strength from him she goes off and found comfort with Remus instead. Highly unlikely when Remus isn't always present when he has to go and cozy up and spy on the other werewolves. I think it was poor writing on jbern's part as an attempt to have drama on the story. Plus what son wants to know, and in Harry's case, see and remember his mother cheating on his dad. That is really fucked up.
