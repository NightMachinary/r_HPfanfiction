** This is great and all, but I can't help but wonder what the point is. I mean, you can get the same list by going on the site and setting the filters properly (that is, change the ratings to allow everything, set it to only show completed stories, and have if sort by favorites).

*** On fanfiction.net you cannot see more than 25 fics at the same time, add fics to list of ignored, you are unable to search "all characters except" (for example I removed all Hermione/Draco, Harry/Draco), filter based on description (my filters reduced list to 1400 positions) etc

You may do all this with this list and higher than typical ability to use Excel/Calc (in Calc you may use SEARCH function to check whatever text contains certain words, that is how you may do description based filtering etc)

**** Ah, that makes sense. I don't know much about using Calc, so that didn't really occur to me. Cool!

******* That's a temporay bug with Google Chrome, although I'm sure you've got it figured out by now, use Firefox to download/use Google Docs until the bug is fixed.
