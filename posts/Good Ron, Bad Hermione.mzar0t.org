I want any fics where Ron is a good friend and Hermione gets bashed, but I would particularly like fics where Hermione abandons Harry during GoF and Ron stays and helps him.


** She was basically this, or at least well on her way to this, before the troll incident.

Then there was the thing with the broom Sirius sent Harry...

*** Before the troll incident? You mean when they weren't even friends in the first place? And the broom incident? Hermione was in the right. A serial murderer who(to her knowledge)was SPECIFICALLY out to kill Harry is on the loose and Harry randomly receives an unmarked present and it just so happens to be something he really wants. She was right to snitch and the kind of person who disagrees has a literal childs mentality.

**** Whoa!

Not wanting an argument here.

I was just saying that if you look at her interactions with them and project forward without adding in friendship, it would be easy to see how they might develop into antagonists.

As to triggering you, I thought it was understood that they are children and haven't fully sorted out their personalities or how to get along perfectly with others - there is no intended implication that she is inherently horrible.

*** Not at all im guessing you don't like hermione(honestly neither do I)but let's be real here Hermione has 2 friends ron and harry she's socially awkward and scorned by most of the school as a know it all book worm mudblood etc the broom incident while yes is Hermione fault was in no possible way an indication she would straight up ditch harry. However im not the person who excuses characters faults and actions because so and so did so and so ill acknowledge the fact that the was in the wrong again but could you and me have a discussion about this id like to hear the thought process behind this type of thinking since imo its illogical and based on opinion but

**** I was mostly playing off the socially awkward stuff.

It is so weird to get downvoted on people's assumptions that I hate her or something.
