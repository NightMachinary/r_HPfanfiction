Self-promotion, but I really can't find any good crack nowadays. Maybe you'll like it...

  "Harry frowned. Here he was, in Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit. Well, that certainly got his plan of to a good start, and earned him twenty galleons from the DA betting pool. Now he just had to escape again, which would earn him another thirty five..."In which Harry utilises that 'oh-so-dreaded' common sense that seems to terrify the majority of the wizarding polupation. Oh, and Hedwig has an owl army. Just because.Complete Crack, not to be taken seriously.. Or siriusly?

  “Scared Potter?” Malfoy sneered, and Harry snapped. He was done, finished, fed up with playing the innocent little Gryffindor with no common sense and a microscopic amount of intelligence. He rolled his eyes.“Why yes Malfoy, I'm terrified, can't you see me quaking in my boots? You, a second year child armed with a stick is the scariest thing I've ever seen. Please, please don't fatally injure me in front of three hundred witnesses and two teachers with your mean words and nasty smiles. Whatever shall I do?” The entire hall fell silent and Malfoy gaped. Harry smirked. Lockhart looked entirely bemused, and he thought Snape might be holding back a laugh.Harry spent his first year hiding his intelligence and playing the role of the Boy Who Lived. However Lockhart and Malfoys' combined presence finally causes him to snap, and chaos ensues from there.
