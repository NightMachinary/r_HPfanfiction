Anybody have a recommendation? Slytherin and Hufflepuff Ron there are several, but for Ravenclaw Ron I've only found /the kids who chose themselves/ on AO3.

I don't think Ravenclaw and Ron are mutually exclusive. It has quirky people (Luna Lovegood), people who gets unnecessarily bothered by other quirky people (Luna's bullies), athletes (Cho Chang, Roger Davies), and who knows what else, so it has got to be pretty diverse i.e. not just bookworms right?

Intelligence-wise, though, we know Ron has the knack to get good grades despite minimal effort (me_irl when I was in middle and high school tbh), learn nonverbal spells in Second Year (his slug spell; too bad his wand backfired), and be very determined (that thing with Buckbeak). So, any good Ravenclaw!Ron?


** I absolutely recommend the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/704082][Switchverse Series]], everyone got displaced from their cannon house in Harry's year including Ron getting into Ravenclaw. It might be slightly cracky in the beginning, but the story gets surprisingly deep and developed into its own plot and story. An excellent fic overall.

** Isn't "eat slugs" the incantation? Or was there some other than second year and I just forgot?
