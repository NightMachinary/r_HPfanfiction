Looking for fics where Harry blind but can still kick ass (but no full on Daredevil). Would especially love it if the fic had students and teachers underestimate him.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

This a super old fic (2002?). In the first quarter of the story, Harry gets rekt by Dursley abuse, which includes blindness (yes it's awful and full of angst). But the story gets pretty interesting after that - Harry begins to develop some seriously sick Divination powers (like looking into the spectrum of every possibility and /seeing/ just what consequences an action will have). And some other interesting stuff happens. The writting is strangely compelling.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** None of these stories seem interested in portraying what it is really like to live a blind life. They all have Harry NOT REALLY blind, there is always some "Oh yes he can see MAGIC" and "OH HE CAN SEE THINGS IN SPECIAL DREAMS AND VISIONS"! If you are not going to commit to telling the story of a blind person then do not even write it! And do not write it and then disrespect real blind people with "Harry is NOT REALLY blind because this and this! Hah GOTCHA!" There are STRUGGLES and DIFFERENCES, but NO ONE wants to really SHOW THOSE AT ALL. It makes me FRUSTRATED and MAD at these authors!

*** I agree- it's a bogus setup when the author already plans to counter the disadvantage with superpowers. Believe it or not, that's what bugs me the most about linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) - Jennifer had her eyes burned away by Uncle Vernon before he kicked her to the street. And her magic works differently because James and Lily didn't know everything about her specialness, which is why they dumped her with the Dursleys to begin with. Angst upon tragedy that, if you really think about it, would invalidate some of the other factors of her uber-tragic life.

[because really, would a kid with acid scarring her face and missing eyes ever be recruited as a child prostitute?]

*** That's because how can Harry ever survive a magical war if he's truly blind. I'm pretty sure spells don't make sounds, and even if they do, the blindness makes it really hard for any character to actually dodge the spell without running into another one. Harry could get killed by anybody in Hogwarts. Heck, just push him off a moving staircase.

** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12631185/1/To-have-Kept-the-Fire]]) is pretty good if your into Dark Souls, and willing to read fem Harry, so far Dorea hasn't been able to see for some bs reason if your worried about that and the story's still in its pre Hogwarts stage but the writing is fairly good imo.
