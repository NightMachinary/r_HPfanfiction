** Are you thinking of Partially Kissed Hero? Sounds like the beginning of that.

*** A chapter and a half into that. So far, I'm loving it, and it sounds EXACTLY like what the OP is thinking of. So thanks to both of you for keeping me occupied for the next couple of days.

**** So did I, until the author defended carpet bombing Muslim countries with nukes... (Read chapter 93 and the author bit at the beginning of chapter 94 to see what I mean...)

The whole fix is well written and interesting, and yet fundamentally unsettling in how it views good and evil, the muggle world, and the nature of people.

***** Yeah I caught up on it a couple of days ago. Without getting into a discussion on "Good, Evil, and the Nature of People" I'll just say that I was sorry to see that it was abandoned after 103 chapters of reading.

****** I had to stop reading after chapter 99, when a formally excellent story started to make me feel almost sick with disgust at the author.

******* I had to stop when instead of ritually enhanced fireproof superhero wizards of their own making, there was an unnecessary side plot about how they were made into fairies.

*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5101357/1/The-Potter-Family-Grimoire][The Potter Family Grimoire]] by DisobedienceWriter is a fic that looks like the one you're looking for. I also recommend the other fics by the same author, as he is high on my list, up there with jbern and Teufel.

**** I ended up reading that one last night. Gotta say that it is probably my favorite one-shot. Possibly second only to [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]]
