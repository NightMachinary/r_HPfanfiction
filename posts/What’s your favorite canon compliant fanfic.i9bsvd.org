** The 'It's Teatime' series by elizablue, with a great story, loved characters and a lot of OC's that I have grown to love (Caden, Nora). And you can never go past Floreatcastellum's stories.

*** That would be [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Teatime series by elizablue]] (and it is Albus/Scorpius slash story, so it is canon only if you consider CC to be the one, which I don't).

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

  Adrien whirled around toward Marinette. She smiled at him. He couldn't smile back. He stared at her like the dumb blond model that he was often accused of being. Something shifted in her expression. And her warm open Marinette smile transformed into Ladybug's grin. He was looking at Ladybug right now. He knew Ladybug's name! Her name was Marinette Dupain-Cheng.And he couldn't say anything! Not to Marinette! Not even to Plagg, who had confided two weeks prior that Master Fu was growing increasingly paranoid since the location of his home and hideout had been compromised. Their master had apparently decided that Chat Noir and Ladybug would have to give up their miraculouses if they ever discovered each other's identities. It wasn't fair! ...A fic where they both know, but can't openly talk about it.

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.
