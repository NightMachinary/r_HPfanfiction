:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay the fic I'm looking for is it's 5th year, and Harry and Co. are fighting Umbridge's ridiculous rules by following them to ridiculous extremes. I remember that at one point all the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws follow a rule saying 'you can only have on your person what you need for class'(That's the jist I think) to the point of walking around naked while carrying book bags.

I think there might have been a side plot revolving around a secret organization in the school working against Dumbledore, I may be thinking of something else.

Please help me find this fic, because I'm not entirely convinced it wasn't a weird ass dream I had.

  Recipe for disaster: Delores Umbridge and her Decrees against a Harry Potter with knowledge of the law and the Muggle Tv. Result: Chaos and hilarity as the DADA Professor shows how stupid can be someone.
