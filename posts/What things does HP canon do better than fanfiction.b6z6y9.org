So, quite recently I've seen a lot of reasons why people think fanfic is better than canon. (And lots of reasons why JKR sucks, but that's a different story.)

It boils down to things like:

- Consistent worldbuilding. New forms of magical transport like Portkeys, Floo connection, Side Along and house elf apparition, thestrals, and Zouwu (from Fantastic Beasts; they can apparently travel 1000 miles a day) aren't pulled out and conveniently forgotten whenever the plot demands it.

- Consistent characterization. Tonks doesn't go from chipper Cockney to crybaby out of nowhere, Voldemort doesn't go from most brilliant Hogwarts student ever to suicide by Harry Hunting for the third time in a row, Ron's chess skillz and alleged street cred intelligence actually do stuff later on.

- Authentic, rather than performative, inclusiveness. LGBTQ+ and non-Anglo/Western characters written by actual members of the community. Ilvermorny and Native American magic explored by authors who have real experience with the culture and know what they're talking about; characters like Anthony Goldstein (confirmed Jewish in JKR twitter post) written with an accurate depiction of Jewish religious practices.

We can jerk ourselves off all day about it, but at the end of the day, we're still here and talking about Harry Potter, over a decade after the series has ended. No matter how much we can pick canon apart, most of us are invested in the story, world, and characters. We're here playing in the sandbox, instead of moving on to other original literature.

So what exactly do you think canon HP has that fanon and fanfiction can't compete with?


** Here are some things I think canon does better:

- Stations of canon. It's actually entertaining in HP canon, while I find myself skimming when fanfic follows the rails to the word.

- It's concise /and/ complete. That's like a unicorn in fanfic terms. Philosopher's Stone is 75k words. How many fics drag out Year 1 to 300k words, then get abandoned by Year 3?

- Characters avoid their fanon characterization. Voldemort isn't torturing his followers for breathing wrong, in between booty-call sessions with Bellatrix. Ron isn't shovelling mashed potatoes like a glutton with every line of dialogue. Remus and Sirius never utter the word "Prongslet".

- Point-of-view consistency. The story is told almost entirely from Harry's POV. Whenever there are other POVs (The Riddle House, Spinner's End) they're brief and important to the plot. Fanfic authors like to cut back and forth between perspectives, sometimes multiple character viewpoints per chapter, and it takes away the mystery and tension when you know what the villain is planning. Or they use multi-POVs to wank off their SuperHarry protagonist, so everyone can marvel at how badass he is. In general, I find it distracting in how it breaks the flow of the narrative, similar to leaving a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter... another thing that appears more in fanfic than canon.

- Harry as a protagonist is written in a way that makes him interesting and likeable. Yes, he's a bit of a generic everyman at first, and his power level depends on the time of day and needs of the plot, but he's sympathetic, relatable, and I /care/ about his ultimate fate more than I do for the average fanfic Hadrian Peverell MC. Hadrian Peverell characters deliver a wish fulfillment experience that isn't nearly as universal as Harry's Coming-of-Age experience.

- Good prose. I never realized how good canon is until I found that I was skimming yet another dry, colourless fight scene in fanfic where it felt like the author was transcribing a videogame playthrough. Good action scenes aren't just about saying who shoots which spell in what direction, but about visceral reactions and imagery.

    Harry's scar burst open and he knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance---

    He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creature's began: they were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape---

    And when the creature spoke, it used Harry's mouth, so that in his agony he felt his jaw move...

*** We can mock JK all we want, but her books are good. There's a reason why she's written one of the most published authors in the world. There's a reason why millions of people love her world and love Harry Potter.

We can find flaws in anything if we want to, JK herself has tons, but the books really are something special. You can moan about plot holes and representation all day long, but a lot of these issues have come up after people have read her books hundreds of times. The way she writes sucks in young readers and leaves adult readers in awe. Her characters have influenced so many young people - there are dozens - heck hundreds - of little girls who looked up to Hermione and made it their mission to be the smartest witches in their class. Her stories teach good lessons on not being a bully, on bravery. Even adults can take away meaningful ideas from her books.

That's because JKR knows how to time skip. Half the fanfics that are super long skip a week at a time, if that. So many of them give a day-by-day play of everything. It's exhausting to read and worse to write.

What's worse that this total act of utter *cowardice* and "lets be happy with what we have instead of taking risks" is touted as heroism!

Before I got to the final scenes, Cursed Child appeared to be just a funny curiosity or a mockery of Harry Potter, which overall just seemed kinda stupid. But these final moments are vile and disgusting. "I wonder what temporal bullshit plot device will prevent them from saving the Potters and capturing Voldemort? ...

This is so true. We have all read stories that start at first year enough that we will skim through anything that is just touching on canon stations with unneeded exposition and POVs. At this point, I just skip those stories now. I do not have as much time as I used to and reading a story that "gets good in third year (400k words in)" is a huge turn off as a reader.

Similarly, huge word counts in the early years usually mean the author is incorporating politics or some other sort of complicated scheming. Those themes are not bad on their own, but when the child characters are the ones being political savants, it becomes completely unbelievable. The best stories are the ones that skip the early years and just get to the meat of what their plot actually is. Even the most AU stories can be executed just as well by summarizing the early years of how Harry became friends with Daphne, what happened with the Chamber, etc through offhand comments and callbacks.

Overall, I feel like people think the earlier books were longer than they actually were. So many stories would benefit so much from liberal amounts of editing. The longest book (OotP) was only 250k and I remember reading like a boring angst-fest for a significant part of the book. Here's the full list:

Sorcerer's Stone: 76,944 words.

Chamber of Secrets: 85,141 words.

Prisoner of Azkaban: 107,253 words.

Goblet of Fire: 190,637 words.

Order of the Phoenix: 257,045 words.

Half-Blood Prince: 168,923 words.

Fanfics following canon plot stations suck. I know what's going to happen and I don't need to see the same thing regurgitated hundreds of times.

It's especially aggravating to see a very different Harry (for example raised by Sirius, his parents, the Blacks, Jedi Master X, or Sith Lord Y) getting stunned by Wormtail in the Graveyard.

**** Is it okay if they're given a passing, background mention, or elided while prose focuses on things the books didn't cover or that didn't happen in canon?

Like, Sirius has escaped so the author mentions events in passing as they go on like before, but the actual plot is centred around something else entirely and Sirius Black is background shenanigans to learning how to use the force/bankrupting Gringotts/creating a whole new branch of magic/using Sirius Black as a scapegoat to murder or whatever.

'And then they spent the night in the Great Hall in purple sleeping bags, and Harry had a chance to sleep a hundred feet away from Ron's snoring, which was nice. The morning was less pleasant - everyone assumed he cared about what Sirius Black was up to, and it was several days before he could get back to his Great Plan. When the fuss died down, Harry could finally get some peace to read the book he'd stolen from the Restricted Section....'

*** Agreed! I hadn't read any fanon writing in several years and I've gotten back into it (graduating college has given me an abundance of free time). It's a very rare story that I can get more than a few paragraphs or even sentences into purely on the above mentioned. I can't help from acknowledging the errors which drags me out of the stories, and nothing is worse than when an entire sentence is nonsense because of poor word order. You can tell when a story wasn't proofed at all.

Also, beyond good editing, good writing! Writing that is over-dramatic, mostly dialogue, inconsistent etc. stops me in my tracks and ruins a story. Flat writing that is just not realistic isn't something I can read through.

Having 13-year old Daphne be the cultured pureblood that Queer Eyes Harry on wizarding culture, while Neville serves Harry as a faithful knight to honor his family's 300-year-old alliance with the Potters, is overdone and unrealistic.

His dialogue is like the rest of the students', the only difference is his tone and delivery being more mean and mocking than everyone else. His word choice is pretty run of the mill, nothing extraordinary or especially refined.

** Oh well, here we go:

- *Mystery*. I still haven't found any fanfic that makes me wonder with the mystery in it as well canon has. I still remember went to sleep in 8th grade guessing who the hell is The Halfblood Prince? Once we know that he's Snape I feel like my life is complete. There's also the CoS fiasco; who causes the petrification? How did they do it? How does Dobby involved with this?
- *Foreshadowing*. It's directly related to the point before. There's so many little things in Canon that you'll miss the first time you're reading but would make you think 'damn, how can I miss this before' once you read the second time ^{and the third, and the fourth ....}
- *Worldbuilding.* I know this is a bit controversial, but the Wizarding World JKR build is unique; it's wierd, has no logic, and magical. It's not a copy medieval world in high fantasy a la LoTR or ASoIaF, nor it is a secret society that basically people with normal lives living a secret live. It's a totally different society with it's own rules and customs. I know it has a lot of problem, but you can deny how awesome Portkey is. Using trash to move people around? You can't go greener than that.
- *Realistic.* Some of the problem Harry has is completely relatable. Bullies, bad teacher, girls, falling out with your best friend, how 'adults don't understand', getting in trouble and being punished, thinking you're doing the right thing and totally messed up. This is a problem that many of us face everyday; this make Harry, Hermione, Ron, even Snape being a character we can sympathize with. Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peverell that needs to manage his finance is someone out there that I don't really care, why don't he hire someone to take care of his investment?
- *Compact*. Canon is short and yet it cover so many things; worldbuilding, character growth, mystery, etc. You'd think that fanficiton will be shorter than the original works, but no. The seven HP book is only 1,084,170 words. Meanwhile we have 777k for three year in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Prince of Slytherin]], 860k for three year in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Marauder's Plan]], ~500kish for three year in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300/1/Black-Luminary][Black Luminary]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][DPSW]], and don't even forget the behemoth of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Saving Connor Series]].
- *Puns*. Honestly this is the most important. How many puns that JKR uses in Canon? Diagon Alley, Knockturn Alley, Grimmauld Place, Knight Bus, Grunnings a Boring Company, Severus Snape, Remus Lupin, Voldemort. I feel like every time I read HP there's always new puns to be found.

HP doesn't really touch LGBTQ+ and other things people in late 2010s care about because it's written in late '90s. That's around 20 years of difference. People don't really care that there's no LGBTQ+ or POC character in the book back then, they are more concerned about the Y2K and whether the world will end.

Bullies, bad teacher, girls, falling out with your best friend, how 'adults don't understand', getting in trouble and being punished, thinking you're doing the right thing and totally messed up. This is a problem that many of us face everyday; this make Harry, Hermione, Ron, even Snape being a character we can sympathize with
#+end_quote

This is a great point. Harry and Ron falling out in fanfic isn't just the ebbs and flows of friendship, it's a reason for Ron to be the lazy scourge of mankind. Same thing with girls, in fanfic 9/10 the girl Harry starts to like is his love for the rest of his life and not just a random girl he liked for a bit while he was a teenager.

***** Not exactly. Harry is put in Slytherin, James (Auror) and Lily (Professor of Muggle Studies) are alive, Harry has a twin brother named James (Gryffindor), Pettigrew still works for Voldemort but is the Potter family attorney (you get a few chapters of his perspective)...there's a lot more but those are some major differences. I think it minorly hits the same plot points, but they're handled a bit differently. Main one is that James is seen as the Boy-Who-Lived while Harry was thought to be a squib and sent to live at the Dursleys so he (Harry) is pissed at his family for basically throwing him away.

Then there's a sub-plot about Theo Nott being cast out of the Nott family and being dubbed Theo No-Name and as such a magical curse causes a lot of wizards and witches (non-Muggleborns and public servants like teachers and Aurors and their children) to be very hostile towards him and those associated with him. Then there's Snape, Lucius, and Regulus doing some mind-delving after breaking out the Lestranges to get a glimpse at Voldie's plans. Bella has a second personality that's a lot more ruthless and focused than her usual psychotic murder-happy self. There's a past Dark inventor dubbed "the Toy Maker" that created cursed toys that killed people and Pettigrew got his paws on them while the Toy Maker's daughter was adopted by the....Goyles I think and was going to be married off to Theo's (former) father who's like 50 or older so gross. But the reason for that was so the Toy Maker's vault and stuff would end up in the hands of the Dark Lord's followers.

And then there's the overarching "Prince of Slytherin" plot where Harry has to prove himself to a hydra chair in a room at the end of a hallway that leads to the Prefects' rooms dubbed "Prefect Row" (the hallway, not the room). Along with all that, Harry is very advanced at Occlumency, Ron got possessed by the diary, and there's Magical India where Parselmagic (magic using Parseltongue) isn't frowned upon and Ron and James are learning it because apparently Parseltongue hereditary and Lily was a descendant of Salazar Slytherin.

Really? I think tragedy is something that JKR does particularly poorly. Sirius. Hedwig. All deaths that should feel tragic but just come across as cheap emotional manipulation or for the sake of the plot. Same goes for how she killed off people without any real impact in the final battle. The only really positive example i can think of in regards to tragedy is Cedric.

It's why we have movies, and an expanded universe, and an amusement park, and fanfic, and millions of kids dreaming. There is nothing in fanon that competes with it; it is an aspect of JKR's worldbuilding.

I dont' have a problem with the characterization in canon, I think the deconstruction in fanon has its uses but I don't agree with your conclusions. Ron is actually tactically useful all the way throught, Voldemort's vanity causes him to make legitimately bad decisions, etc.

For the third point..... it's a very authentic English novel. That's not something the world needs /more/ of, absolutely. But it makes the UK seem delightful, and it's also very damning.

Fanfic is great when you really want to read a specific genre fic: romance, political, more mythology, independent!Harry, etc. They're fun fics and it's cool to see what people come up with emphasizing certain aspects of canon or supplementing it with their own ideas and running with it.

First of all, JKR broke the mold of the cliche "changing the future, by going to the past and reliving the present". Having an all-in timeline where actions have consequences is surprisingly refreshing.

PS. It's actually one of the main reasons why I didn't like the Cursed Child, as she remade that mold and fell head first into it during the second (i think?) act.

*** Characters' achievements were questioned due to nationalism and implicit homophobia, actually.

Fleur is bashed by Ginny and Hermione for her Frenchness before her wedding. And her Veela-ness, if that counts as a race. Dumbledore's achievements are undermined after his death by Rita Skeeter, where she implies that his crowning victory against Grindy was a scam, and that he preys on his students.

  ‘Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald,' says Skeeter, with a tantalising smile. ‘I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell---or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I'll say is, don't be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend.

  ‘Oh yes,' says Skeeter, nodding briskly, ‘I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy's best interests---well, we'll see. It's certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.'

**** There's definite implicit parallels to racism/homophobia in all the treatment of half-breeds and squibs, almost certainly intentional (lycanthropy being AIDS, for example). I don't know about the Rita homophobia though, that reads more as accusations of pedophilia and fraternizing with the enemy.

******* Someone put this in a fic? This is scary. I've seen fans of this pairing saying these two characters have chemistry. But I've only seen this translating to a lot of sex. Some of them make this relationship even worse than in canon. It's interesting that even though they like this paring, I was usually unable to understand why that might be. Unless they like the whole oposites attract idea, but even then, Tonks seems so young in most fics. She doesn't seem to have any idea what's going on and how she should act. I've seen her behaviour of 'wearing him down' shown as something a self-aware female who knows what she wants does because if,say, she pulled back, that wouldn't be so brave. Sorry for the rant, but it's a topic that bugs me a lot. Most women are on her side, at least it seems they are, and consequently see her as the one who is right, so maybe that's where the problem is.

******* To the first? It was a stressful situation that caused him to act rashly trying to save the life of his dead friend's son/avenge their death. Making a mistake doesn't change the fact that he was fair, a good teacher, and sympathetic to the kids. Further, Tonks /wasn't there/. When she meets him the children are all extremely close to him/seem to respect him and he doesn't talk down to them. I don't see how she'd judge him based on a split-second decision years ago that still resulted in a safe-ish Harry Potter.

As to the second? Do you really think it's fair to judge an in-context issue with an out-of-context one? Remus' explanation of Dementors and Patronus charm is correct insofar as it's working how Rowling wrote the darn thing. She changed how magic worked and complex things were greatly throughout the books and it's not fair to accuse a character of deliberately sabatoging Harry when it's quite clear he was telling the information as-known.

Regardless, that doesn't mean I think Remus is a good choice for Tonks as his self-pity isn't healthy and he lets people push him around far too easily. But I can still see her easily being attracted to and chasing him.

** I did wonder when this topic would come up in a discussion. I personally love canon for giving me characters I can identify with, even after many re-reads. I've found a couple of fanfics that do that as well, but that's a rarety. But it's a sure way to make me like any work of fiction. Also, I know JK and romance do not go well together. But personally I prefer her way of dealing with it,i.e, not focusing too much on it. But here I only mean Harry's relationships. Fanfic authors tend to overcompensate. I almost always know what I'll get when I read a fic where the author describes the way a man desires a woman. The problem is that I don't want to know what he thinks, since I most probably will end up cringing. I know that's reality, but I much prefer friendships, parent-child relationships, since men's thoughts in fanfics are always the same. I don't read many fanfics, however, so my opinion maybe isn't all that reliable.

** Disagree about several of your points. The magic and the wizarding world are completely consistent in being weird and whimsical. It was never intended to be hyper-rational, and fanon attempts to make it so lead to much greater problems in worldbuilding. Imagine if someone complained that Discworld wasn't sufficiently logical. Same applies to Harry Potter.

Similarly, most characters are consistently characterised in canon, especially given that many of them are teenagers who are growing and changing somewhat over time (it would be very odd if you were still the same now as you were at 11 years old). We barely see anything of Tonks, so her displaying a few different moods in different scenes is hardly cause for concern. Voldemort has undergone extreme changes from his time at Hogwarts, and he's known for developing irrational obsessions. Being good at chess is very useful in situations where you're playing chess, and otherwise not at all.

  So what exactly do you think canon HP has that fanon and fanfiction can't compete with?
#+end_quote

I think that this may miss the point. Most fanfiction is not written out of an idea that canon is deeply problematic and needs replacement. Rather, it's written because canon is so good that people want more of it, and they expand on it, answering the "What if"s and lingering in the story world for a bit longer.

Regardless of how well you like JKR's specific recipes, people largely agree that her kitchen has a well-stocked pantry, fridge, and freezer, with plenty of utensils and appliances. It's quite understandable that people keep cooking their own dishes there.
