**** That's the extremely complimentary vague way of looking at it. It's a millions time crazier when you actually read it

** I could be proven horribly wrong in the next few weeks, but if I were JKR's agent, I would not be above leaking false information to crowd out any true leaks that might be happening.

**** Many people see nothing wrong with "ruining" #keepthesecrets. Most people will never get to see the play anyways, and some would actually prefer spoilers to get an idea of the plot. In fact, many people are disappointed with Rowling's whole #keepthesecrets - the fact that she releases the "eighth story" in a format so inaccessible that most fans will never see it, and then wants everyone who has to keep quiet about it... for what? Exclusivity?

This is why [[/r/harrypotter]] had a megathread on Cursed Child spoilers.

**** How many of these confirmations are independent, though? (This question isn't completely rhetorical: I don't have the time or the interest to research the matter myself.)

Either way, I'll believe it when I see the actual play or its script.

** I wouldn't mind seeing fics with the Major New Character, but the Character itself might need a bit of tinkering.
