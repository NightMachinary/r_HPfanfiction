Ok, so I'm betting you've all read at least one Daphne is an ice queen because she's cold and aloof. Yes?

But what if the ice queen thing only started because of a rolling joke about ice cream? Ok, so I'm planning to write a Harry/Daphne story and what do you guys think about the ice queen thing being a joke about ice cream?

** I'd read this! That would be hilarious. Is it an inside joke that got misunderstood and Daphne decided to roll with it?

** Or because she's just a sweet person to be around. Like "how are you not a Hufflepuff" sweet.

** I generally write Daphne as autistic. Her reputation as an ice queen is just due to her not outwardly displaying her emotions.

** So I know this girl who's this blonde bombshell and is really elegant. She's an interior decorator, you know? But she fucking loves butt jokes and fart jokes, and that's how I see Daphne, like she's the ice(cream) queen because she is actually a total dork but doesn't feel like sharing that part of her with arseholes who won't get it and aren't worth it

in short I love this
