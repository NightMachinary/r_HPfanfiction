I just imagine this as being a crossover between /Final Destination/ and /Harry Potter/, where one of the Death Eaters has a vision that has them avoiding some disaster, only for them to die later in disturbing ways. I've never actually read any horror crossovers with /Harry Potter/ beyond the /Hellraiser/ one, /Evil, Be Thou My Good/, but I'm guessing it's been done before.

EDIT - Okay, it /has/ been done before, but from the descriptions, none of them had Death going after Death Eaters, unless they weren't categorized as crossovers, I suppose.


** I actually like this idea. Having seen Final Destination, that is what I was seeing in reading your description. As an added idea, while the Deatheaters all die in weird and unusual accidental ways, it always seems to be just as they are about to attack Harry in some fashion. For instance, after Harry frees Dobby, Lucius goes to to curse Harry, and Dobby retaliates as normal. However, when Lucius goes flying back, he just so happens to come between a 7th year casting a breaking curse on a piece of rock he has to move from the hall. So the curse, instead of hitting the rock as planned, just happens to get Lucius, breaking his neck and killing him.

That was explicitly the point of the prompt. I just imagine as malevolent as Death seems to be in the Final Destination series, that it would be particularly... eager? To shuffle off Voldemort's mortal coil.

It's not Final Destination level accidents, but Death Eaters going after Harry have a tendency to to accidentally get splatted. Like, apparating behind Harry... who's on the balcony of his 20th floor hotel room and they plummet to their death.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** Voldemort rushes into Hogwarts... "Albus man, you gotta help me. Death is after me."

"Sure it is,"

"It's no joke you senile old twat!" Voldemort boomed, "Rookwood got turned into a flobberworm and squished today, Lucius asfixiated in dungbombs the day before, and last Saturday Mrs. Karkaroff fucked Dolohov till he was drained and dead. I get the feeling Karkaroff is going to die in embarrassment tomorrow."

"Tom, Karkaroff died more than a year ago."

"Oh, yeah, death got him first"

"You killed him,"

Voldemort put his hands on his cheeks, in shock, "Oh my gosh, Death is using me!"

This is actually a pretty cool idea: Voldemort and his Death Eaters being hunted by Death, ramping up the paranoia between each other and Voldemort himself...

** Out of curiosity, have you read The Boy Who Died A Lot? linkao3(670548)\\
The plot of it is kind of comedic (in a dark way); Harry keeps dying again and again in improbable ways, and Snape is stuck with the job of keeping him alive via an experimental time turner.

*** I'm afraid I've never heard of it. Just about every fanfic I've read that involved Harry dying multiple times were ones done in response to Reptilia28's "Don't Fear the Reaper" challenge, and even then, those stories basically started /in media res/, where Harry is on his last chance to get things right, so one doesn't see the many deaths of Harry Potter.
