So I've seen a whole bunch of fanfic where Ron is bashed, Dark and a complete idiot. I've seen some where he's a loveable, dense idiot, who tries his best, but well, he's just not that bright. I've seen a couple where he's mature and loyal. But I've only seen one where he uses his strategic mind, and he's actually smart (linkffn(4776013)). Does anyone have any recommendations for a smart Ron who is good at strategy? Any pairing, any plot, any bashing.

EDIT: It doesn't have to be Ron-centric, but I would prefer one where his contribution is fairly significant.


** I love him in linkffn(reign of the serpent). I've heard he's smart/effective in all of Starfox's works, personally I can vouch for linkffn(the dark lord never died) which is really good.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
