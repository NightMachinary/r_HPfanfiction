In HBP, Dumbledore's body bind on Harry fails when he dies. Do you think/Has JKR mentioned whether this effect also happens with transfigured things? What about other charms or curses?


** No. We know that, because a legend says that the Quintaped are creatures who were originally human and killed the people who transfigured them. Even if this isn't true, wizards believe, that it could be true. Meaning it doesn't break any known rules of transfiguraion.

*** This is the answer for Transfiguration. As for Charms...

Contrary to most fanon, canon doesn't seem to distinguish between "enchanted" and "Charmed", treating them largely as synonyms. However, given that magically constructed buildings don't randomly fall down, and given that magical objects can be passed down through the generations, one assumes that there is a way to make Charms last long enough to outlive their caster.

That said, from the fact that the school brooms are faulty, we also know that Charms can deteriorate over time/with heavy use.

Making Charms last longer could just be casting them with superior skill. But equally there may be some special requirements.

*** I forgot about them. It does feel more right that a transfigured thing should stay so until someone actively untransfigures it.

**** Also makes much more sense, considering that transfiguration alters an objects molecular structure and doesn't really ad any magic into it. Objects dont just turn into other objects without actually using magic on them.

If you want to know more about the rules of magic, Taure basically wrote down and interpreted all the magical rules mentioned or shown in canon. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit#]]

** Possibly. If JK Rowling was okay with Slughorn's story about Lily's fish, then maybe so. There's nothing in the books to suggest that it does or doesn't though.

*** I didn't think they did. I did recall the Slughorn story, but I'm always a bit wary of movie-verse titbits.

It does make me wonder, though. If a wizards spell fails after death, does this mean they've got a constant connection to the spell while alive? Like, even after casting it, they're sort of... still pushing magic into it? Or do they just leave a sort of invisible layer of magic that maintains/is the charm and that magic disperses on death? What other circumstances could make it fail? Loss of intention? Unconsciousness? Pure lack of will?

Also, I am now imagining some cheapskate who furnished their whole home with transfigured objects, and then they die suddenly and their unfortunate SO ends up suddenly sitting on a bare floor with a lapfull of tea and a few cheap odds ends because they were drinking out of a transfigured teacup, sitting on a transfigured chair, and had transfigured carpets.

**** Some spells do seem to have a sustained effect, as opposed to a one-off one. For example, a stunner is a one-off effect, it stuns, whereas a levitation charm is a sustained effect, for obvious reasons.

I have no idea how exactly enchanted items tie into it, but at a guess they are made via a one-off spell that ties/binds/whatevs other spells or effects to them, and the enchantments failing with extended use may be about the binding becoming too loose for some reason (like because of energy flow, what with the fact that such items probably use ambient magic to work so it has to flow into them when they are used).

It likely depends on the spell. I doubt something like a Stunner or Body-Bind Curse require constant concentration. The Levitation Charm or Patronus, for example, likely require concentration.

** Transfiguration is about the spell, charms and stuff are about the effect. As such, once you change something via transfiguration it will simply be that thing, there is no need for you to sustain it.
