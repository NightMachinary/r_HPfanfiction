Okay, for background: I hate Dumbledore bashing (or any kind of bashing, really), so I'm looking for a comedy/crack fic where the "Dumbledore manipulates Harry" trope is turned on its head, and Harry decides that he would love being a power-hungry puppetmaster like Dumbledore and decides to follow Dumbledore and learn his ways.


** sounds like fun. never read one though, aside from the usual harry learns everything and tricks the evil dumbles..
