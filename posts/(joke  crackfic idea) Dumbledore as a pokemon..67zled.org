- when he was yet friendly with Grindelwald and making world-conquering plans with him, he was Dumble-dum.
- when he had his Uncle-Ben moment and distanced himself from Gellert due to Ariana's death, he evolved into Dumble-dee.
- when he made a decision to face off against his former friend and won in the battle, he morphed into his final form of Dumble-dore.

*** Sort of, yes. Though if you're going to compare it with a mythical creature, I'd go with Maia from LoTR.

And in terms of alignments I'd say undecided -> non-dark -> light, maybe? Since there's only 3 forms, and he had never exactly actively chosen a dark pathway.

Now, /if/ he had stayed with Grindelwayd, it would've evolved him into a dark form.

p.s. Try to think of a scenario in which he would've ended up evolving into a Dumble-derp.

**** he was pretty radical after he finished hogwarts, so dark is fitting, only after arianna was killed he became normal.

also after he dies he became psychic/ghost "im haunting you" ghost nappa.
