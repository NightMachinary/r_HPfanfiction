Nothing gruesome, just crack.


** With a complicated weave of his wand, and a flexing of will, Voldemort's power flowed into a discarded scrap of clothing, which swelled and writhed into the form of a golden-furred canine. It yawned its gaping jaws wide, filled with razor teeth.

‘There you go boy, sic him!'

But the dingo did not rip into the mewling infant. Instead, it curled up beside the boy, and went to sleep.

Voldemort stared at the scene dumbfounded for a long moment, before turning on his heel and storming down the stairs.

Peter Pettigrew slunk out of the shadows of the living room, looking rather pre-occupied with his old friend's corpse, laid out on the carpet.

‘Did... did you do it my lord?'

‘Out of my way, Wormtail!' Voldemort snapped, brandishing his wand furiously. ‘There's a court case in Australia to settle!'
