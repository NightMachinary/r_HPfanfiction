:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So my friend is looking for a specific fanfiction with this trope and I'm really interested in reading this too. Apparently it's very long fic, completed, and apparently sirius not only survives ootp, but he also helps golden trio hunt for horcruxes and apppears in the epilogue as well.

Does anyone have any idea what story it might be? The only fic I found was "a cadmean's victory" by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7037477/DarknessEnthroned][DarknessEnthroned]] but my friend says it's not it


** There's also linkffn(Weary Wizard) but it's a one-shot with that as a minor plot point

*** Arthur weasley dies in that fic, but the fic focusing on bashing instead of exploring the change in ron

**** The fic doesn't focus on Ron. The only Weasley to have an actual role in the /one-shot/ is Molly and her portrayal is /positive/.

****** Because the story is not about the Weasleys. And it's a one-shot so the story has to focus on what's important. And Arthur dies in the background.

** I remember someone mentioning a fic like that in this sub recently. It was the author and they said they wrote it before book 5 was finished and had Arthur die and Sirius live. I don't remember more though. Good luck.
