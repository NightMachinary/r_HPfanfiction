It seems to me that everyday when I check the recently updated fics on the site, there's more and more fics that have been copied and uploaded.

At what point does the Admins of the site step in? Because it is now a glaring issue with multiple authors having their work stolen.

I for one and sick and tired of seeing these trolls on the site with new users falling for it and congratulating them for something they've not even done in the first place.

My last point is a question, does this mean a downfall of the number of fics posted on FF.net? If so, where will authors post their works?

*** How are you sure its the same person? I've seen the multiple postings of old stories (they seem to be from authors who have been inactive for a long time), but I was assuming this was several people.

Just curious, considering it seems pretty easy for anyone to do all that.

***** To be honest, I only recently realized this was even a serious thing on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]. I looked at my filter and saw there were five or six fics that had more than 20k words each by the same author, and several of them I recognized. Saw it just last night as it happens. But there didn't seem to be any commonality between the different fics and accounts. But I don't know much so take that with a grain of salt.

The whole thing just seems like a gigantic waste of time to me, and I can't figure out what you could really /get/ from doing it. Its not even funny.

** Hijacking this post as someone who checks the recently published filter very often. Is this DZ2 guy a machine or something? I swear he puts out like 3-4 one shots per day that never even get close to a second chapter. This is in no way in relation to the topic of plagiarism I was just curious.

*** That author is the biggest mystery to me. He writes so much, but he is a 'serial story abandoner'. He seems to start a bajillion story ideas and later deletes those 10k-20k words stories. The stories in his profile are only a fraction of what he wrote.

*** The sad thing is that they're actually a pretty decent author and can write some pretty good battle scenes and such. The issue is that it's been literal years since I've seen them actually finish a fic they started. That and they post so many fics as one-shots but then never actually tag them as one-shots.

*** It's frustrating mainly because it is more or less the same set of fics being posted over and over again. Occasionally it is stuff that has been removed from the site previously, but mainly it is stuff that is still on the site. The fact that there isn't any system in place to check if content substantively matches existing stories is... frustrating.

Not to mention that unless this guy is cycling VPNs like mad, it should be easy to IP ban. Honestly I can't believe that this person hasn't gotten bored yet. What enjoyment is there to be found from reposting and being banned over and over again? There certainly isn't a financial incentive.

** Well, for each new chapter posted, they could easily check against every chapter ever posted in the same category with similar tags for equal number of characters and something like 2 or 3 triplets of character in the same random position if the numbers are the same... or some other method... it's not like worst case a few 100k equality checks every time someone publishes a chapter would be an unbearable cost. They could even delay the processing to ease the load a little bit, like make the posting/editing of a chapter take 2-3mins to take effect (would also mitigate spamming/DDoS Attacks). That's just a random idea at the top of my head, I'm not designing a NASA system here.

The point is: it could be done, but ff.net is an old website that would need a lot of refactoring and no one really gives enough of a shit to do it. And then that would only protect against the more blatant plagiarism attempts and only intra-site, someone could easily re-post your stuff on a tumblr or their private blog.

To be perfectly honest: it's 2018, the death wails of the copyright have long stopped resounding in the dark and hallowed halls of the interwebs. And is it really such a terrible thing? That's perhaps another debate.

Just post your stuff, hopefully get some favs and reviews, connect with a few people and have fun... That's really all there is to do in my humble opinion.

** It's Plagiarism In Name Only. One troll who uses a bot (I hope they do because otherwise it's even sadder) to upload the first couple chapters of 20 fics at a time, fics from authors with established followings, and they manage to dupe one or two idiots before getting a bunch of comments informing the troll that the account's been reported. This person doesn't even do anything more with that. Hell, I want to see someone rip me off, at least it would be something new and worth discussing.

Report and move on.
