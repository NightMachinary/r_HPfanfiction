** For me? It was in linkffn(Hail, Odysseus) that I'd seen recommended. From Chapter 2:

#+begin_quote
  Harry ran a hand over his face, while surreptitiously breathing in deeply. At once, his keen sense of smell detected various feminine odours: delicate soaps, fragrant shampoos and even a few dabs of a flowery perfume from the dark-haired girl. He also smelt hints of a more earthy, irony smell.

  Concentrating on that scent, he realised that the dark-haired girl and the one with short light-brown hair had both started their menstrual cycles, while the nervous-looking girl with long, straight brown-hair was right on the verge of it. The small, giggly blond child who sat nearest to the door had yet to have her first period, however.
#+end_quote

I did /not/ need to be explicitly told that this Harry could smell... that for the fic to shoehorn in why magical education starts at the age it does.

  He fixed her with the coldest stare he could manage, pushing as much of his fury as he could muster into his eyes.

  She flinched as if struck.

  'I do not forgive,' he repeated in a voice as cold as the ice in his blood. 'I do not forget.'

This is (a 14 year old) Harry supposedly acting badass after Hermione prevented him from using his wand on Ron (after beating up on Ron) and accidentally breaking said wand. Oh, and with only a few weeks of deviation from canon to put him into that state.

***** It's a good encapsulation of the Independent!Harry approach many fics take, yeah - it just jumped out at me because I thought it'd been going in an interesting way (Ron apologizing, Ron/Hermione didn't seem to be being heavily bashed)... and then with that line (and the chapter in general) it sunk in that it was really an edgelord harry fic. Where one summer of reading makes him incredible in all his classes, and a few weeks makes it so he isn't interested in Ron/Hermione at all anymore.

Too jarring a change in personality for me to follow a canon 3 years.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** This was years ago and it wasn't /immediately/, but it should have been. I believe it went something like: "All around the world the nukes failed to detonate as the presence of magic fundamentally can not allow sub-atomic particles to act unnaturally. Except in the Middle East, where wizards had mostly been driven away by Islam."

The author then spent at least 4 chapters occasionally going back to describe all the horrible shit going down in the Islamic world, that had little to no bearing on the plot that by and large was still in fucking Scotland (and some Oracle counsel thing in Delphi, IIRC).

Like I could have written that off as a tragic footnote, but they were clearly gleeful about the concept of mass-murder for a difference in beliefs, I found myself wondering why Voldemort was still a bad guy in their worldview.

But I do remember that the bigotry was a huge surprise, mostly because of how weirdly well put together all the world-building was before that point. Like this behavior of magical fields was why electronics stop working- electrons don't move through wires when magic's about- and a strong enough presence was enough to forcibly revert synthetic objectss to their raw elements.

There is also Chaos;Head which questions reality a lot, and the odd strange feeling I get from playing it I have never experienced before - A feeling that is odd but I like it.

**** It's very funny to me because it doesn't really strike me as /that/ weird.

But I'm in a special case - of having read the first few books in another language (French), where 'Mione' reads fairly naturally, and the british-ism vs American-ism isn't quite as pronounced. I considered it all 'english', and then when I continued reading (and switched to English to read them as they came out), it was at the time I was moving back to the States.

Made me puzzled at how much some people hate american-isms the first time I saw it mentioned.

*** Wait, what's the UK version of "take out the trash"?

Come to think of it, the wizarding world wouldn't use trash trucks, since they don't seem to use roads so much, or internal combustion engines. Muggles use roads and trash trucks. Muggles have a comparatively limited mobility, and no need to hide the existence of their trash. Hence, big, sprawling road networks, and big trucks to convey an entire subdivisions' worth of trash to the dump. The Statute of Secrecy makes the muggle waste management model impractical for the average wizarding household. Can't have random sanitation workers puzzling out what a Bertie Bott Every Flavour Bean is, from finding a stray wrapper in the municipal waste system.

So Ron wouldn't be "taking out the trash" by setting a large can filled with a weeks' worth of waste at the end of the Weasley driveway, even if we called those things by their UK terms.

***** Well, let me educate you: after it became apparent that Harry was interested in spending time with Draco because Draco seemed like an interesting person, the author decided to hammer home that nevertheless this was /not/ a Death-Eater-apologist fic at /all/ by giving the following insight into the sort of values Lucius has brought this Draco up with: Draco casually mentions, when Luna irks him, that one day when he's grown up he's going to rape her in revenge.

It's one of the moments in /HPMoR/ where you can see where the author was /coming from/, but he massively underestimated just /how/ jarring the line would be; he shot for "will reinstate that the Death Eaters are still horrible people" but failed to take into account that with canon /HP/ not being adult fiction, rape is already beyond the sphere of evil where the /canon/ Death Eaters dwell, and that consequently it's not just a shock but completely out of left field and weird and unpleasant.

******* Of course. If you had Draco say that one day he'd have his way with her, you could have Harry slowly realizing that Draco Malfoy was not a good person over the course of a scene for mounting horror.

But having Draco come out and say it explicitly? That's just bad writing and cheap shock. Just look at convicted rapist Brock Turner's dad: he didn't say that his son, convicted rapist Brock Turner, shouldn't be convicted because of anything to do with rape specifically, he said his son convicted rapist Brock Turner shouldn't have his life ruined for "20 minutes of action." You see other similar defenses for similar cases. There are plenty of real-world cases where this sort of value system actually comes into play, but the author just went for the edgy, easy way of making Draco be raised by /eeeevviillll/ by stating it outright.

And then he had Harry feel bad for /Draco/. Harry feels bad for Draco because he was raised in a value system where that was normal--in essence, no one taught him not to rape. Does he care about the hypothetical victims? (Hell, does he care when it's implied that Draco's saying such things about his best friend /Hermione?/)

No. It's just more "I'm working on Draco" and "he's a good boy who just needs to be stopped from making a mistake." He doesn't stop being friends with Draco, he just keeps trying to stop Draco from ruining his own life.

Am I being uncharitable to HPMoR? Perhaps. Harry is, from one point of view, doing a good thing by trying to stop Draco Malfoy from being a criminal, but the way it's depicted in the text is inelegant and unrealistic.

Also, even if he knows what it means, that doesn't mean that he'd know the true moral weight of it.

#+end_quote

It's probably not the first one; we can be reasonably sure that he knows what it is. Draco details exactly how he could get away with it, suggesting that he knows exactly what he's talking about.

That aside, in my opinion the chapter would be more horrifying if the word 'rape' was never used; Draco Malfoy going around basically declaring himself Rapey McRapeface is one thing. Draco Malfoy acting casually entitled to any woman he wants *and not saying /any/ word that suggests he knows it's remotely wrong* is quite another.

It's the bookish son of a physicist saying this; you might feel very comfortable from the perspective of a fanfiction-reader throwing around phrases like "break the laws of nature", but if faced with the limited amounts of magic that Harry had seen up until this point, it would be much more reasonable to assume that you were dealing with kinds of energy not documented by the science you knew, but which still fundamentally fit into a mathematically-consistent model of the universe.

Not criticizing your dislike of /HPMoR/ as such --- the tone of it turns some people off and that's perfectly fine. [[/u/kenneth1221]] below, for example; there's just nothing to answer to that. The Draco thing is (willfully) jarring in a way that some people will find clever and others just obnoxious.

When is it ever in character? No one ever says or does anything like that in the books. When Harry is being sassy, he's not being cute and quirky, it's because he's lashing out against an authority figure. And when he does, his M.O. is to come up with a clever one-liner to undermine their authority over him.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked round and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.

  "Do you remember me telling you we are practising non-verbal spells, Potter?"

  "Yes," said Harry stiffly.

  "Yes sir."

  "There's no need to call me 'sir', Professor."

  The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione.
#+end_quote

And this one:

#+begin_quote
  "Why were you lurking under our window?"

  "Listening to the news," said Harry in a resigned voice.

  His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage. "Listening to the news! Again?"

  "Well, it changes every day, you see," said Harry.

/Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much/

It's the first line of the first book. "Normal" is pretty much their definition.

*** They don't. Also they don't call Harry "Freak" or anything ridiculous like that, in fact I'm pretty sure the only time that word is even utterd is by Petunia when she rants at Hagrid, exposing her jealousy and insecurities regarding and about her sister Lily.

** Any time when Harry suddenly receives a letter from Gringotts or has a meeting with the Goblins.

You just know it's going to turn into some kind of Powerful!Harry, Bashing or 'political'/'inheritance' fic. Especially when he's only 11, like what 11 year old is gonna have meetings with Goblins to discuss his financial plans!? Not many, let alone a child who has been raised in a cupboard.

** The only time I went from being somewhat invested in a story to instantly dropping it was after someone was Obliviated by Dumbledore to act like a little shit, was screwed over by soulmate shenanigans overriding free will and was a pawn for the Greater Good.

So here we have 3 things I find very offputting: Manipulative!Dumbledore, Obliviation abuse and getting screwed over by free will-overriding soulbonds, all within a single paragraph. Nope.

*** Manipulative!Dumbledore, depending on how you define it, is pretty much canon. That doesn't mean he is a bad person or that he is trying to force a Harry/Ginny relationship or stuff like that. But still.
