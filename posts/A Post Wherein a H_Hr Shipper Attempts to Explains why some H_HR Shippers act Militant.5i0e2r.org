Disclaimer: If I've stepped on any toes and you'd like to downvote and move on I completely get it.

 

Now for those of you still here. I haven't been reading fanfiction all that long. I read a little bit maybe a decade ago when the series was still incomplete and then mostly forgot about it. However, in the past several months I have rediscovered the fandom, and I must say that I have been blown away by the creativity and skill many authors exhibit. I'd argue that there are several fics that stand on the same level as canon work, and a plethora of others that fall just short. This universe is just so big, it truly is remarkable how folks are able to alter it, expand on it, and shape it creating many wondrous stories that expand on a book series that I know I will cherish forever as an integral part of my childhood and life.

 

Now with all that being said, when I read fanfiction my preference is the Harry and Hermione pairing. I know that might rub people the wrong way. I know it isn't canon. I know it might not make sense to many, but that is just my preference and quite frankly how I wished the story had ended.

 

It of course didn't, but that all right. I think the world of Harry Potter belongs as much to JK Rowling as it does to the fans of the series. Many of us grew up reading about Harry, Ron, and Hermione while they grew up alongside us. Its one of the many reasons I wish that there had been no epilogue. Want Harry to end up with Draco? Sounds good, its your imagination and interpretation of what happened afterwords. The same holds true to me with fanfiction. Severus travels back in time to win Lily's heart? Sounds good to me. Just make sure to write a good, imaginative story. Ron is actually a time traveling Dumbledore? Well I think you get the idea. Whatever interpretation/preference of fanfiction you want to have should be fine no matter how ridiculous or implausible.

 

Now on Harry and Hermione.

 

This isn't going to be some post detailing why H/Hr shippers are correct, or why JK Rowling got it wrong. Quite frankly, I think that would be a silly thing to do.

 

It's not secret that this fandom has (or maybe had?) a reputation for fighting with one another about what should or shouldn't be canon. I think its completely fine to defend one's stance on why they believe a certain pairing should have been/shoudn't have been. However, I've noticed several posts and comments wondering why H/Hr shippers can be so violent/militant about their pairing.

 

Thus, as someone who enjoys this pairing but has had the opportunity of not experiencing the fanfiction fandom whilst the books were being released I thought maybe I could shed some insight based on some conclusions I've been starting to make;

 

- Any pairing that ISN'T canon can inherently lend itself to believers in that pairing lashing out, and acting hostile towards other members of the community as a means of justifying oneself. I'm not condoning this behavior or saying its right (just the opposite if you read my above paragraphs. In fact, I think this mentality of non-canon shippers believing that they need to vehemently justify their OTP creates many of the bad tropes and cliches that plague fanfiction.

- Many fans are quick to wave off the opinions of others. My favorite example of this is when someone writes off Harry/Hermione fans, accusing them of shipping Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson and not Harry and Hermione. I've enjoyed the Harry and Hermione pairing since I first started reading the books years and years ago, and I find it to be very frustrating and disrespectful when someone brushes off my opinion about my preference because they think the movies "polluted" my views.

EDIT: Should include this as well:

I think it probably comes from insecurity. Non-canon shippers feel like they constantly have to justify their pairing, and therefore go to great lengths in their stories to make their pairing functional. So for example, I've noticed in a lot of Harry/Hermione stories that the Weasleys and Dumbledore often become evil incarnate and are doing everything in their power to prevent Harry and Hermione from being together. These plots always feel very shallow and are incredibly distracting and poorly written.

 

I hope I was able to explain some of my thoughts in a way that others won't find offensive.

  tldr; make love, not war my fanfiction friends

EDIT 2: What are everyone else's thoughts? It would be interesting to open a dialogue in this post as well if poeple want to join in.

EDIT 3: Gonna add this thought I had too, which is also in the comments:

"I do think there is a tendency amongst Harry/Hermione detractors to "Hand wave" away folks who use canon and Rowling's comments to justify the pairing. Has she been misquoted in attempt to justify H/Hr? Most certainly and often obviously, but their are definitely things she has said that DO provide H/Hr shippers with legitimate ammunition (for lack of better term) to defend their stance. This sub tends to ignore that Rowling HAS said things concerning the outcome of the story, even though the things she has said aren't as damning as some H/Hr shippers would lead you to believe (looking at you clickbaity news sources claiming that Rowling explicitly said that Harry and Hermione should have ended up together-that just didn't happen). For me, it has always been enough that JK admitted "that it could have gone that way" as I believe she said, because it means that at least the author herself could see a scenario where it worked out, even if it didn't turn out that way in the conclusion of the series."


** Um... I'm reading over this and I'm not seeing where you explain why and how H/Hr shippers are /more/ militant about their pairing than most other ships. You're just pointing out that all of us are prone to militarism about our ships, a point which I will definitely grant you.

Now, your point might be that H/Hr shippers /aren't/ more militant about their ship, to which I will counterpoint by saying that everything, and I do mean everything I hear about H/Hr shippers is that they can be goddamn /rabid/ about their pairing, even if they have calmed down over the years. Hearsay, yes, but it's hearsay a lot of people will back up.

If I am wrong about your intention, can you clarify the point you are trying to make?

*** I guess I was just trying at first to explain militant attitude expressed by H/Hr shippers, and then realized a lot of what I was saying applied to all fandoms. I just want everyone to get along, and give constructive feedback on fanfiction rather than use reviews as a way to flame an author's opinion on a pairing or how they wrote their story.

EDIT: As far as your comment about hearsay goes, I would say this however: Don't let a select group of individuals (even if they are loud and obnoxious) define a fandom for you. I've had my opinion dismissed about my preference for Harry/Hermione on the sole basis that folks assumed I was just one of the many cliche trotting fans of that pairing which honestly is really frustrating and disrespectful.

I personally have never encountered a militant H/Hr shipper. I tend to stay away from places like tumblr, where they tend to congregate. What defines the pairing for me is the sheer volume of fics in the pairing. Like I said, it's a pairing like any other to me, but there's just too much of it for it to be anything other than repetitious for me. Even if it's the best fic in the world I won't read it because I'm so tired of Hermione as a love interest.

** I do not like the H/Hr ship as a general rule. I just never got the feeling that they'd work as a couple. Mostly because Hermione is extremely strong-willed and bossy, and Harry quite often seemed annoyed by this aspect of her. Not to say that no couple has ever had their incompatible sides, but fanfic authors NEVER address this problem in their stories. Hermione nags and railroads everyone around her, and Harry just passively does whatever she says.

I have read some fics where they are basically friends with benefits, and I like those ones quite a bit more. I'd actually like to see more casual relationships within /all/ the pairings, and not all this talk of soul mates and happily ever after amongst a bunch of 15-year-olds.

** You don't really explain why the fans are so rabid.

On the other side of the coin, I think part of the reason some people respond so negatively to Harry/Hermione is that most popular pairings in the fandom involve Harry or Hermione. So while a pairing like Harry/Draco might only incite the annoyance of Harry/Ginny fans, Harry/Luna fans, and Harry/Snape fans, a Hermione/Harry pairing irks Harry/Ginny fans, Hermione/Ron fans, Harry/Draco fans, Hermione/Draco fans, Hermione/Snape fans, Harry/Snape fans, etc. I'm not saying that every fan of all of these fandoms hates Harry/Hermione, but the pairing sinks the majority of fanon and canon ships.

Like you said, I grew up reading about /Harry, Ron, and Hermione/, and I think they're all brilliant characters. Unfortunately since Ron ended up with Hermione in canon, the 'militantness' of the Harmony ship-dom has translated into a hate-boner for Ron, and that's what I can't stand.

** Here's my reasoning: the H/Hr ship views itself as direct competition to the canon ships, so of course they will be more militant, and also why you have a bigger proportion of H/Hr shippers being completely blind to any canon evidence against their ship.

Now, obviously not all H/Hr shippers are "delusional militantists". But why is H/Hr the most militant ship? Why not something like Ginny/Luna or Hermione/Neville, even though both are just as "fanonical" as H/Hr? The answer is simple. Because the books built up all this interaction between the trio. Regardless of whether it's platonic or not, more presence between the two characters is always "positive" to your ship. It means more opportunity to look for the tiniest cracks in the canon. Ships that have no threat whatsoever against the canonical "order" are by definition more peaceful, because since there's almost or no interaction, there's nothing to be militant about.

The natural evolution of this vocalness is proclaiming that it's better than the canon ships, that the fanon should have happened. So you have to get Ginny and Ron out of the way. And how is that usually done? By bashing. Which is why the vast majority of the Weasley bashing (especially Ginny and Ron, since they are the direct threat to the H/Hr ship) is done by Harmonians.

It's been a problem for more than 10 years, since HBP came out, and while the number of H/Hr shippers has gradually decreased over time (at least in the book fandom, the movies are something else), the Harmonians have only become more desperate to prove that their ship is the only true one. Which explains why they completely misinterpret JKR's words from the Wonderland interview, which further fueled the militancy. In their view, JKR did not say "In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit [compared to Ron and Hermione]", instead it's "Harry and Hermione MUST be together, Ginny and Ron can just fuck off".

And by the way, the truth really is that the films have had an impact on people shipping H/Hr. Maybe not you personally, but in general. In the words of the Rubio meme:

Where did this come from out of curiosity? I've never heard of it. Also on the movies, I also agree that it is incredibly regrettable what the screenwriters did to Ron's character. I ship Harry/Hermione, but Ron is still great and was a big part of the books. It was disappointing how he was handled in the movies. Same goes for Ginny, the screenwriters had a giant opportunity to correct what many perceived as a problem in HBP and Hallows and flesh out her character more. However, and forgive me if I'm incorrect in saying this, didn't Rowling have input on the screenplays or even final approval? If she had any input at all, I can totally see why many of the more "militant" H/Hr shippers could have spawned from/ and even defend movie canon as they could see that as evidence of Rowling "changing her mind" so to say. Couple that with comments Rowling has made in interviews since Hallows came out concerning Ron and Hermione not working (note that interview said nothing about her and Harry) along with other things, and boom you have a sizable portion of the fandom who has felt trodden on (whether this is true or not) come out the wordwork acting nasty after finally getting their supposed vindication.

I don't blame you for thinking this, since it is a common misconception within the fandom. David Heyman admitted himself in 2010 that JKR did not have that much of a role, and he also said that the most important people were, in order: Steve Kloves, himself, and the director. When asked if he was working regularly with JKR, or that she let free rein, he said that he was "a little too free".

JKR was only involved in choosing the actors (such as that they had to be British/Irish), keeping to the very main plot points, and answering any questions the actors or filmmakers had. That's it. There was no real input from JKR.

I mean, Jo more or less said that the two were fundamentally incompatible, and that the relationship was written as "wish-fulfillment", because she wanted to keep the characters the same as when she first plotted out the series. That seems really damning to me, and the whole "they'd probably be alright" qualifier seemed to be just that: a qualifier aimed at diffusing blowback from R/Hr shippers. Obviously, it didn't work.

Really, that interview had almost nothing to do with JKR shipping H/Hr, as the media initially reported, and more to do with her essentially de-legitimising R/Hr as a ship. And, tbh, I kind of agree: I think canon would have worked out more naturally if the trio had simply remained platonic and found romance elsewhere.

True, but I'm predicating this on wish-fulfillment and fundamental incompatibility being much stronger words than the ones she uses for Ron and Hermione being together. I do agree on inconsistency though: It's really odd that JK claims that a relationship was wish-fulfillment and they're /fundamentally/ incompatible, which are such strongly negative things to say about a romance, then says things like Hermione has a weakness for funny people and they'd be okay with counseling. I mean, fundamental implies that there is a conflict between who Ron and Hermione are at their cores, and no amount of counseling or compromising could fix that.

I'm not so sure about that. Now, obviously the backlash against that article was the erroneous supposition that Harry and Hermione should have gotten married over Ron and Hermione, but there were thousands of impassioned articles, op-eds, listicles, and forum posts on why Ron and Hermione were so great together, independent of whether they were better than H/Hr. So much so, that I think it very nearly drowned out the Piers Morgan-sized smugness emanating from the H/Hr camp. One could argue that had JK actually meant R/Hr were not a compatible couple, the enormous response could have convinced her to keep with the canon ships. Of course, this is all speculation, so I dunno.

** I think you gloss over the righteousness of H/Hr shippers. My preferred pairings are HP/DG or post Hogwarts Gabrielle. In my opinion Harry's life and personality lends itself to two types of women, he lacks love so hufflepuffs, Susan Bones pairing. Why? Because Harry has never had someone to love him unreserved with the effort and friendship an huffepuff brings. Alternatively Harry is a lonely sassy grumpy get, but that's okay because he always tries to do the right thing. He could do well with someone cunning, able to match his sass, battle wits and cut him down when he needs it which is why I like Harry/Slytherin girl pairings.

I know that why he ends up with Ginny is she has all of the above, she loves him like all Weasley do, she is sharp and willing to cut him down like Christmas in fifth year. That being said I'm not a huge fan of how limited her character often is and it doesn't have potential blank slate characters like Daphne and Susan do. What H/Hr shippers are awful at is denying that their pairing doesn't make sense but they just want it to work. They more than any other shippers are millitant because they think they have evidence. They have a habit of quoting, often miss quoting cannon and JKR as Evidence for their pairing. This /evidence/ they feel justifies their believes as it /proves/ something. I will never claim Harry/Daphne has any real backing or endorsement I just feel a Slytherin mind set would work well with Harry and it opens up a lot of plot potentials that were never explored by cannon.

He is often found avoiding conversation with her, I explained in another thread why I dislike Hermione and someone replied agreeing with me and linking [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2004/10/28/dyou-really-think-theyre-suited-why-hermione-is-not-the-right-girl-for-harry/]] Which I found an interesting read. That suggests the cannon evidence isn't really there an I like to imagine cannon ended just before the epilogue, that way Pottermore, cursed child and JKR interviews never existed which generally do more harm than good. I actively avoid reading any interviews or Pottermore so my head cannon can take over. For example I can't believe anyone would work with Hermione, Ron can live with her, he's used to her and rather relaxed to balance her but imagine working with her. She'd be a nightmare, I've read fics where this is a subplot that were quite good but I've heard Pottermore gives her a stellar career. She doesn't play nice with others, we know, we read the books.

***** That essay is excellent. It brought up so many points that were nagging in the back of my head but I could never pin down. I always get angry on Harry's behalf when an author pairs those two and automatically makes Harry's character jump through hoops to work better with Hermione.

Maybe the reason people like the pairing is because they like /Hermione/ and so of course she should end up with the main character?

  I just feel a Slytherin mind set would work well with Harry and it opens up a lot of plot potentials that were never explored by cannon.
#+end_quote

You get me. I was raised similarly to Harry (No cupboard under the stairs, but the constant reminders of not being wanted, scapegoating, being targeted by bigger/stronger kids in the family? All happened to me) I don't think even JKR got this particular part of Harry right, honestly. But from my experience, someone like Hermione or Ginny would not work. Even when someone's intentions are good, being too forthright can feel like an attack or an attempt to control, both of which make me dig in my heels and resist whatever the other person wants. Personally, I always felt like Harry would need someone who was a bit more flexible in their outlook on life than Hermione or Ginny are shown to be. Going by house stereotypes, a Hufflepuff would be able to provide the quiet, unconditional acceptance Harry would need and a Slytherin would have the good sense to know that browbeating Harry would be less than ideal and adapt their methods accordingly.

**** I hope things have got better for you. I was never an unhappy child, competitive, bit of a loner caused by the realisation that I was bored by the level of my friends conversational skills more than anything I loved about my sport and my time in university was people with 'chat' wit that could battle sometimes mean or bullying but the challenge made it unimportant. That whole house stereotype is why I like the pairings I listed. I think after the Chamber of Secrets Ginny's world view must have been shattered even if she only accepted it years later. I don't like how the pairing was written in cannon but extrapolating it kind of makes sense. I just prefer the idea of a Slytherin girl with a low brooding bullshit tolerance who enjoys verbal games.

***** Thanks for the kind words, things have gotten better. I loved Harry as soon as I picked up the books because I could relate to him. And he wasn't a whiny victim side character, he was the hero of the story. Hermione's heavy-handed methods -while not done maliciously- seem to me like they would actually be harmful to Harry. Even as an adult, I'll have a reaction ranging from intense annoyance to panic attacks when confronted with personalities like Hermione or Ginny. Since I relate to Harry so much, my headcanon always assumed he'd have the same tendencies.

If Harry is going to be paired with anyone, I feel like it would have to be someone who understands give and take, and would know when and how to pick their battles. Hufflepuffs are usually portrayed as the empathetic ones, and Slytherins would have the savvy to know when it's worth arguing a point and when it's best to back down and try another approach. Hermione, in particular, has too much of an "I'm right and you're going to do what I tell you." mentality.

** I actually think its a good thing to justify a pairing, just not in the way that those shippers are doing it. The writer should justify it through their writing by developing both the two characters and the relationship. Not just have the two characters announce their secret love for one another at the beginning, not by making Ginny and/or Ron evil or removing some sort of manipulations that hid their true feelings from their own self, and not by placing the two together through some magical means like soul bonds or marriage contracts (I've seen both utilized in interesting ways, but usually its just a way to put two characters together).

I wouldn't mind reading some well written H/Hr fics, so I wouldn't mind if you recommended some, but its a ship that I don't seek out on my own because of the problems I mentioned above. I really like Rorschach's Blot's fics, and he has a lot of H/Hr in his stuff. And for the record, I don't like ready any fics with romance as a central part if it isn't well developed. So while I generally prefer H/G, there are plenty of H/G fics that I have no interest in.

** I don't like Harry/Hermione because I think they're incompatible but I avoid it as much as I can because of that section of fans.

It really does go beyond defensive. It comes off more like bitterness really. Canon offended some people (evidenced by the awful Ginny bashing that occured post HBP). They felt cheated and tricked because they thought it was all swinging their way. I know the fact that it didn't was genuinely shocking to that subset of fandom.

I know some were also getting mocked back then. Even before HBP, I remember Harmonians (only a small part of a larger group, I know) not having the best reputation. They were really, really sure they knew the story and some found the resulting attitude aggravating. Post-HBP, there was some mocking of their previous confidence that did make them more defensive and angry.

At least, that's how I see the source of the militant behavior. I just think the reaction is actually horrible for the ship. The bashing fics end up turning away ambivalent fans (I ship Harry/Ginny but I will read almost any other non-canon pairings - even found love for Neville/Ginny and Harry/Tom - but I won't go near any more Harry/Hermione fics.) And the twisting of interviews like they're still striving to change canon only keeps that 'militant' reputation going.

As for Rowling's genuine support, the quotes I know of are in reference to Hermione/Ron and Harry/Hermione. In some ways, Hermione would fit better with Harry. Even in that 'either way' quote, she's referring to the experiences Harry and Hermione share that Ron disappeared for. However, Harmony fans have used these to also invalidate Harry/Ginny when Rowling has reiterated that Ginny is perfect for Harry. A little before she made the mention of Ron/Hermione/Harry (the "either way" quote), she stated that she stands by the fact that Ginny is his soulmate. Ginny and Harry being a perfect match is something she has not wavered on and all Harry/Hermione quotes I've seen have been made as an alternative to the sometimes rocky relationship of Ron/Hermione and not the 'perfect match' scenario she built around Harry/Ginny.

** Personally, I think nearly all of the HP shipping is unnecessary and silly. How many of us are even still close friends with our friends from sixth grade, let alone married to one of them?

It's generally wish fulfillment from people who are attracted to the actors in the films, I have noticed. When it isn't, it's a deliberate style choice to choose someone "different" like those OC stand ins like Susan Bones or Daphne Greengrass. Of course, an OC love interest is usually bad too, as it is frequently an authorial insert.

Long story longer, I agree with Rowling in that very little time really should be wasted on romance in a fic /set at Hogwarts/. Harry should date a bit but trying to find "the love of your life" at 15 or 16, let alone 11 or 12 like many authors do, is ludicrous.

*** It's a little different considering that the wizarding world is explicitly stated to be tiny in Britain- only one all wizarding town, everyone goes to Hogwarts for a free education, etc. When everyone in your world that is your age went to school with you, yeah you're going to date/be friends with people who knew you in school. It happens in small towns all the time.

I do agree that getting into a permanent relationship by fourth year is absurd.
