I've looked for this fic everywhere if seems like, so I figured I'd give it here a shot and see if anyone had read this story or knew where to find it. I read it a long ass time ago, pretty sure it was on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]. In it Harry was pulled to an alternate universe were he died as a baby, Neville was the BWL, and the Hogwarts aged kids had done a ritual to summon someone who was strong enough to help Neville/be his bodyguard, not thinking of the consequences of potentially summoning someone from another dimension against their will.

I remember in it Harry had two younger siblings in the new dimension and for some reason I think Hermione and Ron were younger than in Harry's world and were in the same year as his siblings. Tom Riddle existed in that world but instead of being Lord Voldemort he had decided to focus on bringing change in a political way.

Other things:

- Harry carried a miniaturized portrait of Salazar Slytherin around his neck that he'd found in that dimension and that tried to teach him how to be more like a pureblood or something

- His 'siblings' kept asking him questions about Harry, and at one point seemed to think or figure out that he was Harry and kept pestering him. Sirius and Remus knew the truth and when the siblings figured out they knew who Harry was they tried to trick them into telling them and instead Remus said something along the lines of 'Just because you want to know something doesn't mean you're entitled to that information' and basically delivered a verbal reprimand

- Harry had to follow Neville into the woods at some point to save him? or something happened and he was compelled to do something

- Snape was his assigned mentor, as his cover for being in Hogwarts was that he was something like an intern/journeyman/apprentice or whatever under Snape and he had to grade papers and even look over a class or two once

IDK man, It's been so long and it's one of those stories that I was reminded of by reading another one, and so I wanted to revisit it just to see, and then I couldn't find it. It wasn't complete, and I remember liking it at the time and it's just /bugging/ me so much that I can't find it. If anyone has any idea which fic this is/a link to read it I'd be forever grateful.

Even if not the actual fic itself if anyone has any recs for fics like it those would be appreciated too!

*** Someone found it! It's 'Stranger in a too Familiar Land' by Fyreheart. She took it down for re-write's but there's copies floating around on the web. I found one archived on Scrbd. I remembered some of the details wrong since it's been so long but mostly in regards to characters and minor details.

*** Yes, that's it! Thank you so much. And that explains why I couldn't find it, I thought that might be the case but I was hopeful. I managed to find a saved version of it online so I can re-familiarize myself with it before she posts the re-write, whenever that may be. Thank you again! :D
