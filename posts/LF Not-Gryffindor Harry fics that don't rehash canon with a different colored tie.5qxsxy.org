I want Slytherin Harry who uses cunning and tells a prefect about Granger (if at all). A Ravenclaw who recognizes the name Flamel instantly, goes, "huh," and goes back to reading. A Hufflepuff who goes to Sprout rather than charging down to save the stone. And none of his friends force him to do otherwise.

Slash, dark!Harry, crossovers and bashing are fine. No mpreg, pottercest, romance/smut driven plot, harems or genderbending please.


** But he'll still go out of his way to be best friends with Hermione right? And through her meet Neville and Ron? And band together to save the Philosopher's stone? Or are you looking for a /really/ radical different house fic?

(End of sarcasm.) Maybe try linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) or linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; The Pureblood Pretense) which might not be such good fits but are worth a go.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) Harry is a ravenclaw who is kind of dark and a bit sociopathic at times and a genius at transfiguration. Neville is the boy who lived in this fic, although Harry ends up leading the fight against Voldemort for his own reasons.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) Harry's horcrux becomes self aware and starts helping and influencing Harry. Harry is in Slytherin. It does have some canon moments, but also has a lot of original story and is currently getting even more away from canon.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
