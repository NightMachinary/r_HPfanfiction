Was thinking of something along the lines of Stephen King's “Children of the Corn”, the cults of Silent Hills (the games, in those the cults are much more varied and more well-explored than in the movies) or even “The Wicker Man”, but basically just looking for a story where Harry joins or even creates himself a cult, preferentially based on magic, blood-sacrifice or both. It could also be a more Lovecraft kind of cult, though those are admittedly much harder to get right.

The way I see it young Harry would be prime material for cultish indoctrination (if it is one that takes children that is) since he has as primary caretakers the Dursley's who are clearly negligent of him and has few, if any, social connections due to either Dudley's threats or Vernon&Petunia's lies, plus being a young child and living in what is by all accounts a small town before internet became widespread.

Alternatively, maybe he noticed his accidental magic, but when he did his classic library research of doom instead of going to the fiction section with which he had no familiarity whatsoever or the mystical section which just so happened to be there gathering dust he instead goes to the books that talk about pre-middle age history and it's societies (it should be noticed that considering the time it would take place and it's location those books would most likely be /very/ biased to the bloodier side of it).

Within those he comes across the Nordic Baserkers and the bloody eagle, the then alleged Druidic tradition of the wicker man, cannibalism practiced by both humans looking for power and the greak-god Zeus and his father Kronos, the ancient Mayan sacrifices, the catholic Middle Ages vision on witchcraft... in sum, the goriest and more murdery (though powerful) interpretations of magic.

By having Harry become colder and a bit apathetic as a consequence of him being essentially ostracized for most of his life we could easily have him become more amendable to murder and torture in a relatively realistic way, specially since as a child he would still not have a good grasp on how his actions harm others, and by having him gain some degree of control over his magic and then show it to other children to recruit them with the promise of being able of using magic too. Eventually he would settle down upon his chosen doctrine, potentially something like “the cult of the god of paradise” in Silent Hill, which wants to recreate a god through turning the city into what is essentially hell on earth in the hopes of that god making the world perfect again; or like the vague “He who walks behind the roads” of Stephen King in which the kids are lead into kill all adults in town to feed their blood and flesh to the plantations in worship of it.

Either way, by combining the made up rituals and the very muggle and either reluctant or outright unwilling participants of the sacrifices with Harry's belief in the ritual, his growing control of magic and the fact that it would happen with some frequency... he manages to make a terrible mess of the entire city. Best case scenario he manages to do some basic first-year spells, but with a lot more blood involved, worst case... well, the sky is the limit on that one, perhaps he manages to summon some “god” or extraplanar horror that rips the whole town from existence before moving on to the rest of earth, maybe he even succeeds and makes the town a dystopian paradise built and maintained through frequent ritualistic murder; maybe he jump-starts a zombie apocalypse trying to overthrow death, or maybe he screws the balance of the universe so bad that a bunch of timelines/universes start colliding or an unprecedented amount of muggleborns and magical beasts begin popping out of nowhere. Things could really go wild there.

Needless to say by the time this Harry turns eleven he will be /very/ different from his cannon counterpart.


** There's one where it's played for laughs. Basically Lily's parents were Satanists and survived to raise Harry. I can't remember the title though. I think it's a one-shot and probably not exactly what your looking for though.

**** Linkffn(10108247) and linkffn(7370842) both have the Dursleys raise Harry with the same idea going on. One is a oneshot

  Even if Lily's parents had survived the war, Dumbledore wouldn't have given Harry to them for the very same reason that the Evanses had been proud to have a witch in the family.
