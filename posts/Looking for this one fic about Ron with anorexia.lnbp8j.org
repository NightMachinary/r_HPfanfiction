#+begin_quote
  “All he had ever wanted in life was the approval of someone, anyone, and the only hope he had was from his family.” Hadrian Potter is different, unusual, and strange. He could go on and on, but he won't because it would be useless. Be quiet, be obedient, be polite, follow the rules, and always do as you're told. The rules as they are, and he will follow them, he will. When he does, maybe then he'll finally be loved. Hadrian Potter accepts this as his life, but then a letter comes.What will this change, or will it change nothing?

** The closest is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10932519/1/Can-t-Stop]]), but the group therapy is at some Muggle place, and Ron was dealing with bulimia, not anorexia.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/lnky0h/any_recs_for_fanfiction_about_eating_disorders/]] might have the fic you're searching for, though.

  Ron has always been weird about his food: eating a lot, and eating it fast. He knew he was fairly thin, but he also knew his eating would catch up to him, and he was terrified. Trigger warning for eating disorders (bulimia).
