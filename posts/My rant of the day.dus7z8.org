Does anyone else find it annoying reading a fanfic that is almost all negative until the end. I'm reading one now that been basically the bad guys winning for 200k words, and then the good win at the end by some miracle. It really gets my goat. The bad guys win every battle, have places of power, are pulling all sorts of secret assassination and tactics and good guys just kind of wonder around in circles staring at the sky. The magically the good guys all of a sudden. Win. It's just so hard reading those kinds of stories


** That's literally the entirety of books 5-7. Everything goes horribly until Harry wins by luck

** I'll take that over the protagonist humiliating his enemies at every turn and never facing any real hardship.

** Well there is a reason the phrase "Victory from the jaws of defeat‚Äù exists.People like the whole underdog, come from behind win characters. I mean, flip it around and would it be more interesting if the good guys were winning every battle and the conflict at the end was just a brief wimper as if irrelevant? Because honestly thats how many, possibly the majority, of conflicts and war usually play out, with one side overwhelmingly dominating the other.

There is also something to be said that this is 1) an easy way to increase tension artificially with subpar storytelling ability and 2) often people want to set a grim/somber mood that sets up the good guys to rally from behind.

*** I get that completely. But also feel like if the good guys are pretty useless for the whole story and the bad guys so brilliant then the whole stories makes it seem that the good guys winning is impossible and when they do win it seems too improbable to make sense

**** Indeed. If the victory at the end is only due to idiot balls glued to the villan's hands, deus ex machina and huge author-induced luck, it feels cheap rather than rewarding.

** I might have enjoyed it if the protagonists were legitimately struggling and failing, but from the sounds of things, I would have dropped the fic ages ago.

** I think what made Star Wars (the original trilogy) so satisfying was that the good guys won, but there were losses along the way. In the middle act (ESB), it looked like they were badly beaten, but then they got it together in the final act (ROTJ).

If there's one thing that nags at me about Harry Potter, it's that everything went to shit for three whole books, but somehow Harry pulls victory from his bum with the help of some obscure wandlore and a Jesus allegory.

**** I knew this was the fic you were talking about, I had the same issue with it. The same issue occurs when the good guys win all time, there isn't any tension. It just becomes a guessing game of who's gonna die or who is gonna fuck up next. I wish people could figure out how to write conflicts in which each side achieves some meaningful victories throughout.

  Harry Potter was excited to learn of the wizarding world, unfortunately he had no idea the crucible he was walking into. AU.

** That's canon, lol, Voldy was pwned two times by some retarded deus ex machina right when he was winning (shit, the 2nd time, he /won/ and had his enemies gone underground until he croaked for good due to plot no jutsu).
