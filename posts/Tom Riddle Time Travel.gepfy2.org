Does anyone know any fanfics where Tom Riddle travels to the future (instead of the usual traveling to his time). Ive read "Diablerie" on ao3 and would like something similar. I prefer slash but anything is fine.


** I don't know if you are looking for Riddle travelling into the future because you are tired of the trope where a character travels to Tom's Hogwarts years, but I know one reversing the trope and it's Riddle himself that travel to past from his death to the start of his six year.

** The closest thing I can recommend is linkffn(10673953), which is about Voldemort going back in time after winning the war and realising how hollow his victory was. Fair warning: it's abandoned.

  An odd, dark-haired man rescues Harry from the Dursleys when he's nine years old. Harry would have been thrilled if his saviour didn't claim to be a disillusioned madman come back in time to stop his other self from taking over the world. Add to that his apparent belief that Harry is important to his plans, and things become just a little bit complicated.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** Have you read Pygmalion by Colubrina?

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11248015/1/Pygmalion]]

It's Tom/Hermione instead of slash, but Colubrina is such an excellent writer that it's worth reading anyway. It's definitely dark!fic not redeemed Tom if that's your preference, but the relationship is solid and legitimately loving in the face of all the fucked up shit that Riddle leads Hermione and her friends into.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.
