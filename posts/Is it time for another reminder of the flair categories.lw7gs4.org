Three posts in the last hour, from three different users, have had the wrong flair. Using the proper flair is most likely to get you the response you seek.

- *Recommendation* means that you read a story that is so good, you want to share it with others.
- If you are the one who wrote the story you want to recommend, it's *Self Promotion*.
- *Request* means that you want recommendations for fics that fit certain parameters. You give the parameters, we try to help you out.
- *What's that fic?* is when you want to find a story you read or heard about before, and only have a few details to go by. You hope that one of us recognizes it and can give you the author/title/link.
- If it's about this sub, such as this post, it's *Meta*.


** The flair instructions are literally right above where you pick the flair. I don't think reminding people is going to help at this point.

** All we can really do is report the post and point the OPs to the sidebar. It happens everywhere. Users are lazy.
