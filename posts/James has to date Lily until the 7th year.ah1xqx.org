Hey guys. Really short question. Does any of you know a fanfiction where James's parents tell him he has time until 7th year to make Lily fall in love with him or they will guide him towards another girl...then Lily notices James but he says it's too late (smth like that)....

Also, please share a good fanfiction with HJP. It just has to be decently written (I liked the way Delanda East was written, also Deprived by The Crimson Lord was good, Your Love is all the magic I need, Imprisoned Realm was also good...ish) and fewer cliches please....I just wanna read more fanfiction (the spark was reignited) but I feel like I've read them all and don't know what to search for.

With whom do you want to see Harry paired with? Time travel, fix-it, powerwank, family feels, romance, harems? Which parts of the stories you mentioned did you enjoy and what do you want to avoid in the future.

*** That's the thing.....I don't really mind any pair....maybe not so much Ginevra (sorry, I hate her character), Hermione, Luna or the Patils...it can be a gender bent character (female Tommy Riddle for example), Bellatrix, Andromeda, even Fleur's mother or any MILF really, an OC character etc. Time travel would be nice, though not necessary (can be even universe, reality etc. travel). Fix-it would be ... ok, I'm neutral towards such themes. Romance is again a neutral theme, it can be present, it may not be present, that's up to you. If you know any good harem story that doesn't involve Hermione, Ginevra, Loona, the Patils would be good. Otherwise no. Also, a story where Longbottom is not friend with Harry would be awesome....many of you may love them, but I despise about 6 characters: Dumbledore (Bitchdoore bashing is so common for a good reason), Molly (she's a freaking cow if honest), Ginevra, Longbottom (he's a very weak, cowardly character for most of his life), Ronald "The Gay Sack" (he's a nasty little fucker with jealousy to the moon and a very toxic personality) and Hermione "Mudblood Know-It-All" (she's so infuriating sometimes, her bossy attitude is just bad and she always made me think of spies). Also Lupin....I really dislike him most of all for the fact that he ran aways from his child....

â€‹

I enjoyed the absence of cliches (the later chapters of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6261551/7/Adopted-Life-Dept]] are just painful to read, Harry gets a stuff, the characters talk like they're part of an essay of a 5th grade student who wrote his first or second mini-essay), the realism (for a HP fanfic :) ). But most of all, the fact that you want to read it to the end.

**** Have you read "Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass"? It's premise is Tonks being forced to repeat the 5th year due to an accident during the DoM battle. The pairing is Harry/Tonks, but it does not get much screentime outside of one chapter. Mostly a good depiction of the struggles a time traveller faces without either completely dismissing them or drowning in angst.

The story has Hermione in a significant role but has an original interpretation of her. It takes everything that is likeable about her (the steadfast loyalty, the genuine friendship) and keeps that while making her a deeper character and not just a "study and obey the rules" cardboard cutout.

***** Nice, though I like them a bit longer (this way, it's like a book)...though Hermione as a better character? Hm...a theme that I got curious about...is Bellatrix's insanity....it's too much, even after a stay in Azkaban....I know she chose that life, but I do enjoy a fanfiction where she's being healed....not immediately, but in time...

****** Hermione loses her job as walking exposition and is made into a real character who is somewhere between hero and supportive character while still maintaining the compassion shown with Buckbeak's case and SPEW. And Tonks makes her lose her faith in authority.

If you like Bellatrix, perhaps "All according to plan" would be down your alley. It's an AU where Bellatrix, at age 13/14 from an AU (different Grindelwald war, no Voldemort) is thrown into the canon world. She is there to kick ass and chew bubblegum but is out of gum. Harry and Hermione are along for the ride, but so far I can't really say where it is going. Updates are pretty frequent and long (last one was 11k).

Have you read Wind Shear and Stepping back? They are somewhat controversial around here, but might be something you like.
