It was the end of a long and stressful week and Harry was tired and ready to head home. Why did the Auror have to bring in the suspects now? “Alright, good job” said Harry, “Let's go see them.” “Right this way” said the man. The Head Auror walked down the hall and looked through the wards into the holding cell. His eyes widened. “Ron? George?”

My idea is that in OOTP, Fred and George mentioned that they used illegal substances in their products, so in the future Eon and George are arrested for continuing to use them and as Head Auror, Harry has to deal with it. Just a fun little prompt.


** It would be very interesting to see the silent, mental struggle between harry and ron and geroge. The brothers switching between defiance and embrassement all while harry is trying to figure out if he can really enforce the law or if he has become corrupt.

*** Likely not a good defense to say they're not prohibited; if they're getting arrested they're definitely restricted substances they're not supposed to be using lmao. Legal would work on justification and would probably have an excellent time swaying the jury as they'd be hard-pressed to find someone wizarding who don't know the Weasley's.

**** It could work since it depends on the kind of restrictions placed on a substance. It could be illegal for private use but legal for business use. Or, just illegal in certain amounts or grades.

For example, In food processing, some preservatives can double as ingredients for explosives in certain amounts. This is why some food agencies (at least in my country) take samples for testing the concentration of these amounts.

** This depends on seriousness of the offences. If it is a slap on the wrist kind of thing, then Harry could have a bit fun, toy with 'em, maybe hold them in a cell over night, let them sweat a little, before making them pay a nominal fine and give out a warning.

However, if it is a serious matter (potential imprisonment in Azkaban, snapping wands, business crippling/ending fines) then I think Harry would have to step aside and not be involved in the case. There would be a clear conflict of interest and his ability to be impartial would be in question.

*** Or Harry and Minister of Magic Hermione throw around their reputation and money and change the punishment to a slap on the wrist from lifetime in Azkaban.

Could be a cool premise. Their actions tegarding Ron become a catalyst that turns the new goverment into a corrupt breucratic nightmare worse than the previous one. Their kids grow to be as spoiled as Draco Malfoy while families like Malfoys become poorer and poorer until they become the new Weasleys. A few generations later Potters, Weasleys, Grangers and a few others are the new sacred twenty eight and rule the wizarding britain from the backstage like the old purebloods did.

*** "You've spent a month investigating contraband venomous tentacula seeds?"

It's kind of like, "really, this is the best use of your time," but then I remembered that Devil's Snare was used to kill Broderick Bode in St. Mungos.

Venomous tentacula "expels venom", has deadly spikes, secretes otherwise dangerous juices, etc. Sprout even lets students swear when it tries to eat them. It seems, on the whole, more dangerous than Snare.

Still, though, unless it's used to kill someone, it's probably not for the Auror Office.

And then one would think that a reputable business, one in which the Head Auror is/was an investor, would have the proper clearances to use otherwise contraband materials.

** it would be interesting to see a fic where both ron and george get community service...

they try and serve their sentence in a relatively unpopulated area, where there are little to no weasleys or potters to run into..

but their family and extended family is so large, that they inevitably keep getting found..

​

George and Ron are handpicking dragon droppings at a dragon reserve in England (thank god Charlie was on Romania).

"Mr Weasley...??? Oh hey Mr... Weasleys???" Scorpious Malfoy finds two redheads at the Dragon Reserve. He has been crazy about dragons since he was 5 and his dad told him that 'Draco' meant dragon.

Finally, in his second year, his friend Albus' second oldest uncle finagled a permit for him and Albus to see dragons in England...

George and Ron look at each other, shaking their heads, they know if Scorpious is here, Albus won't be too far behind, and they are too young to be here alone...

Sure enough they hear "Uncle George!!! Uncle Ron!! I didn't know you wanted to see Dragons too!" They close their eyes, for the adult to speak, their embarrassment at peak already.

"Hey Guys!!! I didn't know my industrious brothers wanted to clean up the reserve before their favorite sisters' child comes to see it... How nice. Albus, quick, take your brand new phone out and lets take that facie photo you love to take!! Make sure Uncle Ron and Uncle George's outfits are captured."

"MOM!!!! It's called a selfie, not a facie. Smile you all!!!"
