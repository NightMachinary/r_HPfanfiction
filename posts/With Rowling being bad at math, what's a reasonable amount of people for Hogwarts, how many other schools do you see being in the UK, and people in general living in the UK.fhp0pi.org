Living in the UK that are magical, I mean, or squibs, or other creatures.

I always imagined that there were more schools outside of Hogwarts, in the UK, it was just that Hogwarts the most acclaimed so we never heard of the other ones in the UK.

Added to the fact the ones that live in the UK, who don't want their children homeschooled, or who decide on an out of area school to send their children.

We only hear of two local places to visit/shop, Knockturn Alley and Diagon Alley, but that doesn't mean those are the only two places, I'm sure there are way more than that, but because we followed Harry's point of view, we visited or mentioned those places.

Also it's been highly stated that Rowling is simply put: Bad at math, there could be way more people than what we originally thought, also remember that Voldemort and his followers probably killed quite a few people during the war, which could explain why Harry's year was so small. Other years before Harry were also probably small, we just didn't hear about it.

I always thought that there were two or three smaller schools in the UK not just counting Hogwarts, and Hogwarts was just the more acclaimed one.

How many shopping places do you imagine there being? How many parents who don't follow Dumbledore do you think could take their kids to other schools, in the UK and out of it, as well as having some of their kids homeschooled?


** I just made a post on the wizarding population thread, though this is more of what I was talking about.

Teachers only have so much time in a day, and can only handle so many students. That places an upper limit on the number of students that Hogwarts can educate at any given moment.

Assuming that every teacher works a full day teaching a combination of normal 45 minute classes and longer double classes that last 1.5 hours they probably teach 4 or 5 classes a day. According to canon, students usually only have a subject once a week. 20-25 classes, per week per teacher at maximum, a single teacher can ideally cover one class a week for each year, for each house. In canon, most classes are joint between multiple houses, though I think that is probably more of a result of smaller class sizes due to the various wars.

Hogwarts grew out of Medieval era education practices and apprenticeships, so will probably tend towards smaller class sizes for most classes. I don't expect to see any college lecture halls filled with 150 Gryffindor first years, for many reasons. So based on a class cap size of 20-40. (Though I would tend towards 20. Supervising 40 eleven-year-olds swinging around deadly weapons sounds horrifying) and allowing for those class sizes to correlate with a single house for a given year, the maximum Hogwarts student population without increasing teachers is 560-1120. Obviously, student population in Harry's time will be smaller do to war caused population downturn, and some students will leave after their OWLS, but this is a good baseline.

For other schools, I think that a ministry sponsored public school makes sense. One where students would floo in for the day and return home when they were done. I would expect at least the same population for this school. (Obviously nothing in canon supports this other than the mismatch in JK Rowling's population math. If such a similarly sized public school existed I would certainly expect inter-school quidditch matches) Then, and I do feel like this fits in with canon, there would be a number of children that are home-schooled, probably 100-200 given the attitude of people in the magical community. I'd also expect to see a number of small group classes, basically just joint tutoring sessions with like 20 students and one or two tutors, maybe with parents teaching on occasion the things that they know well. Probably some overlap with the home-schoolers. I could even one or two other small Hogwarts lite type schools, with only like 200 students or so.

Maximum student population based on this is probably 1500-2000. Reflecting a wizarding population of around 20,000.

I think that the lack of muggle awareness is overplayed in canon given that Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade are the /only/ all wizard spaces. I think that most witches and wizards live in small muggle villages that most Americans don't properly comprehend. The kind where there are no chain stores at all, just a local pub, a local grocer, etc. In that sense those villages are almost still like what witches and wizards are expecting, no overwhelming modernity. As such, most of them probably get their food from muggles and only go to Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade for wizard made goods. I would also agree with you of other offshoots from Diagon Alley, probably including a residential section with some townhomes or flats.

the ministy willing to spend more money upkeeping more buildings and hiring more teachers when hogwarts has plenty of space? they weren't even willing to help hire a new teacher for history, letting a ghost that doesn't need paying stay there

**** Fanon. In canon Hogwarts is a private institution. The ministry interfering in Hogwarts business is a big deal. They had no control over anything, budget, hiring practices or otherwise until they passed ministry decrees giving them the power to interfere. There is no canon indication of why Binns is left on staff, especially not a funding issue.

Space wise, Hogwarts does have a number of abandoned classrooms, so it certainly has room for more students if they were to hire more teachers for each class. An argument could be made that the limitation on the student body size is due to the Defense Professor curse. Hogwarts struggles to find one new Defense Professor every year, of they expanded the number of students to where they would need more than one professor for each subject they would have a near impossible time filling both slots.

Regardless, the idea of a public school, while I feel to be justified, is the weakest of the ideas I had for sure. A few smaller schools with teachers pulling double duty on multiple subjects as well as small tutoring groups for other students are far more likely. (Though who is to say those small schools don't receive public funding)

***** said defense curse is less than a century of age, and probably gets destroyed along with it's creator when voldie finally kicks the bucket, and yeah them interfering with hogwarts is big news but still, i doubt with how the pureblood ideology is they'd ever allow support for other schools in general. it's probably hogwarts for general schooling, then apprenticeships for anything more

** when I wrote my fanfic I put roughly 44 people in each year adding a few OC's for the times for when Harry was distracted during the sorting remember the wars would have lowered wizarding population severely

** I'd say Ã© other schools plus Hogwarts at least. In some fanfics there is a school that only goes OWLS. I would assume that there might be a school for just Newts. There might be a school similar to Hogwarts but maybe not as highly regarded. I would assume maybe 20 people per house per year used to be the standard. The British isles had what 2 dark Lord's in a generation of so?
