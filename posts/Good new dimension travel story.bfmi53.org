** I tried to read it, but...

The dude doesn't know the difference between than and then, and it's absolutely intolerable with how frequently he uses it incorrectly.

Plus, it's an AU Harry going to a different AU, and I didn't like HP's character or the story of how he ended up where he was.

0/5.

  Harry sacrificed everything to kill the Dark Lord. He sacrificed more to kill the next one. And the next. And the next. By the end, he had nothing left to give, and nothing left to win. Burdened by failure, he's thrown into a new world with familiar faces and unfamiliar personalities, and must fight to survive. AU, Dimension Travel, Graphic Violence.
