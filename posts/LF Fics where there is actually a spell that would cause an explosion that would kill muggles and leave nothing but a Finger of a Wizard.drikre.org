  instead of the ridiculous event in Canon where there was very little blood, no gore, and any forensic team would have been able to tell you that Pettigrew hadn't died.

You know it pasted a dozen Muggles, right? There would have been an abundance of blood and gore. The finger was probably the only part they could identify, with teeth out of the question and parts scattered about. Confringo is canonically the spell used, and it can make a massive explosion, particularly if it /actually/ ruptures a gas main, as the Ministry told the Muggles.

** My thought is that leaving the finger behind is very specific.

Where do you get this from? Maybe it's been a while since I last read POA, but I don't think it's ever stated there was little blood and no gore. Even if Pettigrew himself wasn't splattered, surely the 12 muggles killed would have created enough gore to make up for him?

This isn't a police show, it's not like the Ministry of Magic would come down and analyze the DNA to find out Pettigrew isn't dead. They would find the finger, perform some spell to determine its owner, and assume the rest of Pettigrew was destroyed in the explosion. Maybe it isn't the best plan ever, but what Pettigrew did was certainly not a "moronic hack job,"
