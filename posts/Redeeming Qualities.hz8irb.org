What are the best redeeming qualities for a highly morally ambitious character to have?

Essentially I want to make them likeable or for the reader to root for them - even though they are the scum of the earth.

All opinions are welcome. :P


** They have to have one morale line that they will never cross, that most people agree on.

Or

They have a strong sense if loyalty and friendship, but it's hard to earn.

** Good goals, bad method. Have you ever watched the Rock (1996)? They're trying to do the right thing but are either misled/confused or plain desperate.

Charming, polite, well-mannered. Artemis Fowl/Hans Gruber.

** So an important question in this is are they the main character or not?

If it's the MC and told from their point if view imo it's best to take baby steps towards evil (ex first learn dark magic to better protect themselves, then use some of what they learned in practice for self defense then revenge and each time it's easier etc). Also, make sure they have people they would kill to protect, this is really useful since it makes the character seem self less. An example would be retaliating against Neville or Luna's bullies in a very cruel way. Cruelty in defense of others comes across as less cruel. Also give them a line they would never cross (rape is a good example, many people consider it worse than murder).

If it's not MC, I would go about it a little differently. Paint the character first as a terrible, terrible villian. Have characters act like they are the root of all evil. Then have your MC slowly explore the motivations, why is the villian doing this? Contrast him with someone "good" who had similar ideas (Dumbledore is actually great for this with his Grindelwald connection). Let the MC figure out the "true" motives of the villian. Give a driving force that's relatable (death of a loved one maybe). Take the world from black and white to shades of gray by making it clear that the "good guys" aren't always good. Don't make the villian the "righteous" type. They should have no illusions that what they stand for is good, however, they should also suggest that the "good" side does have those illusions.

Hope this helped! Personally I really dislike self-righteous characters, so I find characters who are willing to take up the mantle of villian really fascinating. They will do anything to achieve their goals and have no illusions about themselves. Its not fanfiction, but I think two really great examples of this type of character can be seen in the web novels "Worm" and "A Practical Guide to Evil." The MCs are arguably more morally gray than evil, but it's very well explored.

*** Thank you!! Very much appreciated.

It is the MC that I going for here.

I really like the idea of the MC taking the steps towards evil but not realising until it too late Makes it seem realistic that way.

I'll have a look at your recommendations :)

**** I'm actually a huge fan of that approach. I've seen it work really well two ways: either driven by others or by themself. In the first, there is typically a mentor or group pushing their boundaries. They might be doing evil for acceptance or to protect the group. The other is what I have somewhat termed pragmatic evil. The MC typically has a goal or something that they continue to work towards that bushes their boundaries. This works well in revenge and vigilantism.

Fair warning that they are both rather long. However, I think you can get a good feel for the characterization without reading the entirety of either. I haven't finished either of them since they got a little heavy and I needed to take a break to read fluffy things. That's how you know it's good. I want to say I was at arc 11 of Worm and had finished Volume 2 of 5 of A Practical Guide to Evil.

An HP fanfic with a pretty evil protagonist you could check out The Rise of a Dark Lord by LittleMissXanda. Different approach then I suggested, but a pretty dark protagonist (torture for fun by 4th year).

Jeez the whole writing seems like it's fun, but no one really mentions the amount of research that goes into it and how hard it is to NOT make it a Gary Stu.

** Give them some pet the dogs moments, if it is realistically viable in the story make a villain (doesn't need to actively play a part, just a matter of inventing a not completely irrelevant reason for the characters discuss the subject If putting the villain in the story would be infeasible) that is monstrously worse them the character so that he doesn't seem quite as bad in comparison and give your character a method and reason for his actions.

Fex: Voldemort fears death because when he was 12 years old he was forced to live in the ruins of the orphanage for three days with a broken leg during the London Blitz with a bomb right in front of him perfectly capable of exploding. All the other orphans had been evacuated before, but Tom's room was far away, he didn't hear the alarms and Miss Cole deliberately didn't look for him hopping he would die. Thus his hatred for muggles was born of the terrifying experience with their destructive capabilities and he hoped to take control of the wizarding world so to implement measures that would be able to protect them from muggle wars.

His hatred of Dumbledore came about because he blamed him for him having almost died as it was Dumbledore who refused to let him pass the summer at Hogwarts. The Horcruxies were created later because of the trauma of the experience leading Tom to hastily sacrifice parts of his soul for immortality without knowing that it took away portions of his sanity and empathy too.

Tom during his rise in power kept a soft spot for those he saw as kindred spirits, such as Barty Crouch Jr. who suffered emotional abuse at the hands of his father who never wanted a child and always resented him because taking the time to be a father took time away from his work.

*** Interesting perspective. Though, I often see the same thing done in movies. Something traumatic happens to the child when s/he is younger and this is why s/he is the way they are now. And I get why. We are all shaped by our childhood experience blah blah psychology. lol. However, I would like to figure out a way a MC becomes 'evil' without the childhood angst.

Also, I want to stray away from the usual traumatic experience such as rape, solider with severe ptsd, parents/spouse were murdered or Stockholm syndrome.

HELP!!

**** The only other thing I can think that would help is to change the character's personality and interactions with others to the point that they come up as either comically oblivious to their own evilness (“What do you mean canibalism is wrong? The person is already dead, the meat is in perfect condition and it tastes like chicken. Really, your ridiculous notions about wasting food make no sense, there are kids dying of hunger that would love to have /anything * to eat!), a super well-mannered monster (Hannibal Lecter is a good example), having a blue-orange morality, being a prisoner of his own fate (“look, I don't actually want to kill all these people, but the thing is: I have no control, there is this *thing/ inside of me that just won't let me stop! One moment I am relaxing in my home and the next I wake covered in blood with half-eaten corpses around me!”) or make it justified in a “the end justifies the means” and make it in a relatively reasonable way (“Do you think I *WANT* to waste my time babysitting those filthy muggles!? I would want /nothing/ more than to let the vermin kill each other! But they just had to invent weapons that can /WIPE OUT ENTIRE CITIES IN SECONDS/!!! If I don't take control they will salt the earth, kill all animals, boil oceans and pollute the very air to the point it is more smoke than oxygen! I am saving our world and no one have the courtesy of even saying /thanks/”)

***** LOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAADDDDDSSSSS.

It can be physical. When he's not torturing others, he's torturing himself with his tools.

It can be mental, forcing himself to forget all the pain from long ago, which only makes it worse because he doesn't remember what it was, so the past pains kinda mutate into something scary and unknown. It's easy to deal with a memory of a terrible aunt and uncle, but if you don't remember who they were, and only remember that they were BAD, your vision of them will skew. Fear of the unknown is greater than fear of the known.

It can be out of his control, but still kind of from him (e.g nightmares, hallucination, depression).
