Hi everyone!

I just started participating in the National Novel Writing Month. I'm having a hard time finding people who are writing (Harry Potter) fanfiction in particular on the site. If anyone is currently participating, please add me on the NaNoWriMo site. My username is also CypressWand on there.


** I'll add you when I'm back home from work!

** Quite a few people on HPFanFicTalk (HPFT) all do NaNo every year and they have great support systems and their forums in general are great.

***** I get that. I'm in my second year at college and it's the main reason why I've been neglecting my fic. The main reason for me to do NaNoWriMo this year is because I need the motivation to finish the story once and for all (I'm 522k deep and nearing the end. It would be a shame not to finish it now.)

** Hi! I joined the NaNoMo this year for the first time, I'm kind of using the challenge to continue my HP fic too. Unfortunately, I've been stuck for a couple of months and I'm having a hard time plotting and moving forward. Let's help each other!
