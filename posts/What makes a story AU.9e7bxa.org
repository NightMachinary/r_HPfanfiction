I don't understand what makes a Harry Potter fanfiction an Alternate Universe.

I'm confused because I thought that even the smallest difference from canon would make an Alternate Universe, and if that is the case everything is AU.

Is the norm subjective or is there a rule on what stories are considered AUs

Please explain what makes a story an Alternate Universe.


** There are tons of stories which are 'canon-compliant' - that is, where they do not contradict canon but build within the spaces it leaves (sometimes excepting things like the epilogue, pottermore, or cursed child, depending on the writer). There are a LOT of spaces in canon that don't require an AU. Any H/G stories set between DH and the epilogue, pretty much anything about Harry's children, marauders-era, the war against Grindelwald (though with Fantastic Beasts that one is becoming AU), founders-era, I could really go on for pages listing potential canon-compliant spaces.

​

AUs can range from slight deviations -i.e. if Harry hadn't argued when the hat said Slytherin - to major variations - i.e. if Voldemort won the first war - to full on everything-is-different.

In general even a slight variation, given enough time, leads to a completely different universe state, assuming the writer is thinking it through. (Which most aren't, leading to tons of clinging-to-canon stories with more potential than they ever manage to realize.)

​

I think there's also the older(?) definition of AU, which was where the characters and personalities were kept but the setting changed, but I don't have any personal experience with such. I've mostly seen it in crossovers (Marvel characters in a Hogwarts AU, or the like).

*** The definition you cite isn't the usually-agreed-upon one, I'm afraid, though /some/ people use the term "AU" like that. What you describe is usually what's known as a For-What-Of-A-Nail or a single-point-of-departure.

An AU is when the universe is changed in some way, not as a result of a what-if scenario from the plot, but in a deeper fashion. If Harry let the Hat put him in Slytherin, it's want-of-a-nail; if there is, and always was, a fifth Hogwarts House, say, then it's an AU. (There's some debate over whether /technically/ want-of-a-nail fics with a /distant/ point of departure, like "Salazar Slytherin didn't betray the other Founders", counts as an AU; most people would say yes for simplicity's sake.)

** All fanfiction changes things. The difference between regular fanfiction and an AU is the timing of those changes. If the changes occur before the start of the story - i.e. they form a part of the set-up of the world - then it's an AU. If the changes occur /during/ the story, then that's just regular fanfiction divergence.

So, for example, let's say you're writing a post-OotP fic covering Harry's sixth year:

If you say "Sirius didn't die in the Department of Mysteries", that's an AU, because the change you've made is part of the backstory of your fic. Essentially your fic is taking place in an "alternative universe" where Sirius didn't die.

If, on the other hand, you write different 6th year events to those that occurred in HBP, that's not an AU, it's just regular fanfiction. It's the same universe as canon at the time the story starts.

Most commonly, fics which advertise themselves as AUs will have a lot of changes to the fundamental set-up of the world, from the way magic works to the political set-up.

*** Hm... I think there are kind of two ways to look at it. Personally, I would still consider your example of an AU to be a single-point-of-departure, just one that picks after the point of departure. An actual AU would be something where, say, magic altogether works differently, or the Wizarding World is a monarchy.

You could say that I'm going one step further in the "the change must be in the backstory": for me, it has to be in the backstory or setup of the /books/.

**** This is largely a question of how precise you want to be with classification: the example you're talking about is sometimes termed a "For Want of a Nail" fic (mainly used in the TVTropes rec pages), wherein one thing is changed about the plot and the cascading effects lead to a different story. It's still under the umbrella of an AU story, but I'll agree that it differs from the massive AUs you see that change the fabric of the HP universe.

I'd like to see us using the FWoaN terminology more, because I appreciate the distinction, but I don't think it's likely :/

** It's definitely fairly subjective. Some people use your definition for an AU, where a minor change counts as one (although there are still canon-compliant stories that take place during the gaps between canon, during a time we don't see, etc.). I disagree with that definition. There are also "For Want of a Nail"-type fics, where there is one change in the story/setup that is the catalyst for other changes in the story, but otherwise is canon. Others, including myself, would only consider a story AU if it changes something fundamental about the setting, i.e. a "Voldemort Won" story, or a different magic system.

** Dialects are fandom-specific.

In many other fandoms, a fic that extrapolated changes to canon from a single or a small number of clearly defined points of divergence but otherwise tried to remain consistent with the canon setting as much as possible---keeping the parts of canon not affected by the explicit points of divergence unchanged---would be labelled /Divergence/; whereas a fic that arbitrarily rewrote parts of the setting would be called an /Alternative Universe/.

This distinction never caught on in the HP fandom: any fic that wouldn't fit into canon story line is labelled AU, and the only fics that aren't are those that fill in blanks in canon, such as one depicting Harry and Ginny going on a date during HBP.

I don't know why it happened this way.

** Very subjective, depending on how far the changes go. I generally think that anything that follows canon up to a point and changes it from there is just Canon Divergence, but if the changes are far enough back, like in Riddle's or Dumbledore's era, you could consider the resulting world an Alternate Universe.

For me, an AU needs an impacting enough difference that canon just could not gave gone that way, like different mechanics or significantly different characterizations (like good!Riddle or evil!Harry). But [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Alternate%20Universe][ao3 has some interesting subtags under Alternate Universe that are worth considering.]]

** I think you're right that all fanfic is AU. Every deviant from canon would be considered AU. I would think of it like a scale. 1, being more canon and 10 being extremely AU. And if a story advertises itself as AU, it's probably closer to the 10 on the scale. Just like what makes it a light!Harry vs Gray!Harry vs Dark!Harry. Some authors may call their character Dark!Harry, but relative to another author's Dark!Harry, it's more of a Gray!Harry.

​

I personally think of the AU stories as having something in the setting change vs the actions. For example, a setting where Sirius lives would make it AU. The subsequent action of Harry living with Sirius wouldn't be another deviance from canon, but part of this AU.

​

If Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini hook up, I don't see this as AU, because their sexuality was never specified in canon. Thus, the canon setting has not changed. Them hooking up is a subsequent action of a setting that is canon compliant. This would fall towards the one on the scale of 1-10.

*** I like your scale concept but arent you contradicting yourself? You say: „All fanfic is AU“ and „If Nott and Blaise hook up i dont see it as AU“?
