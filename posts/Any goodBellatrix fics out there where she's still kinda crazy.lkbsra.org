Basically the title. Too often do I read a fic where Bellatrix is redeemed and turns into a perfectly normal person. Those stories can be great and all but I've been inspired by [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23163979/chapters/55441693#workskin][Harry Potter and the Aunt from Hell]] and now I just want a good story where she's with the good guys (or at least against Voldemort) but still keeps some of her insanity, which I think could be a very interesting character dynamic to explore. If anyone could recommend any fics like that, then that would be awesome!


** This is very much the case in linkffn(A Life Twice Lived). Bellatrix was compulsed into serving Voldemort by her marriage contract, buy being freed from that shortly after Voldemort's death does /not/ make her a good person. Her first reaction upon meeting Harry is wanting to experiment if him, and she's been staying at Malfoy Manor for over a decade because Lucius is too scared to ask her to leave

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco

***** The implication is more it's reincarnation.

At first, the "male" Draco personality is dominant, but as she grows up, it becomes apparent that Dancia is her own person and can basically access Draco's memories. Draco's memories certainly shaped her, but she's her own person.

One scene makes it pretty clear when there's an emergency and while Draco Malfoy, retired badass auror could deal with it, 11 year old Dancia Malfoy freaks out. Because they're /different people/, even if the same soul.

** I've seen a few that call it (some variation of) "The Black Insanity". Unfortunately, I can't remember the titles of any of them. I know there is at least one out there that discusses all three sisters and Sirius carefully warning Harry about putting himself in their cross-hairs due to the risks involved with mentioning their Insanity. I think there is an ongoing one that has Harry being named Lord Black at Sirius' will reading and getting a letter that forwards 2 letters written to Sirius by Narcissa and Bella before their weddings and asking him to annul their marriages... Sirius couldn't due to never formally getting the Lordship, so Harry does at his first opportunity and Bella shows that she is still crazy, but not so much evil.

** Ok, so if you're into Bellatrix fics you've probably already read Delenda Est, but I'm throwing it out there anyway because it does fit the question - she's definitely on Harry's side and her insanity is less "murder murder crucio" and more quiet sociopathic/psychopathic, but I definitely think it still counts.

Next, I'm going to recommend one that I /think/ is going to go that way but I'm not sure because it's relatively near the beginning. Don't read this if you need your WIPs to update at any kind of steady pace, because this author is one of those that has like 15 WIPs at once and has no issues putting one they're not feeling on hiatus for a long while, so while this one is updating right now, it may randomly pause for 8 months while the author feverishly updates his Anakin Skywalker time travel or whatever (I follow because I like every single story this author has written so I'm happy with whatever is currently updating, but if you're not into Star Wars you'll be a sad potato). Anyway, Deadly Belladonna by AppoApples is a story where 49 year old Harry, who's quite happy with his life and has made peace with it, is non-consensually sent back in time by Andromeda because tldr Black Madness. She sends him with a potion that will supposedly help Bellatrix not be gibbering and Harry uses it, and we're still in the stages of Bellatrix not understanding what's going on, but it looks like while she'll be sane-er, she's definitely not all there and I'm not sure she ever will be.

  Forty-nine year old Harry was rather content with his life, but when his lover, Andromeda finds a way to rewrite the war, well, let's just say that the Dark Lord was not expecting to deal with two Harry Potter's and the loss of his favourite lieutenant.

** I remember reading a story where Bellatrix was saved by Remus at some point in Hogwarts (possibly from a group of junior DE's) and later got married to Remus. She was kind of a mad scientist type character: she was good, but she was definitely not all there.

I don't remember the name of the story, or really anything else about it, but maybe someone here will.

** Try The Plan series ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1466644]]) - an AU Bellatrix, age 13 and already very chaotic and slightly crazy, accidentally teleports herself into third year of canon and decides to revive the house of black, kill the dark lord for making canon Bella a raving lunatic, and generally just have fun.

Very good world building, wonderful characters, frequently updated and absolutely worth a look.

*** I have two problems with these ones :

1. way too much internal monologues. For 1 second IRL, we have like 20 seconds of internal rambling, for every character.
2. Bella is always right, even when she's wrong. At one time, she cheated on Hermione but apparently she's not wrong to do that, because she thinks social norms are stupid and it's almost if the writer said Hermione was wrong to make a fuss of it. And so she never really reflects on herself because she always has the moral high ground. She never care therefore she is right to do everything she wants.

and also. All the intelligent character have the exact same opinion on the same matters. It really sends a "intelligent-good-guys/dumb-bad-guys" vibe

**** The internal monologue just kills me. I love the worldbuilding but please put it at appropriate times and don't give me the character's life story and the history of socialism in between two sentences of a conversation...

I feel like this has gotten significantly worse over time. The first book had lots of internal monologue but things kinda happened and the plot (as much as it has one) moved on. Now we have the Tournament arc and so far it's been like 30k words on the day of the First Task before the Task even started and none of it was really relevant for anything... And did we really need an entire chapter each to introduce the characters who participate in the First Task?

Sorry for the rant.

**** To be fair, canon also had something of the "intelligent-good-guys/dumb-bad-guys" going on. Looked at objectively, every single one of Voldemort's plans are moronic on the face of 'em. He's supposed to be this powerful, cunning, strategic thinker, but since this at least starts out for children he comes across more as Gargamel than Killmonger.

***** Agreed, but in this case it is more "We come from extremely varied backgrounds but we all have the exact same conclusion on one particular and precise topic. And we treat anyone who dare to disagree like fricking idiots because, surprise, they happen to be fricking idiots" except Dumbledore who is more a backward-looking stubborn old man than a fool.

In canon, the good guys agree on the same principles, but not necessarily on the same things, like Molly and Sirius.

*** I hate you for recommending this.

Such amazing worldbuilding and characters, such a boring and meandering story.

Literally 1 million words between third year and fourth year(which is still not done yet)

How could someone pad their stories to this extent I will never understand

** I'd rep my own fic here because that's sort of where it's heading, but I'm still in the early phases of writing it and haven't posted much yet.

But for reference, my fic is going to be more of a forced relationship between crazy Bellatrix and Ginny Weasley that turns into a slightly mentor-mentee style relationship. Nothing romantic between them in the slightest, and Bellatrix will have some awesome freak-outs at inconvenient times that put Ginny in a bind. It's fun to write so far.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
