Everyone tries to make Bellatrix all sexy-crazy because the actress looked good. But in book canon she doesn't look so great anymore after Azkaban, she's in her late 40's, she's completely nuts, she's from an old, privileged family and probably never worked a day in her life besides torturing people for Voldemort, and she seems to have some sort of obsession with babies.

So... anyone got any entitled, Karen-style or [[/r/JUSTNOMIL]] Bellas?

Edited to add: yes, Bellatrix is boomer-aged, though I don't know if England uses the same terms for generations. She was born in 1951.


** That's a great point from canon that I often felt people misremembered. Bellatrix /wasn't/ sexy! She was a crazy middle aged lady with maaayybe a stalker crush on Voldemort but more likely a religious cult leader fixation on him. She was like her from Misery with magic powers and less restraint.

***** Delphini is actually the one piece of "canon" from that play I sort of like/accept.

Of course, in my head she was conceived as a sacrifice and/or potions ingredients.

Think about it, we already saw Voldemort use bone of the father, flesh of the servant and blood of the enemy. There's got to be some super-powerful potions or rituals out there that use parts of your firstborn, right? Especially since firstborns are already referred to in muggle fairy tales like Rumpelstiltskin and even in the bible. Signing away your firstborn is a joke phrase used when people sign something without looking at it or when people drive a hard bargain.

So Voldemort obviously doesn't need an heir, since he plans on living forever. But he needs to have his own kid to kill or chop parts off so he can get stronger or achieve something else he wants. Naturally, Bellatrix is going to volunteer- that may even be why she didn't have kids with her husband, so the baby with Voldemort could be a firstborn on both the mother's and father's sides.

Delphini is damn lucky they died when they did, just a few months after she was born. She wouldn't have lived to grow up, otherwise.

****** I like this idea a lot. The "heir" argument people use is idiotic, as we all know that Voldemort wanted to live forever. Delphi was born to be a tool, a means to an end. There was no love, affection or whatever on Voldy's part.

"Bellatrix, just get the damned food already, we're trying to keep a low profile here" Rodolphus sighs

"This filthy muggle disrespected me, I want to talk to his manager! The Customer is always right!" Bellatrix yells in response

The 1951 comes from the Black Family tree, but even if it's off by a few years (math not being JKR's specialty) we know that she is the /oldest/ Black sister, and anyone older than Sirius and the rest of the Marauders falls firmly into baby boomer territory.

**** The Black Family tree includes several instances of people having or fathering kids at 13 and younger, as well as flatly contradicting what is said in the books. Even if you disregard the dates and just go with it stating relationships and birth order, it makes it decidedly difficult for Nymphadora to be the age she is if Bellatrix is older than Andromeda /and/ at school at the same time as Snape (although getting knocked up by her muggleborn boyfriend and leaving Hogwarts early to elope does actually make a good story).

I've long been of the view that it belongs in the same category as the poo-vanishing thing, frankly.

****** I think people had more problems with the way she said it that the meaning.

Before the installation of plumbing, muggle did use pot chamber and things like that, before later dealing with it (sometimes by throwing it out of the street and you said), and Wizards probably used a similar method (but probably prefering to vanishing the poop rather than throwing it).

In her tweet (it was a tweet I think), Rowling didn't say Wizards were doing their business discretely into chamber pots. She said that a Wizard would shit the moment he needs to (like in the middle of a full corridor), and then Vanish the mess. Even with the magic that deal with everything, it makes them look like babies, or animals.

******** Not everyone goes to Pottermore, and a lot of people only learn about what she says after she tweeted (and often only because mainstream medias decide to talk about this).

For Gay Dumbledore, I admit I don't see the problem since it's already heavily implied in the book (even if some of her comments about how he and Grindelwald were very passionate may have been too much).\\
I also remember her organizing a fack Gay wedding between Dumbledore and Gandalf in front a anti gay marriage association some years ago that had me really annoyed (because, even if I think it was a useless moove that just gave the association more visibility, and I don't care about Dumbledore homosexuality, Gandalf is certainly not gay and as a lower divinity would never marry to anyone, at least in this realm.)

McGonagall is supposed to look like she's middle aged or a bit older (though the movies aged her so that she could be played by Maggie Smith). Bellatrix is even younger, by around 20 to 30 years I think, so she should look like she's in her mid to late 20's. She might look worn and ragged, kinda like a young meth user, but she wouldn't look like a Karen.

She was very beautiful once, but Azkaban took that away - when we see her in the books she is gaunt, sickly-looking, with only a trace of her former beauty. She didn't wear sexy dresses with deep cleavage or corsets. And the only person she wanted in "that way" was Voldemort.
