Basically what the titles says. I don't want anything that bashes any of the characters.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies. Unsurprisingly I've read most of these, but there are several here that I haven't heard of that are bound to keep me entertained for the rest of Winter Break.


** Also, I have some recommendations of my own as well:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11230962/1/Son-of-the-archer][Son of the archer]] by Melancholy's Sunshine is a HP and MCU crossover that involves Clint and Ron as the (underrated) main characters. linkffn(11230962) Status: Complete > The sequel actually involves Ron introduction to the Wizarding World and Harry: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11884262/1/Son-of-the-archer-and-The-Boy-Who-Lived][Son of the archer and The Boy Who Lived]]

#+begin_quote
  linkffn(11884262)

  Status: Complete
#+end_quote

- The [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][Weasley Girl]] series by Hyaroo is essentially where everything is the same except Ron is a girl. However, unlike most fanfics, the author actually creates their own story without rehashing the books so it is unique.

** I don't know if this helps, but I am planning on writing one, sort of.

I'm planning an AU with fem!Ron (I named her Elaine, as it's a name from Arthurian legend) as the main character. The main difference is: Arthur Weasley is highly skilled at Muggle science/engineering (but makes silly “dad jokes” in which he talks about rubber ducks and mispronounces words, so that's why his competence is not obvious). He's much more closer to Elaine/fem!Ron than he is to Ron in canon. Consequently fem!Ron eventually uses magically enhanced cars, bombs, guns, etc. and eventually learns Muggle physics (starting from her third year?). Not sure if I want to have the Golden Trio friendship in this AU, but in this AU she's Hermione's best friend and fem!Ron's academic laziness is complemented by Hermione's diligence, fem!Ron's interest in Muggle knowledge complemented by Hermione's talent in magic, fem!Ron's knowledge of pureblood traditions complemented by Hermione's knowledge of the Muggle world, etc.

I'm sorry if I was just rambling on and on! I hope this was interesting at least a little bit?

**** Thanks, I think I'll post it on here when I get the first chapter up.

I think I'll probably have Harry as quite /important/, actually, but perhaps not as close to fem!Ron in the same way as Harry and Ron are in canon - there's enchantments blocking men/boys from entering the girls' common room, causing Scabbers to be revealed earlier and Sirius to be exonerated in first year. Then Harry would want to know his godfather, and this whole event would probably bring fem!Ron and Harry together as friends. Especially since fem!Ron and Sirius can bond about their love of magically-enchanted Muggle vehicles XD;;

Moreover, everything interesting seems to happen around Harry, and both Ron and Hermione in canon are very proactive people (if that makes sense), so Harry would probably influence events in a large way anyway.

** linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) is my favorite Ron story. In an AU where Lucius Malfoy pulled a coupe and took over Britain when Voldemort vanished, Ron was trained to be the ultimate soldier and spy to help his best friend Harry after his family fled to France. He returns to Britain to infiltrate Malfoy's forces to take him down. Unfortunately, this is the exact same time that Voldemort makes his grand return and all hell breaks loose.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
