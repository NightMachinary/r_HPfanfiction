I don't read romance much. But I'm in the mood for something fluffy with really good characterizations and dialogue.

I don't have an OTP, so open to reading most pairings as long as the fic is really good. Prefer no Snape or Draco as leads though. I prefer rarepairs to H/Hr and H/R, but that might just be because there's a proliferation of mediocre fics with those pairings. OC's are fine (presuming quality).

I'm less interested in school-age fluff. I'd prefer something with adult characters. Any Era as long as the characters are adults!

I'd love something with a plot. (If someone came up with a novel length action/adventure with a romantic plot that was really well written and completed I'd be in heaven)


** - [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290483][Morocco]] is an action Rose/Scorpius. I always say it's like a great summer blockbuster in fic form. Popcorn fare, but well-executed and addicting, and romance focused.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294705][Bathing in Roses]] is school-age and OC but it's my favorite rom-com. It's genre savvy, while being sweet and earnest at the same time. If it's really not your thing though, check out Celestie's other fics! All of them are great, many are romance, and she writes all sorts of eras.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][Satellite Heart]] is a Harry/Draco but it's AUish so it's not really canon Draco. I think it's a cool take on post-war as Harry starts dreaming an alternate universe where Voldemort doesn't exist, and it handles his lucid dreaming and alternate characterizations very well - and it has some pretty funny fluff. I don't even read the ship, so I didn't have to ship them initially to enjoy it.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=282694][You're Gonna Miss Me]] is a post-breakup Roger Davies oneshot. I always though it was the cutest bit of stream of consciousness. Really original.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309456][With All Things]] is a George/Angelina; incomplete but slice-of-life-ish so it's not a big deal, but it is not very plotty.

** hgfan1111 has several good HP/GW romances including "The Space Between", "Brighter Than Sunshine", "Easier To Be", "Learning To Fly", and "Gravity."

All have disappeared from FFN but can be found in various forums. Happy to share a zip'd link of these in epub format if you want.
