:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Bellatrix ( main character) is an Auror has inherited Black Moor. Tom Riddle is her best friend and political mastermind whom stole her girlfriend (Hermione Granger) though Legilimency and is secretly taking over the wizarding world.

Please help! Been trying to find this for weeks before I decided to post on here.

  Hermione Granger was once self assured in her title of Smartest Witch of the Age. But now, after having been thrown backwards through time and space with no immediate way home, she's not so sure about herself. Forced to contend with another who shares her title, Hermione must attempt to make her way back home or learn to live with her new reality. And maybe, if she gets lucky, things just might turn out better than she could hope.

**** Thank you, but that is not it either. I have read a bit of this - not really good imo. What do you think?

** The only story I know where Bellatrix is an Auror and involved with Hermione is "Murder Most Horrid".

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
