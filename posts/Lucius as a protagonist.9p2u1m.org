I've seen fanfics where Draco and Narcissa are good but not so much for Lucius. So looking for one where that's the case, and where he is one of the major characters. Ideally main chatacter but doesn't have to be. I prefer stories where he is a adult but I wouldnt be opposed to ones where he is still in school. I have no shipping preferences for him m/m m/f canon pairings non canon pairings whatever. But I prefer plot or character focused stories not ship focused.


** There's linkffn(Wish Carefully by Ten Toes), a great one-shot told from Lucius' POV.

** Sorry, I can't think of one where he's purely good, but in the recs below, he comes across as complex rather than a total monster. He does bad things, but only to keep his family alive. Lucius is one of my favorites, simply because I don't know what to do with him. He's too fascinating and too intense for bland storytellng. Forgive me if the recs below don't meet ALL of your criteria. If you like Lucius, there's a reason for it, and it just might be between the lines of these stories. First, here's a shortish one-shot about Lucius having to "entertain" the Deatheaters with Severus Snape, as punishment for both. It's Lucius' viewpoint about Severus's AU past. It's part of an ongoing series, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15130943][Conflicted Severus]] by Bridgette. Warning for uncomfortable situations, but the writing is solid.

â€‹

Then, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14752242/chapters/34110054][Unbearable - Draco]] starts out with Lucius just trying to keep his family alive while Draco is forced to undergo one of the worst curses imaginable. Lucius' love and devotion has to jump through painful hoops. Some might see Lucius as evil, but he's not. He's just arrogant and desperate to survive tyranny. If you're not his family, you're his enemy. (Seriously not for lightweight readers.) Even though Draco and Harry become primary figures in the plot, Lucius' role eclipses theirs by the end and takes on new significance in the sequal [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16752724/chapters/39302560][Unbearable - Harry]], though that isn't finished. The sequal is a slow burn where Lucius and Harry have unfinished business, a curse-related daughter between them that neither realizes is keeping them connected . The plot is more concerned with Harry tracking down Snape, but he keeps having to deal with Lucius, which is only hinted at in the story so far, and getting stronger. The story expands all over the place, but is plot-driven.

  When Hermione's magic pulls her away from her friends and Hogsmeade village to the top of a hill, the decision she makes will open her eyes, shining a new light on the world around her - a very hot light. With a lot of learning and some extra homework, she will learn that some people are FAR more than they seem. She may even find love in an unexpected place. **Slow-ish Updates** Set in Hermione's 6th year, beginning the weekend after her birthday. She is 18 at the commencement of this story. Just as you should be if you're reading it
