:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all new to Reddit as a whole but to be succinct during some medical treatment last year I worked through several Harry and Fleur fics and now that my mind isn't blurred with pain meds I'd like to revisit some. I'd welcome recommendations but primarily im trying to recover the title of one I believe I read in which fleurs headmaster encourages her to ask Harry to the ball as she has a thing for younger men and thinks that fleurs assement of harry as a little boy is short sighted Harry being accepts however beyond this point my memory of the fic is VERY fragmented I believe that before or immediately after the ball harry is in fleurs room and she finds out about his injuries and the abuse he's suffered and he is then taken to France. I suspect from the fragments of my memory that it happens before the abll as I feel like I read a passage where fleurs father a French magical official is pleased that his first concern when waking up is that he's missed the ball with fleur but that could be the meds. Please assist.

Cheers for your time and keep safe.
