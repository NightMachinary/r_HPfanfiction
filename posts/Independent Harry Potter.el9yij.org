I read it a long time ago but can't remember what it's called. While at the dursleys he gets a motherly snake, also gets rid of the horcrux. He finds out about magic and moves to diagon alley to live by himself. He gets another familiar a wolf cub who finds him in the park. He doesn't go to hogwarts, and his magic has a grey visualisation. He also makes friends with zabini and longbottom.
