Want fics where DD tells Harry the prophecy (and possible the horcruxes) and/or Harry takes his occlumency lessons more seriously. Harry and crew don't go to the DoM.


** *Initial* /the first letter of a name or word, typically a person's given name or a word forming part of a phrase./

*A*lbus *D*umbledore

*D*udley *D*ursley

Also, Harry took his "lessons" seriously, but mindrape is hardly a teaching technique.

*** I've just known people call Dumbledore "DD" so I've started calling him that myself.

Edit: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted.

** I don't think I've ever heard about a fic where Dudley Dursley knew about the prophecy and the horcruxes and helped harry be a better wizard, but it sounds really cool!

**** Well, Harry did meet him when he was a kid. It may be fun to write something about a protective Diggle watching over the BWL

** I've had Harry learn Occlumency (not from Snape) and hear about the Prophecy from Dumbledore in both "Patron" and "Divided and Entwined".

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
