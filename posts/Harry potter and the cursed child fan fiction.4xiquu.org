Hi everyone

I wanted your opinion and ideas on if I should write a fan fiction about Albus Potter and how his life turns out and also if so what should the plot be?

Any ideas and opinions will be appreciated


** Sure, not like you can make it any worse.

*** I don't regard it as fan fiction because I can't see anything in it to indicate that the writer is a fan or even properly familiar with the canon.

** Well it seems to me that if you've got a story fighting its way out, you've got to go with it and get it on to the page. But I admit I have started on a sort of fix for the Cursed Child, but it's so complex, I'm really regretting that I even started it and I'm frustrated that it's keeping me away from my original stories. But I will finish it and get it out of the way.

**** To be honest, no. It left me very unhappy and I'm annoyed that it shows apparent ignorance of and contempt for its own canon. I think that is why I feel such a strong urge to write a story that makes sense of it.
