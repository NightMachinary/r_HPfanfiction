** Maybe a Draco/Hermione writer decided Draco smells of mint from Hermione cutting herself off when she talked about how amortentia smelt for her.

** So, I've never actually seen this in fics, much less canon, but aside from the Hermione/amortentia thing already mentioned, I think the most likely explanation is the straight-forward "character is green, mint is an acceptably masculine scent"

** Yeah, this stuff just happens in fanfic to every popular character in every fandom. Someone writes it into one story and other people like it and put it into their own work and soon it's fanon.

** Yeah, it seems to come from the amortentia reference, but because it smells like different things to different people, I'd expect a variety.

** I'd say another aspect is it's probably suitably aristocratic to fit Draco. I have no clue if it is, but it sounds fancy enough in text at least

** It's not just Draco; every male character in a romance fanfiction has to smell like mint. That, or smoke or menthol, take your pick. Maybe the wizarding world has a popular brand of mint-scented perfume.

** In [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/][Blue Steel]] by Jeconais (a site login may be required), pureblood males consider bathing every other week to be more than sufficient. Draco's cologne is referenced as an attempt to cover up the aroma, but not described, and Ron apparently doesn't use any.

** Haven't seen mint. Have seen: pine needles, pineapple, sandalwood. Lemon's (or citrus) the most common.
