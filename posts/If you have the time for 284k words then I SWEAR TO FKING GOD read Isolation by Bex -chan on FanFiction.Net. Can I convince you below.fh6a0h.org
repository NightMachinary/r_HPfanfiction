Don't you dare shrug this off as something a random person enjoyed. If you are open to a Dramione story and you have not read it; what are you doing with your life? If you are not open to Dramione READ IT, I originally thought ‚Äúew creepy blond dude and the bookworm, who would read that?‚Äù But I gave it a chance and I am writing this at eleven at night to try and improve your pitiful Isolation-less life. It has won many awards, I never knew there was fanfiction awards but there are, and it has won them. I never do this sort of thing, but I feel a duty to humanity to convince you to spend ten minutes on it. PLEASE DO, it will have made this wasted sleep time completely worth it. Don't have made me type this stupidly big text for nothing! (Why can't I write this much in assessments?) Just look it over, for me. Look, I've even taken the trouble to add a link. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Just one little click!]] This has no value to me, it is purely for your benefit! I BEG YOU. I have spent way too much time on this but really, give it a shot. I'm going to go to sleep now.


** /TL:DR at bottom/

Alright. So a while (like 8-10 months) back I decided to try and read the top 10 HP fics sorted by favorites. I made it through Isolation in about 12 hours, and then stopped halfway through NoFP. So, having read it, I can say with experience. */It is not good./*

From what I can remember (keep in mind this way almost a year ago, and I'm not willingly gonna open this fic again), the entire premise boils down to ‚ÄúDraco is bored of cursing out Hermione, who wants to ‚Äòcure' him, so he asks for a book. Hermione gives him a muggle book, which he enjoys, and then they fuck.‚Äù

Now, the plot is simplistic, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. It's a romance story, which don't always need complex plots. It's the way that Isolation goes about its plot that bugs me. Draco is captured by the order (iirc) and they need someone to look after him. Hermione, after much deliberation is like ‚Äúyeah sure‚Äù and takes him to the Head Suite at Hogwarts or something. Proceed with fic.

Here come the problems. A: Hermione actually cares to give a shit about Draco's well being, in a remarkably out of character move. B: Draco is actually willing to fucking change his opinions about this shit. and C: there's a few scenes, where Draco just lies in bed /listening to Hermione showering, and jacking off./ And that just makes me uncomfortable.

To top it all off, the writing seems overly forced to be romantic, the ‚Äústrong manly body‚Äù and ‚Äúshining blue orbs‚Äù included, which just naturally puts me off of the fic.

So, to rank it... 3.5/10. Methods ranks it at a 3/10, since I didn't even bother finishing it, and NoFP, at a 4/10, cause what I did read of it was actually okay. For the other Top10 story I've read, OGNA, that's a solid 7.5/10, and I'm Still Here (technically #11 but NoFP got deleted) at an 8/10.

Closing thoughts: I'm biased, dislike Draco as a character, Hermione as a pairing, Dramione as an idea, and good!Draco as a possibility. In addition, I dislike romance, and dislike the overly prosey writing.

*TL:DR - I'm biased, but it's bad.*

*** I enjoy pretty much everything that you dislike --- Draco, Dramione, romance, and so on---but we're more or less in complete agreement on this one. Most popular pairing fics often end up being based on the specific tropes and characterization fanon chooses to latch on to and I feel like this one is no exception.

If someone's in the mood for a lengthy romance novel feature a good girl/bad guy pairing, it isn't the worst choice. That's... about the best I can say for it.

**** Alright. As a person, romance does not appeal to me. That said, I /will/ read romance stories and enjoy them if they are well written and have an appealing plot.

Isolation has neither of those things.

While I certainly /am/ biased, it's not that I despise romance (though I won't go searching it out), but that it simply doesn't appeal to me on its own.

I suppose when I stated

#+begin_quote
  I dislike romance
#+end_quote

I could've been clearer, and said instead

#+begin_quote
  I dislike romance as the sole plot of a story
#+end_quote

I hope this satisfies.

** "It wasn't like she, or anyone else for that matter, could see him listening to her calming chorus of bathing moans. It was just too alluring...Too soothing."

This is not fine

"He crept silently towards the bathroom, hoping that she had forgotten to lock the door, and luck was apparently on his side today. He slipped inside and took a healthy gulp of the cherry-scented steam, carefully beginning to discard his clothes as he eyed Granger's oblivious shadow dancing across the shower-curtain.

His pulse was throbbing loudly in his ears by the time he removed his boxers to the first of Granger's bathroom moans, and he eagerly padded across the floor, and stepped into the cubicle."

Why?
