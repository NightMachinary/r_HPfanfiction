Could anyone direct me to any FemHarry/Neville, Harry/FemNeville, FemHarry/MaleHermione, or FemHarry/younger boyfriend or girlfriend: FemHarry/Colin Creevey or FemHarry/Gabrielle Delacour for example?

I'm already aware of and have read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13048945/1/Ms-Slytherin][Ms Slytherin]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3266877/Bellatrix-sDaughter][Bellatrix'sDaughter]] which is a FemHarry/Neville fic, and I remember encountering a FemHarry/Gabrielle Delacour one shot but can't remember the name or author, same for one of two fics that cross with the Inheritance Cycle that are FemHarry/Eragon with the remembered fic name being By Wisdom and Courage.


** Try this one; it seems to unfortunately be dormant, but it has an interesting premise of a genderbent-AU, with MaleHarry/Luna and FemHarry/MaleHermione. Even though it hasnt been updated and doesn't have all the pairings you're looking for, I seriously recommend trying it out.

In case the link doesn't work, it's called Harry Potter and the Distaff Side

** In the [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] series (a four part series), FemHarry gets together with Luna Lovegood for a while. However I will say that although this is the main pairing of the fic, it is not the focus of the story, nor (spoilers) does not last forever. Additionally, this is a very adult fic, all the way from the start, with adult and upsetting themes all the way through. Silently Watches is however, very good at flagging these themes at the beginning of the story I have linked to. The final book in the series is not currently complete, but it seems to be very nearly finished, and it regularly updating.
