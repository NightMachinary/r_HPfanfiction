As you can see I'm searching for a Fanfiction that I've lost the name for... I don't remember big details for in the story but in the end Harry and Hermione take over the prefect duties, while Ron (and I believe Lavender) aren't doing them. That goes so long that none of the younger years want to become prefects but rather like „The Professor“ (that's what they call Harry in the common room)... it's a Harmione fanfic, with Ron! and Dumbles!bashing. That's as far as I remember details and I hope that's enough for somebody to find that Story. Thank you in advance


** I've read this but I can't remember the title. They start calling him Professor Potter and McGonagall spies in the common room in her cat form.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin), but it is was one of the 'Don't Fear the Reaper' challenge responses, and it shares all problems with other such stories. Namely, excessive bashing (up to and including Ron & Ginny dosing Hermione and trying to dose Harry with various mind-changing potions; and evil manipulating Dumbledore).
