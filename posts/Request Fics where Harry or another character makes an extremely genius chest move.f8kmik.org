I want fics where Harry or another character plays within the system to get an outcome they want. Manipulation tactics, knowing the rules to bend them, that sort of thing.

Could be time travel, could be Slytherin Harry, pureblood politics could be played within, etc. I'm not too picky.

I'm interested in anything one could recommend, within reason.

(No manipulation tactics to get with a younger version of a character when the Protagonist is past the age of consent, no pedophilia. etc. etc. Just not too shitty or depraved of an outcome and I'm fine with it, but the protagonist doesn't have to be a saint. I'm fine with asshole protagonists, but you gotta draw the line somewhere.)

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.
