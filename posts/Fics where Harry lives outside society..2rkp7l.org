I just recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] and the WIP sequel by evansentranced, and enjoyed them thoroughtly. It reminded me of another beloved (WIP) fic by Paimpont, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To the Waters and the Wild]], where Harry is raised by elves, and a fic by witchdragon called [[http://www.hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=18012][Gypsy Caravan]] where Harry runs away and is raised by gypsies.

This has me yearning for some more fics where Harry grows up outside society to some degree. Fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6690487/1/Growing-Up-Kneazle][Growing up Kneazle]] are not really what I'm looking for since kneazle!Harry lives in a normal home (albeit magical).

I'm looking for Harry either raising himself or being raised by an atypical group or family. Pairing or no pairing, slash or no slash, it doesn't matter to me. Thanks!


** I'm not actually quite sure if this is the one I think about, red it years ago: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2661709/1/A-Life-Alone][A Life Alone]] The Dursleys get killed when Harry is 8 and he has to life on the streets of London for years.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5528392/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-World-Beneath][Harry Potter and the World Beneath]]

From the summary: Running away from the Dursleys at a young age was a turning point of his destiny. Now he lives alone in the wilderness of a land long forgotten by the passage of time. And this is the story of his discovery in the lost world beneath.

It's pretty good, and fun to read. But it updates really slowly.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][Mastermind Hunting]] starts with him travelling around the world in attempts to lose the attention of various governmental secret agencies. The rest of the story readjusts itself to the more regular Hogwarts life though.

*** Its a really well written and interesting story, but I recall beeing somewhat disappointed by the rather strange end. But worth the long read anyway!

**** Yes, the ending was really devaluing the whole story. My headcanon for this fic (haha) is that it had no ending at all.

***** A good ending /cough/book 7/cough/ is probably one of the hardest parts of writing a story! So neverless, thumbs up to the author of Mastermind Hunting!

** I'm not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9624356/1/Master-of-Death][Master of Death]] he's raised by Death himself. It's pretty atypical, but he's still more or less in contact with society through his studies.

** Is Gyspy Caravan worth it in spite of the slash? Also, how much slash? Are we talking just one couple, a few couple or "EVERYONE'S GAY AND THE NEXT GENERATIONS NONEXISTENT WHEEEE!!1111!!! BUT BUTT BABIES!1!"?

Damnit To the Waters and the Wild too.... :(

*** Gypsy Caravan is /very/ slash heavy. So much so that I actually started to skip over the more R rated scenes, and I actually like slash.

To the Waters and the Wild is gorgeously written, like everything else by Paimpont, and has a wonderful dreamlike quality. The slash is quite minor, and in fact hasn't really happened to any real extent yet because Harry is still young. I highly recommend it.

** Not sure if it fully fits what you look for, but there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8575201/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Escape-to-New-York][Harry Potter and the Escape to New York]]. It is a fic I am enjoying despite not knowing the crossover world at all, and it is almost completed.\\
The "outside society" here is the odd world from the short lived 'Beauty and the Beast' TV series.
