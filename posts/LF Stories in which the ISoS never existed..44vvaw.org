**** This has great potential for AU worldbuilding.

I searched on ff.net for "statute secrecy" but found only stories that seem to follow the same thread as Emperor. I'm honestly quite surprised that no one else has thought to base a story in a world with such potential. One of the reasons for this may be the extraordinary difficulty in worldbuilding practically from scratch. Every facet of both magical and Muggle societies would be quite different. I think one of the reasons why amateur authors are drawn to fanfic is the 'ready-made' nature of the IP owner's world, thus making single-point departure stories far more common than fics where the entirety of canon is reshuffled so dramatically.

***** Sorry to clutter up the thread with an unhelpful post, but it's /just/ the sort of fic that I've wanted to read forever. I remember reading a quasi-medieval AU where the world was essentially a Mageocracy. Harry ran away from the Dursleys (who were blacksmiths) on horseback, ran into some evil pplz and caused a thunderstorm as accidental magic.

And that's where it ended. Not to mention I can't find the damn thing. T_T

****** Also on a tangent, I remember reading a story where it was sort-of medieval (like the author was aiming for it, but there were too many later inventions), in which Harry was an abused stableboy who is eventually found by Snape, and taken as his apprentice hedge-witch/herbalist. But they weren't really doing /magic/ as such, more a combination of common sense and modern (googled) medical knowledge of plants with lots of hand waving away actual pharmacology and physiology (willow bark is not as good as modern pain killers!)

***** I agree, but there aren't even stories in say the 1700s with no ISoS, where additional world building would be minimal. I vaguely had an idea to write a FF with this premise, where Harry lives in a gated anti-magic community before the start of the books, but magic is still widely known. I wanted to see how other authors built the world... this may lead to a discussion post soon.

This could point to the underlying issue then. As far as I know, JKR has never provided much information about the Statute. The [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy][HP Wiki article]] is extensive, but the more reliable [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/ministry/ministry-main.html][Lexicon]] is bereft of any detail.

Huh? Like I said earlier the ISS is extremely Eurocentric. In most other parts of the world magic, rituals, animism, shamanism, voodoo, whatever you want to call it were an integral part of life until Christian (and in some cases Muslim) missionaries showed up and deemed all sorcery evil.

Then again utilizing that route would require actually caring and learning about non-Western history and culture, which would admittedly be a barrier for many...

********** You don't think the world would be different if magic, wand waving, breaking all laws of nature, /magic/ was real, proven, and common place?

If James II could call openly on magic users, would William III ever been able to invade England in the "Glorious Revolution"? If William III never reached power, would the the more Parliament-centred rule of England ever arisen, and the Act of Settlement occur in 1701? What would England, and therefore all its colony's look like now? Would Roman Catholics (and pilgrims) still have left England? If wizards shipped out with the pilgrims, would the native Americans be wiped out in a magical war parallel to that waged by the colonizing forces? Or would they be welcomed as fellow (but backwards to the Europeans) magic users? Would American Revolution still occur if troops could be instantaneously transported as re-enforcement? If the tea was stored in waterproof, unbreakable magicked cases? Would there still be a strong slave trade, if African shamans could curse the slave boats, hex the invaders? Or would European magic users collect thousands more via portkeys? Would the Aztecs fall if their magics could call down their gods? Or would they be labelled dark and destroyed by magical and non-magical forces combined? Would there be so much pressure to explore, when land could be found for more crops via simple expansion charms? Would there be famine at all when food could be duplicated easily and transported instantaneously? Would World War one kill so many with magical healing charms to close wounds or potions to fix broken bones, or would more fall under the wands then fell to guns and bombs? Would there even be a world war one if Archduke Franz Ferdinand had magical bodyguards? Would there be so much technological advancement to get to the moon if a witch could simply charm the rocket lighter, and give the men bubblehead charms to breathe? Would there be as much prejudice against other races when other species existed and walked amongst us? Would religion be the same if thousands could walk on water and turn water into wine, cure blindness and even fly?

There are many, many other events, cultural ideas, fashion, attitudes not just in Europe, but world wide, which would be different if magic was widely known. Even if a story was set in Australia, or Japan or even a tiny pacific island with no name, I would /still/ expect some major world building would need to be done.
