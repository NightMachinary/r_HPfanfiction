**** The problem is that there are two "rules" that get taught early on at school - that you have to use /descriptive language/, and /repetition is bad/. Add to that the emphasis on expanding your vocabulary, and you end up with too many adjectives and too many synonyms.

Basically, kids learn to write things that impress English teachers, not average readers.

Like, hello? That's like standing in the middle of an american airport, looking at your mate, and then shouting "HEY, YOUR EYES HAVE THE SAME COLOR AS THE TRIGGER TO THE BOMB IN MY BACKPACK" at the top of your lungs.

Why call it "The Avada Kedavra"? For gods sake, why the AK? Just say "killing curse", or "death curse", like everyone else. Hell, little kids shouldn't ever learn that incantation, which only has to be spoken with a genuine desire to kill someone behind it (something kids are very much capable of).

just make up a new department, something dumb like the "Department of the Preservation of Wizarding Heritage", where extremely bored people sit around all day pampering semi-important mages who think they're something special, and have our great protagonist find out that, while the potter son, his family is small and mostly unimportant. After all, the whole bounty thing was paid to harry and his parents, and was somehow available to him despite only having a "trust vault" (whatever that means). They never had a manor or a castle or anything like that, and while related to the Black family, those have three pretty direct descendants.

****** True, true. However, I don't think we get any indication of the Potters being an "old and important" family, and they're by no means super-rich.

They're said to be "contenting themselves with a solid and comfortable existence in the backwaters", which doesn't speak to me as the kinda people who'd have hereditary seats anywhere, or be as rich or even richer than the Malfoys.

And while they are descended from the Peverell family, that family's bloodline is dead and buried, their holdings most probably distributed among surviving descendants in the early dark ages, not lying around a thousand years later.

The anime that does it well is called quintessential quintuplets It is about a boy who has to tutor five sisters with only one thing in common - they all had bad grades and hated studying. It does not start out with a very romantic plot, and it is more of a 'How I met your mother' story, but it is still a Harem. The main character is not OP, he is not a blank slate and is a proper character. The members of the not official harem all know each other, have a sisterly relationship, and bring out the best eachother, unlike other harems in which they can be rivals or not know about each other. In this story, the harem is just used as a way to get to know each character's personality, and it is not a way for fanservice and smut.

I don't like harems and that sort of thing but in my opinion, any trope can be good if executed well.

******** The term 'harem' is generally used in a different way in anime compared to the West, or in Fanfic specifically.

An anime harem consists of several girls (or guys, just switch everything for a 'reverse harem') pursuing one guy, and he has to feel all of them out and decide which one he likes best. Then he chooses one and they become a couple, the rest of the girls have to move on.

A harem in the West mostly means polygyny: one man having sexual or romantic relations with multiple (generally 3+) women, simultaneously, to their knowledge. Maybe one is the 'first wife' or something similar, but all of them are in a relationship, and are not expected to leave.

******* They can, but I prefer my characters to /be/ in character, unless the author can show a reasonable explanation for their behaviour. Otherwise why bother writing fan fiction? Why not just make up your own story with your own characters if you're not going to keep to characterisation?

I'm not saying I won't make exceptions if the characterisation doesn't strain belief, especially if the plot is very good or it's meant to be funny. But some things are jarring. Anyone calling Hermione "Herm" seriously and without reprimand is a fairly minor point but it is unbelievable to me. And to be honest I've usually seen it in fics which are wildly out of character and usually have multiple spelling/grammar issues. That might be because I don't read a lot of het, but I do read trio fic.

I don't want to make more of it than it is. There are a lot of things that annoy me more - character bashing without a very good plot to back it up for example (it's just lazy).

***** There's occasionally some overlap between those tropes, sure, but the actual definition of "creature inheritance" is that a character undergoes some sort of 'creature' metamorphosis due to latent genes when they reach puberty or magical maturity. Usually the fic focuses on the resulting drama as the character(s) (most often Harry and/or Draco) learn to cope with the sudden and unexpected changes. Veela 'creature inheritance' seems to be the most common kind in fics, but I've also seen angel, demon, incubus, dragon, elf, elemental, parselmouth, etc.

****** I can try to summarise why it's polarising here.

What makes it liked:

- Some ideas in it resonate with people, often ideas that the person didn't fully realise they had and had never heard from anywhere else before. That can feel almost euphoric sometimes.
- Rational MCs aren't common (many HPMOR readers never came across one before) and can be engaging.
- The spelling, grammar, punctuation, and in general the prose are good, especially by comparison to the average fanfic.
- The humour is enjoyable, it can be a fun read.

What makes it disliked:

- Main character kind of an asshat, especially (but not only) in the first five chapters which turn off a lot of people.
- Can be overtly preachy at times, some of the science is wrong in /technically/ non continuity- or plot-breaking but still problematic ways. And the author claims it's accurate. So.
- Some of the story arcs fell flat and many that I would like to have seen developed were not.
- Author is involved with MIRI, which is a debatably effective AI research institute, has solicited donations to MIRI in connection to and through HPMOR. Also is the founder of the site lesswrong, which has developed it's own controversial reputation.

I've read so many different stories since then that I wouldn't have read because of the stigma attached to the idea of fanfiction. HPMOR isn't the best one I've read by far, but I still found it humorous and remember it fondly. Kind of like how Naruto introduced me to anime a long time ago and I branched out from there, even though I probably wouldn't rewatch it now.

*** its not an objectively bad story, imo its actually great, harry has flaws and fails numerous times before actually getting what he is doing wrong and the humor is very much my cup of tea. admittedly the author tract can get annoying but it is an otherwise fun read. I particularly enjoy the contrasts he puts out like "Harry had earnestly advised Hermione that the young boys serving under her were probably nervous about her being a girl with a reputation for being nice, and that she should pick something scary that would reassure them of her toughness and make them proud to be part of her army, like the Blood Commandos or something.

Hermione had named her army the Sunshine Regiment.

Their insignia was a smiley face."

or

"Hermione had pointed out that this was not what her books said. Hermione had asked if Harry really thought he was smarter, at eleven years old and just over a month into his Hogwarts education, than all the other wizards in the world who disagreed with him.

Harry had said the following exact words:

"Of course."

..............

"So," said Hermione. She was leaning back in her chair and the smug look was back on her face. "What did we discover today?"

...................

"Mmm... okay," said Hermione. "But I was also hoping for something like 'Hermione's books aren't worthless. They're written by wise old wizards who know way more about magic than I do. I should pay attention to what Hermione's books say.' Can we have that moral too?"

Harry's jaw seemed to be clenched too tightly to let any words out, so he just nodded.

"Great!" Hermione said. "I liked this experiment. We learned a lot from it and it only took me an hour or so."

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!""

or his desriptive phrases

**** To be fair, you /do/ have to have a very high IQ to understand HPMOR. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical reader's head. There's also Harry's rational outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Bayesian epistemology, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HPMOR truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in Harry's existential catchphrase ‚ÄúI notice that I am confused‚Äù, which itself is a cryptic allusion to humanity's instinctual yearning for enlightenment. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Eliezer Yudkowsky's genius wit unfolds itself on their screens.

*** I would LOVE to see a crackfic where Harry goes to have a custom wand made and is "in tune" with every single core in the shop. The exasperated wand maker puts all those cores in a full-size tree log to make the world's biggest, most unwieldy wand and tells Harry "There's your bloody wand. Good luck using it!"

And during the final battle, Harry loses his holly wand and tries to cast wandless magic out of desperation which feels much easier but the spells aren't actually being cast. Then there's an absolute flood of spells falling on to Hogwarts in the style of artillery fire and Harry realizes that all those wandless spells were actually being cast from the log wand in Ollivander's shop in Diagon Alley and are reaching Hogwarts with a 5 minute traveling lag.

** The one opinion I have of things in HPverse with the most downvotes is that I don't consider love potions rape by definition. It depends on how it's used.

For example, I once saw a fic where special circumstances made 2 people mutually decide to love potion each other knowingly and willingly for a day (for surrogate parental reasons). While the question on whether or not the execution was wise is unclear, it certainly wasn't rape IMO.
