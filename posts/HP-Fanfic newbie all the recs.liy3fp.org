:END:
Okay hear me out. I have been in the fandom for the last two decades and the books are my personal safe haven, when everything goes shit ones again and/or I feel super anxious. For what ever reason I decided long ago that i don't like HP fanfiction ( I guess part of me never wanted to confuse it with the "real" story). Well than came cursed child - thanks i hate it, and all the very problematic JK stuff. And I decided at the end of the last year: you know what, lets give it a go.

BOY HAVE I BEEN MISSING OUT!!!

I have only read two proper fics so far: The Changeling-Series by Annerb (honestly new head canon) and I Just finished All the Young Dudes by MsKingBean89 (loved it!)

I need more!

I would love all your recommendations! I would prefer longer fics that have already been finished (i am guessing that is not a problem, as there is 20+ years of stories on the interwebs.)

Currently interested in, but definitely not limited to :

- A deeper dive into the Ancient Noble House of Black (maybe something with Regulus and his story?)

- Teddy Lupin (honestly all next Gen, as long as it good! maybe something like a third war tied in?)

- More Maurauders-Era

- St.Mungos (what does it take to become a healer (is there something out there Like Grey's Anatomy but with Magic? :):):))

- Story of Alice and Frank Longbottom

- original charakters, other schools, different parts of the magical world,...

I would like to stay in the magical world, but if there is the Most amazing AU Story out there please recommend it also.

Thank you already!!!


** linkffn(wind shear; honour thy blood; stepping back; I'm still here; Novocaine; Magicks of the arcane; the sum of their parts; to be loved; Serpentine by darkfire1220; hedwig slightly unhinged; no competition;Limpieza de sangre) These are usually the ones I recommend to people new to fanfics. Be sure to check out the authors other works

  Harry Potter grows up on Privet Drive, where he is neither loved nor hated; rather, he is treated with indifference. Will his relentless pursuit of knowledge allow him to defeat the Dark Lord? Will he ever be able to live the life he desires?

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way; by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that may protect or destroy him.

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1CC1hLaavVc][I have . . . a few recs.]] Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom; Grow Young With Me; Negligentia; Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux; Black Luminary; The Merging; Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived; 13491812; A Most Peculiar Girl; Corvus Black; 9666689; 12077175; Forging the Sword; Contemplating Clouds; 8369495; On the Way to Greatness; 11617421)

Linkao3(Grey Space)

In order:

A massive AU which, for many years, ended on a cliffhanger, and which the author just recently announced they'd be going back to. Basically, Voldemort won the war, and at first glance, things look more or less how you'd expect, and they look less how you'd expect as time wears on. Personally, I stopped reading at chapter 100, due to . . . personal reasons, but it's a great fic, and I've been meaning to go back and reread it, start to finish, for a few years, now.

Pretty much /the/ romance fic in the fandom, it's post-war, pre-epilogue single dad Harry/muggle OC who could teach classes on ignoring "don't talk to me" vibes. In progress, and updates are slow going, but they're quite lengthy when they happen, we got the last few in relatively quick succession (three in the span of a year, if memory serves), and it seems to be wrapping up.

An AU and OoC oneshot exploring the long term consequences of emotional neglect during childhood and through adolescence. Fun! And when I say OoC, I mean /very/ OoC. It's got two sequels, but they're honestly nowhere near as good as the original, in my opinion.

AU wherein the horcrux in Harry's scar wakes up and decides to raise Harry as an apprentice/heir/general henchman. It's complete, with an abandoned sequel. I think it sticks too closely to the station of canon f for its own good, but it's a fantastic story, all the same.

Again an AU, this one being the result of the war with Grindelwald having a /much/ bigger impact on Wizarding Britain than in canon, and Voldemort subsequently never rising to power. Its political structure is extremely Not Good, and Harry, who was adopted by the Blacks after his parents were murdered, is on the wrong side of it. Incomplete with very infrequent updates.

The dementor attack at the beginning of OotP goes differently, so the rest of OotP and HBP goes differently. One of very few stories I've read wherein Harry gets more powerful, and it's not really a good thing. Recently completed after a more than 18 month hiatus.

Harry's twin brother is the boy who lived, and while it doesn't make a difference to the Potter family, they all love the twins equally, the rest of the world really doesn't give a shit about Harry, and he really doesn't appreciate that. It's honestly less a story than it is a chronicle of him learning stuff, but it's interesting stuff, and it carries the fic. It's sadly been abandoned, but at least it doesn't end on a cliffhanger. Most of it is only available on DLP, and you need an account to read it, too, so it's definitely the least readily available fic on this list, but still very worth checking out.

Harry asks a different pair of twins to go to the Yule Ball with him and Ron, and things go very differently. Maybe the only decent poly ship I've ever read in the fandom; most are just "bland male protagonist has a harem of 10+ interchangeable girls." Oneshot.

Daphne Greengrass doesn't want friends, Harry annoys her into rethinking her stance on the matter. It's a short and sweet oneshot; not much to say about it, honestly.

Probably my most hesitant recommendation, it's an AU where Harry finds out he was adopted and his biological parents are actually Snape and Bellatrix. Yeah. That said, it leads into a philosophical journey of self discovery, and that's my jam, son. Seemingly abandoned.

The only Harry/fem!Riddle I will ever rec. It's three chapters and has been on hiatus for /many/ years, but the author is still active on the site, and has said that they might go back to it, so here's hoping.

A quick oneshot in which Sirius contemplates the role he'll have in his godson's life.

Ginny dies in the Chamber, Harry, Ron, and Hermione dedicate themselves to making sure that nothing similar will ever happen again, if they have anything to say about it. Abandoned, and doesn't really end on a natural stopping point, but still very worth your time.

Harry/Luna shenanigans in the wake of the former's occlumency lessons. Abandoned, but it's more or less a series of vignettes, so it's not that big a deal that it's unfinished.

Dudley learns some stuff about himself and his family and becomes a better person because of it. Oneshot.

Harry is sorted into Slytherin, which makes everything a whole lot more complicated. There are other good stories where Harry is in Slytherin, but this is the only fic I've ever read and enjoyed where that was the entire premise. Abandoned, sadly.

Harry is raised by Ollivander and has, wonder of wonders, a functional childhood. Also abandoned, because we as a society can't have nice things.

An AU in which students start Hogwarts when they're 14 instead of 11, so Harry spends three extra years with the Dursleys. The very rare fic in which the Dursleys' abuse and neglect are kept to canon levels, but also taken seriously and explored in depth. It's even complete!

*Bonus anti recommendation:* Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. It has some good ideas and interesting concepts, but it's also close to 1.2 /million/ words, and a good editor would've cut it down to 300,000 without losing anything of importance. More than just plain wasting the readers' time, though, it commits the, to my mind, far greater sins of terrible characterisation with /massive/ redundancies in the cast, and an unnecessary fixation on the minutiae of canon (for instance, in canon, we only ever hear about 2 musical groups, so PoS assumes that there are only two musical groups in Wizarding Britain; that its author has this attitude, and seems to assume that their readers will, as well, goes a long way to explaining that bloated word count: I'd be genuinely surprised to learn that less than half of it was straight exposition).

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  What begins as a simple trip to retrieve extra cleaning supplies for his mother turns into something more for Dudley, something even he can't explain. He still hasn't forgotten what the Dementors showed him the previous summer, and he's beginning to think that maybe they were right after all. Oneshot.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** - The first stop should be [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] stories (start with linkao3(1615616) and then go on).

- My first long fanfiction story was “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124), and it persuaded me, that the amateur writing can be worth reading.

- From the I-have-no-clue-why-it-is-not-more-popular-than-it-is category I have series “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]]” starting with linkao3(1048010).

- For adults (no, it is not a lemon, but it is morally ambivalent story) linkao3(11676102) and its sequels.

I have more recommendations on [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/tag/harrypotter.html][my website]].

** Check out the Rights and Wrong's series by Lovesbitca8 on Ao3! Like you, I am a recent newbie of fanfic and these stories got me BEYOND HOOKED!! Seriously. I cannot recommend enough. First is “The Right Thing To Do,” then “All The Wrong Things,” and finally, my favorite “The Auction” which is an AU if Voldemort won.

I will warn you- these are Dramione fics which I never imagined I could enjoy...but now I do. So much. Give it a try :)

** If you're as +infatuated with+ interested in Regulus as I am, consider this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13582160/1/Severed][self-promo fic]] that follows Regulus from his sixth year through the end of 1979, mixing in some Marauders and a Regulus/OC/Remus love triangle in the beginning. It is a work in progress, not abandoned.
