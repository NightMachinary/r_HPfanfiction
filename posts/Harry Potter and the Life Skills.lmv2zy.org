Now, there are quite a few spells shown in books. Most of them seem like either 'combat' spells (curses, jinxes, shields - means to inconvenience another) or 'training excercises' (like mouse to snuffbox - usually not useful, but great for introducing students to a more advanced topic in Transfiguration).

There are also some household charms we see courtesy of Mrs. Weasley, or even Nymphadora ("Pack!"), but quite obviously they're not the focus of the series. As with any unexplored opportunity, I turned to fanfiction. In my mind, a fully qualified wizard (or a witch) should be able to move across the country at moment's notice and have a comfortable shelter and other necessities secured in a few hours, tops. A wizard's home can be anywhere a wizard's wand is, I say.

Now that I've done some Google-work, I turn to you: what uses of magic can you dream up to make everyday life easier?

To give you some examples of what I'm talking about we have:

  /It's long and full of tropes, but at one point there is a student competition. The goal? To build the best dollhouse, with an eye on making it durable and livable, researching spells and techniques to be able to build their own houses in full scale./

  /At one point, students make it their First Year Project to repair old school trunks from RoR, and turn them into saunas. This is done mostly for bragging rights, and with an eye for making complete hot springs in one of the following years./

  /This one's a bit different - a more acceptable take on Lord Potter trope. Harry doesn't really do the Malfoy Strut, but he does use his resources to achieve his goals. Moslty to be left alone and to provide for his in-group. The 'nail' for this one is Harry deciding to hire Weasley Twins to help him survive the Tournament and it's taken to its (il)logical extremes. Forever Dead, but well worth the read nonetheless./

In all those, magic was used to make the burdens of everyday life ever so lighter. Theoretical knowledge was put to practical uses.

Do you know more works worthy of making this list? Can you think of simple ways to make life easier/better? Discuss!

IMPOTRANT:

In the case of "It can/can't be done" argument, houserule is: If it's not contradicted by canon, it's possible.
