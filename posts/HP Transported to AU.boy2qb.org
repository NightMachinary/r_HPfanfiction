I read this awhile ago and cannot find it anymore. Harry is somehow transported via a portal to a AU. He is VERY well trained. has these floating orbs that assist him. James and Lilly are alive. James is a total prick and if i remember right abused Lilly. Harry has a sister in this AU. But their Harry didn't survive.

  Sequel to Fate's Gamble. Harry has finished with his original world (aside from a few visits) and now it's time to follow through on his promise to Fate to set right another world that her meddling didn't have quite the same effect as in his own. Summoned to fight Voldemort once more, Harry decides to have some fun while he's there. This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

**** It's an alternate reality (its a universe where the multiverse is a thing) and it's used as a plot point in the start of the story. It's simply used as a spring board to the rest of the story, isn't really relevant to the plot later.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), has a rather jerk!James, and it was his negligence that Lily was very badly hurt once. But it's not the exact fic you are looking for.

If you like this genre, I have several more dimensional travels in which James and Lily are alive:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Both Harry and Sirius ended up in a world where Tom Riddle was good, but there were different bad guys. No Harry in this world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]], linkffn(2705927): During the Horcrux hunt, Harry ended up in a much worse place where his counterpart was quite bad.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2477819/1/Lily-Potter-and-the-Worst-Holiday][Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday]], linkffn(2477819): The entire Ministry Six got catapulted into an alternate world where Neville was the BWL. Super!Harry soon showed his mettle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483): Harry and Ginny ended up in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] universe, linkffn(5511855), and 20 years into the future. They were kind shocked to find Bellatrix as the Minister and married to the other Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadows Walks]], linkffn(6092362): In search for Hermione, Harry embarked on a long dimensional travel and encountered many different outcomes.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
