Does anyone have any recommendations for fics with Harry and Sirius just having a laugh together? The sort of dynamic that they have in Oh God Not Again and A Black Comedy, preferably, rather than those fics where they go around doing childish pranks that everyone finds hilarious. Thanks!


** I like Harry and Sirius' dynamics in linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip) but Sirius isn't a major character and the fic is more about Harry's relationship with Dumbledore.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** Linkffn(Harry is a Dragon and That's Ok) is a good example of this I think. Due to various butterfly effects, Sirius is properly released from Azkaban without any issues and he's able to live openly. Since the threat of Voldemort/the Death Eaters isn't really present in this fic, Sirius gets to play the fun uncle to Harry and since Harry is well-adjusted rather than angsty, he actually plays along. Lots of them just comfortably hanging out together, Sirius acting like a man-child but actually teaching Harry things at the same time, etc

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

**** I was hesitant at first, the gimmick sounded odd to me, but it's one of my favorite fics now. Amazing amount of world building and one of my favorite Ron portrayals
