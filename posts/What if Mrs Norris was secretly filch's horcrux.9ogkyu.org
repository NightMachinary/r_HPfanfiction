***** Filch is now the human-form avatar of the [[http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Leviathan][Leviathan]] in Hogwarts lake.

It is studying magic and is making slow but real progress toward emulating Wizard magic with mass effect fields.

** What if Filch and Mrs Norris swapped minds when Filch was a kid. He's not really a squib, it's just that Mrs Norris can't channel the magic in his body because she's a cat. Mrs Norris acts irritable in Filch's body so that nobody stays close to her for too long and figures out her secret. This also explains his unruly appearance (cats don't know how to shave or use hairbrushes)

Filch constantly follows her in his cat form, waiting for the opportunity to find a way and switch back to his own body. Also, Dumbledore only keeps Filch around because sometimes he comes across him licking his own privates to clean himself and it gives him a hearty laugh every time.
