Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, but I've never written a HP fic before (though I do have writing experience) so I'd like to get some feedback before I start publishing things.

EDIT: It would probably be helpful if I mention that one thing I would like help with is avoiding OOC


** Sure!

** I would be down to help, but I'm not perfect with gramar but I'm amazing at finding missing links, misplaced names and plot holes.
