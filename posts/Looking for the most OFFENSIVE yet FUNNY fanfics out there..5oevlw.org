  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] fits the bill rather nicely, it's funny, and slightly offensive, while still being a good story. Even if it isn't exactly what you're looking for, it's still a good fic to get ideas from, and read to your sides content anyways.

It's probably useless as a reference on how to write comedic scenes, though, seeing as the entire fic save for the ending is written in what is practically 'play by post'.

It does have a lot of 'noodle incident' style stuff where things happen off-page and characters describe them or react to them, though. And of course, there's Harry Potter, Viktor Krum and Oliver Wood posing together naked for photos for a calendar.
