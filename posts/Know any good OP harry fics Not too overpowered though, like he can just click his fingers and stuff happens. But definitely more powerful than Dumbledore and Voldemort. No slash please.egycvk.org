A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him. This is also going to be a Godlike Harry fic, as well as a 'Harem' story. Lemons, Dark!Harry ,Powerful!Harry, Slytherin!Harry and Harems.

** Story: The odds were never in my favour [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11517506/65]] It's a fem harry story, can be bit confusing, but generally a good story. OP harry trope doesn't really arrive until the end of first year, or it at least becomes most obvious then.
