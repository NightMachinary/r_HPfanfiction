:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading this fanfiction once where Harry was almost like Tom Riddle in a way, where he comes into hogwarts and gets sorted into slytherin, and then kinda takes over the whole house. He was stupid op in the story, and draco was like his right hand man. He has his own group like Voldemort and his death eaters. And in the end there was this huge battle between the dumbledore brothers and Harry and that's all I can remember from this fic. Can someone help me find it?


** Now at first, that sounded like linkffn(rise of a dark lord)

Then i realized this was something else. I really want to read whatever fic this actually is.

*** Well I think I found it lol. If I can remember correctly I just ignored all the sex in the story so I can't recall how good the story is but I think linkffn(Harry Potter: Lord of Darkness) is the one I was talking abt

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
