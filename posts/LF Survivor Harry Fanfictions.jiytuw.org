So I read this one story where Harry was the Master of Death and he had to travel to the past but the thing that never left him was his incredible grief. People around him would be in awe of or jealous of his incredible magical power and general knowledge of the wizarding world. He was basically a walking treasure trove but very mindful of it. Though the thing that was so electrifying to me was the charisma and pull he had over others was beautifully vulnerable. He was like the baby of his house (Hufflepuff).... I want something like that or similar. I would prefer either Gen or M/M.


** Please let me know if you find it! Sounds cool
