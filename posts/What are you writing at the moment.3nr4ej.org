*** I have read several of them, and I find none of them satisfactory. Here are some points I'd like potential writers to consider:

1) What Snape was doing to 'protect' students. He should not be excessively cruel that Ginny would never ever agree to name her son 'Severus', but he should not treat Ginny as Lily Evans 2.0 either. Both extremes are implausible in my opinion.

2) Ginny's situation after the fall of the ministry was especially precarious. Voldemort and death eaters knew that she was very important to Harry regardless whether he broke up with her not. Unless someone convinced Voldemort otherwise, she would certainly be dragged off in front of him, and it wouldn't take long for Harry to capitulate. Snape was a master legilimens and could be very likely Voldemort's chief interrogator in the raid on the Weasley wedding. He should have no problem breaking into Ginny's mind to realize what was really going on. Snape should realize that if Ginny was lost to Voldemort, it would be game over. Ginny had to play her being-dumped-furious girl part, while Snape reported back to Voldemort that Harry had run off with Hermione.

3) I'd like to see writers consider the fact that Voldemort was pursuing the Elderwand quest until the Eastern holiday. He spent most of the time out of country, and he would cruciate anyone who summoned him without Harry Potter wrapped up. Thus, his minions were terrified of him and were more than happy to cover things up, and he was pretty much oblivious to what was going at Hogwarts. From the book, it was obvious after Voldemort's return, that crackdowns, torture, and violence increased dramatically.

4) From the time Ron left in mid October until he came back on the Christmas day, Harry and Hermione were talking to the Phineas Nigellus Black portrait almost twice a week, so they should have a good idea about what was going on at Hogwarts. There was NO word about Carrows cruciating students in detentions. Also during the same time, Harry was drooling over Ginny's dot on the marauder's map for hours a day, and there were no mentioning of Ginny in unusual locations.

**** Thanks for your advice! I have a few thoughts.

1. This is something I'm aware of, but don't think I've written him too cruel. I made sure that he got Ginny away as quickly as possible, without alerting the Carrows that he was rescuing her, where he then killed time in the tower, not particularly caring that she was being a bit cheeky. He still has to keep up appearances, and we know that there was a low level of mutiny against him. It is hard to get the balance right though, he is a tricky character, so I appreciate you highlighting this for me.

2. This is what I have been trying to portray, and was the reason I made sure Snape said to the Carrows that her story was probably true. Over several chapters I've had her repeatedly emphasise to students that Harry broke her heart. I disagree that he would have been in the raid at the Weasley wedding - I think Lupin would have mentioned it, given that he was asking Harry if there had been 'any sign of Snape'.

3. This is something I need to pay more attention to, you're right. Thankfully I've only just got into September.

4. It's only Ginny they've done it to, and it was very briefly, rather than the systematic punishments that will come later. She is being interrogated, rather than punished in detention. Harry also does not begin looking at her dot until they're camping, and it is the first evening in Hogwarts; they haven't spoken to Phineas yet. Otherwise I've mentioned classes being a bit shouty, but I'm not planning to have then being horribly beaten just yet.

***** I'm also thinking about the role of Draco Malfoy. This guy obviously had no guts in really hurting people, but he was also a coward that would do anything under threat. After the skirmish in the cafe, Harry could briefly see him reluctantly torturing Rowle under V's threat in the vision.

I guess his actions at Hogwarts would be pretty similar: he would get titles such as head boy and junior inquisitor, but only carry out his 'duties' passively; but when pressure got high enough, he would do what was required of him.

After the debacle at Malfoy Manor and Weasley going into hiding, I think both Snape and Bellatrix lost a fair amount of prestige, and that would hurt Draco's position at school significantly. V would drop all pretense of 'appeasement' and implement harsh policies. So when the DA carried out their usual rebellious activities, they got surprised by the Michael Corner torture episode. Under the new terror regime, it took only 2-3 weeks before the DA went into hiding in the RoR.

****** Yes, I have similar ideas about Malfoy but he hasn't entered my fic yet.

In terms of the escalation of violence, I'm portraying the Carrows as characters who very much enjoy violence, and sometimes lose control, but are under orders from Snape. So I'm trying to write it as a tension and threat of violence rather than outright terror or the other end of the scale which is just Umbridge level strictness. The casualness of Neville's discussion of the Carrows suggests to me that violence was a regular thing for longer than just a few weeks, but I see it as something that was always at the sidelines and gradually became more common as the Carrows struggled to both control their tempers and also gained confidence in V's regime.

I think by the sounds of it we have read the same fics and been annoyed by the same things!

******* Finally, I think the DA kids would thoroughly "work" on the Carrows after the battle. War-hardened teenagers would definitely be a cruel bunch after seeing their comrades murdered and themselves being tortured. Testimonials and biographies from real-life war veterans can all attest to that. The one paragraph in E.B Sledge's 'With The Old Breed' about how a young American Marine "worked" on a wounded Japanese soldier after the Battle of Tarawa was really stomach turning.

In fact, there was foreshadowing in HBP, when Dumbledore had a brief exchange with the Carrows on top of the Astronomy Tower. Also, J.K Rowling announced a book named 'Dumbledore's Army: The Dark Side of Demob', that was supposed to show how imperfect they were.

I find it far more credible if our heroes showed negative emotions than as hate and vindictiveness as compared to only grief and forgiveness.

#+end_quote

I completely agree, Snape would not have gone to interrogate the wedding guests - Snape has two main jobs now that Dumbledore is gone, give Harry information so Harry can succeed and protect the students at Hogwarts.

It's been my head canon for a long time that the only reason the Weasleys were able to stay out in the open so long was because Snape managed to hide the fact they were close to Harry at all. Not that Snape cares about the Weasleys, but I'm sure he realized that if they were in danger or kidnapped Harry would try to save them, thus probably ruining Harry's chances of winning. Snape going to look for Harry at a Weasley wedding would basically be saying, "yup, this family is important to Harry! This is definitely where to start looking for him." That's the opposite of what Snape wants, so he finagles the plan as best he can as Voldemort's right hand man to get stupid Death Eaters to do it.

** Currently writing an HP/Witcher crossover, inspired by a writingprompts thread from a few weeks ago.

Here's a little excerpt, for those interested:

#+begin_quote
  "The monster they're describing. I've never heard of it," said Ron, folding his arms on the face of the heavy wooden table.

  "Never?" asked Harry; he remembered hearing the description of the monster outside the ealdorman's house. Ron was right, vibrating medallion or not, the monster they were talking about was non-existent.

  "There's nothing like it. Believe me, I know. I've the bestiary memorised like the back of my hand, Vesemir made sure of that."

  "Vesemir?"

  "One of the senior Witchers at our school," said Ron, "nice bloke, but boy is he a slave driver."

  "How did they describe it again?"

  "Like a goat, but with a lion's head, and ox legs... it's all a load of ploughing bollocks."

  "So?" shrugged Harry. "It wouldn't be the first time a client's exaggerated the monster they saw. I once did a contract near Vengerberg, and this miller's boy was convinced he was attacked by a werewolf. 'Huge and fierce it were!'," he continued, mocking the boy's accent, "turned out it was just a lost dog from a nearby village. Damned docile thing, too. Apparently the boy kept throwing rocks at it and it bit him when it had finally had enough. Poor kid was probably lying to save face."

  Ron looked amused. "What did you do?"

  "Brought the dog back to its owner, went back into the woods, found a wolf and took its pelt, then got the reward."

  "And the boy didn't say anything?" the wolf school witcher asked, incredulous.

  "What would he say, "I didn't get attacked by a werewolf'? Admit he wasted the ealdorman's time, as well as his father's and my own?"

  The redhead smiled at that, and made to reply, but their quiet conversation was broken by an intruder come to the table. A very fetching bar wench, with a lovely, slim face and eyes that shone like sapphires, even in the dim light of the tavern, came to them with two oversized mugs. One was filled with fresh, life-giving water, and the other a noxious-smelling, vile sort of beer, poorly brewed and poorly prepared, though Harry supposed the ample bosom served alongside almost made up for it.

  Thankfully, however, Ron was the one that had opted for the beer, and so, while Harry contentedly sipped at his drink, the other witcher observed his own as if it were poison, and eventually pushed it aside with a scrunched face and a disdainful sniff:

  "I had been itching for a pint of proper Cintran Faro," he moaned piteously, "this looks worse than the slop I had in Vizima!"

  Harry chuckled softly. "Vizima? Beer? You poor man."

  Ron laughed. It wasn't altogether unpleasant sound, a quick, severe, barking noise, but it served to remind Harry that he was more like the medallion around his neck than he looked. "I am, indeed. That's the Path, isn't it? Always with no more than hundred coins of whatever currency in whatever kingdom. Even this bloody contract will only give me a hundred gold ducats, fifty of which I'll have to share with you."

  Harry, too, laughed. "Backbreaking training, The Trial of the Grasses, numerous mutations, infertility..."

  "...and for all that, a bloody fifty ducats," commiserated the red-haired witcher.

  "That is," said Harry, "if we even survive long enough for that; most of the other witchers my age died half a year after leaving Kaer Almhult, dead in a swamp from their first fiend or chort."

  "Or worse still, a band of nekkers or an exploding rotfiend..." Ron sighed, "poor Terry. Horrible way to go."

  A comfortable silence fell between the two, just as the drunken braying of a pig-farmer about a Redanian milkmaid's breasts filled up the small tavern. A load of other men and boys clapped along to the rhythm; the Witchers watched and smiled, and Ron even joined in on the clapping, though he soon stopped when he earned the glare of an old man.

  "Mutants," the man muttered to himself, as if fed up. Both Witchers ignored it, but a long silence fell over the two.

  "We need to speak with Jonas, the butcher, after we eat," said the redhead later, as the song winded down. "Given what I heard from the ealdorman, I don't suspect that he'll be of much use, but I hold out hope for a small wonder."

  "An eternal optimist, then," Harry commented slyly, raising up his drink, intending to clink it against Ron's own. The unwary redhead complied and they both took a very long swig of their respective drinks; Harry smacked his lips in content and laughed when the other witcher gagged on his own.

  "That..." Ron sputtered, "that was unkind."

  Harry shrugged once more, a mischievous smile playing at his lips.

** I /wish/ I currently working on my story, linkffn(Flowers in Winter by silverfirelizard53). I am swamped with work and school right now, and I probably shouldn't even be on Reddit for these five minutes. This next few chapters I have planned are going to be a lot of fun to write, so I'm hoping for stress break/mental breakdown to free up some time in the near future. I didn't get any reviews/follows the last chapter update, but it's all good for now. I'm writing just for fun.

  She was a girl of exceptional talent and a kind heart, but she had been born between two worlds...neither of which she truly belonged. She was Lily Evans, and she had lived as she had died; fighting for the things in life that should have been rightfully hers to claim.

** Planning out my Historical Fiction with Ralston Potter and the English Civil wars. Which I hope I can lead into a Grindelwald Story later on.

Sort of a Magical history for Britain and the Potter Family.

** toggling between a worm fic, a DF fic, and an HP/firefly crossover. I have around 2 weeks worth of daily updates stored for my current story, so that gives me some time to experiment with new ideas and see if I come up with something interesting.

  Six years after the Second Wizarding War Hermione Granger and Lucius Malfoy meet under extraordinary circumstances and pave the ground for a patron-protégée-relationship of profound consequences. Fighting for power and control, they end up blurring the thin line between fatal self-destructiveness and divine symbiosis. It's called politics. HG/LM, Lumione, ONGOING
