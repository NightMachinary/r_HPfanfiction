** ‚ÄúNo,no hermione, I'm sure it said bark lord‚Äù Harry insisted‚Äù And what else barks better than puppies?‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry, when was the last time you got your eyes looked at?‚Äù Hermione asks all the while inspecting Harry's glasses

‚ÄúLast week,‚Äù Harry replies.

Hermione inspected Harry's glasses.

‚ÄúFRED!!!GEORGE!!! YOU BETTER MOVE YOUR ARSES BECAUSE YOU ARE DEAD!!!!!‚Äù Hermione yelled.

From across the great hall everyone saw a pair of red heads running out. Hermione sighed as she pinched her nose.

‚ÄùOcculus repairo.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, your right! It does say dark lord, hmm what should we do with the puppies?‚Äù Harry asked

‚ÄúWelcome to day in the life of hermione Granger‚Äù she muttered to herself
