** I wanna see a version of this where it isn't a spell, it's flying.

He's already presented as something of a prodigy on a broom, why not dial that up to 11? Like have his innate magic be so in tune with a broom that he can get a creaky old school broom to break the sound barrier.

Like so long as he's got a floating broom in his hand, his reaction speed becomes freakishly quick - imagine the DoM battle but with Harry zipping around like a fucking madman cackling not even trying to cast spells, just chucking heavy objects at Death Eater heads, or twisting them around and getting them to accidentally hit each other.

You could do the whole series like that - Harry's special Occlumency is meditating while flying. He eventually thinks to shrink a broom and strap it to his chest and he uses that to zoom through the maze at the end of GoF (and subsequently flee from the graveyard ritual).

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

****** Oh yeah. Same with his stooges. Crucio, imperio. Durrrrrrrr.

Makes you wonder why he was the "most feared dark wizard", when everyone and their grandmother knows of and can cast his spells. That was never explained in the books.

Then again, I think 99.9% of HP canon in general is absolutely terrible and that Rowling is vastly overestimated as a writer, so...

******* I tend to justify it in my head as being very limited because Harry's pov is very limited; an unreliable narrative. Which means Harry's memories are mostly going to be caricatures of everyone and what they did. This would explain things like Harry's memories of his aunt and uncle.

One thing that bugs me (I've been relistening to DH) is the whole idea that Harry and Hermione never mucked about while Ron was away. I'm sorry JKR but you've got two seventeen-year-olds in the wilderness with no other human contact, under constant life-or-death stress - there's no fucking way they didn't do /something/, even if they felt awful about it afterwards and swore never to speak of it again. I know that's offtopic but it's been bugging me recently.

** Well there's this great series by who I consider a pretty under rated author by the name of JK Rowling. Now I wouldn't say he's terrible at all other spells above one, but the one he's good at, he's really good at. The spell btw is Expelliarmus. As a matter of fact, he uses said spell against the unblockable Killing Curse, and through the power of plot, wins with it. I know it's pretty fantastical, and is pretty unbelievable in some parts, but I enjoyed it.
