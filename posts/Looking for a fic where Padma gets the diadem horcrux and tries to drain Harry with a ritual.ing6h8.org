:END:
It had long chapters and this took place in 4th or 5th year, also I think it was never finished. I think Harry might have been in Ravenclaw and friends with Luna, also there may have been a bit of sex? Thanks in advance.

  Imagine Harry Potter raised under the guiding hand of Sibyll Trelawney. He arrives at Hogwarts versed in the higher arts of Divination, Arithmancy, Numerology, and Palmistry - you know 'real magic.' Prepare yourself for one humorous ride.
