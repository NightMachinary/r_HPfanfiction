** I have to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), again:

  His Weasley eyes flashed with fury. "You'll regret that," he hissed. With a smirk, he turned to the Basilisk.

  "Attack."

  "No, don't do that," I ordered in Parseltongue.

  The Basilisk has no way of identifying the "one true heir of Slytherin." It's a snake, not some magical lineage device. As such, it follows any command given in Parseltongue.

  Diary glared. "Attack him!"

  "Don't do that," I ordered. "In fact, never attack me. And don't listen to any of his orders, either."

  "That isn't fair," he grumbled.

  Ginevra spun in place, short hair twirling around her head like a dress. "Welcome to the Chamber of Secrets!"

  Hermione glanced around. "So you're really the Heiress? I'd just assumed you had caught Harry's sense of humor."

  "Of course I am," Ginevra said. "I command the Basilisk."

  She hissed, "Come." Or possibly "Strangle." Her accent was terrible. The Basilisk slithered towards us, students scrambling out of its way. It came to rest beside Ginevra, eyes closed and waiting for instructions.

  "Go sleep twice," Ginevra said. "Only need look terrifying."

  I would like to reiterate the horror that was Ginevra Weasley attempting to speak Parseltongue. The Basilisk silently accepted this butchery of the language, returning to an empty corner where it curled into a ball.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** Linkffn(Rising from the Shadows) Harry actually removes all the magic binding her to a persons will, gives her a tiara that filters her gaze and translates her speech, and makes her his home bodyguard/living bed.

Linkffn(Weres Harry?) Harry broke one of the Basilisk's fangs off before destroying the diary, and leaves the Basilisk to sleep until it wakes up in Year Five because the school is under attack by Fae.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
