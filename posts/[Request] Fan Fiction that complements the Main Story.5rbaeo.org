Im very new to the Fan Fiction scene, only read one fully so far "Ginny Weasly and the Half Blood Prince" which I loved, as the title suggests it is book 6 from Ginnys perspective. It added to me, much needed story to the Harry/Ginny relationship, which was in my opinion missing from the main story. So i wanted to find more stories like it, that flesh out some background events/characters.

I also tried to read "Dumbledore's Army and the year of Darkness" - I like the more mature tone, but to me Neville and Ginny just seem too out of character, and a lot of what happens does not make sense to me E.g Snape allowing Students to be wiped in front of the whole school, where as in canon Snape was appointed to "protect" the students as best he could without breaking his cover.

So any suggestions for Fics that are canon friendly and complement the main story would be appreciated, im open to all characters but would love a decent Fic about Hogwarts during Deathly Hallows like DA and The year of darkness but a little truer to the tone and characters of the main series.

Thanks in Advance!

EDIT: Wow cheers guys, Starting reading "Not From Others" really enjoying it so far!, also added "Snape Chronicles" "Grave Days" and "The Life and Times" to my read list - should keep me going for a while thanks for all the suggestions!


** Anything from [[/u/FloreatCastellum]]:

"Not From Others", linkffn(11419408): By far the best Year 7 Hogwarts fic

"The Aurors", linkffn(11815544): A very good postwar crime/mystery fic

Most of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]'s 84 stories are a gigantic, canon-compliant, postwar series. "Grave Days", linkffn(5486257), happens right after the Battle; "Strangers at Drakeshaugh", linkffn(6331126), is about Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009.

Going back to the Marauder Era, "The Life and Times", linkffn(5200789), is a great canon-compliant story about the first 6 years of James and Lily's lives at Hogwarts.

"Polyjuice, Memory Charms, and More", linkffn(4291790), is a collection of erotic scenes involving Harry and Ginny.

--------------

"The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(4291790), is canon-compliant until the end of DH, but AU postwar. All was NOT well, the old establishment maintained a tight grip on power and betrayed Harry and his friends, so they decided to fight back, with any means.

** linkffn(7937889) is in Snape's perspective. It's very long but well-written. Definitely fleshes out possible motivations for Snape's specific behaviors.

I liked his childhood and canon years the most, everything else is meh.

** Okay, so first of, I second Not From Others. It's great. I also second Mind's Eye Soul's Reflection, BUT, I'd like to point out, it was written before Half Blood Prince even came out. So as you may imagine, there's a lot of stuff who doesn't line up with canon in any way, but I'd recomend you to keep reading anyway. When I read it, I was looking precisely for the same thing you are, and while I was put off at first, I decided to keep going because the writing style was really good, and I do not regret it in the slightest. It's a beautiful story.

ANd for my own recomendation, I think almost anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3955920/HalfASlug][HalfaSlug]] will be to your liking

EDIT: Oh, and since no one has made that bot yet, I find it my obligation to recomend Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) to you. It's absolutely nothing like what you've asked for, but just trust me on this one and give it a go.

** There's quite a few nice stories out there that explore some minor characters quite well. For instance, I'm quite fond of this one which looks at Percy during book 7, Linkffn(3784000) Additionally, this one touches on Dudley developing as a character in book 7 Linkffn(7129525)

For something a little different, I've always quite enjoyed this story for explaining the Lily/James relationship coming into being, though it's not very serious. Linkffn(2427170) Oh and there's this Lockhart origin story, if you're curious. Linkffn(8098609)

** [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection]] - Luna during /Order of the Phoenix/. One of the only stories I've read that fleshes her out and explains her character. Also great characterization of Ginny.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] - Ginny's diary exchanges with Tom Riddle. Great characterization of both Ginny and Tom Riddle.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/36505][Pieces Universe]] - A series of stories that are canon-compliant. There are a few oneshots in there about other characters during /The Deathly Hallows/, and they're all very well-written.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]] - The village of the dead, Post-Deathly Hallows. Every year, the village hosts a tournament with the prize being 24 hours on earth. The catch: the runner-up is eliminated from existence. Well-written with some interesting world-building, great descriptions, and focus on dead characters moving on.

I've also recced some fics that place during /Deathly Hallows/ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5pzbep/request_can_you_recommend_fics_that_take_place/dcv9uba/][here]].

** I also don't have anything that complement cannon, I went very far out of that range after certain fics...

I'd recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux)

Thats about as close to canon as I can get. The rest are sort of au with Dark! Insane! bamf! Or time travel... Lots of harry joins voldemort with slash too... Not all of them. I have severitus, mentor! Dumbledore etc.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
