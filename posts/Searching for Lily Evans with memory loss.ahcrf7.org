This popped into my head and I thought it would be a good prompt if it wasn't done before. If it hasn't then maybe someone could do something like this?

Basically Lily Evans loses her memories somehow, whether from protecting Harry or a future occasion causing her to forget most of her life.

Later on, Harry bumps into her and recognizes her but Lily is freaked out by Harry's shock and him calling her “mum”. Harry drives Lily away which depresses Harry causing him to want to avoid the woman to avoid any future problems or embarrassment/ hurt.

Lily slowly regains her memories through therapy from St. Mungos or something and tried to work toward regaining Harry's trust/ belief while Harry is avoiding her. Mostly because Harry becomes insulted when Lily suddenly begins to refer to herself as his mother or something.


** Reading that tickled my brain a bit. It took me a while and some incredibly lucky search results, but I found the fic your request reminded me of. I also found out I've been living under a rock because I was very surprised to see what had become of HPFF.

Anyway, if memory serves, [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=190868&showRestricted][Return of the Star by a_shooting_star (HPFF)]] has a fair amount of what you described in it. It's been a few years since I read through it, but I vaguely remember Lily struggling with accepting who she was versus who she'd become.
