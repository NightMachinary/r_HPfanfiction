** Can't remember exactly the name but it was a DBZ and HP crossover. It started out pretty good tbh but then it just got very very strange. Like it randomly started throwing in Star Wars themes and elements and time travel.

** I mean, the cross for weirdest crossovers with HP fics is split (for me, anyway) between The Eagle of Truthiness and The Most Electrifying Man.

**** It was a very nice one shot that made me want to see a little bit more. Harry is a doctor who just kinda goes around helping people with his magic since he's stuck in their world for the time being. The Author left the ending open ended enough so someone could pick it up for a sequel. It made me want more Frozen/HP though...I think Elsa and Harry would be a cute couple

  Anna's birthday was supposed to be perfect. The last thing the Queen of Arendelle wanted was to end up sick and helpless on her sisters big day. Then again, if she hadn't been, she would have never met the green-eyed Wizard and his owl. Coming to the realisation that she wasn't as alone in the world as she thought could really take it out of a person.

  It seems like fanfics have had baby Harry raised by every character in fiction except for one: Godzilla, King of the Monsters! Watch as I descend into madness trying to take this story semi-seriously, by which I mean that it will have a plot that tries to make it work logically.For G-fans, this takes place in the Shōwa continuity (for non G-fans, that means the goofy 60s and 70s Godzilla). For fans of both, or just Harry Potter, sit back and enjoy the lunacy!

** For purposes of this discussion, my take on "weirdest crossover" is one that doesn't work well, or has a disturbing plot. If it works well, and doesn't make me queasy, I just say, "that's fun" or something similar.

It's not Harry Potter, but perhaps the strangest one I've run across is linkffn(The Dalek Invasion of Discworld by Rosethorn).

For crossovers involving HP, linkffn(Darkness of Birth by njchrispatrick) is an Avengers cross that has Howard Stark forcing Tony to give birth to Steve Rogers' son (Harry).

linkffn(Holly, Phoenix, Diamond, and Elm by alienyouthct) is an X-men cross in which Emma Frost rescues Harry from Godric's Hollow, turns him female, and adopts her.

  Howard Stark was remembered as a hero, but he was not a good man. Steve did not expect his friend's dark turn. He would never have believed it if it weren't for Tony's animosity, the certificate tucked into a forgotten drawer, and the photo of a baby with blond hair and curious brown eyes.
