It is a Dramione, but it has healthy laughs. Good fun even if, like me, you've never actually taken part in a live RPG.

Bonus: It's complete!

a short exerpt to give you an idea, as their party rummages through a medicine cabinet trying to find something to heal a wounded member:

"Pansy had been next to try to remedy the situation. Unfortunately, the check being for knowledge has put her at a disadvantage.

Draco shakes his head at her failed attempt. "I'm sorry, your character doesn't know what a tampon is. Anyone else?""


** Y'know what? This is the first Dramione that I've actually enjoyed. Thanks for the rec.

*** I find that as long as it isn't some weak-willed, fragile angsty Hermione getting together with an equally winey (or worse somehow manipulative and dominant) Draco, it's a tolerable pairing. Here, he's goofy and she's living her life. It's nice
