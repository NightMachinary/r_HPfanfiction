I am dying to read A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles, but I can't seem to find it anywhere to download to a pdf so I can take it with me. Anyone know where I can get it?


** Try this: [[http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net/]]

I personally use [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][calibre]] with the [[https://code.google.com/p/fanficdownloader/][fanficdownloader plugin]].
