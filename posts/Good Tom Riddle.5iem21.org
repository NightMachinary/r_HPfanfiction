I've only read two fics where Tom/Voldemort was actually the good guy.


** It's somewhat of a spoiler in A Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali. Damn, I wish it wasn't abandoned.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

*** Shit. Forgot about that one. Make that two good Tommy fics I've read, then. Still can't remember the name of the other one, though I remember what happened in it clear as day. Edited my OP.

**** Not the main character, but how about the Altered Destinies linkffn(3155057) series? It's about Harry going back in time, and eventually adopting a young Tom Riddle

  Albus and Gellert, two bright young wizards, would meet in the summer of 1899 and develop a strong friendship, but would part ways following the death of Albus' sister, Ariana. But what if Ariana survived this encounter? What would it mean for a boy named Harry Potter and the events that would unfold almost a century later?

** You're unlikely to have read it, because, to the best of my knowledge, there's no English translation yet. But why not. (Also, it's less "was actually the good guy" and more "was the Dark Lord for a while, then had a change of heart". And a bit cracky.)\\
There was a wiki input thread on a similar topic a few months back, I should have posted it way back then; looking back I'm really sad that I didn't do it (and the thread is probably archived by now).

The name is (well, translates to) /Professor Riddle's Chronicles/, and the fic itself is [[http://www.snapetales.com/index.php?fic_id=8314][here]] (Russian only, so far).\\
Essentially, Tom Riddle's desperate bid for the DADA position in 1967 goes through after Dumbledore can't find any other candidates again. Turns out that Tom is actually rather tired of all the Dark Lord stuff, and the kids those days don't seem to know anything anyway...\\
Most functional analysis (and probably most math in general) I've ever seen in any HP fic (and that's /including/ that classic ditty /Harry Potter and the Elliptic Integral/).
