Honestly, I'm pretty sure I said everything in the title. I've seen a lot of time travel fics, none done well I'm afraid, and wanted to try the concept out. See how it is when done well, you know?

Iâ€˜ve been fascinated with the idea of them going back to Tom Riddle's fifth year, the one with the Basilisk so if someone has a good recommendation for that, I'd read it.

Oh! Before I forget, no less then 70,000 words. That's reasonably flexible, but not pliant enough to go below 50,000 words.
