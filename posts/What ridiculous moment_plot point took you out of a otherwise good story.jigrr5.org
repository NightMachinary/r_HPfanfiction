The fabled and legendary Hogwarts charter (School Rules). This annoying plot point enables Lord Potter etc to kill a student been 1st years who look at him. The charter allows him to have any and all pets including a Basilisk and a Rayquaza. He can have his own tower and access to the wards and use them to take complete control of the castle.

This annoying plot point usually comes with dickish LORD Potter who immediately looks down on non magical borns who don't have any knowledge about wizarding culture.


** For me, it was A Second Chance. The basic premise is good enough: Sirius gets a trial when Harry is, like, 4 or 5 years old, rebuilds his life, takes custody, all that good stuff. The story's oddly casual about following him (and other characters) into the bedroom when they have sex -- and Sirius has /lots/ of sex -- but I've read my share of smut so other than the tonal shift it's nothing I haven't seen before.

Then at the end of Harry's fifth year, he /still/ falls through the damn veil.

I lost all interest in continuing at that point.

Take your average Malfoy encounter. Rather than just impotently stare at Malfoy or resort to physical violence after he called Hermione a mudblood, most teenagers would just call him a wanker/bastard, say that they fucked his mother and tell him to go suck a cock.

And honestly, there's nothing wrong with that. I'd rather read an impromptu rap battle than some crap about insults and taking it to the Wizengamot. Either fight fire with fire (trade insults) or demand satisfaction and settle things in a proper duel.

*** I don't like the absurd "don't go to Gringotts, my boy. My boy, have a lemon, my boy, drop. They're not potioned. I'm totally paying people to by your friends for the Greater Good (chorus of angels), my boy" fics, because they're absurd. However, canon Dumbledore spends his time raising a child soldier to commit suicide in a specific way. He pushed things such that Harry killed someone at age 11. Looking at canon from a perspective beyond the "well it's a British boarding school novel" shows significant fuckery going on. He is a manipulative bastard, but the usual indy!Harry nonsense is rather absurd when the easier path to power is to remove Hagrid and Sirius from play and tell everyone that the Potters sent him a message and he killed Voldemort in a duel.

Speaking of Sirius, Dumbledore is totally to blame for Sirius going to prison without a trial. He's a top figure in the judicial system. He prevented Snape from going to prison, and there was actual evidence against Snape. Except he didn't do the same for Sirius. Looking at the dates, Harry was left on the doorstep BEFORE Sirius was arrested (and Sirius provided the means to get Harry to safety), meaning Dumbledore didn't intend for Harry to end up in Sirius' care in the first place. Why did so many of the Death Eaters get trials, when the one innocent man didn't?

*** 1) Because he is easy to blame. From Harry's POV (in a grown up hindsight 20-20 sort of way) Dumbledore is on the positive end of the spectrum deeply negligent and the fact that he sends Harry back to the Dursleys is bad. On the other end he masterminded every bad thing until his untimely death to horcrux ring in book six and set Harry up to be a martyr which is also very easy to blame him for.

2) He has too many balls in the air and for a man who preaches second chances the fact that he signed off on Sirius going to Azkaban for 12 years and didn't use that political cloud he has to get Sirius a trial is bad morally.

Dumbledore's actions and lack of actions just stink in hindsight. The lack of information, the secrets, the death of Sirius because of said secrets (In hindsight being the operative word) are painting Dumbledore in a very very bad light.

*** While I get where you're coming from, wouldn't it be in Harry's best interest to not antagonize young Snape? Snape was always on the precipe after all on which side of the war he was part of, and if you can make sure there's one less Death Eater in the world, why not? Same with other Slytherins. Regulus for example, while he was almost certainly a blood purist and not exactly a good person, you could possibly divert him from becoming an actual Death Eater if you were to hint about the lengths Voldemort went to to attain immortality.

It's much more interesting to consider young Snape. Though even then I'm not sure how easy it is to divert him while not putting yourself at risk from other nascent Death Eaters. It's not an easy solution especially if you're going to be applying only social pressure.

As for always being on the precipice, maybe early on, but he told the prophecy to Voldemort knowing that it would lead to a family with a young child being murdered. Not the actions of a person who I consider on the precipice.

But it's not graphic or anything so I read on to see if it gets better. The twelve, nearly thirteen year old girl is now pregnant and decided to keep it and everyone is okay with that, maybe a little surprised, but her own mother doesn't do anything. Especially when they did consider abortion, I don't know very much on the topic, but I do know that it is possible for someone that age to get pregnant (though usually the male has to be a bit older, I think) I can't imagine it's healthy physically or mentally. That really did it for me, couldn't keep reading not a chance.

** I've found that the more fanfiction I read the less I forgive stuff like this, things that just take me completely out of the story for various reasons. This instance is not even really that bad compared to some stories I've read, it just happens to be the most recent.

I was recently reading The Potter Alliance and Harry, Susan and some others were addressing the press/members of the public to talk about what happened during his 5th year basically. At one point the crowd erupts with questions and then the story goes on with

#+begin_quote
  Susan stepped to Harry's side, 'Shut it!' This caused everyone to stop, and she said, 'He said no questions till the end. We will sit here all day if we have to, but let the man finish.'
#+end_quote

I stopped reading and closed the tab. I was enjoying the story up until then but having 15 year olds bark at, and then talk down to reporters/ the public like that ruined it for me. Harry losing his temper and lashing out a bit I can understand (up to a point), he's one of the most famous wizards in Britain if not the world.

But a random 5th year asserting themself lecturing a room full of adults, AND they all do what she says.

Not even remotely believable to me.

I'm not entirely sure why that scene jumped out at me as totally wrong, but like I said previously, it's not the worst simply just the most recent.

** Delenda Est. Beating a dead horse at this point, and if you haven't heard of the fic you must be living under a rock. Anyways, its one of those fics that tries really hard to be good and not do anything stupid, and it works for a bit, but then its obvious that it was too much work for the authors to go against their nature and not do all the dumb shit that they did in Earl of the North.

Now I know a lot of people will think the jump off point is when the second time travel happens, but for me, it's really dead and unsalvageable in chapter 20, when Harry goes to Gringotts, and essentially the goblins gets angry at him for not checking in with them after timetraveling, and that he's caused so much problems for them because of it. As far as I remember (and its been years since I've read the story, with no desire to read it again. This plot point still sticking out to me after all this time just reinforces my opinion of it), the goblins barely have any role in the story other than to bank money (as it should be), so for them to suddenly be saying this shit is the most eye-rolling moment in the entire story, and the story pretty much just keeps going downhill from there.

** Inconsistency in the author's internal story rules. I recall one "underage magic trial goes differently" story in which the Wizengamot basically let Harry take control of the courtroom, interrupting Fudge and/or Umbridge, monologuing without interruption on the points he wanted to (snarkily) make, and nobody ever said, "Hey, kid! Shut up while the adults are talking!"

There was an Azkaban!Harry story in which Harry could produce illusions that were solid and persistent or visual-only and easily disruptible, based on the author's needs at the moment. Similarly, there was a story in which Harry was a Royal Marine, but only when it was convenient.

Other things that will take me out of a story are things that make little to no sense as the jumping-off point for the story:

James Bond/Sailor Venus/the Greengrass family move to Privet Drive? Harry is a senior member of an ancient order of assassins (while still a pre-teen), that carries out incredibly flashy killings in public while wearing distinctive clothing, yet nobody knows about them? Harry is incredibly skilled with both guns and swords and is an enforcer at the age of 6? First year students are heavily into dom/sub relationships? Harry talks like an older teen/young adult at the age of 4? Things like these irk me tremendously.

It won't necessarily take me out of the story, because sometimes it's not obvious until the end, but a Checkov's Gun failure will annoy the hell out of me.
