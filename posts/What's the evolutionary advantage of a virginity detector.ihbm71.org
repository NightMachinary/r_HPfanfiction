** Are we talking about unicorns in canon or in fanfiction? In canon, they just prefer women unless they're babies in which case they don't mind men as much. I don't think a Harry Potter work mentions virginity in the context of unicorns.

In fanfiction, I'd assume it's simply taken from mythology. I usually abhor the Doylist argument but honestly I think it just boils down to the author taking it from mythology and not much else. If they did come up with an explanation, I guess an explanation could be that the authors view virgin girls are more naive and trustworthy (getting a really bad taste in my mouth right now from all the stereotyping) and thus less likely to harm the unicorns.

Maybe the unicorns are super sexist. Or maybe they were created by the common puritan wizards in fanfiction.
