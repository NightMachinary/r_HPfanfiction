** I don't like reading about pregnancy. However, children are a large part of people's lives, so if magic would allow men to have children, some men would have children.

Albus Dumbledore is semi-canonically gay. Some stories (eg Firebird's Son) have put him in heterosexual relationships and then given him children. I have a story hanging around on my hard drive in which he has a husband with whom he has had children -- and so, when Harry is orphaned, he and his husband, Afton Perks, choose to raise Harry along with their daughter, Sally-Anne.

Mpreg in the backstory, and some discussion of it. But with fpreg, you don't usually hear details about how widely dilated the parent's cervix was, or how many stitches their perineum required, so I'm likewise circumspect about the mechanics of male pregnancy.

** I don't read them intentionally. Sometimes you just stumble into one and wonder to yourself, "How willing am I to suspend disbelief today?" In a fandom that revolves around books/movies concerning a /magic school/, my answer is usually obvious. The concept isn't synonymous with bad writing. Weird plot, maybe, but I can work with trash sometimes.

I think authors write it because they want a slash pairing /and/ familial bliss (he has your eyes, Harry) or angst (he has your nose, any-HP-adult-male). To each his own, I guess.

*** I have never read one but my biggest issue with the whole concept is giving birth as a male. I imagine that a lot more painful than as it is by nature.

Edit: to make thinks clear, my issue is the way a male pregnancy would end the natural way, namely squeezing a child through your penis. If you want to make a case about magic then you could take the more logical route and have the two males create a child through magic (in a lab or a cauldron or however) and then have a woman carry it. Or use the cauldron like an artificial womb.

**** Your biggest problem with mpreg is... mpreg. :^{)} lol.

Authors don't really go into the gory detail of their anal babies, as far as I've seen. If they do, it's no worse than reading an in depth account of someone being flayed alive. Mpreg is pretty tame on the scale of fic pain.

**** I think if there's ever real-life mpreg, they'll just do a c-section. A male would be no more likely to squeeze a baby through his penis than he would through his butt, just like women don't give birth through the urethra.

** I used to read them, and typically since HP is a magical story, there is a magical explanation for the whys and hows.

Personally, I'd still pick mpreg over a gender swap story. But again we return to my motto: Your kink is not my kink, but your kink is okay.

Different people like different things.

*** Yes. My main complaint is the same complaint I have with any fic that features pregnancy, male or female. Authors who have not had babies should research pregnancy and know what symptoms appear when. I always scoff when the pregnant character is described as waddling around, complaining about being fat at 3 months along.

** I used to avoid them. Then I had a story blind side me with one. No warning at all. But the story was so good overall, I ignored it. Now, as long as I skip over the explanation of the conception and any decription of the birth, I'm good. As far as I'm am concerned, there was magic, then a baby, yay.

** First, we're speaking of a world where magical beings exist: vampires, werewolves, merpeople, goblins, Veela, giants, and probably others that aren't leaping to mind. We have Metamorphmagi and Animagi---people who can transform theirselves at will into other shapes or animals---so, if all that is possible, why would mpreg be so wildly outside the realm of possibility, given that the impossible already exists? It is, for the purpose of my story, simply another state of being.

The basis for the story was that the ability for men to conceive and carry a child to term was something most pureblood (born of two magical parents) wizards could do, but when the Statute of Secrecy went into effect, the Ministry found a way to suppress the ability. It wasn't until Harry, who was raised in the Muggle world, became pregnant was the plot discovered.

One of the things I consciously avoided was falling into some of the typical mpreg traps. There are no bizarre cravings, no wild mood swings, no bursting into tears at a moment's notice. There wasn't quite enough body horror, but that's not something I write well. The "mystery", such as it was, was a bit too easy to figure out, but on the whole, I'm damned proud of that story.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry Potter fell in love with Severus Snape---and that is where our story begins. All Harry wanted was a quiet year to finish his education, but when the Sorting Hat raises the spectre of Voldemort reborn and Luna is telling him he's going to change the world, a quiet year becomes impossible.

** The problem I have with it is that it often becomes the defining feature of the story. Instead of just moving on with the story, the authors need to spend chapters upon chapters justifying their reasons and excuses, instead of just leaving it as is. Other than that, most slash pairings are "wrong" to me. Nothing against homosexuality, but I throw up when I read SnapexHarry or HarryxDumbledore. Sometimes, just sometimes, it works out, and I guess its allright, if the story is otherwise good.

** tl;dr: I am not bothered by male pregnancy at all.

I never understood why authors go that route instead of using a surrogate carrier that can add more depth and detail to a story by being there. We can then learn what this character likes, dislikes, and a bit about their past. Is this character a previous friend or a new character that the MC went through an agency to find? Is she a pure-blood? Bias? Hateful of the MC? So many questions that could be answered and learned from.

MPREG comes off as lazy and unintuitive writing.

The two characters could do their thing in a potion which would then be drunk by the female and boom, impregnated! Then traits from both males can go in. It's magic, who cares about inconsistencies.

Of course, I do find a pregnant Harry amusing with how he acts, but I would rather a new character be introduced and remain in the story then take the lazy route and just have Harry (or the bottom) do it.
