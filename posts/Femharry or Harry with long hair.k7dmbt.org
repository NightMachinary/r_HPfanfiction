Just as the title says, I am looking for any story that has harry or femharry having long hair.

And when I say long I mean longer than just shoulder length and more like waist length or longer.

I don't have any problem with any kind of slash.


** That would be an interesting direction to take the 'going into hiding' thing. Instead of all of them going, the Potters stay in public, but they put Harry in a highly defended tower somewhere, where the kid can grow up safe and hidden from everyone. They get a little paranoid, and after the 'Incident' James isn't allowed scissors anymore, so Harry's hair just gets longer and longer. Unfortunately, living things continuously resting up against something as heavily enchanted as the tower is tends to have some... side-effects.

Harry now talks to animals, and regularly has mood-swings (as in, Harry starts to sing swing, whenever the mood strikes them - including all the big band sounds). The hair is also slightly... alive and sometimes hisses advice when Harry needs it.

I don't think I've seen a 'Tangled' AU version of HP before. :D

** Fate's Gamble by Lupine Horror and basically every other of their stories. Harry has floor length hair and is very androgynous, still hetero tho.

** I think most fem!Harry-s have long hair, to be over-feminine. E.g., ‚ÄúBecoming Harriet by Teao‚Äù linkao3(4876630).

  Harry gets a surprise on his seventeenth birthday when he discovers a secret Lily Potter took to her grave; a secret that will change his life forever.He must learn to interact with the wizarding world all over again, and discovers the darker sides of inequality and misogyny. Not HBP compliant.
