Every time I read time travel fics they're about (mostly) Hermione and (sometimes) Ginny travelling back to Marauders era. Today I was thinking, wouldn't it be comedy gold if Harry travels back in time to the late seventies/early eighties, with looking like James and him being a baby having to change his own diapers and all that? Does anyone know if such a fic exists?


** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1/Timely-Errors]]) Is a classic

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

** I can give you the classic Marauder era fic but not the baby harry one. At least, not male harry. I know a few female harry ones.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12744735/1/The-Last-Peverell]] -Female harry. Maurader era. James exists. Haven't finished this so chapter54+ is unknown to me

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11626818/1/Threads-Of-Time]] -Female harry. Just after Lily and James die. Helps raise harry alongside Sirius. F!Harry/Sirius

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11540175/1/A-Mishap-and-an-Opportunity]] -Male harry. Marauder era. Tonks is also there with harry.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/community/Traveling-Through-Time/46868/]] Try checking out this. It's a compilation of many of FFN's time travel fics. You might find one you like.

I know a lot more time travel fics though most of them deal with you back to harry's first year.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14403330/chapters/33262935]]

Here, Harry goes back to about a year before he is born, though Light guys don't really like him...

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13414074/chapters/30735705]]

Here when Harry goes back James is in his second year. (it's also my favourite soulmates/tomarry/time travel tbh)

** Here's one you may not have seen.

[[https://ficwad.com/story/34656][The Younger Potter Twin]]

The author has a profile on portkey too but this story isn't there. He's a good writer so his other stories are worth checking out although like other prolific authors some stories share certain elements.
