So it's an exceedingly common trope for fics to praise the every ground Hermione walks on, and to pass Ron off as a hyperbolic idiot with the brain power only to eat.\\
But what about the inverse? I'm curious to see any fics where Ron is praised as Harry's best and most loyal mate, and Hermione is passed off as a rule-strict know it all or something along that line.

I'd especially appreciate it if it was more of an anti-trope or something decent instead of the usual cliches but with Ron instead

The only one I know is this. It's about what Ron and Harry would have done in various situations if Hermione wasn't there.

** You know...I can honestly say I've never seen a negative Hermione if Ron isn't also given the death eater treatment.

I suppose the fact that she generally comes across as the only competent member of the group has something to do with it. I mean, I don't even like Hermione, but I still feel the books could have easily been called "Hermione Granger figured that shit out, why are you here scarhead?"

I don't have a problem with Hermione per se, but I'm very curious to see the reverse clich√© in action

  A mistake by a dying man drives Hermione to obsession as she seeks to unlock the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] During the summer between first and second year Harry prays for help and ends up getting Loki involved in his care. Hermione is bashed (among others) but it's only because it takes a while for her to get used to a more independent Harry. Ron deals with it better but he ends up caught in between Hermione and Harry. I like this because Harry isn't shipped even though some other characters are, and it's complete.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded) is pretty harsh on Hermione (somewhat justifiably, imo, but it's a little over the top) and has Ron as a mostly sympathetic character.

Major canon divergences though, be warned.
