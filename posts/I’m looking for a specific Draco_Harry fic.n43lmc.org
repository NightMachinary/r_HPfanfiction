:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading it on AO3 Draco was a spy for the order but the only ppl who knew that were Snape and Dumbledore draco showed up and was tied to a chair because no one knew he was a spy and he couldn't tell anyone I think because of an unbreakable vow and both Snape and Dumbledore could not be reached even though Draco asked for them there was also a point where moody used crucio on draco or smth similar it is revealed not soon after that he was a spy this was a draco/Harry fic to and I'm about 70% sure Draco saved Harry and that's how he got found out as a spy

if anyone knows what fic I'm talking about plz let me know


** Try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] too :)
