For extra lulz/horror, he only finds out after marrying and having a kid with Ginny.

(I'm not sure enough on the dates to figure out if Arthur could plausibly by Lily's father in this case, but I'm not bothered who the Weasley in question is.)


** That means he and Ginny would be first cousins, not really that bad. If you do a little research, you will find out that birth defects of children born to first cousins are only slightly higher, comparable to raising Women's age by 10 years. The eugenics craze since the late 1800s has blown the danger of first cousin marriages way out of proportion.

This kind of discovery certainly doesn't qualify as horror.

But if Lily had an affair with Arthur Weasley... but still wouldn't explain why Harry looked like James

*** It'd be horrifying for Harry and Ginny if they'd grown up believing first-cousin marriage was bad. Ginny definitely might have if Molly and Arthur pointed at the Blacks and said "don't be like them".

As for Harry looking like James if Lily shagged Arthur, that's simple---you do what a load of Severitus writers do and say Harry's appearance was charmed. Either by Lily to hide the affair, or by Dumbledore for The Greater Good^{TM}

**** Nah, that's because Arthur's mum also had an affair, and so he's the illegitimate son of a Potter :-)

**** If we're sticking close to canon we never see Harry get any sort of sexual education and the wizarding world is full of light inbreeding (I say light because it seems to mostly be cousins, not siblings or anything). I don't recall hearing anyone say anything about the inbreeding in canon (even from Muggle borns and "blood traitors"), so it probably wouldn't be too horrifying.

****** I think they (Rowling and her editors) anti-squicked that one, from being "siblings" to "cousins". I don't think any other pureblood society would /want/ to mix with that sort.

*** If Arthur was Lily's father then Ginny would be Harry's half-aunt (she'd be Lily's half-sister). If it were Arthur's father then she'd be Harry's half-first cousin. Any other plausible Weasley male would bring more distance between them, so it really wouldn't be all that bad from a genetic standpoint (or societal, considering the wizarding world's pureblood family trees).

**** I think that Lily is only like 9-10 years younger than Arthur.

*** You're only looking at it from a genetics standpoint. Lots of people would be perfectly horrified to find that they've been sleeping with a cousin.

Edit: just realized how old this post is. Oops.
