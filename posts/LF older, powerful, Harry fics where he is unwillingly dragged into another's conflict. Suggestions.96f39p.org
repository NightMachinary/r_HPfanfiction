One example of this would be Wind Shear by Chilord. I'm looking for preferably long stories, without slash.

Thank you all in advance.

#+begin_quote
  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. The war ended over a hundred years ago. Harry Potter and Voldemort are old, out of practice, and politely ignoring each other. However, as tensions rise across Europe the Ministry persuades them to join forces to try and end a series of disappearances in the Black Forest. No pairings.

writer leaves it at a cliffhanger then tries to get pay-per-view

was a great story right up until that point. 3 years later no one has ponied up. Wonder why?

BTW leaving it for paywall is against ffnet rules.
