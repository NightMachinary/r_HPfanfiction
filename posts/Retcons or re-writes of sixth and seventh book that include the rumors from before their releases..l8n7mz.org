It mainly compiles all the rumors that appeared in early 2000s about books 5, 6 and 7. I remember that the most popular title for book 6 was "Harry Potter and the Green Flame Torch" and for book 7 it was "Harry Potter and the Forest/Fortress of Shadows", but there were other suggested titles that spawned from JK's riddle on her website that would give away book 6's name such as the Pillars of Storage, the Mudblood Revolt, the Chariot of Light, the Pyramids of Furmat and so on, as well as some of these names being trademarked by WB.

I was wondering if there are any known good fics that incorporate these ideas in a revisited sixth or seventh year stories.


** I was a kid in those days so sadly I've never heard of those names. I gotta say, The Mudblood Revolt is a kick-ass name
