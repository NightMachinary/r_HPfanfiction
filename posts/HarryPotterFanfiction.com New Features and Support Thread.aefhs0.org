Hi everyone,

â€‹

This is Ronnie from FanfictionRecommendations, the new owners of [[https://HarryPotterFanfiction.com][HarryPotterFanfiction.com]] and I wanted to create this thread to keep everyone up to date on which features we've recently launched as well as keep the comments open for further suggestions on what we can improve. Many of the things we're adding today were brought to our attention by the community and we LOVE it.

Thanks for your support - its really fun to see the rebirth of the site!

**** Awesome. I haven't been paying attention because, quite frankly, I don't do anything else when I start reading fanfiction, so I only check back around longer holidays. Say, did the old user account, those that didn't have published fics, get saved? I do remember having some faved fics.
