I don't know if this had been done, I couldn't really find it. Basically, the idea behind it would be that Draco is actually a badass dark wizard that is fully committed to Voldemort. When he kills Dumbledore, he is catapulted into the inner circle of death eaters. What happens next? Tell me what you think, has it been done before? Is it a good idea?


** I have seen it done in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6699485/1/Almost-Perfect-Almost-Yours][Almost Perfect, Almost Yours]], although the murder was not the focus of the story. It was a dark!Draco story and the murder really set him on his path to darkness.

Also on the flip side, I've seen where Draco turns spy like Snape and the murder could be a way to secure his position in the Dark Lord ranks in order to help the Light. I would think here, someone from the Order would have to know he's really not guilty. Otherwise, Draco would have to pass along information anonymously somehow.

Honestly, any idea is good, as long as the follow through is well thought out and well written. Good luck. :)
