Fics where the main character (doesn't matter who, I'm not really picky) stays in their animagus form by choice, curse, accident, etc. and is forced to live as that animal for the time being. I'm good with crossovers, encourage them, even. Thanks in advance!

Fem!Harry leaves the Dursleys and lives in the wild as her animagus form, takes on its characteristics, ends up meeting Nagini and eventually Tom Riddle (I can't give too much more because spoilers but I love everyone's interactions, they're all wonderful.) It's probably one of my favorite fics.

  The summer after her fourth year is the worst one yet and Harry knows with grim certainty that her Uncle is going to kill her before she can even reach her fifteenth birthday. So she leaves. Finds herself by the edge of an forest - knows that no one is going to look for her out there.And she's content on her own - finds the rhythm of survival. Learns.She knows that the day she meets Nagini that she should have left. She's had dreams looking out from those exact slitted pupils - knows that she puts her life in danger every day she stays with Voldemort's familiar. But it's hard to be scared when Nagini huffs about her 'silly speaker' and complain about him working too hard and praises him for his toasty winter bed.But then, it's not Harry Potter who Tom meets that day in the clearing.It's Nagini's 'Little Wolf' - and that changes everything.

  Harry decides it would be a good idea to find out what his Animagus animal was, but when he transforms but can not transform back, things get complicated when he ends up in the hands of Voldemort who refuses to turn him back. How will Harry cope with being Voldemort's pet? Read to find out...

  [HG/SS] AU/Crackfic: One morning, Severus Snape wakes up with a furry visitor snuggled under the quilt with him. As he pulls back the quilt, two glowing eyes lock with his, and everything is turned on its ear. As the rest of his visitor crawls out from under the covers, he realises he has a problem. There is a Nundu cub in his bed, and for some reason, she's bound to him.

  A strange bird appears in the dungeons. One that is hurt and might be a wizard with a depression. What will happen when he finds out that the bird is the abused son of the hated James Potter? Will he be able to help the boy? And what about Severus' friends the Malfoys. What will they say if they find out that Harry Potter is a Shadow Phoenix that is living with Severus Snape?
