I'm in the mood to see molly get taken down a peg or two. Other characters can be bashed, but I specifically want Molly to be bashed. It's just she always seems so overbearing and I'm sick of reading stories where Molly is a mother figure to Harry she's not his mother, and she's also so annoying in OOTP when Harry, and Hermione aren't even her kids, and it's not her house, it's sirius's house, and she's act's rude to Sirius at times, and wayyyy to overbearing.

Bonus points if he starts reading her the riot act in grimmauld place since he can refuse to help with cleaning since firstly he's not her kid, secondly not her house, and thirdly he has an extensive library where he can start learning, because it's not like voldemort is back or anything.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

*** Yeah, but those stories usually focus more on Ron or Ginny bashing, but Molly bashing is usually more of an after thought in those stories. I want ones where if it is a bash fest type of story she get's more than a passing glance. I mean in general i'm pretty suspicious of Molly, because when you look more closely from even chapter 1,2 or 3(can't remember) her actions have been suspect like how she was complaining about muggles so obviously in a MUGGLE train station, and asking her children pretty loudly where platform 9 and 3/4 is.

I mean really think about it at minium she has had to go to that train station twice a year for half a dozen or more years, and went that way herself when going to school, how can she not know where it is.

Also if she has such a problem with muggles couldn't they floo/apperate/portkey/drive etc... there. When taking just those two reasons into account when there is so much more(love potions anyone, her reaction to rita's arcticle in TWT saying how Hermione is Harry's girlfriend, the way sirius treated harry like a grown up pissed molly off) it makes her a very suspicious, and unlikable character.

**** Well... I'm going to defend her, just a little, here.

The platform number: It always struck me as perfectly obvious why she asked the platform number: She was checking if the /children/ knew it.

Didn't your parents ever ask you questions they already knew the answer to, just to see if you knew/remembered the answer? My family did that all the time. When I read that part in the first book I just went "oh, this family play that game too. All right."

As for the rest... Eh. Molly never actually complains about Muggles; outside that "packed with Muggles" comment (which narratively is only there so Harry can conveniently hear a word he recognises), she doesn't seem to have a problem with them, taking more the "Muggles do know more than we give them credit for" attitude... patronising, yes, but compared to the sheer contempt we see other, otherwise sympathetic, wizards and witches show...

The love potion thing? She was telling Hermione and Ginny a funny story. Hermione was giggling about it -- and knowing Hermione, if the story had been "I totally bagged Arthur because I secretly fed him a love-potion!" Hermione would NOT have thought it was funny. My guess is that she told a story about brewing a love potion and making a fool of herself; both to amuse Ginny and give her a slight warning: "Don't do what your silly old Mum did."

Really, almost all Molly's flaws all stem from one thing: Overprotectiveness. If anyone harms, or threatens to harm, "her" children (and she does include Harry in this), then they face her wrath.

She's one of those people who gets angry when she's worried, and perhaps doesn't stop to consider whether or not her worry is actually justified -- she lashes out at the twins because she's worried they are going to end up broke chasing a dream; she lashes out at Ron because she was scared he'd kill himself and Harry with the flying car stunt; she is cold towards Hermione because she thinks Hermione is hurting Harry.... and she's snappish with Sirius because she's worried his recklessness will endanger Harry.

She IS very overbearing and bossy, and she DOES need to back off sometimes. Sometimes she doesn't handle her children all that well, leading to inner tension in the family. But calling her "suspicious," I feel, is stretching it.

Also... I don't think it's unreasonable for Harry to help out with the cleaning at Grimauld Place. He's not actually Molly's son, but he IS staying in the place, and it's fair that he helps out.

***** O.k. I won't argue about most of those points except the platform where Molly, and co have been going for the past five+ years I think, multiple times a year, that still sound suspicious to me, because while I can accept her doing it the first few times, heck the first half dozen times, but Molly, and Ginny have been going there multiple times a year for five years at this point. No matter what that will always seem suspicious to me for that fact alone.

With regards to the last point you bought up, at this point Harry has faced down horrors, and Voldemort for the past four years. His fourth year literally giving back voldemort his body, and him being a part to it, and Molly thinks his time is better spent cleaning up the house instead of either giving him time to either prepare himself, or mourn the loss of an acquantince at least(Cedric). No that is greatly irresponsible, and naive on her part, and is not how a mother would react. Actually a mother would grab her family, and run to try to keep them safe or fight if there was no other alternative, but when you can literally teleport there was an alternative.

Also while she can be a mother to her kids she has no right to dictate how sirius act around or to Harry nor does she have a right to essentialy force Harry, and Hermione to clean up the house when Harry at the least has better thing to do with that time.

Also with Molly having at least been told once of the dursleys treatment of him before this point(and if she didn't believe or at least check for herself, instead of dismissing it then it is her fault not the twin's. Even if my kid's were trouble makers, if they told me this I would never dismiss it I would look into it) she didn't think to herself that maybe she shouldn't be doing basically the same thing by forcing him to do chores.

Lastly Sirius is gracious enough to house the Weasley's, and willing to let the place be used as headquarters she could at the least show a little more respect to him.

Also just to get it off my chest, MOLLY IS NOT HARRY'S MOTHER. I'm a father myself, but unless I saw something like physical violence or emotional harrasment etc... Like I said she can treat her kids how she wants, but she has no right to dictate Harry, and Sirius's relationship. Especially with how much they help each other on an emotional level.

It doesn't need to have happened every time. My family would just ask at random, even if it was a question they had repeated several times before.

It's clearly a way of engaging with the kids -- given Ginny's response, she doesn't seem to be tired of it.

And she clearly thinks he's too young for this. It's not like she doesn't have a point; even if Harry has been forced to do the work of an adult, he ISN'T one. Molly is trying to give him a break from all that, in the hope that he won't have to continue down this path.

She's not being particularly effective in doing so, but I can see where she's coming from.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

He'd had a month to mourn already. It's not like she snatched him straight from the gravesite and forced him to clean Sirius's house. You can also see some hints -- or at least, I can -- that burying herself in work is something Molly does when times are troubled. She may just be trying to keep his mind off things.

As for preparing to fight Voldemort? You KNOW Harry wouldn't have done that anyway. This is fifth-year CAPSLOCK-Harry, if left to his own devices he just sulks, shuts himself away and does nothing. Which is a pretty good sign that he isn't an adult; he's reacting like the teenager he is.

The cleaning is to help out Sirius. His home, after a decade of neglect, is nearly unlivable. Kreacher isn't doing anything to clean up, and the task is too big for Sirius to handle alone. As long as they're there in his house, they might as well do what they can to improve his living conditions a little.

#+begin_quote

Isn't that exactly what she was doing? The entire family, plus Harry and Hermione, have gone into hiding, in a secret location. How's that NOT trying to keep them safe?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Again, what would he have done? Harry is not the sort to sit down and read or prepare unless he HAS to, and it's something he has to do NOW. If he hadn't been cleaning, he wouldn't have done anything.

You're right that Molly isn't Harry's mother, but Harry doesn't HAVE a mother. And for the most part, he doesn't seem to mind Molly treating him as a son... he's touched when he overhears her saying he's "as good as" one of her children, even if he doesn't like what he deems her "mollycoddling."

Like I said; her flaws stem from overprotectiveness. Thing is, she's not 100% wrong; Harry IS underage, and his relationship with Sirius, such as circumstances has shaped it, isn't really healthy for either of them. I'm not really certain that they DO help each other that much on an emotional level.

Not saying their relationship is all a bad thing, or that they aren't helping each other on some level... and certainly it'd do more damage than good to separate them. But neither of them is really prepared to be the other's main emotional support.

You can see it especially in the fourth and fifth book: What Harry really wants, really NEEDS, is an adult he can talk to and rely on, who can listen to his troubles and help him out. He tries to place Sirius in this role, but the problem is that it's not a role Sirius is in any way ready for.

Sirius has too many issues; after a decade of emotional hell in Azkaban, he's not the most stable of people... and he hasn't had a chance to grow and mature into the adult Harry needs. Now, he obviously loves Harry, and he does try his best to be that adult, but he doesn't really manage. Problem is that emotionally speaking he's little more than a teenager himself.

It's clear to Molly, even if it isn't to Sirius, that has Sirius has started seeing Harry as a replacement for James; the best friend that Sirius used to get into trouble with. Just as Harry is trying to fit Sirius into the role of responsible adult, Sirius is trying to fit Harry into the role of partner-in-crime and co-conspirator.

They can't give each other what they really need.

Now, do I agree that Molly handled this poorly? Yes! Her comment to Sirius about not being there for Harry was WAY out of line, and Lupin is right to call her out on it and remind her that she's not actually the only one there who cares about Harry.

But Molly is also under a lot of emotional stress. She's constantly afraid that her family's going to die, Percy isn't talking to her, Ron's likely to go off and get himself killed alongside Harry, and Harry's in constant danger. Sirius isn't helping with his mood swings and his attempts to try getting Harry to take unnecessary risks. The woman's on a constant verge of a breakdown, but due to circumstances she's stuck in this situation -- just like Harry and Sirius are stuck with it.

It's perfectly fair to not like Molly as a character... I'm not always the biggest fan of her either. But there's a lot more going on with her than just being the bitchy overbearing mother who needs to be taught a lesson.

******* A lot of what you said I can agree with, but while Harry may have only done the things that you stated there were other adults who could have helped him out instead of just Molly. Also when locked in a room in the Dursleys with little to no contact with friends, and Molly having been told of his abuse at least once she should have known better that he hasn't properly mourned yet.

You need friends, family, and a support structure to get through that. Yes Harry would have acted like a teenager in that way, but it would have been a start. Making him clean up the house was not the way to go. He either needs to act like an adult or act like a cleaner or act like a teenager. Out of all of them I would rather he act like a teenager, but he can't. Simple fact is he doesn't have a choice, and when Molly, and everyone else don't try to prepare him for the coming trials that is terrible. I meant it is a caregivers job to prepare their children for the world so Molly fails in that pretty badly as well. It's frankly irresponsible. To be fair it's not all on Molly, but she could have made better choices. If she can make him clean, why not make him study.

Also with the Sirius, and Harry relationship while it may be unhealthy at first, it's what they both need, and would have progressed beyond replacements if it was given a chance. I place a good portion of the blame of Molly. Hell if they were just given even a few hours a day to get to talk, and know each other Sirius might still be alive. I'm not saying he would be, but it might have changed somethings

Also you didn't address my other points. Please if you're going to reply please don't just pick, and choose at least a passing sentence like how about Molly clearly knowing of the abuse or possibly worse ignoring her own children, and not looking into it herself. I don't know which is worse, but both don't paint Molly in a favourable light.

******** I'm sorry, the posts were getting so incredibly long that I prioritised the questions I had immediate answers to, and the thing with the Dursleys is a big topic. But, if it helps:

Actually, the only thing she was told was that Harry was locked up and that they were starving him. If she was told any other details, that's either off-page or in a scene I can't find at the moment. Her response to the latter is to feed Harry extra.

Now, I WOULD agree with you that she would have done well to try and find out more... but here's the thing. As far as the narrative is concerned, Dursley-abuse doesn't really matter. And this is because the DURSLEYS don't really matter.

The Dursleys are, in essence, the old storytelling trope of "the Mundane Adoptive Family that takes care of the Hero until he's ready to Start his Journey and Fulfil his Destiny." And since they represent the inferior mundane life that Hero leaves behind, he can't be too attached to them... so they have to EITHER be killed off at the beginning so that the hero can't return to them, OR they have to be so awful that he doesn't WANT to return to them.

The HP narrative goes for the latter, but also wants to make sure that the Hero isn't too browbeaten. And so, the Dursleys become over-the-top, buffoonish caricatures with NO redeemable qualities, whose rather cartoonish abuse of Harry never has any lasting effects.

Harry is locked in the cupboard without food? No worries, he can sneak out during the night and take what he wants from the fridge. Harry is threatened by Dudley the Bully? Actually, Dudley is too stupid and lazy to pose a real threat. Harry was kowtowed and punished for talking back? Wait, no, he talks back all the time and nothing really happens.

The Dursleys are cartoon villains. They're horrible, but ineffectual --- and they become more and more out of place as the series goes on.

They fit in well enough in the first book, where everything was simplistic, but as the series went on and things got more complex and, for want of a better word, "realistic" -- the Dursleys remained caricaturish buffons.

And their treatment of Harry is never really brought up, EVER, outside the Dursley scenes. When Harry is in the wizarding world, the Dursleys may as well not exist. They belong to his other life, they're not "real" the way the wizarding world is.

Hence, you only need to refer to their horribleness every once in a while so that we can be reassured that no matter how dark Harry's adventures get he's still better off in the wizarding world... but anything that happens to Harry while he's with them doesn't really "count." Every year when he leaves for the wizarding world, it's more like he's waking up from a bad dream: unpleasant while it happens but ultimately it's not going to have a great effect.

And that's the seriousness the narrative treats the Dursleys with. For all intents and purposes, they're a bad dream that Harry sometimes has to endure. He doesn't take them any more seriously than that, and neither does anyone else.

So Molly's reaction here? That's not really on her. It's just how the series is put together. Tons of fanfics have been written about what awful a person Dumbledore is to send Harry to the abusive Dursleys, and what jerks the wizards are for not seeing how abused Harry was, but these fics kind of don't get the storytelling trope here.

True, but they didn't. Well, that's not completely true -- Hagrid tried, at the end of book four. It's easy to forget, but Cedric's death took place almost a month before the end of the school year, and Harry had a month at Hogwarts, during which he only wants to talk to Ron, Hermione and Hagrid.

So that means Harry has had two months --one in the "real" world and one in his "bad dream" world. Granted, he's not OVER Cedcic's death at this time, but it's wrong to say that he hasn't had time to mourn.

That no other adult figures reached in, can't be blamed on Molly either; she didn't tell them to stay away.

#+begin_quote
  You need friends, family, and a support structure to get through that. Yes Harry would have acted like a teenager in that way, but it would have been a start. Making him clean up the house was not the way to go. He either needs to act like an adult or act like a cleaner or act like a teenager.
#+end_quote

It's made pretty clear in both the forth book and the fifth one that Harry doesn't WANT friends, family or a support structure. During his time at Hogwarts, he only wants to talk to Ron, Hermione and Hagrid.

Harry plain isn't interested in taking any help. OOTP is the book where he tries to withdraw from everybody -- he doesn't quite succeed, but for a while there, he doesn't do much.

And honestly... doing chores is not such a terrible thing, and teenagers won't take any harm from it. When I was fifteen, it was my job to keep the family house (except for the bedrooms) clean. It was a dull job, but it was one I did nevertheless because I had to help out where I could.

#+begin_quote
  Simple fact is he doesn't have a choice, and when Molly, and everyone else don't try to prepare him for the coming trials that is terrible. I meant it is a caregivers job to prepare their children for the world so Molly fails in that pretty badly as well. It's frankly irresponsible. To be fair it's not all on Molly, but she could have made better choices. If she can make him clean, why not make him study.
#+end_quote

Molly doesn't KNOW that it's unavoidable. Harry himself doesn't know it at this point. Dumbledore is the only one who knows about the prophecy, and he'll be keeping it to himself until the end of that year.

Far as Molly is concerned, it's the Order's job to fight Voldemort. Hopefully Harry won't HAVE to get involved at all -- yes, obviously he's a huge target, but that's all the more reason to keep him protected, and with any luck Dumbledore will finish of Voldemort. This isn't irresponsible; I's say Molly's judgment is actually very sound here. There's a difference between "preparing the children for the world" and "making them train for a war that they don't need to be fighting."

She just doesn't know that Harry is the main protagonist of the series and as such has to be the one to take down Voldemort. In her eyes he's a kid who's already risked his life too many times and who's done and been through too much because the adults in his life have not done a good job of protecting him.

So she goes too far in the other direction and wants to shield him from it all. Not the ideal thing to do, but with the information she has, I wouldn't call it irresponsible. Once again, it's overprotectiveness that guides her here.

#+begin_quote
  Also with the Sirius, and Harry relationship while it may be unhealthy at first, it's what they both need, and would have progressed beyond replacements if it was given a chance. I place a good portion of the blame of Molly. Hell if they were just given even a few hours a day to get to talk, and know each other Sirius might still be alive. I'm not saying he would be, but it might have changed somethings
#+end_quote

You make it sound like Molly was actively hindering them in spending time together. She wasn't; they had plenty of time to talk and she didn't try to chaperone or tell Sirius not to be around Harry or anything like that. She DID tell Sirius not to share Order information with Harry, and she DID say that she was afraid Sirius thought Harry was James... but there's no part of the book where she's keeping them from TALKING.

********* I'll go from the last to first, and i'll keep it shorter since i'm getting tired now.

While it's never said it is implied that Molly doesn't approve of their relationship, and we both know that Molly is someone who would try to interfere in the interest of protecting Harry, also if he spends all his time cleaning, and in a house with a family as large as the weasleys, and order members dropping in, and two friends who would monopolize a lot of his time Harry would never get much of a chance to spend quality time with Sirius outside mealtimes. That's why Molly made that comment about Sirius, and James, and why it may be true. I mean think about it Harry acts a lot older than his age, mixed with Sirius being locked into Azkaben for twelve years, and Harry not being much younger(at least mentally) than James, with Harry being almost a physical clone of James, and Sirius's mental torture. The best way to getting around that is time, something Molly nor basically everyone else gave them.

Yes, but she does know that he has faced Voldemort numerous times, and even a basilisk. She, and everyone else know that Voldemort really want Harry dead, this is further supported by the beginning of OOTP. While Molly, and everyone may not know the prophecy, they do know that Harry is in incredible danger, and maybe it would be good to train them at least a little bit. I mean there not idiots, they know Hogwarts has teens not far from adulthood who are Voldemort supporters. So it would make sense to make sure they can defend themselves.

Just, because he doesn't want support doesn't mean he shouldn't get it. That's why it's called support. People shouldn't have to ask to be supported by practically family members.

No, but we aren't discussing others failings(that would take days) we're talking about Molly's, and when you're sopposed to be "as good as" she should have tried to reach in. So either she's a somewhat bad mother, or she doesn't care so much about Harry.

Next topic. It does count. we're not applying movie logic to this entire argument, we're applying real world logic, and in the real world that would be incredibly irresponsible, and quite possibly a criminal mentality. If we just applied movie logic to these type discussions or rants they wouldn't exist. That's all i'll say on it.

This is speculation and not evidence. Besides, after the first week, the kids' cleaning sections seem, from what I can tell, to mainly take place during Order meetings, which they aren't allowed to sit in on anyway. Outside Order meetings, Sirius was just as involved in the cleaning; there was nothing to stop him and Harry from tackling a room together and chat that way.

There's no evidence that they did this -- but there's no evidence that they DIDN'T, either. So since we can't say one way or another, I'm not prepared to accept "she is someone who WOULD" as a valid argument.

The kids are going to Hogwarts, where they'll get lessons from professional educators. Yes, WE know that this year's Defence lessons will be terrible, but MOLLY does not know this. You keep demanding that she act on information she doesn't have.

If Harry's hearing hadn't gone well, that would have been the time to start private lessons -- but since it DID, the priority is get Harry to Hogwarts where Dumbledore can keep an eye on him. NOT to prepare him to fight Voldemort, which Molly thinks is avoidable.

It's not that he doesn't ASK, it's that he deliberately AVOIDS. Short of barging into his room and forcing him to talk (which would have unleashed another temper tantrum, no doubt), there isn't a lot they can do. If he's not ready to accept the help, it's hard to force it on him.

If we're going to apply "real world logic" to this, then EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER IN THE BOOKS would be either criminally insane, or just criminal, and need to be locked away. And in that case Molly is far from the worst case.

Harry is KIND of under close scrutiny with Fudge breathing down his neck and looking for any excuse to have him expelled from Hogwarts. Harry is underage; if he uses magic, the Trace will go off. Not sure how this will affect the Fidelius, but likely the Minister will be informed that spell such-and-such was performed in Harry's vicinity -- which means household spells and similar are probably okay, but COMBAT SPELLS? Harry would be expelled before he could blink.

For me though, from what i've observed of her character it's more likely that she would keep Harry, and Sirius apart to "protect" Harry. While they had one nice moment they also had a few bad moments.

Close scrutiny or not i'm 90% sure that someone from the order could have removed the trace, or let Harry use their wand, and don't say they wouldn't, the amount of laws that were broken in fifth year by the good guys is astronomical. If they thought it would protect them, and possibly stop Voldemort(because last I checked at this point Harry has survived more encounters with him than all of the order, we know it's mostly luck, and some skill, but what do the order members actually know about the confrontations.) they would do it.

Just, because that's how the series treat child abuse, it doesn't mean it is right. Unless you approve of that you should understand that it is very wrong, once again fictional or not. Also last I checked it did actually have an effect on his personality. At the very least he was an introvet with few friends, and way more forgiving than a kid/teenager should be.

I mean while I like Ron somewhat you've got to admit that he was a bit of a prat in his earlier years, and most people who don't have a similar personality(i.e. Harry) would have dropped him as a friend, but Harry didn't, because Ron was his first friend, so even if Ron killed Dumbledore he would eventually forgive him, because he fears being alone again(also I was using the above scenario as an extreme example, but I don't honestly know how that would play out).

Sorry, I disagree. Especially since we never saw it happen. Some things can be assumed to have taken place off-screen, but Molly deliberately keeping Sirius from talking to Harry? That is too important a plot point not to even mention. It's FAR more plausible that they had several nice moments off-screen and this didn't make it to the narrative because it wasn't important.

And really, it's Harry's fault that he didn't talk more to Sirius. He ignored the two-way mirror that would have kept them in touch while Harry was at Hogwarts. He ignored it because he thought he was keeping Sirius safe, but nevertheless -- you can't blame Molly for this.

#+end_quote

The Trace isn't tied to the wand, but to Harry. If anyone does magic in his vicinity, the Ministry knows about it, AND they know what spell was used, so lending him another wand won't work. Remember, Harry got in trouble for Dobby doing magic at Privet Drive, and Dobby wasn't even using a wand.If they thought it would protect them, and possibly stop Voldemort(because last I checked at this point Harry has survived more encounters with him than all of the order, we know it's mostly luck, and some skill, but what do the order members actually know about the confrontations.) they would do it.

From what Lupin says in DH, the ONLY thing that can break the Trace is the wizard turning seventeen. There are simply some magics that can't be broken before their time; the blood protections on Privet Drive could not be broken before Harry was seventeen -- and once he WAS, they couldn't be put back up again.

So yes, I CAN say, and I AM going to say that it's perfectly plausible that they couldn't do it.

Dude. I was an introvert with few friends. I was forgiving to the max. I have never been abused in my life. Some kids/teenagers ARE like that.

Really. Ron was a prat in the earlier years. The bloke who literally was on Harry's side in EVERYTHING until the blow-out in fourth year. Who lived with him for seven years and only fought with him twice.

The same bloke who kicked off their friendship by reassuring Harry that no, he wouldn't be the worst wizard at school.

The same bloke who stuck by Harry even when the entire school was shunning him, TWICE, over two years -- even when this led to everyone shunning Ron as well.

The same bloke who made sure Harry would get Christmas presents , who sacrificed himself in a giant chess game, who stood up on a broken leg and said "If you want Harry, you'll have to kill all of us."

Yeah, can't IMAGINE why Harry would want to be friends with such an utter bastard.

If you'd said he was a prat in the LATER years, I could have understood that better, because he had some really douchey moments especially in the last two books... But Ron in the early years? He's a FAR better friend to Harry than Harry is to him.

In fact, this is something that can be said for both Ron and Hermione; they support and help and are there for Harry almost constantly, and Harry very seldom does the same for them. This can be explained somewhat; Harry's problems are bigger and he does need more support... but sometimes he's just callous.

When Ron is angry at Harry, he sulks and pulls away. When Harry is angry at Ron, he screams, hurls insults, tells him to go away, and throws badges at him.

When Harry's hand is hurt, Ron and Hermione wait up for him with Murtlap essence. When Hermione's hand is hurt, Harry says "you'd better get to the hospital wing," finishes his breakfast, and goes off to class.

Although one thing that I will admit that annoyed me, and probably soured my opinion of the film a bit was the whole slytherins go bad was said by HAGRID not Ron.

The movies, past the first one, just turn Ron into a huge whiner. They take away all his one-liners except the ones that makes him seem like a doofus or a jerk. Pretty much all his COOL lines are given to Hermione instead; chief among them the "if you want Harry you'll have to kill us all" moment.

Book-Ron is trying to stand up on a fucking broken leg to pretty much place himself between Harry and what he thinks is a crazed killer. He's in pain, he's scared out of his mind and he's NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE KILL HARRY, DAMMIT.

Movie-Ron just sits and sobs while Super-Awesome Hermione (who has been shoved down our throats as the only competent member of the trio throughout that movie) delivers the "kill us all" line.

I know Steve Kloves was a Hermione-fan, but some of the movies are just such blatant Hermione-worships that I just get sick of her. I LIKE Hermione, and I even like Emma Watson's portrayal of her... but the script really oversells her.

As for Hagrid... I can forgive the movies a lot with him because Robbie Coltrane is just so GOOD in the role. Actually, that is something the movies do well -- with a few exceptions, the actors are really good.

Thing about a good sidekick character is that he NEEDS to make some positive contribution to the story, otherwise he's mainly just an annoying distraction.

After the "chess" scene, Ron doesn't really get a lot -- he busts Harry out from the Dursleys in "Chamber of Secrets," but after that he doesn't actually accomplish anything of note until the seventh book, when he saves Harry from drowning.

Otherwise he's mainly just along for the ride. Even the small victories he gets happen off-screen and are overshadowed by Harry and/or Hermione.

Which is why he NEEDED that moment of "go through me." Because all through the second movie and the third movie, he's been portrayed as this whiny dragalong who does nothing of value. In the books at least he gets to provide exposition and explain how the wizarding world works, plus he gets to be the one person Harry can relax and just be himself around. You don't get this in the movies, so I was really peeved when I found that he was denied even this moment where he at least proved his valour.

It's not that I mind that the Ron of the movie has become more of a comedy relief character, it's more that he's clearly being written by someone who doesn't like him.

Steve Kloves was stated to be a Harry/Hermione shipper, so he seems to like undermining Ron and showing how unimportant or pathetic he is. The result is that the movies aren't about Harry, Ron and Hermione -- they're about Hermione and Harry... and that silly whiner Ron, whom they sometimes let tag along.

I mean I get how Dumbledore said he doesn't think he exists, but wasn't he saying that in some type of limbo. I mean really you can't deny he exists when you are literally speaking AFTER you died. A being like that has to exist otherwise you would have almost everyone just doing whatever they want when they die.

************************ Well, there can be an afterlife without there being a literal personification of Death. :)

Don't have the book here, but I don't remember Dumbledore saying anything about whether or not Death exists... he just says he doesn't think the Deathly Hallows ever actually belonged to Death and that the "Three brothers met Death by a bridge" was just a story.

************************* Yeah, but it was strongly implied he believed he didn't exist, heres an excerpt

“So it's true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers---” “---were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.

Also think about it. He said legend, that usually means untrue, fanciful, twisted. Obviously ghost, and souls exist, and they can stick around, so if death didn't exist there would be a lot more ghosts, afterall you'll need someone/something to ferry all those souls to the great beyond.

** Generally Robst has a lot of Molly+Weasley bashing... in particular "In this World and the Next" comes to mind. The quality of his writing is well known, so I'll not belabour the point.

Another story I vaguely remember having Molly bashing:

Faery Heroes too I think:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233288/1/Faery-Heroes]])

It's a pretty common theme in HHr stories (which I read a lot) so I'm having trouble remembering particular stories.

*** Hey read the first chapter of Faery Heroes, and I have to ask, I read that the Potter books greatly power up a Wizard/Witch. Will this be a OP Harry story? I don't mind if it is or isn't, but would like to at least know this much before I go further.

*** “That Robst's writing never really improved over time meant that with each fic I got more and more frustrated while reading. I was always going to discontinue reading his fics.”

It's too bad because many of his stories begin with a really great premise.

Edit: this is what happens when I comment at 5:00 in the morning. I was attempting to satirize some of Robst's more annoying writing tendencies in those first two sentences, but I'm not sure why I put them in quotations.

Who are you quoting here?

Anyway... it's a bit of a shame because he's not a bad writer from a technical standpoint. His stories just never aspire to anything interesting...

***** In my eyes, his execution is very poor and redundant. Every story of his starts out interestingly enough then chases back to what he's already written before. It's like a criminal on the run from the police going in circles, hoping whoever's going after him will follow his direct path and not take any shortcuts. Reading the many reviews he receives for his stories, it seems like many of the people on there follows the circles, neglecting the shortcuts many users on here have seen.
