I want fics that explore the magical world. Rowling created a wonderful universe and I feel most fics including the books didn't explore it to its full potential. Don't get me wrong I loved the HP series. Its just most of the story and its fanfics takes place at Hogwarts and really doesn't fully exploit the magical universe Rowling created.

  The tale of a Diary that was a little more independent, and a little less puppy-murderingly evil, than he was really given credit for. After all, what's a bit of major violation of the laws of ethics and magic between friends?

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley. And ends up joining Bill on a Cursbreaking expedition to Cambodia. He gets far more than he asking for! Disturbing news, promises, trouble and danger keep following Harry's every step.

** Linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has quite a bit of great worldbuilding, for example there's a dark lady from central America with ancient Aztec rituals, a dark lord from Africa who has control over nundus, a dark wizard from Russia who gained his power by stealing from Siberian natives and a seer from east Asia. Unfortunately it's not complete, but it's updating again now, it was on hold for a few years while the author was finishing linkffn(The Arithmancer) which also has some worldbuilding about magical academia and science.

** Basilisk-born by Ebenbild

This story talks a LOT about the history of the wizarding world, starting around Merlin's time.

Story: When Harry Potter is attacked by the dementors while he is with the dursleys, a mysterious figure sends him back in time thousands of years. The mysterious figure takes Harry's place so no-one is suspicious when the real Harry goes missing.

The story follows both the mysterious figure who takes Harry's place at the present, and Harry in the past. The story has a LOT of mystery, and expands and explores the magical world, especially its history. It never often admits the answer to a mystery quite suddenly, instead the clues slowly pile up until you figure out yourself for sure the answer to some of the mysteries.

This story also has some outstanding plot twists to top that all!\\
