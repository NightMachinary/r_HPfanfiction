Its all the same with either brother/sister/or even longbottom being it, then thought harry lost his magic or just plain neglect/still at his aunts house. Only seen a few well done ones that doesnt use this format


** I suspect it is because the purpose of WBWL as a device is /not/ to shake up the the stations of canon, not usually.

Often it is used as an easy crutch to make Harry be even more wronged by everyone around him. It is employed so that Harry has zero positive authority figures in his life (not even his parents). I don't quite understand /why/ this is such a popular proposition, but there's no denying that it is often used to achieve a 'betrayed fic'.

Betrayed fics seem to be common in a lot of young adult fanfic. Percy Jackson, Pokemon, Harry Potter, Naruto, all of them have some variant on the concept of 'Protagonist has been betrayed by everyone he ever knew, with the exception of SexyWoman. But see how he curb stomps them when his true power is revealed!'

It's a way of really ratchetting up the power fantasy, and really leaning into the image of an independent hero who doesn't need no one else because he's just so amazing.

So these fics use WBWL, or Azkaban!Harry, and then largely follow the same notes of canon, only with some added extra 'awesome independant Harry putting down all those who betrayed him!' They're not concerned with altering the story or setting, they just wanted to set up more bad guys for Harry to stomp on his way to final victory.

** The starting scene is ALWAYS Voldemort going to the Potter's house, seeing an ugly fat crying baby and a ~mysterious~ slim baby with green eyes, deciding to kill the green eyed one because obv the crying one couldn't be his prophesied enemy (because its sooo unreasonable for babies to cry), Harry deflects him with some powerful magic, some debris comes down and makes a mark on his twin's face/body, Dumbledore comes in and sees the mark on the twin and decides that he is the BWL (doesn't bother to check Harry because reasons), sends Harry away to the Dursley's because all the attention has to be on the BWL, and Lily and James let him because- despite risking their lives at 19 to fight an evil tyrant- they are clearly secretly evil.

*** Doesn't bother to check Harry because defeating Voldie used up all his magical energy and he's unconscious, but Dumbledore assumes he slept through the whole thing.

**** Dumbledore uses a spell to check their magical energy levels and discovers that Harry is a Squib (when he really just used up all his magical energy defeating Voldemort). Grandma Longbottom and Uncle Algie decide to drop their child out of a window to check if he's a Squib rather than use this spell because reasons.

***** I've read mentions in a fic or two that "testing" children's magic like this was a tradition from the Bad Old Days. None of that new-fangled "we can just use a spell" for Augusta and Algernon Longbottom. (I've seen stories where Uncle Algie was sometimes her brother-in-law and sometimes her brother---but has anybody ever written them as twins? With names like that...)
