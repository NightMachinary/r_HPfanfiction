Is there any good story with a centaur/s as a main hero/es?

Doesn't matter if it's a canon character, human canon character turned centaur, an OC.

If he/she/they (by some miracle) attend to Hogwarts, it's even better.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Endless Possibilities) The most recent plot-line focuses on the Centaurs at Hogwarts.

  After Frisk's first year at Hogwarts, things should be looking up for the Dreemurr family, as the awarding of the Order of Merlin suggests. But the next new students at Hogwarts may tip some very delicate scales... and in the Underground Kurt Kairos and Sans have a project of their own. Sequel to Harry Potter and the Underground's Saviour.
