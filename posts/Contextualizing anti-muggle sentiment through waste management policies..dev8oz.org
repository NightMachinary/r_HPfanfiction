So I was watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGPC26x5Hr4][Ordinary Things]] on youtube and it struck me that there might just be a modern (post industrial revolution) cause for anti-muggle beliefs in Britain specifically.

Let's look at this through the lens of Lucius Malfoy.

Born in 1954, just two years after the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smog_of_London][Great Smog of London]] which directly killed some 4,000 to 6,000 people and effected the health of around 100,000 in total.

Now Lucius would have no direct experience of this event, but the people who raised him would certainly have been shaped by it. His parents may have even been trying for a baby during the smog itself.

The total wizarding population in the UK sits somewhere around 5,000. A world wide sporting event held every four years only attracts around 100,000 people. Keep in mind that travel is near instantaneous for this community and there's no equivalent to TV for people to experience the game at home.

So in just 5 days, Muggle pollution has killed what amounts to an entire countries worth of people, and made the equivalent of all of Europe sick... by accident.

So the muggles stop burning their garbage and instead let it fill the streets, which you can watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knOV2favJWU][here]].

We know that staunch segregationists like the Black family still resided within London, so it's not hard to imagine a young Lucius Malfoy walking through urban streets on occasion and seeing the squalor that Muggles lived in.

Being the isolated and privleliged child that he is, Lucius doesn't understand that Muggle's can't just vanish waste, nor do they have access to the supernatural cleaning efforts of House Elves. To young Lucius, they stink, they fight and they destroy the world and if he voices this opinion, his family and social peers nod and agree.

Escaping to rural surrounds of Hogwarts, again maintained by magic and a bevy of House Elves, it stand in stark contrast to the filth of the mundane world. But that Muggle loving fool Dumbledore lets mudbloods attend the school, when he should know that Muggles destroy everything that they touch.

its an old post but along similar lines to the point you are trying to make

  After all Albus Dumbeldore was born in 1881 so he would have been in about his third year during The Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894. and Dumbledore is not even close to the oldest wizard we see in the books

*** Thanks. The linked post reminds me of a scene from Prince Of Slytherin. Harry explains Salazar's anti-muggle beliefs from within the context of his own time, 1000AD not 1990.

The basic notion was that the vast majority of muggleborns that survived long enough to be enrolled in Hogwarts were Illiterate, unwashed and deeply superstitious... because they were peasants!

Slytherin wanted to locate Muggleborns as soon as possible and abduct/foster them into wizarding families.

There was another story were the rising living conditions of the muggle world in relation to the magical world meant that muggleborns were no longer content to live as second class citizens anymore.

Wait, what? Malfoy Manor is in rural Wiltshire. For most wizards, the only contact with London they'll ever have is King's Cross for school, and Diagon Alley for shopping. They aren't exposed to or care about changes in the Muggle world, which is why Irish students are still invited to Hogwarts even though (South) Ireland left the union in the 1920's. The average wizard lives in isolated rural areas, like the Weasleys, Diggories, and Lovegoods, and doesn't even know how to dress like a normal Muggle even though it's a law set by the International Confederation. The average wizard doesn't understand technology. [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-hogwarts-express][They had to steal a steam train]] because they couldn't build one themselves.

#+begin_quote
  "Where exactly the Hogwarts Express came from has never been conclusively proven, although it is a fact that there are secret records at the Ministry of Magic detailing a mass operation involving one hundred and sixty-seven Memory Charms and the largest ever mass Concealment Charm performed in Britain. "

I doubt wizards could connect pollution to Muggle industrialization/technology, if they don't understand technology.

Idk man, if the anti-muggle sentiment and wizarding superiority isn't based on prejudice, but because there are valid reasons that muggles are morally inferior to wizards, then the whole theme of the books is made irrelevant. I guess you could write a fanfic based on that, but it slips into the territory of legitimizing the Death Eater cause and turning Voldemort into an Ecoterrorist Crusader.

I feel I address this point in mentioning 12 Grimmauld Place which is located in the Borough of Islington.

Additionally we see our main characters walk from Gimmauld to Kings Cross.

#+begin_quote
  It took them twenty minutes to reach King's Cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats for Harry's entertainment. Once inside the station...
#+end_quote

And the Weasley's drive to Kings Cross in other years. There is canonical precedent for Wizards walking through Muggle areas.

For further reference, all the odd people that Harry notices in the first book before Hogwarts. Even Vernon notices them one the streets after Voldemort's' incorporealization.

**** Yes, but the Weasleys taking an hour long car drive is certainly the exception in a world where you can instantly teleport.

***** I think we're getting a bit off topic here, but I feel the presence of the Knight Bus, Brooms at transport and the outlawing of Magic Carpets infers desire in British wizards to avoid the uncomfortable use of Apparition and Portkeys.

Either way, all this hypothetical young Lucius Malfoy would have to do was look out of a window whilst visiting the Black family residence. I don't imagine Lucius to have some grand theory and understand Muggle culture in any depth, only that he sees Muggles as inherently dirty and never seeks to examine his own conclusion because 11 year olds don't really do that.

****** The thing is, smog wasn't fully understood even by scientists at that time, so wizards figuring out complex chemical reactions between various forms of air pollution seems a bit off. And most wouldn't be exposed other than the skies above Diagon because they live in rural areas and have various forms of instant teldportation.

As for the Weasleys, Devon to London are two hundred miles. I don't think that Rowling thought their "drive" through.

******* I see what OP is getting at though. Sure, wizards may not understand complex chemical reactions but they don't need to in order to form superficial, prejudiced opinions.

Even if they teleport most places, they do live in this world. Seeing as how the hospital, Diagon Alley and the ministry is in London, it's safe to assume a decent amount of traffic goes through there.

They just need glimpses into some of the messiness of the muggle world, really. The existing sense of superiority (over the fact that they can do magic and muggles can't) is then reinforced. And it goes from there.

It's like those people who have layovers in places and cast judgement based on that. Like “Ugh, the south is so pathetic. I've never actually traveled there but I was at the airport in Alabama once and it was just sad.”

*** lol, Could of been the possibility of someone asking why Diagon Alley smelled, and then someone basically tell a fellow wizard about the problem in the muggle world; low and behold a part of why superiority is a thing is because people think Muggles smell bad, ergo now we know why Walburga Black call's them 'muggle filth' and muggleborns 'children of filth' .
