Can anyone help me find the fic above? It was a subversion of the 'Ministry Marriage Mandate' trope where Harry goes through spouses like Miss Zabini.


** Was it linkffn(The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic by Luan Mao)?

*** That's a new way against a marriage law, but I don't agree with this approach. If he really wanted to kill people, why not going after those responsible for the law? The girls were most likely innocent.

There is another fic with the exact same name in which he took out those responsible for the law by himself, and I find that one a lot more satisfying: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]] by Bobmin356, linkffn(4960536).

Or he could organize a mass exodus as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]], linkffn(6049450). This one is pretty satisfying too.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901), Harry was badly injured and too weak to fight, so he hired some super assassin from the US and let him take care of his enemies.

But of course, my favorite marriage law fic by far is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005).

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
