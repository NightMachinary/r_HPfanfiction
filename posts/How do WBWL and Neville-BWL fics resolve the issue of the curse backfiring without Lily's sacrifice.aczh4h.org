The books are pretty clear that the only reason Voldemort's Killing Curse backfires is because Lily sacrificed herself to protect Harry. That sacrifice was only made possible because Snape begged for Voldemort to spare Lily.

Which creates a plot hole in any fics where:

- Lily survives to raise Harry (or his twin), who is the BWL

- Neville is the BWL

How does the curse backfire without the sacrifice?

I don't think I've seen this question resolved before. Most fics die incomplete, without ever addressing the issue. /Saving Connor/ is the only such complete fic that I can think of, and it was started before DH. We might get an answer from /Prince of Slytherin/ --- five years and 3M words from now, when the author reached year 7. :p


** What does Snape have to do with that? I thought it was simply Lily sacrifing herself to protect Harry and nothing else, which would be easily solvable by having Alice do that for Neville in the case of the stories you mentioned.

*** The way I understood it, Lily's sacrifice only meant as much as it did because she didn't have to die. If she had stood aside like Voldemort said, he would have let her live as a reward to Snape. She wouldn't have had anything to sacrifice if she was going to die anyway.

That's the solution to another common question: why hadn't the whole boy who lived thing happened before if all that was needed was for a mother to sacrifice herself? That's because in other cases, the mother would have died anyway. It wasn't as much as a sacrifice, in theory.

*** Lily only had the option to /choose/ to sacrifice herself because Snape asked Voldemort to spare her. If Snape hadn't asked then Voldemort would have just killed her straight away, and it wouldn't have been a sacrifice. That's what would happen with Alice.

** In case of Longbottoms, Voldemort might want to spare them because they were powerful Purebloods. His demand would of course be rejected, he then lost his patience, killed them, and finally had his AK backfiring on him.

But I have never seen a good explanation in WBWL fics so far.

** don't some of them have lily still doing blood magic? Falling under the assumption that canon lily must have been dabbling in rare blood magic, otherwise more people would be spared the AK due to the commonness of sacrifices. I think some WBWL have her doing a different type of rare protective magic that doesn't require a life sacrifice? Not saying it's a good explanation, but that's the one I usually use to myself in a WBWL. Guaranteed, most WBWL require much suspense of disbelief in creating the setting for the book. Because... like, really... They both managed to get scars thanks to some random-chance displaced object when the curse fired. And Dumbledore, greatest wizard of the gen, can't figure out which baby had an AK fired at him and which baby's scar is due to a dislodged piece of wood from the cradle. linkffn(2861750) is a funny oneshot making fun of the suspense of disbelief required for WBWL stories for those who haven't read it

*** Canon refers to 'blood magic' in very vague terms, generally meaning 'powerful protections powered by a loving sacrifice'. It says nothing on whether any other preparation is required (e.g. was Lily 'dabbling', or was her protection accidental?)

I do struggle with fics that portray blood magic as just another exotic field of magic that Lily is researching --- the point in canon is that blood magic is so emotional and instinctual that Voldemort could never hope to understand it. And certainly any fic that has Lily invoke 'blood magic' /without/ the sacrifice contravenes and cheapens canon.

  Will the real Boy Who Lived please stand up? Snape is convinced that the second Potter twin is the one to worry about. Too bad no one else seems to agree. Oneshot.

** Sometimes they do something where Lily ended up in a coma instead, sometimes literally through a blood sacrifice ritual (I hate these in particular). Some fics make it so that the grandparents are the ones who gave a blood sacrifice, such as Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived by The Santi. Many people also aren't aware or disregard about Snape, which makes a direct swap easier. Often they just handwave it.

** If you look at the whole thing too close it leaves plot holes wide enough to wiggle anything in.

I mean you want to tell me, that never before anyone was offered/able to save themselves, but instead choose to sacrifice yourself for someone they love? NEVER EVER BEFORE???

It just doesn't make sense. That means it has something to do with Voldemorts terrible soul state and that as fragmented as it was, killing a baby was just too much after seeing how loved it was and being untouched by it.

Or you could just say that maybe there was someone having a good word for the Longbottoms as well, (and far more successful at it, because they nuggled Voldemort to focus on the Potter boy), or have Voldemort in his arrogance offer them a chance to live because they are purebloods as a show of his total victory not only killing the boy, but gaining the parents as well, or placing an Imperio on one of them and in the last second they break it and jump in front of their child

** I've never read one that went into detail about that. But one easy explanation would be that one of the Neville's parents has had a chance to escape (a hidden portkey or smth) but they choose to not to use it. This is should be good enough, I think.

** It's quite simple - throw away the wondrous blood protection that only works at random instances, and use a device of your own making.

Make Divination powerful in a way that the prophecy actually takes root the moment Voldemort casts the Killing curse at Neville. Let the power the Dark Lord knows not actually be a legitimate power, and not some wonky shit like love. Yes, yes, I know, Albus, Hermione and lots of other people say that Divination is wonky - prove those fuckers wrong.

Failing all of that, just change the wording of the prophecy. It's not like poems are hard to write, even half-assed ones.
