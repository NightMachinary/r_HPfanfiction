Either by the tournament by being forced into competing, or the ministry trial. Either way, one where Harry ends up declared an adult by mistake :)


** These always strike me as bizarre.

Britain has no legal concept of the emancipated minor

*** Well obviously it's due to him being Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff, which gives him the power to emancipate himself. Duh!

*** You could just say as an orphan he can be responsible for himself.

And Wizarding Law could include these cases. I mean, what do wizards have that's tied exclusively to age? The Trace, Apparition and the Statute for Underage Sorcery. Which is about magic, and OWLs are basically declaring them capable of using the basics safely.

You can get a license for Apparition.

If the guy lives alone, has no guardian, why prevent him from doing magic after his OWLs? Or apparating? And if he has the money it gets even easier.

**** Not under British law, under aged orphans always have a guardian. Even if it's state supplied.

Now obvious magical government doesn't have to shadow Muggle but there's no reason why it would import a foreign concept like emancipation for minors precisely because underaged magicals are so dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
