I am trying to find a fanfic where Harry and Neville grew up together with James and Alice. Lily and frank die to protect the kids. Neville and Harry both have twins that are thought to be the ones who kill Voldemort. Harry and Neville are neglected and abused. At so point in their life the get trunk from frank and lily with this in it to learn and a copy of the prophecy. They new that they were the ones who kill voldy when they were kids before that. James and Alice got married some time after the attack. I believe it is on fanfiction.net
