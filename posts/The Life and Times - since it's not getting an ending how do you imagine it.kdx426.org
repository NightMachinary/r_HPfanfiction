As the life and times is officially abandoned - but nether the less the best marauders fanfic out there I was curious what other peoples headcanons for how the story should end?

​

the one scene I really wanted to see was James reaction to Lilys Patronus - is that what finally forced her to confess her feelings? how do you think it went down

​

does anyone have any one-shots that help fill in the voids?

** I weirdly liked how it ended? There was some hope in it in a weird way...

I do wish they'd seen the Patronus. And I WISH they had fecking kissed!! Especially in the rain!!! Oh and I REALLY wanted to see Mary and Reginald get together I was hanging onto that the whole time.

Jileplz on Tumblr has taken up the task of finishing it though it's a very slow process. I don't know if they've released anything yet. [[http://jilyesplz.tumblr.com]]

Also Emulz is writing a really good story in the same tone and style as TLAT and really worth the read. It even starts with a brawl and a fight! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11972910/chapters/27077862]]
