I'm looking for any fic where Harry, over time, becomes as powerful as Dumbledore and Voldemort. I'd prefer fics that cover all the years of hogwarts, but I'm really fine with anything.


** linkffn(5244813) Basically thing you want. There are two years and Harry slowly becomes powerful. linkffn(8379655) also has Harry slowly increasing his power.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** Could you provide more info on this? Is this a dimensional/world traveler fic where Harry travels? or is it focusing only on Jasmine? Or even a time traveling fic? Its hard to tell from the description and it seems almost to hint at such things.

#+begin_quote
  The request is weird in my opinion because Dumbledore is powerful due to being an excellent student and then training his magic and knowledge over the decades AFTER Hogwarts. Especially with Grindelwald he most likely made even some questionable stuff, besides the elder wand hunting. The same happened to Riddle, who was strong and a gifted student, but AFTER Hogwarts he did a lot of experiments, even on himself, to strengthen his magic/body to become even more powerful. With the dark magic he did, it even helped him to get faster to Dumbledore's level. Thus if we intent Harry to slowly become more powerful to the ranks of Dumbledore/Voldemort, it means he must do a lot of stuff AFTER Hogwarts, for at least some decades to become as powerful as both of them. Any shortcuts wouldn't work, because Dumbledore/Riddle would have used them as well. That is why, logically speaking, in my opinion the request is weird... Even Rowling knew it would be impossible for Harry to become as strong as Riddle and used a different method to destroy him.
#+end_quote

I think this is wrong. This is for 2 reasons:

1. We know that Dumbledore and Riddle already had surpassed existing wizarding knowledge while they were at Hogwarts, at which point they were already pushing beyond the boundaries of known magic.

2. When we see Dumbledore and Riddle fight in OotP, the vast majority of the magic they use is within the Hogwarts curriculum, merely applied powerfully and cleverly. For example, all Hogwarts students learn animation, but the difference between an average student and Dumbledore is the difference between making several attempts at animating a single small object and instantly animating multiple large objects simultaneously.

Of course there are interesting and obscure odds and ends to be learnt after Hogwarts if one has the inclination, but the core knowledge, the foundation, is already there. You're simply filling in the gaps after Hogwarts.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
