I'm thinking of writing a new fic. I don't want to go into plot details right now, because I haven't figured that out yet (I have some ideas, like Harry travelling and discovering new magic, but I haven't expanded them yet) and because it is my first fic, I'd like for you to give some advice on what to avoid doing (ex good grammar, write the names correctly etc). I'm planning to start in 3rd year, because i can't write preteens that good.

What do you think are the most common pitfalls for a new "writer"? What should I avoid?


** Be careful when you edit. You're going to realise you make mistakes. You might even realise you hurt your plot somehow. Re-writing is the death of a lot of fics since it can destroy your confidence and enthusiasm. Re-writing is never fun. It might be needed to present something you're proud of but it can seriously sap your interest. I'd always recommend you write well ahead of what you publish so you can edit at your own pace and if editing gets you down you can focus on more writing.

On a general writing tip, there is a thin line between ingenuity and ridiculous. You can come up with new things but if they're simple sometimes you have to ask, if this worked, why hasn't someone done it before? Maybe the conditions weren't right, maybe a prerequisite didn't exist when something similar was last attempted. Just be careful you're not trying to be too clever. A classic is someone trying to melt down wizarding coins and selling the material to muggles. You really think that if that worked, your character would be the first to think of it?

** Okay, some quick advice off the top of my head.

While writing:

- If you're not British... either do a lot of research or have someone Britpick your fic or something.
- Also the things you mentioned, good grammar and spelling. Maybe get a beta.

While posting:

- Have your summary say something about the story, not something vague. I want to know what it is if I'm gonna read it.
- Don't have author's notes in summary.
- (On AO3) Tag correctly. No minor ships or characters tagged; it just confuses.

*** Just to add to your AO3 note: CharA/CharB is a romantic relationship. CharA&Charb is a platonic relationship.

Honestly, I feel a newer writer has better things to focus on than that...

**** Yeah, I agree with this. I don't think that many people /actually/ care. Just don't have a blatant foreign cultural thing inserted into the story. At best it seems ignorant and at worst it can even look preachy

** General Stuff You Should Try To Avoid IMO

Ultra powerful and attractive characters.

Too much emphasis on family alliances and lordship

Ultra powerful goblins

Daphne Greengrass in any major role

Death Eater apologism

Bashing of those who don't deserve it.

*** While Daphne Greengrass is an overused character, I wouldn't avoid her on principle. She's a fine character to have in Slytherin-centric stories, but she should definitely be avoided as the "token good Slytherin character" that so many fics use her as without giving her much more depth. Ditto for using Tracey as little more than "Daphne's friend".

***** It goes further than this. There are quite a few stories, usually Slytherin-focused, which justify Voldemort as right or "right idea, wrong execution" because Muggleborns were threatening the pureblood culture or similar bs.

Also, quite a few stories completely gloss over the crimes of certain characters. I mean, just the fact that Malfoy was hiding his Death Eater activity under a Hogwarts robe would have seen him tried and executed for that by the Allies in WWII while the Axis and Soviets wouldn't have bothered further than the nearest wall.
