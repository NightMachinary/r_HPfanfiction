** I like writing Ginny because I did loads of research for her and her dialogue patterns, so I'm at the stage where she comes very naturally to me.

But my absolute favourite character to write is, without a doubt, aunt muriel. So much pleasure.

****** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]]. If you don't want to read the whole thing, chapters with Muriel in are chapters 5, 26, 27, and 28. As it's canon compliant you shouldn't get confused :)

** When writing a character's pov, anyone who is largely overlooked in most stories. Filius comes to mind. After reading Mcgonagall's pottermore entry i had a great time writing them as old competitive friends.

** Ron. He's got such a fantastic sense of humour, and is essentially a one-man quip king. He's not yet been the main character of one of my fics, but he's pretty much the lynchpin of all my favourite bits of dialogue in them.

*** I couldn't agree more. I love writing dialogue for Ron. He's got such a sarcastic and chill tone about him. His lines in the books were always the ones that made me laugh out loud the most.

** My favorite? I suppose it's Harry, because he's the central figure in all my fanfiction (so far), but there are other characters I've found I enjoy writing. Sirius is one, mainly due to my main fic, which features Sirius quite a bit. Also, and this is solely because of that fic, Mulciber. He's practically a non-entity in canon (he shows up in the DoM battle and only then it's Malfoy saying his name), a blank slate, really. I took the name and pretty much built an OC under that faux-canon banner and he's always fun to write. Whenever he shows up, a scene automatically becomes better.

** Sirius Black, because I write best in 1st person narrative and comedy is usually my main focus. I enjoy implying something happened and letting my readers imagine it further, which is a tactic I find works best when I'm writing from the perspective of a self-centered character. Lockhart is another favorite of mine, because I find it hilarious when he ignores the main plot entirely to focus on something only he thinks is important. Sometimes it turns out it matters, generally it's just jumping down another rabbit hole.

** I love writing Severus so much. I think it's because we get enough of him to feel like we can really understand him, but there's so much mystery to his everyday life. So i feel like I have enough of his soul to write how he gets meticulously dressed every day, or what his bedroom looks like, etc.

** Luna. It's extremely difficult to get into her mentality, but once you do, she's a fun and unique character. I like the challenge and I like her personality. She's multifaceted with pros and cons and it's interesting to explore all the different directions in which you can take in her characterization and the plot around her.

*** I'm not sure why you've been downvoted for this - it's true that when we write OCs we fully understand and know them. I certainly feel defensive over my OC.

** Lucius. I don't think I write him /well/, and probably not very canon at all, but I love the challenge of putting myself in the shoes of such a casually arrogant and bigoted person. His mindset is so foreign to my own that it's both difficult and fun to try to see the world the way he does.

*** It's hard to write internal dialogue with such different assumptions to our own. Lucius doesn't preach that Muggleborns are inferior due to their blood, that just an obvious fact he doesn't think about. Of /course/ purebloods are better, it doesn't make intuitive sense that it could be any other way!
