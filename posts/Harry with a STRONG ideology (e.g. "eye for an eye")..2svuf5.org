Want a Harry with a strong moralistic code that he lives by. I'd particularly like to read a fic where this ideological outlook is developed from naivety, though that's not too important.

EDIT: Especially scarily strong ideology which frightens other characters.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9655837/][This fic]] seems to be exactly what you are looking for: it's got the ideology, the naivety, and the frightening other characters. Though, it's less "eye for an eye" and more "From each according to his ability; to each according to his need."

**** My top 20 is badly in need of an edit, as I've read a couple fics, such as this one (/Forging the Sword/ ++++++) since I wrote it that definitely deserve a spot.

In fact, just tonight I was toying around with the idea of expanding it (probably taking it off my profile and putting into an open Google Docs) into categories - one-shots, Canon Flavor, time/dimension travel, romance, etc.

***** Don't know about the Google docs. I very likely wouldn't have followed an off-site link and then I might have missed out on “A Long Journey Home”. It's not the only story I read because of your list, but it's the one I liked best.

** You might also want to give [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2869936/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hero-s-Path][Harry Potter and the Hero's Path]] a try, although it kind of fails the "from naivety" check... sort of.

** Very much along those lines is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry by LordsFire]] and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8532802/1/Hero-Harry][Hero Harry]]. Harry lives by a very strong moral code developed from suffering abuse at home and at school, and sees Voldemort, Dumbledore, Draco, and the Ministry of Magic as basically equivalent to the bullies he faced in school as a child and is determined to protect others. I actually didn't like whole sections of this, but it was an interesting concept and has some really good parts.
