Hermione setting Snape's robes on fire in their first year, creating the Polyjuice Potion, etc. I'd like for it to be when the trio is out of Hogwarts when Snape and/or other Professors, finds out, but he/they can find out when they're still at Hogwarts.

Can be like a what if scenerio or "missing moment" or whatever. Just the little stuff the trio had to do to get a job done.

No Weasley Bashing.

  Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glumlooking girl sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S-bend of a toilet three floors below.

  “Myrtle!” Harry said in outrage, “I'm --- I'm not wearing anything!”

** Hogwarts Reads the Books ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1779118][series link]] Ao3) linkao3(24609685) (first book)

It's a "read the books" series. The series is currently in book4, and the author is slowing down due to school? Anywho, the series is at almost 800,000 words.

I haven't read this completely but I do like chapter 15 when Harry tells the Order how useless they are at that point

***** I mean they go on and on about how they should take care of everything but...

Pre series they left harry on the porch in October, they are lucky he didn't wonder off into traffic or froze to death.

You all know year 1 but you cant tell me to take dumbledore seriously after he decided the best way to get to an urgent meeting is flying there on a broom.

Anyway i will never take any adult in that series seriously.
