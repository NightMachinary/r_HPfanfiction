He buys a muggle cottage, but hires the goblins and a warding company to take some of his magic and make it sentient and then shops for about 2-3 chapters to furnish it...(either in ffn or ao3, but could be others..)


** Not that fic, unfortunately, but linkao3(House Proud) contains a sentient Grimmauld place which a post-war Harry is forced to fix up.

I'm not a fan of Drarry at all, but I still massively recommend it - it's not explicit at all, and it's hands down one of the most unique fics I've ever read, and I've been on the lookout for something similar ever since.

  There's a sanctuary headed by a green-eyed man located in the outskirts of Scotland. Tom would rather risk it than the Orphanage.
