** You really haven't thought this through have you?

1. Writing fanfiction for money is one of the few things that is generally unaccaptable among fanfiction writers, not to mention massively liable to prosecution.
2. Suppose the writer is a fast writer and produces said fic in, say, six months, are you really going to pay the equivalent of six months wages. Â£10,000 or so? Would you pay half upfront? What if the writer went awol?
3. How do you choose your writer? Some sort of audition process? What standard of literacy are you looking for?
4. What if you didn't like the story when it was done? Would you refuse to pay?
5. Who would own the story when it was done? You or the writer?

Altogether you need to do what the rest of us do and write what you want to read. Not enough time? Join the club.
