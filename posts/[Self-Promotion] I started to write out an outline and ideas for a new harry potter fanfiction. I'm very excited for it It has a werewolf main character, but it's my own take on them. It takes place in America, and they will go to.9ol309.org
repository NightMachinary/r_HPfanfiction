Yes see the title please! :) I got an idea for a new story and I decided to write outlines and ideas to a notepad in my ideas folder! :) :) It's going to be about a werewolf protagonist in mage america who attends Ilvermorny! That way I don't have to be worried about British-isms or whatever that are so bad to do!

Yes my protagonist will be a boy for once, since I want to try to write something other than a girl like always. :) His name will be Jake Graves, and he will go on lots of adventures and struggles!

Mostly with being a werewolf! In my Fight For Rights story, I wrote vampires very differently from most, because I wanted it to be a true CURSE. I gave them two dozen negatives and only a few positives (immortality, enhanced physical abilities). That way it's not some thing like "Oh cool I have superpowers and I live forever why doesn't everyone do this?!". It's one of the most horrible things EVER to be, and that's why not even Grindelwald or Voldemort became vampires for immortality's sake.

Anyway, my WEREWOLVES in this story will be similarly, utterly /damned!/ Truly cursed and horrible. The main part of it is this: each and every time a werewolf transforms, whether willingly or otherwise, partially or fully (they can get claws and fangs in human form), their soul will be corrupted a little bit more. How much more depends on how long they were transformed for, and what they did during it.

They'll lose willpower, focus, memories, knowledge, intelligence and even complex human emotions. They'll degenerate, more and more, into a wild animal - in and out of werewolf form. It will be permanent, affecting them even as a human.

For example, they could forget how to put on clothes, brush their teeth, or even what a toothbrush /is/ and how to use it. They could forget their birth date, the names of family members, or even /who their family members are./ They might wake up and be totally panicked and scared about who these people are in their room. They might have a total lapse of focus and need meds to work on homework, or at a job for longer than a few minutes on a bad day. They could get totally confused about where they are or what they're doing.

And as they live and transform every month, it just gets worse and worse and WORSE!

Until the end, the point where they're just a totally average, wild magical animal of a predator.

Yes it's kind of like a dementia. Like Alzheimer's. But it starts from birth and progresses on from there, through childhood, teenage years, young adult, and onward forever. It's not just an old age thing.

Also I'm going to put in poison damage from silver, and maybe fire and garlic. Also probably that werewolves can't be around animals because they'll freak out and get scared or aggressive! That is the worst thing I can think of cause I love animals so much and it would be HORRIBLE! So yes, werewolves can't have pets or be around pets or anything.

Just to totally stack the curse of being a werewolf.

So yes, if you willingly transform, it's a dilemma, because you could use that strength of a giant magical beast for something good, but you'll be terrified about what you'll lose inside yourself by doing so. You'd /know/ that you're hastening along your own descent into a lack of mental faculties.

So yes these are my ideas and outlines about this plot concept so far! :) I hope it is interesting at all to anyone? If not I'll still enjoy writing it for myself!


** Sounds like an interesting concept for a werewolf story. What does any of that have to do with Harry Potter other than name-dropping Ilvermorny?

This is seriously one of those things that works better as an original piece than as fanfiction, because all you're doing is writing something original and slapping HP serial numbers on it.

*** Well it's going to be at Ilvermorny, and I'm going to use all the house info and stuff on it from Pottermore! And also there's going to be lots of references to canon stuff and places, and lots of canon spells and magic and stuff too. I mean it's like Fantastic Beasts right? That takes place in magical america and in the past, but it's still totally harry potter! I'm not writing something original and slapping harry potter on it, I'm writing a harry potter universe story explicitly. :)

*** To be fair that's half the au fanfics as well they just use character names and magical Britain....

I will agree it seems to be disjointed from the hp series (though the Alexandra quick series were similar and worked very well)
