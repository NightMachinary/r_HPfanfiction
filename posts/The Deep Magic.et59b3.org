I am looking for stories with lots of theory and complex magic also deep magic like obscure and interesting thank you.


** I know this one story with Mentor!Albus, I thought it was 'magics of the arcane' but that's not it.

I can only remember this scene where Albus and Harry are in this weird darkness world being faced against a heliopath, maybe?
