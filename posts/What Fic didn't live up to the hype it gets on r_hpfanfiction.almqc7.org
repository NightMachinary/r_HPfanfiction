** i've started seeing 'amalgum - lockhart's folly' recommended recently

so i was like "oh, i wonder how the author handles this"

i had to just put it down at the point where lockhart teaches 2. year hermione how to swing her ass while walking (seriously what). i was already skimming by that point due to it containing Dumbledore & ron bashing, but holy shit. what makes people rec that?

*** That fic has so many cringe moments. It's not clear how old Harry was when he was sent back in time, but apparently being the only survivor in a war torn future has made him afraid of women, racist, homophobic, and think that it is perfectly okay to relentlessly bully a 12 year old child.

As for why i'd recommend it with that part, I honestly truly forgot about it, I thought that part was weird but it slipped my mind until I was reminded in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ak1izz/looking_for_fics_with_and_older_harry_mentoring/ef0xnt5/][this thread]].

Repeatedly touted as one of the funniest fics in the fandom, it fell flat for me. I thought the humor was pretty juvenile. I'm not a big fan of raunchy humor and I never liked any characterizations of Big Dick Harry, and this is something the fic likes to play up for laughs. It is essentially the HPfanfic version of Zoolander. Hit or miss depending on your tastes.

This is how I feel about it too. I think it's amusing at times and some of the jokes are clever but for the most part the jokes are childish and often become repetitive. The story itself is ]pretty good though. The magical arms, That Fucker, ward breaking, "new" Voldemort, etc. I can see why it's not everyone's cup of tea but I do think it's one of the more worthwhile HP stories and understand why it continues to surface as one of the more foundational fanfic stories.

Frankly, there's a lot more bad writing than good writing in HP fanfic and even less great writing. Almost anything written well will be recommended periodically and anything beyond "good writing" will become a longstanding favorite.

** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. I think read up to around chapter 90 so I definitely don't hate it and I'm not saying it's bad. However, it really does try too hard to make any and every canon plot hole make sense, at the expense of pacing and the overall story itself. Even some one off jokes, like Roonil Wazlib are seemingly made into plot points. Because of that, essentially nothing happens for 600,000 out of 700,000 words and I can't remember any part of it except for the stuff with "Lockhart" and the werewolves. The rest is hazy.

Harry Potter and the Lady Thief is another. I pretty much don't like any of the characterisations. They just rub me the wrong way. The plot is really good but the excessive exclamation marks and calling everyone a "smelly dog" was grating.

That's one of the issues I have with HPMOR as well- sometimes, the answer to "why is it this way" is "because it fits with story/literary reasons," and that's perfectly fine. Not everything needs to be addressed and overexplained.

And yeah, the "big" twists and action are the parts that stick out to me, but also the little things that definitely needed time to build up- Jim's reaction to the prophecy after year 1, some of the stuff with the Ron subplot in year 2. And just because so many justifications are thrown at the board, some of them stick the landing really well. Year 1 and even Year 2 have a fair bit of filler, but it's not really something I can recommend skipping entirely.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** I see Carpe Noctem linkffn(13088810) recc'd a lot and I didn't really enjoy it.

I found it very dry, and the "protagonist" Voldemort/Tom was pretty unlikeable. It wasn't because he's a murderer without remorse who wants to take over Magical Britain, but because he had no interesting personality traits and was it was boring to be "in his head" when reading the story from his perspective. I don't mind amoral or dark characters, I just want /interesting/ ones. I want to be entertained.

It seemed like the fic was about what Voldemort does, rather than who he is. He's competent, rational, intelligent, and more powerful than everyone else, and those are the tools he uses to advance the plot. He's not particularly introspective, and the writing conveys a cool and in-control attitude at all times, which comes off as emotionally detached... Which doesn't feel like Voldemort, as he is a guy who likes monologuing, attention from his lessers, and BIG DRAMA like the Graveyard Duel in GoF. I couldn't get invested in his non-existent personal growth arc, and I could tell that the only reason why I'm still reading is to see Voldemort throwing Mentos into Diet Coke, aka Fucking the Status Quo.

It's kind of like those OP Super!Harry fics... There's no personality, just power wank.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

** Oh God Not Again is hot garbage. It's one of the few stories I angrily read the whole way through even though I hated it from pretty early on just so I could hate it in its entirety.

It is a canon rehash in the worst sense. A time travel story that bends over backwards to make sure it stops at every single station on the canon timeline. It has to spend half its time plugging the holes that are created whenever Harry even slightly varies from canon.

Harry is this weird pseudo-soapbox for the author sometimes and he has these random thoughts (usually to try and fix a plot hole and explain why it makes sense that everything is still following canon) that feel completely shoe horned in. Sometimes it's just the author replying to reviews by having Harry have some random thought.

None of the characters are likeable, except for maybe Gilderoy who is genuinely entertaining. Harry is the worst of a bad bunch. For the most part they don't actually seem like friends at all.

This fic is an exercise in frustration. I like the writing, and When In Doubt, Obliviate!, another fic by this author, is one of my all-time favourites, so I wanted so much to like Oh God Not Again, but...

This seems like a weird complaint to me because I was under the impression that this was kind of the whole point of the fic. It's a comedy based off of having a silly peggy sue Harry in canon situations.

** Almost all Dramione Fics.

​

Look, I am about to write one as entry for a competition, and I hope I will make it right.

​

The thing is Hermione/Draco have so many dramatic possibilities that , as a fanfiction writer, I agree there is a potential there to discuss serious questions and do some quality writing. For instance, I would love to see explained how a very opportunistic family like the Malfoys fell for Voldermort- I can understand the Blacks, being half crazy, and the Lestranges being the source of evil, but Malfoys had always been the epithome of the cunning. Even according to Pottermore, they just embarked on the Blood Purist train because it would bring them more political power.

​

Not to mention, Abraxas Malfoy only dies when Draco was already at Hogwarts. Why there is no dramione fic showing Abraxas role in Draco´s upbringing?

​

I would love to see a Dramione dealing with Draco and his family and Hermione and her family. Come on, you have a racist family of bigots actually being warm towards each other and uniting at the end, while you have your resistence heroine taking all the steps to be assimilated into this world, to the point we are not even sure how her parents are even called?

​

I would expect something to happen during their eight year to change things in a realistic way...Hermione and Ron naturally distancing themselves romantically while Draco, in a subdued way, tried to apologise? Draco, an only child, and Hermione, an only child, how they were coping with their own families in the aftermath? Growing gradually close as they worked through years of past agressions and attacks...how they slowly recognized some similarities , if they exist?

​

I mean, the possibilities of good drama are endless!

​

Yet, what you get? VEELA DRACO! EVIL!HERMIONE! HORRIBLE!RON WORSTFRIENDEVER!HARRY or MARRIAGE LAW where they keep getting at each other´s throats until Draco fucks Hermione into submission- Slytherin Sex God anyone?

​

Honestely, Dramione fics are usually dissapointing.

So imagine my disappointment when I go to read it and there's like 1500 words dedicated to Ginny's tits in a pushup bra.

If I stumbled across that fic I'd probably have finished it and thought "hey that was alright" but because of the way it was sold I hate reading it. I can't figure out if the people recommending it read it so long ago they've forgotten how juvenile the writing is or if they're just young enough that they honestly think ""I can't help it; I like the boobs. I like the whole thing. That dress is snug in places where school robes just aren't," Harry said earnestly." is passable as something someone would read and think "holy shit this is actually book 7!!!!!"

Seventh Horcrux is a very well done comedy, but like all comedy its /really/ a matter of taste. I think it's the funniest work in the fandom, and it gets rec'd enough that many seem to agree, but YMMV.

  "Voldemort is a powerful wizard," Dumbledore said gravely. "He has undergone procedures and rituals that would have crushed a lesser wizard and come up on top. He will shrug off and regenerate all but the most severe physical and magical wounds, although your skills in this area probably exceed his. His spells will be tens-times more powerful than the average Auror-class wizard. His reflexes and duelling style is unique to himself and quite possibly one of the most dangerous duellists in the world. His stamina, unmatchable by even myself. His greatest asset, however, is his mind. His ability to analyse a situation in a split-second and react accordingly will match even your own superior senses. I have heard some compare Lord Voldemort to a modern-day Salazar Slytherin. That is incorrect. Voldemort surpassed Slytherin long ago."

** Honestly, most stories which weren't also recommended to me by a friend with mutual tastes, don't live up the hype for me personally. I'm not really a fan of most commonly found tropes in here:

- Author following the events in the books even if it doesn't make much sense with changes that happened.

- Author feeling compelled to draw out a story over all seven years.

- Inclusion of the war and countless deaths, even though the starting premise of a story is different, often without a good look into the problems with war, but just to showcase new deadly power-ups.

- Feeling the need to add representation, but always with suffering attached (for instance if there are lgbt+ characters they often seem to turn out evil or they add a lot of homophobia/bury your gays.. while the original books were totally silent on them).

- Turning some moral grey/goodish people one-dimensional evil (often just because the writer isn't a fan of the character/feels the need to include the characters even if they aren't needed with a new premise).

- Characters solving problems by raw magical power (includes overpowered spells they acquired/researched), instead of finding other solutions.

Still, if the writer finds joy in writing it, all the best for them. There are some good stories floating around, and I occasionally read a story even if it contains one of these tropes.

Like, yes, I understand that you want Harry to have been in Slytherin and be a lord and be Blaise's best friend and put on a string by Daphne. You can do that with 2-3 chapters of highlights in the beginning, get to the meat of your story that you're clearly dying to write about with all that political intrigue/smut/battles/etc, and throw in some flashbacks if you want.

I honestly don't see a problem if so-- maybe the specific verbiage of "bombshell" is a bit unrealistic, but you can find people that are your age hot even as a preteen.

In that same vein, teenagers also have sex even if Luna and Harry did have sex. It's a bit weird if it becomes a full blown erotica scene that's meant to be titillating, but I don't see an issue with simply sleeping in the same bed as someone especially, or even desiring affection in that circumstance.

If Harry/the protagonist was an adult thinking 11-12 year olds were bombshells or sleeping naked with a 13 year old, then yeah I can understand the criticism a lot more from that perspective.

The Arithmancer felt good while it was being written but I can't reread it because of how utterly hopeless Hermione is at the start only to become utterly badass at the flick of a switch. And the sequel takes far too long to get to the point. And the sequel to the sequel is just pointless.

**** Emperor has some great writing, an engaging plotline, good worldbuilding, but calling it "Harry Potter fanfiction" is almost a misnomer. It uses the names and a /little/ of the HP magic system/history, but in reality it's kind of its own narrative. Like, if you changed the names appropriately and added a tiny bit of extra exposition for the magical history of that universe, it could very easily be its own world. So if you're looking for a true Harry Potter "what if" type situation, you probably won't like it, but if you're just looking for a well-written story with magic that you understand, you'll probably enjoy it.

  Blindness starts well but ends up with an overpowered!Harry disinterestedly flicking everything aside.
#+end_quote

You summed up why I stopped following this fic perfectly. It was great when Harry was first learning, and understanding how magic fit into his "sight". It was OK when Harry got powerful, and was excessively studious. It turned crappy when he became OP and had cheat codes for using and understanding magic better than anyone else could ever hope to.

** linkffn(Renegade Cause).

Oh gods. Some of the characters, like Kemester, are absolutely brilliant. Some of the story arcs are very, very good.

But.../fuck/, does it go about the plot in an absolutely unbelievable manner.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

** Well, I suspect that most of them wouldn't for me, but I rarely even open fics that I can see aren't my cup of tea judging by the summary and/or pairing. I'm not interested in teenage romance, power fantasies, and pureblood culture with marriage contracts, for example, so I avoid fics with those themes, no matter how recced they are.

Also, Seventh Horcrux. I've read it a few times but it just doesn't do anything for me.

Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes: Not funny and repetitive.

HP and the Wastelands of Time: Harry Potter in name only, plus lots of gratuitous action.

*** There's no such thing as gratuitous action! Gimme more action! Cram some fucking explosions in there, make sure the hero quips, the girls tits bounce, and for God's sake do it all with tons of lens flare on the screen. Blah blah blah what's with this boring talking, character development feelings shit, fuck that, make a random OP time demon burst in and fuck some shit up!!!!!

****** Easier search of [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]. Remove characters you don't want. Harems, genderbender, slash, femslash, multi. Update after, Published before etc.

It's not perfect, but it's better than [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]'s search system
