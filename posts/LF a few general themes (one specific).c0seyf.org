I'm looking for a fic that had the Golden Trio in a muggle hotel. They were starting the horocrux hunt or something.. I remember death eaters finding them there (possibly?).

But I'm also wanting to read any non-cannon 7th year fics. Like the ones that were written before the actual book came out. I prefer ones that are well written and not smut but I can handle bad writing if it's completed, and long with a good plot.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/][The Seventh Horcrux]] (not to be confused with the super popular and hilarious “Seventh Horcrux”), linkffn(2818538), came out before DH, guesses several canon DH facts correctly, and was rumored to be a leaked version of Book 7.

As for alternate Year 7 fic, my favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), in which Grindelwald breaks out after Dumbledore's death and offers to help Harry. Together, they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe. Luna (whose father hangs Grindelwald's symbol around his neck and pisses off Victor Krum mightily) has some great interactions with Grindelwald.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** My personal favorite. Don't let the first person turn you off. I've probably read it a dozen times.

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=191950][After the Summer Ended]] The story centers around Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they Horcrux Hunt. For a story written before Deathly Hallows was published, I am amazed at how accurate the author's predictions are. Honestly, it's the Deathly Hallows I always wanted.
