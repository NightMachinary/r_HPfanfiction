Arthur Weasley might not be knowledgeable on muggle tech, but he knows the stock market. Or perhaps one of his inventions become a staple in muggle households?

Either way, the Weasleys go from one of the poorest families to the wealthiest. How does this change the events of the series, e.g. Ron meeting Harry? Wealth would definitely have a significant impact on the Weasley children, especially the younger ones, though I would imagine that Molly and Arthur would keep them (mostly) straight and narrow.


** Surprisingly little, as far as Ron is concerned.\\
He'd have new clothes, books and wand, but most of his insecurities would still be there.\\
After all, he'd still have a bunch of successful older brothers, a younger sister soaking up some attention, a successful father spending less time with the family and more managing his finances and defending his ravenue from vultures and blood purists...

Additionally, there would be possibility of scarcity-time habits remaining to some extent, depending on the timeline of Arthur's enterprise.

So, Ron would be less sensitive as far as material goods go, but still in the shadow of his family. Possibly forced through some etiquette lessons, possibly with a bit les of a temper, but still same old Ron - a normal boy living in the shadow of greatness, desperate to prove himself.

Butterflies would of course happen, for example the second book would be very different - but the changes would not be - IMO - too drastic. Though Hermione recognizing Ron before Harry because of Sunday Times Rich List, for example would be pretty funny.

** Well, in the Spy-AU [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822]["Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived"]], the Weasleys are the Wellesleys. Not quite incredibly wealthy, but rich enough - and Ron's the grandson of the Duke of Wellington. He still has some self-esteem issues since Harry's the famous Boy-Who-Lived. Worse, all his brothers aren't just successful, but bucking the family expectations of marrying a noble, so his grandparents and mother try to influence him do "the right thing" (they like Hermione, but not as future wife for Ron).

It's a complete story that spans all seven years and has sequels, side stories and a prequel of sorts.

** It wouldn't change the characters too much except for Draco not constantly making fun of their poverty. But it would probably change the later plot quite a bit, with more wealth available the Order would be more capable. Also WWWâ„¢ would be an international megacorporation mass-producing all kinds of magical gadgets instead of a small prank stuff store. Instead of messing around with an old Ford Anglia, Arthur might be building a small air force of flying invisible /Challenger 2/ main battle tanks.

** I think they would lose a lot of their charm. Their taking in Harry as their own wouldn't be quite as admirable. Don't see how it would affect the plot much

** Arthur Weasley won 700 Galleons in the Daily Prophet drawing and immediately used them for a holiday trip instead of increasing the welfare of his family in the long run. Next year he somehow got a bunch of tickets to the Quidditch World Cup final Top Box, but didn't sell them and buy less expensive tickets instead.

So clearly Arthur Wealey is one of those people who live like there is no tomorrow and spend as much as they earn. If he suddenly became rich, that wealth would not last. He would need a continuous flow of money to support his wasteful lifestyle.

Perhaps this change would cause Ron to be an obnoxious spoiled brat. Most likely he wouldn't have any realistic ambitions like becoming capable of taking care of himself and his family. As the lack of money has never been any problem to him, he just fantasizes about becoming a new Dumbledore who defeats Dark Lords with ease. However, he is not willing to do much at all to achieve it. He wants everything to be easy for him, and he ends up living a meaningless life, immersed in escapism. Such a character would obviously add nothing to the story, and be cut out.

*** We don't know if the tickets are resellable. Honestly, I would expect Top Box seats to have stringent rules about reselling. What minister wants to sit next to some unvetted vampire from Albania? They bought a new wand for Ron and took them on a fun family vacation with 700 galleons. That's around 4500 dollars so it's not exactly like it's going to do much for them. They have the food they need, a house, and now the magical items they need. What would you have expected him to have done? Invested in the stock market that might not exist? Talk to a financial planner over 4500 dollars? Put it in the bank for a rainy day? I think it was fine for him to take his kids on a vacation that they never really get to take. Happiness is part of welfare. One incident is hardly a sign of poor judgment and the books seem to imply rational thinking from Arthur. He literally passes a law with a loophole for himself. It's really not clear at all.
