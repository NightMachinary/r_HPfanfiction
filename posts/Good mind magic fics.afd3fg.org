  AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE

** It would be amazing to find a fic that goes further and uses the fact that the brain makes up part of what we see to have a person be invisible or something because they tricked the other persons mind into not seeing him.

** i just made an account so I'm not sure how to use the bot but linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) is my all-time favorite series and has a fair bit of mind magic in all of the books, especially the first one. really cool theory development for occlumency and other branches of magic.

** I was about to suggest that fic based on the title. I've not really happened on a fic of that quality dealing with mind magic. At least not in-depth

  This is the story of a person who died. It's OK though, he got better. Through some kind of cosmic coincidence he wakes up in the body of an 11 year old Severus Snape. What would someone in his position, with knowledge of the future and what can be accomplished with magic do? Liberally abuse it and live like a king of course! Snape!Harem SI-OC as Snape NO SLASH.
