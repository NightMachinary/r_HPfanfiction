When you sign a contract, I believe you should have the right know what exactly you're signing up for. It was unfair and unethical to curse the parchment secretly, especially since that curse apparently permanently scars your face.

Agree or disagree?


** I think she should have since I think the largest reason to have the parchment do that would be to disincentivize snitching and that's not possible if they don't know the potential consequences. Otherwise it only allows to know who did it afterward, which is quite a bit less useful

Although I think some people might not have signed if they knew, once it's signed you would know that the people in the know are definitely trustworthy, or at least not going to squeal if they eventually leave.

******** Ok, first of all, you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny --- and he had a nasty temper anyway, nobody would have wanted someone like that on the team.

The accusation about Malfoy's goons is just ridiculous --- if anything, the experience did them some good and taught them that not anything that looks like food should be instantly shoved into their mouths.

The reporter was writing all those nasty articles about Harry and Hagrid while having the support of the entire Ministry, and there was no other way to stop her from doing that. Killing her might have worked, but can you really say that it would be better than just temporary incarceration and some blackmail?

Same with Umbridge --- she deserved what she got even if just for her blood quill torture trap.

The situation back then was such that all of these things just /had/ to happen. And it's partially because of all these unsavoury choices that Harry grew to ruminate over lately that today we have this better society to live in. So the next time you decide to spend your vacation in one of those nationalised former Malfoy-resorts or get to live with a pretty pureblood girl for a while thanks to the Ministry Lottery, be sure to think over the things you so wantonly share as a public opinion!

If she really wanted to protect her friends in this case, she might very well have simply taken Skeeter to the DMLE and that would have been the end of it, and if not that there were always Dumbledore and McGonagall. But she didn't, which is a flag that might very well be red.

******************* And by that time she still did not consider Dumbledore impotent politically. Two months later, sure, but by then there's no reason for her not to try him other than her deciding on her own.

And that's the entirety of my point from the very beginning, really: her deciding on her own. That Skeeter did deserve what she got, sure, and that there might not have been a better solution, sure, but we don't even see Hermione consider any other solution and instead (as far as we see it) decide on her own that “oh, this is what she is going to do with Skeeter”, which makes her decision questionable. It doesn't mean she is evil or anything, nor does it mean that the ministry was reliable or anything, but in the previous book (the third one, to be precise) she knew that she has Dumbledore on their side and in this book Dumbledore proved that he can't go against the tournament but was still somewhat reliable and yet she made the decision she made on her own and we never saw her actually consider alternatives or go “well, I guess I have no other choice, nobody will do anything anyway”. It's one of those situations where the character might very well have had a reason to do what she did, but because we don't see that reason as there's nothing given to us to even think that she has it and because of the character's behaviour throughout the story, the action and the choice of taking that action are questionable.

/That's/ what I am on about. The whole timeline thing and fighting about whether or not authority figures were reliable or not at this point is pretty much making fire by now, as the whole point is the ambiguity and thus questionability of Hermione's motives which is her recurrent flaw in the story, not whether or not her decision is excusable because of the ministry's incompetence or Skeeter's wretchedness (it is and I won't say otherwise, but it irks me that some people seem to think it makes her not flawed).

***************** Hmm ... that's a good question. Seriously though, we know she could have taken her to Dumbledore, even if just to give him means of preventing her from getting into the castle, because he wasn't the kind of person who'd ruin her the way DMLE would have if they found out. We know that by this time she did not have problems with authority that would prevent her from doing it because of what happened with Harry's hand in the next book (what with her dragging him to McGonagall). Heck, if it truly was about stopping Skeeter's lies for moral reasons, then I'm sure that taking her to the DMLE was the thing to do, so whatever caused Hermione to keep her in a jar I doubt it had to do with that.

I think the core of the issue in this case is that we don't know why she didn't do that or anything else but instead decided to keep Skeeter in a jar and then release her under forced cooperation---which from Skeeter's perspective pretty much was being abducted and then threatened with ruination---so we can only guess and in the end what she chose remains morally questionable. Skeeter is presented as a really bad person so it's easy to see her as quite evil (well, she is a pest, that much I will admit), but we don't see Hermione trying to fight that evil and being forced to resort to using the jar and threats for a lack of a better option as the circumstances or other people close option after option, and instead what we see is ... well, what is in the books. And because in the books Hermione has a history of acting “because she knows better”, it makes it hard to automatically assume that her intentions for this specific course of action were good rather than it simply happening because she had the possibility and decided to do it.

It might very well have been the best option she had, but even if that happened to be true it still wasn't a “good” option. Because as it is shown to us it doesn't look like something that had to be done or was done to protect anyone, just something that Hermione decided to do and that's it.

******************************* And, as far as I see it, you are missing the point. Most actions of Hermione's from that list are things that can be excused, or justified even, given the circumstances. They are still questionable actions because we are given Hermione just doing them and have to excuse or justify those things on our own and we know that Hermione is fairly haughty and has a tendency to make decisions for others.

That was the whole point regardless of the case. Changing it into being about Skeeter is, in this case, missing the point and missing it badly. We /do/ know that this is one of those “bad or worse choice” situations and that she chose as best as she could. We aren't even taking issue with that. But you were acting as if that was the crux of the whole issues.

It's not about the ministry being incompetent and worth close to nil. It's not about Skeeter and how bad a person she is. It's not about Cormac deserving anything she could have used on him. It's about the fact that she thinks she has the right to decide for those around her. Ultimately, in the end, it all went well and we know that most of the stuff she did could be excused or justified. But that is her character flaw, and as in many of those cases we were not given any reason to think that there was a reason for her making those decisions other than her simply being that pushy and/or haughty, it remains about that. /This/ is what the whole thing has been about from the very beginning, that Hermione is a flawed character. But so is everyone, so it doesn't mean that she is automatically evil nor are we saying that.

Talking about this specific case for real would have been actually debating why you think that we've been shown what had caused her to feel forced into deciding in the first place, not changing it into a thing about Skeeter and why this decision is best. Doing that in this case accomplishes nothing as we already know that Skeeter deserves it and much more and it really wasn't even about Skeeter in the first place, it just was about Hermione's act of making a decision when the situation behind it somehow involved Skeeter. Not about the choice she made, we already know why she made this particular choice, it was about why she thought she has to make a choice in the first place and the fact that the only answer we are seeing is “because she thinks she can make choices for everyone”.

So if that is how you approached the whole thing, then you've been shooting at a different training range from others to begin with, so of course everyone missed the other side's points.

That put her in the position of being the one who would have been blamed had her mother really lost her job, and not only would that have been true because she did know about DA, but she also never really wanted to be a part of it and attended only for Cho.

People expect loyalty from her and see her as some kind of big traitor who was loyal and then stopped being when in reality she'd never been loyal and had only been pulled into it and expected to keep quiet because Cho didn't think it through. All in all, the blame for her betrayal is more on Cho's side than on hers; the blame for telling, yes, that's Marietta's, but the blame for betrayal not really.

** I agree but I'm willing to forgive her this lapse in judgement. Hermione doesn't know how to break rules, it just doesn't come naturally to her. She can lie to help her friends, as we see with the troll incident but I would like to believe if she ever actually found herself pranking someone she would go completely overboard and maim them for life. It's just not a skill she has a natural aptitude for.

So enter Umbridge, an authority figure that is abusing her authority and is free of any checks and balances AND is messing with Hermione's OWL year. Imagine the talk Ron and Hermione had about starting the DA, how excited they both would be, all the plans and notes Hermione would be making, because it's Hermione and she likes to be prepared.

They finally convince Harry to meet with the people they've spent months trying to commit to coming, they've had a tough time of it looking at some of the people that made it into the final meeting.

Then the meeting doesn't really go too well. Harry is aggressive and defensive and isn't interested in using his mystique to draw people in.

Days and nights of hard work are all about to fall apart but some how they manage to get people to agree not only to come but to put their name to paper.

I can imagine Hermione being unable to bear the idea that her brilliant idea to curse the contract could ruin everything at the eleventh hour, so she didn't tell anyone. It's not exactly a lie right... it's an omission.

And she couldn't very well use a different piece of paper because it's such a good idea. No one will ever know right?

The Imperius curse got Moody to tell Crouch what he knew. Veratiserum got Crouch to spill the details of Voldemort and we all know he didn't want to do that.

Oh, legilimency too. All of these methods work regardless of what the person wants except in rare instances. Fear of reprisal isn't occlumency.

Edit: also, apparently in the movie Cho told due to veratiserum and did so without reprisal. I know it's not exactly a slam dunk due conflicting canon, but this allows the possibility that intent was a key component to the jinx. I'm getting all of this from a wiki, cause I can't remember all of these details. lol

It comes from Word of God. J.K. Rowling confirmed in an interview that Marietta had permanent, lasting scars from the incident, though they "faded with time". She also didn't seem to regret Marietta's punishment, because "she loathed a traitor". Another poster above also referenced the fact that Marietta is mentioned as wearing concealing clothing after the fact in the series in order to hide these scars.

As an edit, here is the quote.

#+begin_quote
  Q: Did Marietta's pimply formation ever fade?

  J.K. Rowling: Eventually, but it left a few scars. I loathe a traitor! [[http://archive.org/stream/J.k.RowlingChatTranscript/ChatJkRowling_djvu.txt][(Source)]]

And the quote about Marietta from /Half-Blood Prince/.

What Hermione used was indeed Dark magic. Dark magic has been shown several times in the series to permanently maim or disfigure victims, including George Weasley (a missing ear); Bill Weasley (body scars); and Mad-Eye Moody (body scars and a missing eye).

It's entirely possible she considered that if a traitor knew about the jinx, they would find a way to get themselves out of it before snitching.

As for it being useless for preventing being snitched on unless everyone knew about it, she probably didn't consider that they wouldn't actually see the snitch until after they'd been busted. Therefore giving them ample warning to scatter, create alibis, etc.
