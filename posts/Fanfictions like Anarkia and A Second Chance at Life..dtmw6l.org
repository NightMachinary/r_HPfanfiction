I was wondering if there were any other fanfictions like *Anarkia* and *A Second Chance at Life.*


** The closest thing I've found to Miranda Flairgold's work is a magic story that is a fully original fic--Mother of Learning by Nobody103 linkfp(2961893). It's a groundhog day type fic, with the main character reliving the same month at his mage academy over and over. It features extremely interesting and well-developed magic, dangerous animals and demons. It is clearly inspired by Flairgold's story (in addition to Harry Potter, and Dungeons & Dragons) and It is one lengthy chapter away from being finished.

Note one major flaw: the female characters are underdeveloped.

  Zorian, a mage in training, only wanted to finish his education in peace. Now he struggles to find answers as he finds himself repeatedly reliving the same month. 'Groundhog Day' style setup in a fantasy world.
