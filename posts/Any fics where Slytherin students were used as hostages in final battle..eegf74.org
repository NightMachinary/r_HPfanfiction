I always thought it was stupid to let go of Slytherin students, where they can be used as leverage against Death Eater parents. Is there any fics use it?


** Not for the Final Battle, but in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), Hermione's group captured several Slytherins in Draco Malfoy's Death Eater cell. She turned them over to Dumbledore, who then blackmailed their proxies in the Wizengamot for gold and votes.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** I am absolutely a Hufflepuff. I would do that. I believe in fairness, hard work, and sticking it to the cunts hard with a half brick in a sock, from behind a pillar where they can't see me.

Fairness isn't fairness in combat. It's fairness in society, and to get that, we may have to kill a whole lot of Slytherins.
