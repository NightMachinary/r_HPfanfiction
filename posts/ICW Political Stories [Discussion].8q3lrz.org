Given how connected the wizarding communities - or at least their governments - appear to be in canon (can they can depose Ministers of Magic?), are there any stories where this close relationship plays a large role in the story?

Like, maybe foreign Ministries quickly determine Fudge is just wrong about Voldemort's return and so force him to step down. Or whatever. Got a political story appetite today.


** Although it sticks with canon (so nothing so direct is done), foreign countries do accept refugees from Wizarding Britain in the Anguis Series and other similar activities.

The later series Stygian has international politics as one of the main components of the series.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** I seem to recall Starfox5 had a fic linkffn(patron) that involved significant international politicking.

There are some international meetings, but I cannot recall if it's the icw or some other organization in the AU.

*** It's the ICW. International politics also play a large role in "Divided and Entwined", though mostly indirectly, with other countries (resp factions in those countries) meddling in a Britain recovering from a civil war.

***** "Divided and Entwined" has more politics. In "Patron", Dumbledore is on top of things and (mostly) handles the Ministry and Wizengamot. In "Divided and Entwined", it's an unholy mess.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** Far more helpful and loyal than in canon. Though frankly, Harry kinda of is irrelavant along with him when compared to Hermione, who becomes something akin to a savant (yeah its that kind of fic). I wouldn't discard it for that, there really isn't bashing, more along the lines of turning Hermione's abilities up to 11 while leaving Harry and Ron about equal at respectable 7.

***** Harry is only "irrelevant" in as much as he's not involved in researching spells - unlike Dumbledore, who plays a major role there. Harry's still the (much) better fighter and flyer than Hermione, and there's ample combat in the story to make him and Ron relevant, in my opinion. And that's not even counting Harry's much, much more important social position there.

More importantly, though, in "Patron", both Harry and Hermione would be called "irrelevant" according to your standards when compared to Dumbledore. He's the one who directs the war, mentors and supervises Hermione's spell research, and handles politics. And when it comes to fighting, the most active character is Aberforth, handling "problems" all over Europe for the brother he loathes. So, it's really more a matter of how important you judge the things Harry and Hermione contribute to the war when you judge relevancy. There'are Harry's visions for intel on Voldemort's actions, Harry's fame and reputation and influence on his fellow students as well as individual fighting skill, and Hermione's research into new spells. But without Dumbledore, all of this would have been irrelevant since Voldemort would have walked over them without trouble.

******** Don't take what I said the wrong way, I'm a fan of Patron. Though I do admit my personal favorite of your work is The Dark Lord Never Died. You have really good world-building and some of the best action in the fandom. Plus I enjoy that the characters in your fics are not idiots.
