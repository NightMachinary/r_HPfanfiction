I'm looking for a specific fic where Snape and Harry both dream of Dumbledore (who is dead), and Dumbledore turns them both into children so that they can experience a happy childhood. Ron and Hermione temporarily adopt them both until they can figure out how to turn them back. I remember Snape is bullied in preschool and Harry defends him. Eventually Dumbledore turns them back.

In the sequel, Snape's love of Harry matured into a romantic love.
