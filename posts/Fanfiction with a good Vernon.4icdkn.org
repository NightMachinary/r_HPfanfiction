I just read My Nephew Harry, and I'd like to read more fanfiction with a Vernon that isn't completely evil. Typically, from what I read, it's Petunia who is the less evil one.


** I'd like to see a fic where they both aren't psychopaths, but they still hate him. So he gets treated properly, because Normal People don't even think about boot cupboards, raggedy clothes, and medical neglect. They don't hide their dislike but don't abuse him.

** I think linkffn(Magical Relations) is ok, it has magical Dudley in it.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** linkffn(10136172) had a good Dursley family, although I stopped reading it for unrelated reasons soon after that. I don't think it was a focus of the fic.

** It's a minor part of the story, but I liked Vernon in linkffn(Old Soldiers Never Die by Rorschach's Blot).

#+begin_quote
  "Might also be a good idea to start working with Dudley," Vernon called out. "Learning a bit of boxing might be just the edge you'll need to kill one more before they manage to bring you down."

  "Thank you uncle," Harry gave a cold smile. "I look forward to learning all I can."

  "So you're going to get the freaks to pay you to kill more freaks?" Vernon gave a slow nod, "I think I might be proud of you . . . Harry."
