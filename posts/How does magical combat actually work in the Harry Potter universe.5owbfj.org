Ignoring the movies, how does/would actual magical combat/duels work in the harry potter world? I have seen/read a lot of different version, the wand is a gun approach of the movies where a lot of running and hiding and jumping around is done and a wand is basicely just a slower gun shooting bullets you can defend against, the stand still and "fence" without much movement at all and all other kinds and versions. But im not sure what actually would be the proper way.

Lets assume wand movements are actualy important as is perfect pronunciation (even if silent cast), can you actually run and jump and dodge whithout screwing that up? I mean its almost impossible irl to hold an egg in a spoon while running and jumping/dodgeing, could anyone really perform perfect wand movements while doing that and pronounce the words properly? If you are breathing super hard and fast, anything long then 1 short word would get warped just due to the rapid breathing, wouldnt it? You also have the fact that its impossible to aim properly while running/jumping, out of 100 shots maybe 5 or so would be on target id assume if you are actually moving - so is it a bit of move, stop and cast, move again?

I cant recall how it really was done in the books (and im to lazy to redownload them and then find all the mentionings) and iirc there wasnt actually a lot of proper fighting as such in the books themselves (bar maybe the end of book 5).

So my question to you is, how to do you think combat in the hpverse would work? The nerdier the answer the better!!!

This, the priori incantatem effect and other examples scattered throughout the books, shows that spells, or at least curses and jinxes, do in fact show up as projectiles. I do not know why so many people suddenly think that this isn't the case but they are wrong.

Spells can collide, they can ricochet, they are tangible. They can be dodged, they can be blocked and they can be parried. Spells move fast but wizards seem to be faster, stronger and more perceptive than muggles either way.

Just look at quidditch. Flying at high speeds while dodging projectiles, hitting those projectiles, which are fully capable of breaking limbs, with one hand while moving towards it and being capable of finding and tracking a small highspeed flying object all show just how superior wizards and witches really are.

Is it really such a surprise that people like that can sidestep 'jets of light' when they are prepared for it?

Everyone has their own idea of how magical combat should be in the Harry Potter world, but keep in mind that spells can be seen, they can be tracked and they can be dodged.

*** Nice find for the ricochet, but the next question that needs to be answered is, what speed due they travel at? In the example provided, it very well could have been that all the spells were cast near simultaneously, and it wasn't until it was all over that people realized what happened, otherwise, why weren't Hermione and Goyle able to dodge the spell?

Two bullets fired at each other can very well richochet too, but that doesn't mean you can see, track, and dodge one fired at you.

This was right after Voldemort tried the Imperius and Harry resisted it. Voldemort then fired another curse at Harry and this happened.

You have to remember that this was at the graveyard and that the entire duel happened while they were surrounded by Death Eaters. And there were only about 25 of them there. And really, a circle made out of 25 people isn't that big so Harry and Voldemort were standing rather closely.

Another interesting quote is this, once again from the GoF:

"Hermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody something. The rest of the class was very eager to leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex deflection that many of them were nursing small injuries."

Hex deflection, not practicing shield charms, not using counterspells. Deflection.

We don't know what that means for sure, but with the ricochet quote from before we know that it is possible to redirect spells. Put that together with the term 'deflection' and the fact that Harry can dodge a curse from Voldemort after being Crucio'd and we can safely conclude that dodging is possible in a duel. We can also conclude that perhaps the fanon trope of 'parrying' isn't as farfetched as some people may believe.

Now, I don't think that spells move slowly, but I do think that wizards and witches can react, dodge and perhaps deflect a small number of them.

Now the next part is my own opinion and isn't as waterproof as my previous arguments. This is simply my hypothesis on how magical duels work now that I thought about it for a while:

This all leads me to believe that, barring transfiguration and the elements, a magical duel consists of trying to get initiative with a multitude of rapid curses while dodging/deflecting/shielding (dodge when you can, deflect when you can't and shield when you can't do either or have to stop multiple spells) your enemy's curses.

Shielding is probably the last resort because that forces you to stop attacking, which allows your enemy to stop dodging and deflecting and fully focus on taking you down.

Once you add transfiguration and wide area spells you change everything quite a bit but I think the basics would still be the same.

#+end_quote

Harry started moving when Voldemort first raised his wand, so before the spell had been cast. And the spell struck the headstone Harry was hiding behind since we're told it cracked, implying if Harry didn't have cover the spell would have struck him, so he didn't really dodge it.

For your second example, the Shield Charm has been shown to deflect hexes (but not always), it's possible that was what they were practicing. Of course, it's all speculation and I think it's open to interpretation.

**** You dont dodge the bullet, but you can dodge the gun. I.e while its impossible to dodge a fired bullet it is possible (well theoretically) to dodge before the shot is fired so that the second the shot is fired you already dodged.

For bullets this means dodging in the time of a trigger being pulled so its pretty much impossible, however spells do take a lot longer to be performed, and 0.5 seconds or so is ample time to dodge. This means that even if spells were as fast as bullets it would be much easier to dodge them compared to a bullet.

** There are largely 4 different scenarios and 3 of them are shown in the last few chapters of Order of the Phoenix, the last is shown towards the end of Half-Blood Prince.

Listed in chronological order :

- Scenario 1 : Two magic users or two groups of magic users of unequal skill face each other, where the weaker group is fighting to flee. This scenario is perfectly described in the bowels of the department of mystery in book 5 where Harry and the gang are facing Lucius Malfoy with a variety of death eaters. From the weaker perspective, this fight involved a lot of running while keeping objects such as doors and shelves between the line of sight, and also firing spells over the shoulder as general disruption. From the Death Eater perspective, this involves a lot of chasing, corralling, and doing what you can to corner the opponent to stop them.

- Scenario 2 : Two magic users of equal skill face each other. This can be shown best with the Belatrix and Sirius fight in front of the archway. I believe it would look very much like a medium distance fencing match, probably within 15- 20 feet of each other. It would involve lots of movement of the wand to hide to hide when and what spell you will be casting offensively or to immediately begin casting a shield or parry as needed. Generally in this type of combat, the first hit lands will be the deciding blow. These fights will be quick where the first mistake made in positioning or awareness will be met with a deathblow, especially if one side can emotionally disrupt the other.

- Scenario 3 : Two grandmasters face each other. This is the Voldemort vs. Dumbledore fight. These are the fights that feel like a proper 'magic' fight, where each player has a space around them that is theirs to control and command to their will in every sense. Need to protect someone? that statue that is nearby will become animated and act as a physical barrier. Need to attack? Summon a wave of flame to send towards your enemy. A wave of flame coming at you? Reverse control of it, or deflect it with a wave of water. These are the fights that are determined your creativity and resourcefulness of imposing your will on the environment around you.

- Scenario 4 : A weaker person tries to take on a someone more skilled in a direct confrontation. This is the scenario at the end of Half-Blood Prince where Harry gets absolutely schooled by Snape. Harry's intention, strategy, and spells were immediately read and deflected before even having a chance to start.

Also, in general, I don't think spells themselves really act as 'trackable' projectiles. Yes the books describe 'flashes of light' but I think this description is comparable to seeing a 'flash' from the barrel of a gun. Yes, line of sight is important, but the thought of seeing a spell, identifying it by it's color, tracking it's location, and coming up with the appropriate defense to that specific spell is ludicrous. For instance, in baseball, a pitcher is 60 feet from the batter, and a ball pitched between 90 and 100 mph, even with these metrics the batter only has a small fraction of a second to react to which pitch is coming at him.

**** Well as we see in scenario 4, it is possible to figure out which spell is being cast and counter it before it's even finished. Surely there is a time to recognize and prepare a defense against a spell, but doing so purely by the light given off is not it. It would have to be by the movements of the wand, the incantation (if spoken), or general knowledge of the caster's favorites. If the light of the spell is involved at all, it would be the last piece, the deciding factor between a narrowed down list of reactions.

As for the speed of the battle, I think that much is a given. Fighting with a weapon has always been a quick endeavor, it's movies that tell us otherwise.

***** In canon, nonverbal casting is taught in year 6 - so, skilled wizards and witches won't give their spell away by that. Further, countering a spell before it's finished casting would require you to cast much more rapidly than your opponent. Given the reaction times of humans, I don't really think that would work out that well with spells that travel too fast to block.

****** Spells being nonverbal is why I gave the disclaimer in parenthesis, but we must also keep in mind that the killing curse, and other unforgivables, were ALWAYS verbal. Why else would Voldemort take the time to make the full incantation in his fight with Dumbledore.

That being said, we don't know the functions or limitations of the shield charm. Could it be that a good shield charm will deaden the effects of a spell meant to sever an arm to only give a paper cut? If so, a shield charm combined with a bit of movement could very well be a useful defense. If it's a spell that can't be weakened by the shield charm, perhaps all those spells NEED to be spoken, giving the defender extra information and time to make the appropriate response. This to me seems plausible, and may explain why the 'grandmaster' duel was one consisting largely of transfiguration. Only through that type duel, could you get a spell to the scale needed to alter and modify the environment, which opens up completely new avenues when it comes to attacking and defending.

** Dodging (or side-stepping) really cheapens magical combat. Perhaps they are warranted, if one is sufficiently far away, but otherwise it's a an easy copout shortcut. My preference lies towards specialised shields and transfiguration/conjuration for defence, and curses/charms/transfiguration for offence.

Canon doesn't have a lot of examples of such magic (a few super-cool duels aside), so if one wants to delve further into magical combat, get the fuck down and invent some spells and magical effects.

** I think that we have to consider the mechanics of spells to begin with. We have mostly two types of combat spells, projectiles and non projectiles. Projectile spells are those such as Stupefy, and must be shielded against or dodged. Non projectiles encompass everything else, such as Aquamenti, Incendio, and various transfigurations.

Now surprisingly enough, we never get an indicator that power is a factor in spellcasting, at least canonically. The fandom likes to assign power, because being able to send Killing Curses all day is ridiculous and should be nerfed. But as I see it, spellcasting is about the mind. You concentrate on putting someone to sleep, and thus get the stock Stupefy. Emotions can influence this, since as you get angry, you are more able to concentrate absolutely on what you want. This leads to spells which supposedly require an emotional component. The Killing Curse for example, requires that you must totally want somebody dead, without doubt. Now this can be done emotionless and calmly, especially by Voldemort who may or may not have mental issues anyway. But for the majority of the population, this mindset doesn't come into play unless they truly hate somebody with all their heart. This explains how the Aurors are able to use it when given the go ahead, how Voldemort can hand them out like candy, and how others have more trouble with them.

While spells don't have a power requirement, people can still get tired casting them. It is hard to concentrate, especially on difficult topics. This explains Voldemort's and Harry's prodigious abilities. Both of them are very driven people with an ability to understand and comprehend spells which is far above their peers. Harry can cast the Patronus, fully mastered the Summoning charm in a matter of days, and pulled off the imperious curse on his first try. The reason he isn't on Voldemorts level is simply exposure to magic.

Now why does only Dumbledore and Voldemort use flashy AoE spells when dueling? Well first let's explain why nobody else uses them. Finite. They can be canceled easily. Finite sort of acts as the EMP of magic. A lot of magic can be canceled by it, so transfiguring the ground or animating it is next to useless. But to cancel projectile spells, finite would need to collide with them midair. So the only option of projectile spells is to shield or dodge. But wait, what about wand motions? Wand motions (headcanon) are a series of movements denoting parameters and variables of the spell. With the proper wand motions, you can make a Lumos on par with a Lumos Maxima. However, you can also hold these parameters in one's head, making concentration more difficult and the spells sloppier, but allowing point casting, which is essentially just pointing and shooting. So this is why fights devolve into duels. There is an interesting website or post somewhere where someone calculated the speed of a spell to be on par with a starwars blaster bolt, which I thought was funny. But you have enough time to dodge, but can still be hit if one aims. Shields block the physical effects of a spell, but are connected magically to the caster, who must concentrate on maintaining the shield. The unforgivable curses are mental attacks, so they infect the magic enough to drop the shield, since you cannot concentrate through an imperious or a cruciatus.

So why does Dumbledore use transfigurations? Well because both he and Voldemort are too damn good at shielding. Any traditional spells would just not make it through, thus they must get creative. If both Lord Level wizards can toss out multiple transfigurations per second, then finiting one or two will see a hole form in your defense, where the opponent gains the advantage. The only solution is to transfigure the transfigurations.

All of the above applies to magical vs magical combat. Magical vs muggle combat is different, as muggles cannot cancel spells. Thus, a self perpetuating swamp transfiguration in the middle of London would bog down the population, literally. Invisibility may be countered at some point, but not before the heads of the military are imperioused. Teleportation would never be countered well by Muggle forces, though automated turrets might work. Admittedly, bombs and guns would do a lot of damage but the wizards have an easy way of countering, in negating kinetic energy, and targeted vanishing wards. The way I see it, Wizards as a society are a heavily adaptable nation of the best guerilla warfare fighters where everyone is armed and dangerous. A wizard may teleport while invisible into a nuclear power plant, and short out the power while breaking open the nuclear containment, then teleporting out.

And that brings me to a final theory. Why does electricity fail with magic. Magic is the art of breaking reality, so when some magic leaks off, it turns to wild magic. It's like have an engine in a car which loses heat because it is not 100% efficient. This wild magic randomly messes with reality. It will create pockets of hot or cold, pockets of reduced, increased or reversed gravity. Some wild magic would stop elections from flowing, some make them flow backwards, and some force quantum tunneling to increase range by orders of magnitude. And each of these pockets randomly mutate, changing sizes and melding into each other. This would provide a great explanation for the failure of electronics.

A physical shield protects against Stupefy and fares decently well against Incendio (assuming it's a magical fire primarily, which it must be since it's got no fuel). In your writing, you can choose whether the standard magic shields protect against the more physical attacks.

That changes the analysis somewhat. You have spells that need line of effect, spells that can target you regardless, and indirect spells. /Aguamenti/ to make the ground slick would be indirect; /Aguamenti/ to bowl you over would be line of effect; /Crucio/ would target you regardless.

This would kill probably kill anyone who wanders by. Maybe not immediately, but it's injuring you every time it affects you. Reversed gravity might not hurt much because gravity is such a weak force. Temperature fluctuations -- if one of those hits your brain, that could kill you or give you permanent brain damage. If it hits your bones, it'll stress them and you'll end up with microfractures. Electrons not flowing -- that would probably result in a short seizure or temporary numbness and paralysis in part of your body. Or if you're unlucky, it hits your brain stem and you die.

**** That's an interesting point. I was pulling the concept from Dogwizard from the Windrose Chronicles. It does beg the question though, why doesn't anyone die after walking through a ghost? If we presume that ghosts are around freezing point, then one would think that they die.

Just to pull a workable answer out of my ass, free magic and magic fluctuations are most common in places with large amounts of magic, such as Hogwarts. Students aren't affected because they have a magical aura around them already as a result of them having magic and leaking it constantly. The leaked magic turns to wild magic, but not immediately, and acts as a sort of buffer for the magic. It isn't overly noticed in the muggle world, because iron and iron alloys negate and absorb the free magic, especially in cold temperatures, hence cold iron being anathema to Fey or magic spells. Given how much iron is in and around London, that should account for them not dying.

***** You could write a fic like that. You'd have to divert from canon -- kids at Hogwarts can bring in apparently mundane animals -- and any Muggle walking through Diagon Alley is at risk, so you'd have to tune the strength somewhat.

****** It really does make a lot of sense, at least the iron part. Sort of like a faraday cage for magic. Of course it would only work with direct magic, so Stupefy is fine, but Incendio is not. Protective enchantments are a bit more tricky because the canon is so inconsistent. We see age lines which indicate barrier wards, but we also see how Apparatus is impossible in all of Hogwarts, which indicates AoE wards. Tanks may be a great idea for attack, but then you get the issue with wild magic. Maybe the more focused a magic is, then the less it is interfered with by iron, explaining why vehicles don't fail next to the Leaky Cauldron/King's Cross. So vague magic, such as DADA curse or wild magic, or accidental magic are all easily negated, Stupefy is weakened, and wards are barely touched. Magic is interesting because the mechanics are so unintuitive, so I really enjoy trying to figure out workable mechanics which fit with canon.

For instance, the Fidelius requires tons of power to cast, at least according to fanon. Let's put a concrete number to it for the sake of demonstration: it consumes 10,000 magic beans to Fidelius a 1m cube. That strength produces one wild magic event per second throughout the area affected by the Fidelius.

This falls off with the square of the distance from the area affected by the spell. At 1m, let's say, you're down to 0.5 events per second. At 2m, you're down to 0.25 events per second. 3m, 0.125 per second. By the time you reach 10m, you get about 3.5 events per hour on average.

Muck about with the numbers to get the effect you want.

Regardless, though, this would put a lot of stress on materials in a magic environment. You have a book with no special protections? Muggle clothing? It's probably going to be trash after a year in Hogwarts.

The worst part of it is that I don't see what good it does you. How does your story benefit specifically from this wild magic idea? It seems to be a complicated thing that opens you up to a ton of plot holes if you're not smart and well-read and careful to examine every single aspect of the effects. It's like the worldbuilding in Firebird's Son: unsatisfying and full of holes, half of which have inadequate attempts to plug them.

** I'm going to pull from the expanded world and say it's probably a lot like what we saw in Fantastic Beasts. Or at least takes a lot from that world. Mostly silent casting, and among powerful witches and wizards; point casting.

When we witnessed duels and fights in Fantastic Beasts (especially during the ending scenes in the duel between Newt, MACUSA, and Gellert) we didn't see many wand movements at all aside from shielding and batting away spells. I think combat in the wider magical world would be much like that.

Most likely all combat would involve silent and point-casting to some degree, except for maybe the most powerful of spells like the unforgivables and fiendfyre. Now the more intricate aspects of battle I think would be a bit different. I imagine a fight against multiple enemies would involve a LOT of dodging and shielding and be very much in line with the idea of guerilla tactics. In a one on one battle though I imagine it would be much more like your typical duel that we've seen multiple times in the series.

** Wizards and witches shooting coloured lights out of their wands is as basic as you can get. That sort of magical combat is for those without much knowledge in magic or power in general.

However, once you get to Dumbledore and Voldemort levels of skill, then things become more esoteric and strange. The duel in the MoM atrium is a prime example though the movies managed to make it look pedestrian (Where's Voldemort's conjured shield?!)

I like to imagine when you're a master of magic, and have learned strange and nearly forgotten spells from ancient tomes then the spells you can pull off are wondrous and frightening to behold.

Picture a wizard waving his wand, nothing happens at first and so you think it's a dud spell when suddenly your entire perspective shifts, what is up is down, what is left is right, that would instantly fuck you up, you will no longer be able to fight like that and all it would take is simple stunner or killing curse to finish you off.

How about a spell that adjusts the gravity around your opponent, either making them float harmlessly or crushing them into the ground as if an elephant just landed on them.

Then there's transfiguration, Dumbledore was supposedly a master but we don't get to see really creative uses in either the books or the films, I like to imagine any mundane object could be turned into a vicious animal. Say a fight breaks out in a classroom, well, all those desks and chairs suddenly become lions, tigers, wolves e.t.c. Or you could even deliberately not finish the transfiguration so that a floor tile turns into a lion's face which bites and snaps at anyone who walks near it.

Then there's the real heavy hitters, like Fiendfyre, infamous for being wild and uncontrollable for most magicals, well, if you have an iron will (thanks to Occlumency) you could control it, like the giant snake Voldemort conjured in his fight against Dumbledore. If there's Fiendfyre how about other elements? A water version of Fiendfyre would be just as devastating, at least fire if hot enough can instantly disintegrate you, drowning is a slow and painful death.

Lastly there's creative uses of mundane and seemingly harmless spells such as Wingardium Leviosa, like Ron demonstrated with the Troll, a heavy object falling on someone's head would kill them just as easily as a killing curse.

** Spells, if you discard the movies, are actually hard to see. only the most taxing spells create light show like in the movies. Most of the jinxs and curses are invisible or only seen as ripple in the air. Also spells are might not be fast as bullets but they are actually hard to dodge. So if you want to imitate Yoda you must be supernaturally fast. Voldemort has done a lot of rituals to make his body spell resistent and enhance his body. Dumbledore though could have been gone the other way. accumulate a lot of magical knowledge, enchant your body and clothes, cast lots of defensive spells on yourself to turn yourself to an unshakible force. Lots of fanfic would tell you to get close to your target to defeat them but no self respecting wizard would let you get that close to themselfs.
