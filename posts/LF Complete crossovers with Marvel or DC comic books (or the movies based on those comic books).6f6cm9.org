One specific one I'm having trouble recalling is where Harry goes to the Justice League world and he's the Master of Death so can't be killed. He's also stupidly powerful and everyone in the Watchtower hides the coffee from him because it get's him super wired. Pretty sure he ends up with Supergirl/Kara as well.

Any other completed crossovers with Marvel/DC would be appreciated. I'm not picky except for the whole complete thing so even if you don't think it's very good I'll probably read it. Please no MegaMatt09 fics though.


** The story you're specifically looking for is Terminal Justice by Overkill AKA Irrational Intelligence. it is a sequel to Make a Wish by Rorsachs Blot He removed the story from ffn about a year ago. You can still read it at linkffn(11965672)

** "Son of the Archer" is pretty cute. That's a crossover with the MCU, in which Ron Weasley gets separated from his family when he's a toddler, and ends up adopted by Clint "Hawkeye" Barton.

** Oh! I almost forgot this one, but there's [[http://web.archive.org/web/20080308011248/http://www.themedicinewheel.net/series/computer.html][The Room With a Computer]], which is a crossover with the X-Men movieverse.

After the death of Jean Grey, Scott "Cyclops" Summers takes up the role of Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts. Takes place in Harry's sixth year, though Hermione is a more central character.

Features appearances of most the X-Men, and in the last chapter Arthur Weasley gets to fly in the X-jet. Very cute story!

  From June to July 2012 the talented Heather Sinclair produced a wonderful story 'Death's Knight' a crossover of Harry Potter and the New 52 Heroes. Available here: /s/8187641/1/Death-s-Knight. Heather's story ran out of steam, but she gave me permission to adopt it. Where her's started 5 years after the end of the world, mine starts about 20 minutes before.

  AU Death of the Endless offered Harry a way to save his friends and a few billion other people while he was at it. There's a catch. He has to use that Master of Death title that's hanging over his head and give up almost everything he's ever known. But there are perks. Oh yes, dating a Kryptonian can be challenging. Harry/Power Girl.
