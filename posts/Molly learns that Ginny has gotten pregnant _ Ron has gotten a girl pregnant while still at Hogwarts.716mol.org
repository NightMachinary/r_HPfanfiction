*** Just don't filter for that particular pairing on FFNet or search any such tags on AO3, and you should be able to avoid it.

Cassandra Clare once wrote a Ron/Ginny fic called "Mortal Instruments" (the title of which was later re-purposed for her book series), and she has regretted it ever since - so much so that she's removed all existing copies of it from the internet.

***** And for sure you shouldn't search on 'Ron/Ginny' 'incest' there, because you'd probably find over 200 fics that you wouldn't want to read. Even clicking on the wrong tag for [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/daily_deviant/tag/content:+incest][Daily Deviant]] comes up with stories you should definitely keep at arm's length.

***** Ao3 is usually fine, it's just that they don't moderate what can be posted. Just set up a filter that blocks out -cest tags and you'll be fine.

**** It's a two-fer, both dirty joke and a reference to the actual sword.

...

No, but it actually references the sword as well. And it doesn't help that I ALWAYS misread his username as closerpenis.
