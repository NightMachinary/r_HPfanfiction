It can be op harry, but I'm looking for unique things like Barefoot on ffn or Bitter Hug of Mortality on ao3. Because I love that stuff.

**** +Looks like it's golden lasers, shields and explosions.+

Edit: The author made up his own sharingan or something because it does whatever the fuck he happens to need it to do for any given situation. Not the worst story though. Reasonably sensible adults and I really liked many of the changes second year. Especially because he had the guts to change some really key things and /stick to them/ instead of bullshitting his way back onto the canon rails.

Edit 2: His dementors are way better than canon's.

Edit 3: Maybe it's like a green lantern ring but in his eyes? Given up trying to make sense of it at this point tbh.

Edit 4: Finished the fic. No idea what the power is or why he has it but it was an enjoyable read.

***** I... think I'm going to at least skim through it to at least try and figure out how this works. How are the Dementors better than canon? Are they more eldritch in a /HPMOR/ sort of way, or more human as in /Dementors/?

*** I had to drop Ectomancer, honestly. It's just barely even relayed to Harry Potter, aside from the characters. He falls into puddles and talks with like Studio Ghibli-esque spirits and gets kidnapped onto a Fight Club boat until he kills a troll. I dropped it when he got in legal trouble for either killing the troll or making an illegal wand out of a chair leg, it was just too weird.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
