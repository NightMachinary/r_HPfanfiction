Struggling to find fics that hold my attention hoping you guys can recommend something. I tend to get a bit picky with the fics I like so I'll just throw out some preferences of mine and anything even remotely close would be greatly appreciated. I like a lengthy read with a fairly canon Harry, except with a bit of a power boost, canon Harry was meant to want to be an auror but I feel like he fell short in a few areas. M rating is good, gritty with swearing and sex is great. Any old pairing will do, no slash but and bonus points for Harry/Hermione. I'm a sucker for top notch writing styles, first fic I ever read was Vox Corporis and my expectations have been unfairly high since that day. Last thing, and I don't know why, but Draco being Harry's best buddy or on the order's side just grinds my gears for some reason. Thanks in advance gang


** Are you looking for a fairly canon Harry, or a fairly canon plot as well?

I've written two crossover stories where Harry goes through some more focused combat training, and the fights are deadlier as well. Also, H/Hr, and Draco is anything but a buddy of Harry.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.
