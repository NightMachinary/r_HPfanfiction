At the end of book three, after the event's in the shrieking shack, Dumbledore visits Sirius in who is now imprisoned in one of the Hogwarts' Towers. We never see this meeting, but despite a complete lack of proof (Pettigrew escaped, and Remus is still in werewolf form) Sirius manages to convince Dumbledore that everything he had thought about the night James and Lily died for the last 12 years was wrong and that Sirius really was innocent.

What do you think went down in that conversation? Are there any fics which deal with this?

** I don't know why, I feel like it was not even a conversation. Considering Sirius was unconscious (like Harry), Dumbledore 1st stop was probably the only one able to give their version of the events, Snape , Ron and Hermione. And while I do not think Snape was totally honest (though I'm not sure he would outright lie to Dumbledore), Ron and Hermione probably gave him a lot to think about.\\
For example, if Sirius is really a Death Eater, why is Harry still alive on the ground after Sirius managed to find him outside of Hogwarts?\\
Why does it look like Harry tried to protect Sirius against the Dementor?\\
Add at that the version of Ron and Hermione (about Peter Pettigrew), plus Dumbledore power as a legilimen, and the conversation probably went like this :

******* Absolutely nothing in canon say Sirius did'nt get a trial. It is possible for people (at least Death Eaters ) to be tried without being present. As seen with the Lestranges and Barty Jr who only came to hear their verdict. Veritaserum is a plot hole, and Rowling sealed it by saying it was full of flaws. Sirius could have ttansfigured his throat to block it, transfigured the potion into water when he drinks it. Or just modify his memories during the 5 days gap between the attack on the Potter and his arrest.

So there is no way to be totally sure about his innocence without Pettigrew. And that's before he escapes Azkaban. After this, people were probably even more paranoid about him (he did the impossible once, why not twice ? ). If caught, he would be Kissed, just in case. And even if he does get a new trial, no reason for the verdict to change without new elements (ie Pettigrew )

******** Why wouldn't he have been powerful? His son was a Death Eater, but he wasn't, and he took a hard stand on Death Eaters, so he only really lost a shot at being Minister. No one knew about Jr until the forth book. And Dumbledore could've brought Sirius to the international stage, and gotten him a trial through the ICW.

They could do truth serum. Or they could watch his memories, and if you fake a memory, we're shown it's very obvious if it's a fake. People here like to say truth serum can be fought, citing canon, but not actually bringing in evidence of it. We're shown unbreakable vows are canon though, and you'll die if you break the vow. So they could have him swear the vow with Dumbledore and a binder infant of an audience, saying the memories are real and he won't fight the serum. Boom, all arguments taken out.

********** Sorry, I was asking why it mattered when talking about getting Sirius a trial? Crouch was a super ass, but he was fair in his dealings in the justice system. He failed when he got his son out, but that had nothing to do with Sirius. He gave the Lestrange trio and Jr a trial, and they caught them in the act of torturing the Longbottoms into insanity, yet for some reason only Sirius didn't get one. Which makes zero sense outside of a malicious or VERY incompetent Dumbledore.

** Linkffn(The Bureaucratic Error by Iniga) covers this in Chapter 5 but it's canon divergent (Pettigrew is caught) and the whole story is AU. Short answer: he uses legilimancy.

But in any event, I recommend that fic for about a hundred different reasons.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. Heavy on Remus/Sirius friendship. Some Black family dynamic; Harry/Sirius family dynamic; Sirius PTSD exploration. Tonks is a major player but not til halfway through. No bashing. Harry is present but not primary; these adults prefer not to ask teenagers to save the world.

**** Dumbledore does nothing in his power as Chief Warlock or Supreme Mugwump of the ICW to actually help Sirius after it comes out he is innocent.

I subscribe to the fanon trope/cliche/whatever that he knew Sirius was innocent, but wouldn't let Harry be around him. He knows Harry has a bad life with the Dursley, but as Snape confirms, he wants Harry to martyr himself. Sirius would help him with his confidence and a real family to love and live for. Seriously, #12 is under a Fidelius, with DUMBLEDORE as the secret keeper, (WHICH MEANS NO CHANCE HE TURNS AND GIVES THE SECRET AWAY), and he still forces Harry to Privet Drive for two months of the summer.

Edit: Changed innounce to innocent for the third time.

**** The first.

Snape was a Death Eater and a spy for Dumbledore since before the Potters died. There was no way he didn't know who the traitor was and since Dumbledore trusted Snape after the 3rd book, he knew as well. Voldemort did not keep the identities of his Death Eaters secret; he addressed them by name in the 4th book, they formed a circle around him with each Death Eater having a specific position and both Pettigrew and Snape had their places. There was no way that Snape and Dumbledore didn't know who the real traitor was.

Not to mention, the secret keeper for the Child of Prophecy betrays them, a man they all trusted and whose betrayal shocked everyone, and Dumbledore doesn't so much as speak to him and ask him why he betrayed his best friend and godson?

***** I like to think that Snape kept it as a bit of revenge over Sirius. He knew but he didn't tell Dumbledore. Sending Sirius to jail served no purpose as Dumbledore easily convinced everyone else to leave Harry during his childhood.

Not that I don't understand the other viewpoint. None of us really knows, unless Rowling clears it up.

Another bit of headcanon is that Dumbledore is stuck in limbo, unable to see his sister due to grooming Harry to die.

And yet Dumbledore trusted Snape. I hope that cursed hand and Nagini's venom were incredibly painful.

I don't think he'd be able to convince Sirius to not visit or check up on Harry regularly.

******* Oh don't get me wrong. If I were Harry, I'd probably burn their legacies to ashes and make their names villified (McGonagall too).

But again, this is Dumbledore. I think he legitimately didn't know. I don't think he facilitated the lack of a trial, but thought Sirius was guilty and that Harry would go to his custody if he got off like the "imperioused" death eaters, so he took advantage.

Of course there is also the distinct possibility Dumbledore thought both were death eaters, reinforced by Snape.

******* It's also headcanon for me that Ginger's are especially susceptible to possession by Horcruxes.

Or that Dumbledore killed his sister and swore not to kill again.

Although, McGonagall is almost as culpable for leaving Harry in said situation as Dumbledore.

*** I don't know, Dumbledore has experience with his bestest bosom friend (Grindelwald) turning and betraying him (or at least having such a large and sudden falling out that the next time they see each other they're in a battle that determines the outcome of a war), so maybe he isn't so surprised when it apparently happens with Sirius and James.
