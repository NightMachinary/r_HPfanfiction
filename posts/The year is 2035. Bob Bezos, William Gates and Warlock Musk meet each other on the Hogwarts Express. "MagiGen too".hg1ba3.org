Someone figured out how to CRISPR the magic gene into IVF babies and offered various ultra rich muggles the chance to have wizards as children or grandchildren. Now there's three kids at Hogwarts with a combined net worth of their families of over three hundred billion dollars. The wizarding economy will never be the same.

** Able to only convert about 30,000 USD into galleons because of laws governing transactions between separate economies, those three children get onto Gringott's shit list for being even more annoying customers than the Malfoys who constantly run surprise inspections on their high security vaults. At least the Malfoys have the courtesy to not make a fuss on the main banking floor.

Bezos tries to start amazon in the wizarding world and struggles to get off the ground. Existing owl-order, the ability to teleport, and a different culture makes shopping a hassle-free experience anyway.

Musk does a bunch of stupid shit and runs afoul of the Ministerial Agency Against Deceptive Duplicity, a similar agency to the SEC. Having run afoul of traditionalists in the government who dislike his muggle ways, Musk gets sent to Azkaban.

I'm not even going to get into magic genes, but as someone who's studied genetics, definitely another variable than Rowling's recessive magic gene. I suspect something involving souls.

*** I'd guess Musk would be more interested in getting someone to develop a way to consistently violate conservation of momentum, because if you have a device that can magically do that then you can take an existing SpaceX capsule, slap the magic thruster on the back, and pretty much fly around the solar system however you like.

It's be like playing Kerbal with the infinite fuel cheat on.

*** Someone did the calculations once, magic would need to be an array of like 17 genes, half of which are recessive, a quarter of which are dominant and a quarter of which has to either be recessive or dominant based on what population numbers you axiomate.

I'm generally not a fan of making magic conform to science, or at least physics and biology. It's its own separate field, its own thing - there are magical energies, magical biologies, magical reactions and so on and so forth. You'll never be able to make sense of a phoenix if you don't look at it magically, because its biology is only a small part of what makes it real. Same with all other magic, which may have physical or even chemical effects, but isn't "just another energy" or "dark energy" or whatever.

Imo, magic comes from the soul, like you said. It might be an effect of bloodline (which JK said but I dislike), or an effect of the life in magic itself or simply an effect of the planet, or perhaps the stars at the time of one's birth. I wouldn't say it's out of the question for instance that the constellation which one was born under determines one's magical talents, for instance.

**** If magic is caused by something outside of the DNA that actually makes it ridiculously easy. Take a donor egg cell from a witch (magical), remove the DNA and replace it with the DNA of an egg cell of the muggle mother. Now perform normal in vitro fertilization with the DNA of the muggle father and you have a fertilized cell that is from a magical standpoint the child of the witch mother but genetically it's the child of the two muggle parents. You don't even need to make a single cut or edit in the genome. Any decently equipped IVF clinic could do it. Personally I prefer two dozen different genes across different chromosomes, it's at least somewhat challenging.

***** You're assuming the mysterious magical thing is in some other part of the egg, like the mitochondria (which would make sense, considering how magic breaks normal laws regarding energy.) But the inheritance of magic could just as easily have nothing to do with gametes at all. It could depend on the way the stars shone on the pregnant woman's belly, or any other bizarre thing.

***** I set up a headcanon about all this stuff one summer, because I was bored. In that, there was once an advanced civilization back before the Toba super volcano went off, that was magical where our society is technological, but over the course of their development they depleted certain magical natural resources, and made it impossible to follow in their footsteps. Like what would happen if we used up all the coal and oil in the world. Sure, we might find a way to not need it anymore, but if another civilization had to start over with no coal or oil, they'd have a problem with kicking off their own industrial revolution.

This civilization saw the Toba Cataclysm coming, or maybe they were just planing ahead, and like our own vaults, they set up sanctuaries, to ensure that they'd have enough left over to rebuild if need be. Maybe Toba was natural, or maybe it was the result of their own ‘Mutually Assured Destruction', just with volcanic fire and ashes, instead of nuclear. Either way, the Toba Cataclysm happened, and wiped them all away, reshaping the world and beginning the little ice age that nearly wiped out humanity in our own history.

Access to ‘Magic', or Mana as they called it, is restricted to 81 genes total, only 27 of which are usually human. Each gene acts as a marker for the Ley Lines to recognize who has access to any one or more of the set of all magical abilities. All genes are recessive, making them relatively rare, but not unheard of. If you tried to put All Of Them in someone, then the System would see it as ‘hacking' and smite them and you; but with enough trial and error you could get away with it, to some extent.

X---x---x----

Of course, that's all just headcanon.
