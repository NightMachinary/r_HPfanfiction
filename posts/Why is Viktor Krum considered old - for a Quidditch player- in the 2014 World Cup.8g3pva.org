In the 2014 World Cup Skeeter says repeatedly that Krum, at 38, is really old and taking the spotlight away from younger players. But we know that wizards age slower (physically) so wouldn't Krum be super fit at 38? My question is why would a Quidditch player (a sport that isn't exact;y draining) have an age limit?

Edit: accidentally wrote 28 instead of 38 a couple times, changed to 38


** It is incredibly physical since you are pulling 5-10 G quite often, especially as seeker. Not sure why Krum would count as old though.

*** You would be correct. There is no way he would be 28 (birth in 1986), the OP probably meant 38.

** Even with living longer, you don't see Wizarding kids take a greater length of time to mature. Their bodies just might be better at repairing injury and replicating cells, and of course their medicine is much much better. So they might lose reflexes at the same rate we do.

** I mean there's checking and bludgers and falls and strength training and yeah quick drops as already mentioned. And wizards aren't like WAY better at aging, in almost any sport late 30s is considered borderline old. Think about the Olympics- the training required to stay at the top is grueling and anyone approaching 40 is significantly older than their late teens/early 20s counterparts.

*** Wizards comonly live to 150 and more when they're not killed by dark wizards. If the average lifespan of a muggle is 80, wizards have something between a +40% to 50% increased lifespan+. That's huge.

Edit: Am I completely stupid? That' almost double, so something between 90-100% increase, not 40-50.

**** And now you veered on the high side. 150 / 80 = 1.875 = 87.5% increase. 30 * 1.875 = 56.25. So if we were to compare the two, Krum should have another 18-ish years left of his career before he'd hit the peak.

***** You're right. I was going for a very vague estimation anyhow, considering we don't have any clue about the actual wizards lifespan, we only now that wizards often live 150 or more. Also, 30 is still somewhat young in some sports. I believe the average retirement age in football is around 35 and the best athletes in HEMA (historical martial arts, see it as fencing with actual sword rather than the supple and thin weapons) used in modern fencing, are around 40 (I'm giving this number from memory but I think it's around that). In some sports, experience is actually more important that reflexes, speed, agressivity and physical strength. It is difficult to say if quidditch would be one of those sports, but what we could already answer to Rita Skeeter is that Victor still playing in the team means he's still effective enough to be selected in the team, and thus still among the bests no matter his age.

****** Yeah, in HEMA I think it's mostly how many hours (well) spent in practice/duels/other kind of fights that matters. Matt Easton, founder of Schola Gladitoria is 42 and still, seemingly, holding out well.

I think in Quidditch it's a bit of both, you need the know-how and reflexes. Though I think that it's the kindest on the Chasers.

******* You'd also need some crazy awareness and acquire a good reading of the game is certainly not that easy considering the playfield is 3D. Someone who's got a lot of experience and is able to more correctly assess situations and read the game would certainly be a great asset in this sport.

So it's difficult to assess which of those things would be more important. An sadly, for obvious reasons, we can't just go watch a few games to get a clearer idea ;).

** Maybe they also mean it in the sense that he's keeping the spotlight away from the new crop of players. Even if he isn't too old to play Quidditch, he's been a famous Quidditch star for more than 20 years--he's old in terms of being a Quidditch celebrity.

** 38 could still be pretty old by quidditch standards and outside a wizard's physical prime.

** I would assume that if this were true, the mean and median age of a Quidditch player would be younger than 38. Thus, at 38, Krum would be considered old for a Quidditch player.

**** That isn't contrary to what I said. If wizards age slowly than the difference between someone in their 20s and 30s doesn't matter. I don't think this is true though. They age just as muggles do, which means like muggles a persons teens and 20s will be peek physical fitness.

What you're talking about is a wizards constitution, which is much better than a muggle. But irrelevant in this case.
