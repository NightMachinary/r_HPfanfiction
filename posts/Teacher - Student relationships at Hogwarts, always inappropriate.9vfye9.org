Well, yeah I guess they always are. But are some less inappropriate than others? What pairing do you kinda sorta ship despite yourself?


** Reading about student/teacher relationships didn't bother me so much when I was a lot younger, but like... I'm 28 now, and the thought of being attracted to someone who is 18 (or younger even!) is absurd to me. Well, I guess maybe not just thinking someone that young is attractive, but... I remember being that age, and teenagers are dumb, man. Even really mature teenagers.

I've read some HP/SS and HG/SS fics that I enjoyed despite having that dynamic, but I am pretty uncomfortable with it generally.

** No. They are always inappropriate. A student cannot consent to a relationship with their teacher whether of age or not. The power imbalance makes it completely unconscionable.

That's why it's usually illegal independently of statutory rape, and why it's unethical to sleep with your boss.

This also says nothing of the squick factor. Snape is likely the youngest teacher (half of them are cardboard cutouts with teacher spraypainted on them, ie Vector, Babbling, Sinistra, and to a very slightly lesser extent Sprout, Burbage, and Hooch) and he is still nearly twice the age of his oldest students in Harry's first year. They have nearly no points of common interest, and it's just effing creepy.

Yes, this! Even in university, where all the students are over the age of consent, students-teacher relationships are innapropiate.

While I agree that students-teacher relationships are a big no, to be fair OP never said it had to be during Harry's Hogwarts years. I mean Snape was just a few years older than the oldest students when he started working at Hogwarts.

** Well, you could create situations under which it was ok-ish.

For example, if a recent Hogwarts graduate was in a pre-existing relationship eith a Hogwarts student one or two years their junior and then accepted as teacher into Hogwarts I would jjot have too many problrms with thrm continuing their relationship if the oldrr partner were not directly teaching the younger one.

This is a very specific scenario, though, and on the whole Student-teacher relationships still stay inapropriate.

** Teacher/student relationships are, generally speaking, very off-putting for me (as are almost all dubcon situations). I think the only fic where it didn't totally squick me out was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/443099][A Slant-Told Tale]] linkao3(443099) and that was because it was both brief and under very unique circumstances.

I'll leave those circumstances under spoilers, for anyone who's curious but doesn't want to read the fic: McGonagall, shortly before graduating Hogwarts, is entered into an arranged marriage with someone who has a family history of instability and violence. Knowing that she'll be expected to bear children, but not wanting to pass on those genes, she convinces Dumbledore to sleep with her. She tells him she wants to be experienced before her wedding night, but really she's doing it so he'll impregnate her.

** Inappropriate?

Pretty much always.

Hot?

That's a difficult question. It is a common fantasy and as long as both sides are of legal age (16 in the UK), are attracted to each other and there is no abuse of power or coercion I don't see the harm. Yes, technically it is statutory rape, but most of the male "victims" were only hurt by being high-fived too hard (if he is not into the teacher, that changes the situation from statutory rape to actual rape). It is preferable when the teacher has no professional relationship to the student, but given the Hogwarts staff that is a given (the main teachers are anything but attractive).

I know that it is a different dynamic when the student is female, but I have absolutely no interest in reading "older man seduces girl" either way.

***** Yes, because bringing up a single anecdotal case in which the victim (and yes, he's still a victim) doesn't appear to have "minded" being taken advantage of discounts all of the research which shows that men and women are similarly affected by cases of sexual assault.

Psychology Today goes so far as to say, [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psychoanalysis-30/201101/talking-about-sexually-abused-boys-and-the-men-they-become]["By age 16, as many as one in six boys in America has had unwanted sex with an adult or older child. Millions of men, abused as children, continue to live with the debilitating effects of shattered trust."]]

They continue with, "Sexually abused boys are also troubled if they were aroused while being abused. Teenagers are easily aroused, having little control over the hormones surging through their bodies."

If you had a 15 year-old daughter and she was seduced by her 39 year-old male teacher, would you be any less upset because she said, "Don't worry, daddy, the sex was great?"

No, you wouldn't. This idea that men can't be sexually assaulted as young adults by a trusted, adult figure because they'll just "high-five" each other is ridiculous. We're socialized that we should enjoy it, so it's easy to kid ourselves into it. As a male who's been sexually assaulted by someone I should have been able to trust and, like many others who've shared their stories, immediately "high-fived" my friends, I'm now, years later, dealing with that trauma with a /therapist/, for God's sake.

Just because we might fantasize about it doesn't make the reality acceptable. Rape fantasies exist. Snuff fantasies exist. Ageplay exists. These are things which should never enter the realm of reality, though unfortunately they do.

If you ever have to think about whether or not turning down a sexual advance will harm you in some way, the relationship cannot be properly consensual. If you say "no" to a teacher, you have to worry about whether or not they'll grade you properly. Put you in detentions more frequently as punishment. Potentially get you expelled. Unless you happen to record the inappropriate conduct, you're left in a he-said-she-said situation. Who is more likely to be believed? The likable teacher, or the hormonal teenager?

That's not consensual. Not /really/.

#+end_quote

I'll admit that applying the same law to every situation equally isn't always fair. For a situation like this, perhaps it's a gray area which allows for some examination before ruining someone's life.

However... that's NOT what you were talking about. Your specific example was between a 15 year-old and a 39 year-old. Hardly just the consequence of some unfortunate age roll-over.

******** It was within the legal age in France, which is 15. And they are still married decades later, so obviously not just some fluke. And again, I am talking about mutual attraction, not just a teacher lifting up her skirt and telling you to get to it. Pretty much all examples I linked came with some flirtatious preamble which leaves plenty of room to back out.

Obviously abuse of power is something which makes the whole scenario a lot more dubious, unless you are into noncon.

And luckily, there are ways to prove the truth with magic, from Veritasserum up to swearing unbreakable vows.

** Ignoring magic: I would say it is a rule with few exceptions. If you are doing a 19 year old teacher with a 17 year old student, maaaybe. But then, I don't see any problems with Romeo&Juliette exceptions to Statutory Rape, and if you are imaging that situation you'd think they would know each other before one got promoted to teacher, given how Hogwarts is structured.

With Magic: Still mostly inappropriate, but there are some scenarios (that have NO analogous situations IRL) that are explorable. If you are in a world with De-aging potions, or potions that can /literally control emotions/, or magical creatures that age from 8 to 25 in a day, or magical creatures that only live to be 15 years old, it isn't overly unbelievable that the rules governing the situation are different. And it is also MUCH more believable that society would view situations differently with such possibilities.

There's so much juicy potential in those pairings as far as the stories go I think the drama of what can happen outweighs the initial taboos. But all's good, we don't judge here! Cheers.
