I read part of a fic where Hermione is undercover in the death eaters and she ended up branded. That's all I remember, sadly. Maybe around 2006? Don't quote the date though.

Probably not the one you are looking for, but it has Hermione undercover among the Death Eaters. She is also friends with Draco.
