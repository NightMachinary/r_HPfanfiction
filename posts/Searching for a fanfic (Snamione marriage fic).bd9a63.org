So I read this story a while ago. I can remember all the details but not the title.

So Hermione Gets a letter from the ministry of magic saying That she has to get married because of a marriage law and she gets a letter with I think only one name but Severus Snape's name is the only 1 on the letter. Snape gets the same letter with her name on it. He refuses to get married to her so they go to the ministry and Hermione sets a date for their Marriage.

They are told that if they don't get married they have to live like muggles. Mcgonagle gets involved and she makes snape in charge of the potions for the hospital wing at the school. She Makes Hermione his assistant And it distracts him so that he stays until they get married.

I remember that she wore a green wedding dress and that he saw her as one of his students so he felt gross marrying her. Harry and Ginny are married and they have their kids out of order, with a daughter first. (Lily) Harry gets a box of pictures from Severus when they go to dinner at their house.

The fic is rated M and there is lots of smut.
