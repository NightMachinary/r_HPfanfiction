I like these stories, because they skip a lot of what I consider are story killer arcs for a lot of authours, centres around a relatively pivotal, and interesting year. In addition it allows for some good bit of creative freedom. This isn't an 11 year old Harry, where having him know unique forms of magic, or knowledge is unbelievable. This is a 14 year old. This is someone where them knowing something powerful, and/or unique isn't outside the realms of possibility. Harry is also at an age where him speaking, and thinking closer to an adult is more believable instead of an 11 year old knowing how to "game" the system, and/or romanticising 4th+ years, or god forbid, girls in his age group. I mean to each their own, but that's just creepy.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

***** Correct. Rule 8 states that we can't link to fics that sexualize minors, meaning anyone 17 and younger (as we are going by USA's definition of minor because reddit is USA based). Because it never really states /what/ age Harry/Hermione are once they start getting involved with each other, we have to play it on the safe side and not link the fic.

Again, discussion is fine, direct linking is not.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF
