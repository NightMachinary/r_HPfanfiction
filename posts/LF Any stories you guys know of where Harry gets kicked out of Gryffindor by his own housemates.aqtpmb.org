/Seriously? You beat a hundred dementors at once with one spell? Most of us can't even handle one dementor./\\
/At some point, we need to address the proverbial elephant in the room; you're too Gryffindor for Gryffindor. You're making the rest of us look too good./\\
/Every time something blows up, the school looks at us instead of the experimenting Ravenclaws. The younger students are being warned to avoid us crazy types. The teachers are setting us harder homework than the other houses, and I know for a fact that Hagrid has got his groove back and is planning a chimera just for us next year./

/The bottom line; the rest of the school is using you as the baseline for Gryffindor behaviour, and setting their standards for us accordingly. If we keep trying to match up to you, the rest of us will be burned out in a week!./\\
/With that in mind, we regretfully have to inform you that we are kicking you out. Yes, we are giving you the boot. To save our own skins and stop your reputation for uber-heroics rubbing off on us, you are being formally evicted from Gryffindor House./\\
/Please don't hold it against us, we simply can't handle your epicness anymore. If you speak to McGonagall she can arrange private quarters for you, and in the meantime you can stay in your old dorm, just...please don't wear our colours anymore./

(Gryffindor later come to regret their decision, lol)

Edit: it was almost definitely /The Lie I've Lived/ or /You're My Density/ that I was thinking of - both are linked downthread.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

** Funny, I am linking to this one fix twice in two different threads: linkao3(Becoming Harriet). Pretty nice story, which is hurt by too much pornography (it would be pretty good story even without it, and no I am not against sex per se, but here it tears continuity of the story).

This is (really rather good) story of Harry changing into a girl (or reverting back to a girl in fact) and Gryffindor girls are really not OK with the change. Ginny (obviously) is hurt because she feels being cheated, and Lavender & co. are jealous. Situation and hostility is so bad, that Harriet gets her own separate room, which obviously enables a lot of sex action.
