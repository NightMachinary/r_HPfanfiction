“Mmmmphrg!” Hermione mmmmphrged through the gag over her mouth.

“Now you are just being silly, Hermione. Of course I am not evil.”

“Uuuuurgh!” Hermione uuuurghed towards the boiling pit of lava over which she was suspended.

“It is for the Greater Good, Hermione. You of all people should know that.”

“Blurb?” Hermione blurbed, with hope in her eyes.

“If you won't speak English, then I won't either,” Luna said shaking her head. “Frublemurgle,” she frublemurgled.

Hermione accepted her fate, she had survived the very worst of Death Eaters, but she could not battle with insanity.

Just then Harry's Patronus materialised in front of Luna. “Where's Hermione? I said I wanted to celebrate her birthday. Tell me she is at a safe place and you haven't done anything, or I swear to Merlin...” the patronus dissolved.

Luna took one look at Hermione, one at the big red button which ominously said /Unleash/, and sighed. One day, Harry would appreciate all she did for him.

But in the meantime...

Luna levitated the bound figure of Hermione to the floor beside her, and changed the bindings to butterflies which flew away.

Hermione started coughing out all the toxic fumes she had breathed.

“Why?” she managed to croak out.

“Harry likes you.”

Hermione didn't think the situation could go even more, well, looney than what she had just witnessed, but it did.

“That... makes... no... bloody... sense...” she said through choughs rocking her body.

“Of course it does. You really need to learn to open your mind to other people's ideas, Hermione. No wonder you are head over heels in love with the redhead.” Luna adjusted her delicate outfit.

“What? Ron?” Hermione was having trouble thinking.

Luna concentrated hard, and the large evil lair around them changed to the Ravenclaw common room.

“Let this be a lesson.”

“Les---son?” Hermione passed out.

Luna left her slumbering at the floor of the Room of Requirement, and instead headed back to her dormitory. Her job was done for the night.

** I'm intrigued and want to see more. I'm particularly interested to see if Luna has an army of Heliopaths or other such creatures.
