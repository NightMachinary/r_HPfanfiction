The title is slightly misleading, but I couldn't figure out how to word my question in the limited about of characters. There are a lot of fics out there that explore Harry's parseltongue ability, oftentimes dedicating thousands and thousands of words to that aspect of it. In a fic I want to write, I'm thinking of giving Harry a snake companion, but would this cliche make you put down a fic out of sheer exasperation? Are you alright with it as long as it doesn't delve into parselmagic/parselscript/since-Harry-is-a-"speaker"-he-is-now-the-king-of-snakes stuff?

Do you enjoy reading about a Harry that explores this ability, or do you just tolerate it? Can it be done well? If you dislike this trope, how can it be written to make you like/stand it?

Just on a personal note, the snake/parseltongue doesn't play a significant part in the fic. I mainly just wanted Harry to have 'someone' he can converse with/speak at candidly (I imagine snakes don't really give a shit about human affairs) in a time where he hasn't made friends yet/doesn't know who he can trust.

Sorry if this post seems a bit disjointed, I'm tired.


** I'm totally okay with snake familiars, provided they speak like the basilisk: "Food... sun... food... mouse! ... sun... sun... sun".

Snakes that have a load of knowledge about the wizarding world or who can carry on a conversation that requires a human intellect to understand: meh.

*** I agree. A peeve of mine that I see often is when a random snake knows all about the wizarding world/ wizarding history/Salazar Slytherin's "real thoughts" on blood purism because apparently knowledge is genetically passed on through the generations akin to instincts.

In the first book, the boa Harry frees tells him, "Brazil, here I come! Thanks amigo." Which is indicative of higher level thinking. Although that also could be passed off as JKR taking liberties while writing a kid's book. In my mind, snakes don't actually think like people do, but that same magic that allows parselmouths to understand snakes also allows the snake to understand and respond to parselmouths in a way they couldn't otherwise. E.g. Harry asks snake what it wants to eat, snake thinks back go its last meal, a bird, and it says bird, despite having had no previous idea as to what it was called. Magic is interpreting what it wants to say in a way Harry can understand. You can also attribute the basilisk's mantras to the fact that it was speaking to itself, rather that to a parselmouth. *this theory's probably full of holes, I havent thought it out too much

** I'm alright with parseltongue if it isn't done stupid.

I roll my eyes at parselscript, but okay, maybe it's an artificially created magical language since it's doubtful snakes developed intelligence on their own, and the creator wanted a way to write down their new language.

I /really/ roll my eyes at parsel magic. But okay, maybe it's just like casting spells in another language, and doesn't give any advantage over other ways to cast spells besides syllable length and people not being able to tell what you're casting because they can't tell what incantation you're saying. Nonverbal casting has those advantages too, so nothing /to/ OP going on.

I /draw the line/ at the /stupid/ idea that "spells cast in parseltongue can only be undone by another spell cast in parseltongue." Really. /Really?/ So, what, can spells in French only be undone with another French spell? Was the way Harry was supposed to defeat Voldemort in canon by learning some spells in another language, so Voldemort couldn't block/undo/affect them? Why would casting spells in another language cause /any/ restrictions on what magic can and can't interact with each other?!

Basically, just don't make parseltongue a cheap way to make Harry overpowered, and you're already doing better than most people.

"/3><p311!4rmu5/!" Harry cried out, jabbing his wand suddenly in the Dark Lord's direction. A jet of #FF0000 light sprang from his wand and sailed across the gap between the two enemies.

Voldemort flicked his own wand in response, as though swatting a fly, but to his shock the spell was unaffected, hitting him straight in the chest and causing his yew wand to go sailing away.

"How---"

Compared to the offensive spells that the younger students at Hogwarts would actually know (Diffindo, Expelliarmus) conjuring a snake with the Serpensortia spell and ordering it to constrict/bite your opponent could actually win you a duel.

Spying by attaching an extendable ear or tracking charm to a snake. Have snakes attack from behind during a fight. Harry working as a breeder, tamer, etc.

** Snakes and parseltongue are no more cliché than any other aspect of the HP world, and as long as they have a purpose in the fic and are handled with some ingenuity, I say bring 'em on. And frankly, I wouldn't worry too much about adhering strictly to known snake behavior. After all, there's that pesky boa constrictor in chapter two of SS. It's played for laughs, of course, but that doesn't make it any less canon.

I've read various Snape/Harry fics (yes, I'm one of those) that use the concept of Parseltongue cleverly, so I've seen it done well, and in any case I would never scoff at a fic simply because it re-visits a familiar idea. We're fanfic writers (and readers). That's what we /do/.

So write what you want to write. Feedback from a beta reader is probably more useful than canvassing the opinions of people who haven't a clue as to how you write or what shape your story's taking. If /you/ like the snake companion and you're enjoying writing about it, that's all the reason you need.

(For anyone interested in Snarry fics with Parseltongue, here are a couple of recs:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/77600][If This Be Error]] by Nimori, a humor fic with a botched bonding spell and a senile snake that's one of the highlights of the story.

Also [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/102594][No Place at All]] by Acid and Sinick, concerning Harry's discovery of a post-series Snape who survived the war and now works in a traveling carnival as a snake-handler. The after-effects of Nagini's venom, which destroyed his vocal cords, allow him to understand the creatures he uses in his circus act.)

** I like parseltongue and usually find myself disappointed when Harry does nothing with it (like in cannon, or in fics where it is brought up and then quickly forgotten). If I could talk to snakes, I would be talking to them all the time, it seems weird to me that harry wants nothing to do with. The most common argument I hear is that since he got it from Voldemort, he hates it; but even before he knew that, he still did nothing with it. (In between Zoo visit and book 2). If you can write a good Harry actually uses parseltongue story, I'll definitely read it.

That being said I am sure there could be some really clever uses of it. If you do this however keep in mind it could really alter canon ex. snake familiar sent to spy on the door or snape and finds out he isn't the big bad guy, year 2 the snake straight up tells harry he isn't crazy and is hearing a big ass snake, year 3 catching pettigrew either with the map where the snake detects him and/or later after the shack there would have to be good reason why the snake wasn't there or couldn't catch pettigrew and so on- if a familiar who is coiled around Harry or able to obey basic tasks then it can really change things.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  #+begin_example
      When starting this, please keep in mind that A Year Like None Other was started long before HBP came out\. It was always my intention to write an alternate 6th year and when the canon Year 6 was published, it meant that my own little saga seriously diverged from canon\. So reading this, imagine that Years 1\-5 did occur, but nothing we discover from HBP and DH is necessarily true this time around\.The most important divergences are these: In this universe, Snape \*is\* a pureblood and his father's name was Hostilian \(which tells you a lot all by itself\)\. Dumbledore never died \-\- and certainly not at Snape's hand\!   This story is completely finished and is about 760,000 words long\. It took me a while to get it all posted here at AO3, but I am very happy to report that the whole thing is now online for your \(hopefully\) intense enjoyment\!And now, on with the show, which begins with A Year Like None Other \(completed\), continues on into A Summer Like None Other \(also completed\) and wraps up with A Family Like None Other, a Year 7 novel that I am still writing\.

** Some authors really nail parsletongue for me, or at least how I see it myself.

Snakes shouldn't talk like people, they are animals, their primary motivators are food, survival, mating and nesting. So a conversation with a snake would be pretty boring:

"/Mussssst find food, speaker hasssss food?/"

Also, snakes don't smell, they taste the air with their tongues, so many authors don't know this...

There shouldn't be certain words in parseltongue, words like "biscuit" or "computer" should be obvious, but more common words like "friend" or "lover" should not exist since snakes would have no concept of such things, being animals after all.

Some snake species are more intelligent than others, such is true for all animal sub-species, so conversations would be different for the more intelligent snakes, and I bet the Basilisk, being hundreds of years old should be pretty intelligent and as close to a human as possible, depends whether or not it's mad like some authors prefer.

** Go ahead - I love parsel-stories (though I don't think there's parsel-magic...sure you can cast using parseltongue and it will probably creep out everybody except Voldemort and stop others from understanding what you are casting, but that's it)...using snakes for certain things, like say bringing a portrait full of snakes to school and then commanding the snakes to jump frames (as spies around the castle) would be neat (it's an idea I haven't seen, so I tend to think it's mine (at least it's on a list of ideas I might one day use in a story)), is neat, too (just don't exaggerate the power of snake-speech, it's useful - sure, but it's not the most useful/powerful ability out there (not even close - being a metamorphmagus is more useful IMHO - as is being an animagus!))
