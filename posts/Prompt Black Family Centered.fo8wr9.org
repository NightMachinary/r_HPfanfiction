Found this in some old word documents. It's hella tropey and a pretty bad plot, but if someone wants to take a crack at it:

*Outline: Black Family- The DCW*

*CHAPTER 1*

The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black is a part of the Druid Chosen, a trio of families chosen by the Druids, who taught humans magic, to lead the magical world, and who lead the revolt against the Druids. The other houses that make up the Druid Chosen are the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass and Nott. In the '60s, when this story is set, the Druid Chosen control most of the political and social world but are not direct rulers. They, like the rest of the Noble Houses, are respected and looked up to in the Wizarding World, while having more power than most. They control most of the Daily Prophet, the Ministry and Hogwarts, as well as being the richest people in Magical Britain. Traditionally, each of the Druid Chosen families name their eldest male child as their heir, who represents them in the Wizengamot. Since the Druid Chosen have very powerful magical lines, this child is usually inherently magically powerful and is trained well.

The story begins in 1960, a year after Heir Apparent to the House of Black, Heir Sirius Orion Black III, was born (Nov. 3rd '59). For the purpose of this story, Pureblood tradition dictates that when a couple do not have a Spare, in case the Heir dies, they must place the Heir under a Stasis Charm until one is born. For Sirius, however, this was not the case, since, in 1958, a daughter, Bellatrix Cygnus was born. Bellatrix was named Heir Presumptive to the House of Black, and Heir Apparent to Lord Cygnus Charis Black III. She was kept under Stasis till 1959, until her sister Andromeda Cassiopeia was born (Dec. 15th '59). Her youngest sister, Narcissa Lyra, followed in 1960 (Sep 1st '60). In this story, Regulus wasn't born until much later (July 4th '71).

Because of my little Stasis intervention, Bellatrix and Andromeda were the same age as Sirius and only a year older than Narcissa. At the time during which this story is set Lord Arcturus Sirius Black is Head of the House of Black and is very focused on the political education of his grandchildren, and so “persuades” their parents to move away from Grimmauld Place. They all grew up in the huge Black Manor in Berkshire, which neighbours the Greengrass and Nott estates and end up being as close as siblings. The Greengrass's and Nott's both have two children each: Sebastian and Astoria Greengrass, and Thoros and Aria Nott. Sebastian was born in 1954, and Stasised until 1957 until Astoria was born, with the Nott's being natural-born twins, born in '58. Deviating from canon once again, in this story, the Wizarding World is currently undergoing a Feminist Revolution, and so, while they still maintain their power, the Druid Chosen are coming under quite a bit of backlash for having a patriarchal line. In order to solve this problem, they decide to institute a “Group Succession Policy”, enforcing a sort of future oligarchy, with all the current Heirs to divvy up duties when the time comes.

The story then skips to December of 1970, to the week before a ball in which the children will be officially presented to Pureblood Society. At this point in time, they have already begun studying under the tutelage of different family members. The Blacks are currently hosting a French cousin from the Noble House of Delacour, in order to further a testy alliance with the family. At the same time, Walburga discovers she is two months pregnant and has no idea how to tell Orion, her distant, somewhat emotionally abusive husband. She discovers from her brother that Orion believes that she does not perform her role as a wife properly and is not submissive enough towards him. She also finds out that he is still scared of her, after he found her in their bedroom, when they still lived at Grimmauld, trying to Crucio baby Sirius. Walburga is offended by the fact that he thinks she is unfit to properly discipline her child and finds that the meaning behind Arcturus's move to get them to leave Grimmauld was that he thought he could raise and teach the children better than them. In a move to teach both Orion and Arcturus a lesson, she shares this with Orion and encourages him to confront Arcturus, which she knows won't end well for either of them. She goes to visit her old, dying mother, who tells her that this might just be her insecurities of lack of maternity getting to her. Walburga lashes out and kills her mother in a fit of rage, before realizing that she is right. She goes back to the Manor and stops Orion from confronting Arcturus and confesses to him, before realizing that she doesn't trust him and that he would stab her in the back at the first opportunity. She erases his memory and confesses to her brother, Cygnus, who arranges to have someone framed. While nosing around in her things, Cygnus discovers that Walburga is pregnant and tells Orion. Meanwhile, Bellatrix and Andromeda try to befriend their new houseguest, to no avail, and then enlist Sirius, ever the charmer, who is for the moment a bit preoccupied by his crush on Narcissa, feeling disgusted by himself. Narcissa herself is learning to come to terms with her sexuality and learns of Sirius' crush. She takes him to the Rose Garden, and he becomes the first person she's come out to as a Lesbian.
