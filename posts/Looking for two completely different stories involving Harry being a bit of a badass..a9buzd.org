The first fic is a dimension/time travel one that has Harry being sent to an alternate time where he saves Lily during a battle and nearly cuts Bella in half. He's stunned rightly after and while the Order is trying to figure out what to do with him Snape observes that Bella had to be placed in a stasis charm so the healer could fix her. I know this seems to be pretty specific but it's the one chapter I can remember from it.

The next story is a Sirius is free fix it fic where Harry uses some political clot to outwit some Purebloods on the wizengamot. I think this is a bit of a harem fic involving Susan and maybe Daphne. Amelia and Sirius do become a couple here as well. The one scene I can clearly remember is Midway thru the story and it involves an imperius placed on Lucius that has him cursing Harry after he wins a major session within a court room and is struck after pushing Ameila out of the way while She and Sirius put down Malfoy for good. The curse was a mixture of a cutting curse and poisoning on that Harry somehow counteracts or Sirius remembers the cure for.

I know it's asking a lot given it's just two scenes taken out of context but any leads would help. I thought I had these stored in my faves but I guess I just thought I did. Any help is much appreciated!

** I think I've read the 2nd fic but I can't remember the title or author. Was it the one where Harry has a fistfight with several Slytherins and beats them to a pulp? Also I think he was apprenticed to Madam Pomphrey. Story was several hundred thousand words I believe.

*** I believe you may be right. The chapter I described was somewhere in the middle of a very long fic. I do kinda remember that Pomphrey was a bit OOC considering she wasn't blind to Dumbledore's flaws.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** The first one almost sounds like chapter 17 of linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall), but that doesn't have anyone get cut in half, let alone Bellatrix. Maybe you're combining two different stories?

Sorry I can't be more help.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

*** The Merging is a big fave of mine so its off the list. Bella isn't so much cut in half as the curse Harry threw at her almost severed her spine and Snape has to help with healing her. I'd go as far and say the fic that I'm looking for has the mentioned scene popping up around chapter 2-3 and Harry has to get used to the fact he's stuck in the new timeline and slightly older then his parents.
