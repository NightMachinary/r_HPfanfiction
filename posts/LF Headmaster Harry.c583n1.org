So been awhile since a request like this was posted so any and all fics where harry becomes headmaster of Hogwarts. Or where he is like Dumbledore. So he's wise, powerful and old. Also non fem!harry or slash please. Any help would be great, thanks!


** Oh my God, it made me remember this one weird fanfic, in which when Harry was being sorted the hat decided that he's so smart and amazing he's freaking above houses and just made him a headmaster. It was all about 11 year old Harry making changes at Hogwarts. I think it wasn't even crack.

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.

** I very dimly remember reading a Harry/femOC fic where Harry is the headmaster and his and his ex's kid enrolls at Hogwarts, if anyone knows what I'm talking about and can provide a link, I remember it being petty good, just not my cup of tea.
