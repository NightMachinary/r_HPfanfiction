Most of the stories I've read have Voldemort screaming this, yelling that, and dropping cruciatuses like candy. Is there any story in which he never shouts, just speaks quietly, and everyone just falls silent and listens? Please, no Good!Voldemort.


** The Well Groomed Mind By Lady Khali comes to mind. and while Voldemort isn't necessarily good in that series, he's not exactly evil, either. in short, he's portrayed as a rebel leader using guerrilla warfare and whatever means necessary to achieve his goal of overthrowing a corrupt government.

also features EvilDumbledore. and Harry and Voldemort being related. damn good read, overall.

*** Questions:

Does it feature male Slash?

Does it feature bashing?

Does it use a lot of cliches?

Is the author crap at grammar and/or consistency?

Does it have illogical amounts of angst?

​

I need answers to these questions if i commit to reading something that big.

**** No male slash. Can't really think of any bashing? Not cliched. No, not crap at grammar. I might not have a great eye for consistency but I didn't notice anything. I think logical amounts of angst.

**** It is honestly the only abandoned fic which I recommend mostly due to the incredible world building and very consistent, insightful, and realistic character relationships/interactions/developments

**** No slash, no bashing, no bad cliches, and it's a great story.

It's one of the best of the best stories out there. Voldemort is a massive protagonist too.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

** Well, Professor Quirrell from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) matches that description (though given the usual complaints about that story, I wonder how many readers actually like him better than Harry?).
