Hello. A fanfic was recommended to me to read. It's called /"/*/We'll Always Have Paris by/* */Melissa D/*/"/.

It was described to me as one of the oldest and amazing fanfic that supposedly started Draco/Hermione paring.

I tried to look for it. But can't find it. On [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8174867/1/We-ll-Always-Have-Paris]]) there are only three chapters and I been told there are 17 chapters in total and that the fanfic is completed. I tried other places but I have to pay for it to get it via Amazon ([[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40019402-we-ll-always-have-paris]]). Or this place [[http://www.oocities.org/hermione_draco/paris.html]] which with some proxy links can be read but only up to the 10th chapter. The other 7 chapters are not there.

Does anybody know where I can find the complete fanfic? Or maybe someone saved it and would be willing to send it to me? Or something else?

Tnx in advance! xd
