** Okay, basic grammar note. This is stuff that will make or break your fic, and actually caused me to stop reading as I started Overcoming Darkness. When you quote, It's "Your mail, sir," ... or "Your mail, sir." It's never, and I repeat never, "Your mail, sir". or "Your mail sir"... That's poor grammar and immediately makes people drop your fic. Fix it.
