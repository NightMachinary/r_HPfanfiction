** Originally, there were going to be 3 parts to Backwards With A Purpose. But the author ended up moving the few written chapters from Part III to the end of Part II (beginning with Chapter 50: Part III The Refuge of Hope). The ending of Chapter 52 was changed a bit to facilitate the author completing the story, but it contains almost all of what used to be Part 3.
