Bonus nonexistent points to stories where Ron is smarter than average.


** Ron!Bashing is tiresome, ain't it?\\
Anyway, one of my favorites is linkffn(Midnight By The Weasley Watch), where Ron and Snape represent Hogwarts in an International Chess Tournament.\\
Last week, I more or less tripped over a new one trawling through the HP/Avenger crossover section: linkffn(Son of the Archer) is a "raised by an Avenger" story, but this time, an infant Ron is in the hot seat after Hawkeye rescues him from his kidnappers after overhearing their plans to kill him. The sequel, linkffn(Son of the Archer and the Boy Who Lived) was updated a couple of weeks ago.

  COMPLETE. Ron Weasley makes up his schoolwork, and actually thinks for a change. Snape gets some Christmas presents he doesn't expect. The old game is over, but a new one is just beginning. Please read and review. And thanks to you all!

*** I like Midnight by the Weasley Watch. Those type of calming stories are a good change once in awhile.

I'm also looking into Son of the Archer. The concept sounds interesting, but it isn't a very good first chapter because of the typos right on the first line, as well as the way the author obviously forced Hawkeye's actions for story purpose, which in turn didn't make any sense at all. I hope it gets better in the later chapters.

**** Honestly, it's not the most well written thing I've come across, and there are a couple bits when Ron's around five or six that make you go 'eh' (and not to be spoilerish, but the...'reunion' with the Weasley's isn't done that well either), but it's by far not the worse thing I've read and it's original enough for me to stick with it.

** Ron is almost a main character and very effective in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/][Backward with Purpose I: Always and Always]], linkffn(4101650).

He is very heroic in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6884267/1/Stop-All-The-Clocks][Stop All the Clocks]] and its sequel [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6884267;6989327).

The time travel [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/][Gryffindors Never Die]], linkffn(6452481), shows him and Harry as great drinking buddies too.

Harrymort initially didn't think much of Ron, and often used him as bait in dangerous situations in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106). But he prevailed and eventually earned Harrymort's respect. Ron accomplished quite a lot later in the story.

In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), Ron didn't have to fight a lot, but he was Harry's most resolute supporter and often gave good suggestions.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** a couple more I forgot. linkffn(The Red Knight) gets a lot of mentions here, and I'm brainfarting on another one I read recently. Harry runs away, spends some time on the street before getting "adopted" by a couple that own a gay bdsm club. He eventually returns to the Wizarding World as Malfoy's Ward, and Ron is quite competent here as well. Has a good grasp of contracts (and contract law, maybe) and very knowledgeable in Pureblood Customs/Traditions as well (unrelated to "purity". I could've sworn I've recc'd it before, but I'm not finding it in my post history anywhere. :(\\

  I died and woke up in the Harry Potter world. Magic is cool! Wait, why is no-one sticking to canon? Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux Recursive fanfiction. Self Insert. Please leave a review, as it helps the story get more exposure. Plus, I always love to hear what my readers have to say.

** linkffn(Australia by MsBinns) has been pretty good so far. Admittedly, I haven't finished it but Ron is pretty likable but still has his canon flaws. A big part of the beginning is Ron dealing with his brother's death (very badly) but the emotions are portrayed in a realistic way. It's a Ron/Hermione story if that matters and told from Ron's perspective.
