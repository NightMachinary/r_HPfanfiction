How to pack as much information as possible into a title.

Yes, it really does end that way; evil power-and-fame-hungry Dumbledore is run over because in all of his scheming, he neglected to educate himself about developments in the muggle world.

...Some more details I can remember; it starts with Harry discovering Ron (or Hermione, I forgot which) crucified in the Gryffindor Common Room with blood everywhere, and then he's dragged to Dumbledore's office where Dumbledore gloats and explains everything, right up to and including framing Harry for the murder. It's not an especially long fic, maybe a few thousand words at most.


** So, not the one where Dumbledore is actually Flamel, and Harry and Riddle both get their power from harems? IIRC Dumbledore gets hit by a bus in that at the end, and he frames Harry (and framed Riddle) for /something/. I don't think Ron/Hermione die in that though.

**** It's linkffn(The Truth by Clell65619). It's a falsified crucifixion, though I don't recall of who off the top of my head.

***** Oh, huh. I read the three chapters to the end and I stand corrected. I was sure it was a one-shot with Hermione or Ron being crucified instead of Romilda Vane, but otherwise it's the same as I remember.

...Perhaps! Maybe Clell copied the concept from another author and made a more elaborate version?
