By that I mean any background pairing that just gets mentioned offhand that stuck with you for one reason or another despite not really affecting the overarching story its from.

For example, from [[https://skoosiepants.livejournal.com/180711.html][Otherwise]] by skoosiepants:

  Ginny narrowed her eyes at him. “You've been talking to Ernie again, haven't you?”

  Ron looked shifty. “No.”

  Ernie fancied himself a romance guru. He sat about on satin pillows and blathered on about essential oils and generally freaked Ginny out. It was one of the many reasons she avoided visiting with Hannah. And Seamus. And Harry and Millie, because let's face it. There was some sort of orgy going on over there, and Ginny didn't really want to know.

** Cold blood linkffn(5786099) has Neville/Tonks. Tonks showed up at Hogwarts in disguise to protect Harry and started teasing Neville. Neville eventually summoned his Gryffindor courage and teased back... Doesn't really affect anything.
