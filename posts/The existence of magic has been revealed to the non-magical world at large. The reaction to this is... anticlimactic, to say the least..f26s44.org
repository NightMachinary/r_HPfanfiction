"Legilimency will also be made illegal under the new legislation; it's a direct violation of an individual's privacy, akin to illegal trespassing, except directly into somebody's mind.

"Use of Veritaserum as part of legal proceedings will likewise be illegal, as they violate a person's right against self-incrimination. Pensieve memories will no longer be admissible in court, as scientific studies have repeatedly shown that human memories are altered every single time a person recalls them, which is why a person's memories are often better than the real thing.

"Seriously, the entire magical legal system is full of this kind of bullshit.

"Oh, and with the existence of Polyjuice, fingerprinting will no longer be admissible in court, as anybody can just drink some Polyjuice, impersonate somebody else and steal their fingerprints. DNA, however, is another beast entirely, so we'll be relying more on that instead."

"As for Hogwarts, it will now fall under the Department of Education, which means all of Hogwarts professors must have valid teaching credentials; no longer will Hogwarts be the personal fiefdom of its headmaster and the laughingstock of all Europe.

"Oh, and if you think you can use your society's self-governance as a defense, you're badly mistaken; with the number of times your wars have spilled out and affected us, you've been in violation of the treaty for decades, if not centuries, and now that your society is out in the open, your self-governance is being unilaterally been revoked by every single world government."

The British Ministry ignored a war on their doorstep, but how many wars has the US needlessly started? Vietnam? Iraq? Afghanistan? Do you have any idea how many people the official US goverment killed? How many kids they murdered? How many kids they raped?

I don't think veritaserum crosses the line of human rights. "My rights end where yours start".

Assuming that the magical community got every man, woman, and child to fight for magical self-governance (including the muggleborns), that would still be one wizard for every >18,000 muggles, and the magical community does not understand technology muggles have had for over a hundred years like telephones, much less satellite imaging and video recording. A wizard who tried to imperius a world leader would be caught pretty fast based on their ignorance of the precautions they had to take alone.

I'm sure one wizard could take down more muggles than one muggle could take down wizards, but even if you're generous, the most people any wizard killed in one curse was about 13. Muggles would overwhelm wizards with numbers alone.

****** Population numbers always matter, whether people are fighting hand-to-hand or not. Population and resources decide how long a country is able to dig in its heels and prolong a fight. All it takes is for a wizard to get cocky and gloat, and then a muggle has knocked them out with a baseball bat and the wizards have lost a big percentage of its fighting force.

And the spells you're describing are all very advanced, to the point where there are many adults who don't know how to use them. The imperius curse is not only illegal, but only a limited number of people are able to actually do it, and an even more limited number of people are willing to do it. Same with fiendfyre, and apparation similarly is difficult and carries the risk of splinching. A wizard on their way to commit war crimes in London splinches themselves, lies on the street with a missing leg yelling, and then in comes the baseball bat.

The minuscule wizard population means that the number of wizards who could actually pull off (and is even willing to pull off) the magic you describe is limited, and their margin for error is even more limited because one of them going down is the equivalent of taking down some double digit percentage of an army in one hit.

And this isn't getting into the response of outside forces if war cropped up between magical Britain and muggle Britain. NATO, the EU, and America would be offering military assistance to muggle Britain in a heartbeat. That's a massive military industrial complex pulling for Britain, with many very intelligent and well-resourced people suddenly dedicated to finding out everything they can about magic and any possible way to counter it. Would the other magical governments be willing to throw their weight behind magical Britain in the same way, or would they decide they'd have better luck allying with the muggle governments in their own area to tame magical Britain so that there's a better chance that wizards in other countries will get a better deal going forward?

--------------

You're looking at this the wrong way. Wizards would not fight a war like we do. They don't need to seriously rely on things like resources, or how they're going to get somewhere, or any of that.

Copying and pasting from another comment:

We can't wipe out terrorists living in a fucking desert in a third world country but you think we could wipe out magical beings that can teleport and hide behind magical protections that muggles literally cannot comprehend? /What./

Here's what would actually happen:

Muggles try to impose their own laws on wizards, wizards refuse and tell them to fuck off and go back to their hiding. That's it.

There's a few isolated hate crimes here and there, mostly muggles attacking each other on the false presumption they're wizards, thus killing their own.

If the muggle government tries to war, it doesn't go anywhere. Because wizards aren't some nation living on some specific land. They live among muggles. They could be anyone. And their larger communities are behind anti-muggle protections that make it literally impossible for the muggle brain to comprehend reality. It's comparable to Lovecraft's mindbending eldritch abominations.

But let's say muggles discover the existence of Hogwarts and its general area. Let's say they nuke the shit out of the general area. Let's ignore the fact that we don't use nukes against our enemies in real life and presume they've gone crazy with paranoia and nuke the general area of Hogwarts. Let's assume Hogwarts protections don't hold (I believe they would but let's ignore that.)

Well, now, you've just killed a bunch of school children and pissed off the whole wizarding world. Now they send a few talented wizards to infiltrate the muggle governments (like Kingsley Shacklebolt literally does in canon), Imperius the important people, immediately end the war, and maybe cause the Muggles to nuke themselves in revenge.

Something of this variation would happen. The idea that we'd be able to kill every last wizard is insanely unbelievable. How can you possibly look at the fact that the USA (our most powerful nation) can't deal with the likes of Vietnam or the Middle-east and think they could kill millions of magical beings spread throughout the world, hidden by magic we can't comprehend?

And even if they were largely successful somehow, all it takes is one talented wizard to completely destroy the world.

******** I'm on my way to work and do not have the time to refute you point by point, but suffice to say, you don't need to wipe out every single wizard to defeat wizards. You just need to convince them that it's better to submit to muggle rule than to keep fighting.

And there aren't millions of wizards in Britain. Going back to the ~40 kids per year birthrate, and assuming that wizards live an average of 100 years (to estimate, since Dumbledore lived to 120 but most of the characters we meet die quite young), there's ~4000 wizards in Britain. A large percentage of them have muggle family members, and thus would object to committing war crimes against muggles. Let's get rid of the roughly 5% who are muggleborn, then another 10% who have living muggle relatives, then get rid of the 640 magical people who are underage. 4000-1240=2760 wizards who are of age and have no reason to value muggle lives. Except! Many of them married muggleborns and halfbloods who have living muggle relatives. Let's get rid of another 10%. We're at ~2490 wizards who might fight muggles, and ~1500 who might defect if they kill too many muggles. How many of these wizards are conscientious objectors? How many just don't care that much about self-determination? How many just don't plain have the skill in combative magic to make a difference? And how many wizards would defect to muggles and how devastating would their influence be?

I'm almost to work so I need to wrap this up, but suffice to say, brute force tactics (especially when you're not in a position to understand your enemy, which is why I think the imperiusinf world leaders thing is silly; no wizard who grew in the magical community would know enough to convincingly imperius a world leader long enough to do anything) aren't enough to win a war.

We don't know what magic can do against technology, and I'd argue that not only would a lot of the drugs we use to medicate learning disabilities and Alzheimer's would counter magical mental manipulation, but also that magic would likely be detected with satellite imaging, either by noticing the absence of image or being able to see what a human can't. And this is to say nothing of what could be discovered covertly about the difference between magical DNA and muggle DNA, and whether or not it could be manipulated.

But all that's besides the point. There's also the fact that a large chunk of the magical population have motive to dismantle magical self-governance: muggleborns, squibs, werewolves, and other mistreated minorities. They're people who've been abused, marginalized, and discriminated against by the Ministry of Magic and by all counts will probably continue to be so in the future, so why not try their luck with the muggle government instead? Muggleborns (and squibs who couldn't get jobs in the magical world) would know about how much more robust human rights are in the muggle world, and spreading that information to marginalized magical people would make going turncoat very attractive. Then you'd take out the wizarding world's one advantage: magic, because enough people with magic would turn against them and help muggles dismantle the Ministry of Magic.

******* Actually, canon implies a whole lot when it comes to that. And extended canon (Pottermore) only backs it up. Magic /is/ superior. That's why in Ch 1 of HBP we see wizards casually waltz into the muggle Ministry, do whatever they want, and casually use mental manipulation on presidents. This is canon.

Satellites existed in the 90s, but places like Hogwarts still remained hidden from them. So no, magic wouldn't be detected by satellite imaging.

Probably nothing. You're looking at magic like it's scientific. It's /not/. I doubt muggles could study magic at all. It's on a whole other spectrum of reality.

You're looking at magic like some mechanical scientific thing, but it's not. But even if you do want to look at it like that, it's still INSANELY powerful. Do you have any idea how much energy it takes to create matter? A LOT.

A single cup of water being created would take the energy of 250 NUKES. Now look at how much water wizards can casually create. W

*Wizards easily use the energy of thousands of nukes.*

So there's really no reason at all to believe technology would overpower magic. Rowling says magic overrides the "mundane" (which is why magic can heal every single muggle disease), we /see/ magic override technology in canon, and everything else hints at magic being superior.

Then why haven't they done that so far? Squibs can't do shit. Werewolves are a minority. Muggleborns aren't actually really discriminated against.

******** Pottermore isn't canon and you know it. We work from the books or we accept that British wizards shit themselves in public willy nilly for hundreds of years, no in between.

Satellites existed in the 90s, but Muggles had no incentive to investigate a castle in the woods. They very well could have detected Hogwarts but never bothered to look into it. And magic can't just be handwaved as unexplainable, because clearly wizards have tried to explain it (magical theory) and it follows some kind of rules that can't be circumvented. There's something that can explain it. Maybe it's an internal power source, maybe it's in external force that wizards can tap into, but it can be explained like gravity. And if it can be explained, a sufficiently clever person can manipulate it, and said sufficiently clever person can find a way to allow other, less clever people to manipulate it. Think electricity. All it would really take is at least one disgruntled muggleborn to let the government poke and prod at them and their non-magical family members for a while.

As for muggleborns, how can you say that when in the course of a single coup, the government cheerfully started to ship muggleborns to Azkaban without any public outcry? That stuff doesn't just happen. That stuff happens when a lot of normal people 'other' muggleborns, and society leans against them. Marginalized minorities have historically suffered for long periods of time, and then take advantage of external strife to overthrow the societies that marginalize them. It's common enough that it's a common military and intelligence tactic to research marginalized minorities in a hostile country and then infiltrate them to convince them to help the external nation to defeat the nation that oppresses them. Without the weight of a nation behind them, it can be hard for a minority to get the resources for a coup.

It isn't just Hogwarts. It's Diagon Alley. Hogsmeade. All the other magical schools. All the other magical villages. If satellites caught hundreds or thousands of places no one ever heard of, they'd be investigated. This is plain common sense.

Nonsense. There is absolutely no canon evidence that a muggle could ever learn to harness magic.

You said it, dude. It was a coup. It isn't the norm. It lasted literally a year. Before that point muggle-borns were becoming Minister. Fudge got elected on a pro-muggle slogan.

And I notice you haven't responded to the rest of my comment concerning wizards destroying cities. I trust you concede the point there?

There is nothing stopping wizards from destroying cities or Imperiusing world leaders and ending whatever conflict immediately.

***** That's completely ridiculous.

Firstly, population numbers do not matter when it comes to this scenario. An average wizard can learn to Apparate into a city, unleash Fiendfyre, and Disapparate out. Your average muggle will not have an assault rifle, much less city-destroying capabilities.

Secondly, how in the world would muggles wipe wizards out? This argument has never not been absurd. We can't wipe out terrorists living in a fucking desert in a third world country but you think we could 100% wipe out magical beings that can teleport and hide behind magical protections that muggles literally cannot comprehend? What.

Here's what would actually happen:

Muggles try to impose their own laws on wizards, wizards refuse and tell them to fuck off and go back to their hiding. That's it.

There's a few isolated hate crimes here and there, mostly muggles attacking each other on the false presumption they're wizards, thus killing their own.

If the muggle government tries to war, it doesn't go anywhere. Because wizards aren't some nation living on some specific land. They live among muggles. They could be anyone. And their larger communities are behind anti-muggle protections that make it literally impossible for the muggle brain to comprehend reality. It's comparable to Lovecraft's mindbending eldritch abominations.

But let's say muggles discover the existence of Hogwarts and its general area. Let's say they nuke the shit out of the general area. Let's ignore the fact that we don't use nukes against our enemies in real life and presume they've gone crazy with paranoia and nuke the general area of Hogwarts. Let's assume Hogwarts protections don't hold (I believe they would but let's ignore that.)

Well, now, you've just killed a bunch of school children and pissed off the whole wizarding world. Now they send a few talented wizards to infiltrate the muggle governments (like Kingsley Shacklebolt literally does in canon), Imperius the important people, immediately end the war, and maybe cause the Muggles to nuke themselves in revenge.

Something of this variation would happen. The idea that we'd be able to kill every last wizard is insanely unbelievable. How can you possibly look at the fact that the USA (our most powerful nation) can't deal with the likes of Vietnam or the Middle-east and think they could kill millions of magical beings spread throughout the world, hidden by magic we can't comprehend?

And even if they were largely successful somehow, all it takes is one talented wizard to completely destroy the world.

** A while ago, I posted an outline about how it might happen:

It starts when an American chemistry professor working on battery technology reads a preprint on ArXiv about a clever method that some experimental physicists had discovered for using some self-replicating organic molecules to stabilise a particular quantum effect. He realises that it might be useful for solving a particular problem that he's been having with one of the battery designs he's been considering, and so he gives it to a grad student to work on.

It works quite well, producing an incremental but meaningful improvement (maybe a 10-20% increase in capacity for the weight/size/cost). The student graduates, and they spin off a startup to develop the technology for industrial use.

However, some manufacturing prototypes seem to exhibit an anomaly in that the battery discharges more energy than can be accounted for. More precisely, while the energy spent charging it still exceeds the energy released when discharging it (so it doesn't raise "perpetual motion" red flags), the loss is smaller than it should be according to the physics models. This is noted in the technical reports, but it doesn't appear to degrade the battery, so it's chalked up to measurement inaccuracy or an unaccounted energy leak from the environment. The design is patented and licensed to car, phone, and other manufacturers.

It also turns out to be the first instance of Muggles tapping into the same fundamental forces as those that facilitate magic. Because the separation between the wizards and the "no-maj" in North America is very strict, the first major interaction actually occurs in the UK.

A Muggle driving his brand-new Tesla through rural Scotland sees a castle in the distance where he doesn't remember seeing one before. (His car battery interfered with the Muggle-Repelling Charm cast over Hogwarts.) Curious, he decides to take a detour, finding a surprisingly well-kept dirt road, but as he drives onto Hogwarts grounds, his car dies. (Hogwarts protective magic interfered with his car battery.) He uses his phone to call a tow truck. The tow truck gets lost, because of Hogwarts's unplottability.

Tired of waiting, our hapless Muggle decides to go to the apparently well-maintained castle to see if he can get help there. He sees an number of students and creatures, and he witnesses a number of magical acts. He takes several pictures and videos, including a number of selfies.

Obliviators are called. As per standard operating procedure (updated for developments in Muggle technology), they incapacitate the Muggle, and cast Memory Charms on him and on any electronic devices he has on him. (The refined Memory Charm can affect inanimate objects with meaningful "memory" as well.) They then move him and his car to a nearby rest stop, where he wakes up and resumes his journey. (Farther away from Hogwarts, his car battery works again.)

Having arrived at his destination---having made an assumption that he had stopped to take a nap---he discovers that not only does he have a call record to a towing company from the time he was supposedly asleep, but that his phone has photos and videos that he does not recall taking, of what appears to be a visit to a theme park with some /very/ impressive special effects. (The battery in the phone interfered with the Memory Charm.)

The footage is sent around his social network---taken to be special effects---and a week later, he and his mates get into his Tesla to go looking for that theme park again...

Meanwhile, back in the States, the professor and his students had finally gotten around to trying to account for the energy discrepancy. Ultimately stumped by the apparent violation of conservation of energy, he publishes a preprint outlining it, asking others to try to reproduce and/or explain the phenomenon. Many scientists do, until the evidence is incontrovertible...

And so it goes.

** The reason that is so prevalent is that it's what would happen with 99% certainty. Various governments and companies across the world will try and succeed to get their hands on a wizard, and then torture/dissect them for information or to find out how magic works, all while not taking into account that magic can be used to make their normal methods of secrecy useless. And don't tell me it wouldn't happen, various superpowers today have done so in the not so distant past. (MKUltra, the CCP, the Nazis, etc).

Or there would be fear, as there is of everything. People and governments afraid of the power of magic, and try to control or chain them down, just like in this thread. Wizards take offense, the situation escalates.

Or there would be religious extremists - in many areas of the world, "witchcraft" still results in execution, and those communities would be attacked instantly. Saudi Arabia, for instance. Many parts of Africa. Some parts of America, which has a xenophobia problem anyways.
