No H/G or H/Hr Preferably independent and powerful Harry. Preferably no horcruxes (I don't really mind horcruxes, however it makes the hunt necessary and i don't like that.)

Thanks

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.
