I'm a huge fan of Severitus and Snape as a mentor/parent- but I'm curious about seeing Snape parenting someone other than Harry.

I read a fab one-shot where Snape & Harry co-parent his kids after Harry & Ginny get divorced. I'm also SUPER open to Snape/Hermione pairings- where they have kids.

I like Snape as a dad - does anyone have any great fics where he's parenting/co parenting kids that are not Harry?

Thanks!


** I have a series where Severus is a dad/older brother to OCs. It's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/952881][Family Branches]]. There are several stories in the early series that focus on him being parental with his sister and daughters.

While I know you said you're looking for stories where he's not parenting Harry, there is this one I read recently where he parents Harry in addition to a couple of OCs and Neville with James and Lily. I enjoyed it. It's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28322313/chapters/69394074][Fawns and Snakelets]].

*** Will second Family Branches. Severus is OOC'd into an actual good person but the series as a whole is very well done. The OC'S and the tragic MCD were well handled. Came for the Dimensional Travel AU, stayed for the OC's. Thank You Author!

** The Callista Snape series by Arinus on ff.net is SO GOOD. The first story is Snape learning he has a young daughter (from a brief affair with Bellatrix) and building a relationship with her as he becomes her caretaker and she has serious trust issues.

The second story takes Callista through her years at Hogwarts and it's super sweet to see how she grows as a character and how as they both get older, they reminisce on when she was small enough for him to pick her up to stir potions.

The third one is post-Hogwarts and incomplete, but the whole series is so well-written. I LOVE Severitis but seeing Snape with a daughter does things to my heart.
