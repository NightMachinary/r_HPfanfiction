This is what I remember:

•Harry and Dudley are both wizards.

•Originally they went to Slytherin but Snape “loans” them to Gryffindor (Harry) and Hufflepuff (Dudley)

•Petunia leaves Vernon after he attempts to exorcism them (the boys)

•Petunia receives sort of magical inheritance after gaining some magic (I think they called the process the surge)

•Part of the inheritance was talking mini dragons (I think they were called sports dragons)

•There is a diary (Not the horcrux) that's important to the plot line. (I think it's the diary of like Petunias great uncle or something?)

•Barty Crouch Senior translates it for Petunia

•Dumbledore and Petunia form a group to hunt down the horcruxs together

•Petunia rescues real Moody way earlier than cannon in 4th year

There's other things I remember about it but these are sort of the main points.

Thank you!!

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
