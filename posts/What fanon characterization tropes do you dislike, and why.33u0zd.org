** That Veela are mostly French. They're from Slavic/Polish folklore- even in the books they're known as mascots for the Bulgarian national Quidditch team.

On the other hand, I find it annoying that Fleur was introduced as the best and brightest of her school (selected by a magical artifact which probably didn't care how she looked) but by the time the story's done she's a barefoot homemaker who is afraid of broom flying. Really Jo? Descended from air spirits who change into fire-throwing bird-women, but she needs her 'Beell' to fly her on a Thestral?

*** I think of Fleur as just another casualty in JKR's war against blond people.

- Luna is unfortunately crazy because the author has confirmed that Snorkacks do not exist.\\
- As mentioned elsewhere in this thread Draco is just a one dimensional bully for five books before HBP attempts to give him some more depth. Too little too late. His family - also blondes - are also unrealistically self-obsessed and hateful towards others.
- Neville is blond in canon, but is almost wholly defined by his deficiencies for five out of the seven books. He's also played by the dark-haired Matthew Lewis in the movies (although he gets a pass for being Welsh).

Neville, Luna, and Xeno are arguably protagonists and "good." There's also Hannah and Colin.

But there are quite a few "bad" blonde characters.

Apologies for the derail, but it's even worse than that. Throughout the Triwizad, there was exactly one instance of a Champion just plain breaking down and failing a Task (other than due to outside interference in the Third Task). It was the same champion that (we are told) wore unsuitable, tangly clothing to a Task involving a dragon. Which Champions was it? I'll give you two hints: it was /not/ the underage, unprepared one, and it was /not/ the Hufflepuff.

He took a considerable risk not admitting to Auntie Bella that he'd recognized Harry, and he's a kid whose beloved dad is a racist (there's a lot about Lucius's attitude to mixed marriage in Beedle) so he's starting off with a considerable handicap, and quite indoctrinated.

So, you disapprove of any pairing that isn't explicitly called out as being valid in canon, then? Because, seriously, there's at least as much canon basis for Hermione/Snape as there is for Hermione/Draco, Ginny/Draco, Harry/Draco, etc.

You're looking at them through the lens of what we know came later. When James Potter was at Hogwarts the Slytherins were just kids. They may have been unpleasant, but they weren't Death Eaters yet, especially in his earlier years.

Also, the HP wiki says:

#+begin_quote
  James also had a habit of hexing innocent students for no other reason than because he could, especially Severus Snape, a Slytherin in the same year as him.

  Many teachers regarded [Sirius] and James as troublemakers or practical jokers; Hagrid once compared them to the mischievous twins Fred and George Weasley.

She points up their similarity to Dudley's gang by giving Dudley a sidekick named Piers (an old variant of Peter) who is described as rat-like and who holds down Dudley's victims while Dudley hurts them. Sirius says that Peter typically attaches himself to the biggest bully in the playground, and JK wrote a charity prequel-ette which showed James and Sirius in between 6th and 7th years, already Order members and bravely fighting Death Eaters, but making time on the way to pick on two innocent Muggle policemen.

*** I'd go even farther than that: what abuse Dursleys do heap on Harry in canon should be discounted as well, the same way we would discount slapstick comedy in a visual medium, particularly in a cartoon. Doubly so because --- like an anvil falling on a character's head in a cartoon --- their abuse is ultimately of no consequence to Harry's physical and emotional attributes.

My experience is that for the purposes of characterization and plot, it actually makes for better fics to pretend that "The Cupboard" never existed, and Harry has always had the smaller bedroom.

**** Well, the cupboard is canon, I don't think one can pretend it away - but I used to live in a cottage which had an understair cupboard which extended under the upstairs landing, and was 12ft by 4ft. Harry's cupboard holds a proper bed (we know it's a bed, not just a mattress on the floor, because spiders live under it and socks disappear under it), Harry and Vernon all at the same time, without any apparent difficulty, so it is a proper small room - albeit one which presumably has a sloping ceiling at one end. If it was better lit it would probably be adequate and even quite cute as a child's bedroom, if it was all that was available. Many older houses in Edinburgh include windowless internal bedrooms of about this size. It's the fact that Harry gets one small badly-lit room while Dudley gets two full-sized rooms which is abusive.

There are very few situations where the room where Harry slept at the Dursleys would come up in a conversation or would be examined, unless the author steered it in that direction; and I can't think of a good fic where it's plot-critical to steer it there. (It's not plot-critical in canon, for that matter.)

Very interesting thoughts on what "cupboard under the stairs" means in this context. I never thought of it this way.

And, I agree that giving Dudley two rooms, while Harry sleeps in a cupboard is emotionally abusive and neglectful. My thinking is that one shouldn't so much diminish Dursleys' abuse but to make it less cartoonish, and bring it in line with its actual impact on Harry.

These fics also seem to be joined by the trope of Harry being the heir to multiple families(one or more of the founders is optional) and having more money than the Queen.

** My #1 fanon pet peeve: Hermione <3's Rules/Authority Figures

There is no evidence for this despite the fangasms that occur every time Hermione points out that a specific action will break a rule. There is an enormous difference between being /aware/ of an action's consequences and steadfastly avoiding rulebreaking.

Let's take a look at some of Hermione's accomplishments:

- Set Snape on fire in PS
- Broke curfew to stop Quirrellmort
- Coaxed Harry & Ron into brewing Polyjuice Potion
- Stole the ingredients herself
- Was on her way to tell Harry - not the faculty - about the basilisk traveling via pipes
- Assaults Snape in the Shrieking Shack
- Helps Harry with TWT preparation which may or may not have been against the spirit/rules of the competition

If anything I would say that she has a penchant for following her own moral compass and acts accordingly regardless of any rules.

#+begin_quote
  Even appearance stuff counts.
#+end_quote

There are only two places in canon where a character makes a value judgment as to Hermione Granger's appearance. Yes, the Muggleborn's looks are /described/, but comments about whether her appearance is good/bad are extremely sparse.

- Rita Skeeter calls her 'plain but ambitious' once she's soured on Hermione. I think this is where the awful fanon trope of Hermione having poor body image comes from. I hate it when authors project their own insecurities onto characters.
- Harry Potter acknowledges she's 'very pretty' at the Yule Ball. I think this is where the 'brainy birds are naughty' trope originates.

I never got the impression that she was unattractive, but from the fact that Harry didn't recognize Hermione at the Yule Ball suggests that she didn't put much effort into her appearance (i.e., styling her hair and doing her makeup) on a daily basis. Which makes sense because all her friends are boys.

I get what you mean about fanon Hermione being rigid about rules. If you're doing an AU Hermione that never ended up with the trio it might make sense, but Hermione is willing to bend the rules. I do think she has a tendency to appeal to authority as a last resort though. She threatens to write to Mrs. Weasley about Fred/George, she tells McGonagall about the Firebolt, etc.

Fanfiction often does take it too far. Like, Hermione wouldn't dwell over it or have an eating disorder, but she'd have things she doesn't like about herself from time to time.

****** In this respect it's not just fanfiction. "Double Ds" is commonly used slang for big boobs; anything above DD is considered exotically large in the popular imagination. If a writer (of fanfiction or otherwise) mentioned a character having bigger than DD boobs, people would be imagining that character as having absolutely huge sweater puppies.

So it would be a case of increased accuracy resulting in decreased communication. By giving a correct bra size, you actually mislead the reader. When writing you have to use language as it is commonly used, not what's technically correct.

None of this is helped by the practice of clothes stores. The majority of clothes shops don't stock above DD,and most women are not wearing "a bra that fits". You have to go to a speciality store like Bravissimo to get a proper fitting.

Of course, unless there's some specific joke or plot point that relates to a character having a particular bra size, I'm not sure why authors feel the need to give such precise info. If a character is noticing another's breasts, there are plenty of better ways to describe them than giving a bra size.

*** There was a fic that stuck with me (though not the name, unfortunately) that took Hermione in a different direction (though a bit off from canon) - that the reason she was so adamant about the rules was that she had no clear conception of proportionate response. That for her, breaking the rule that said "you must be in bed by curfew" was equivalent to breaking the rule that said "don't disfigure other student's faces with a complicated curse for 'betraying' you", so she just tried to follow all the rules so that she didn't get in trouble. After she became friends with Harry/Ron, she just used them as baselines for what rules were okay to break and when.

Obviously off from canon, but it hit some interesting points- the same Hermione that hated breaking rules is the Hermione that sent a teacher into the forest to be attacked by a giant/captured by centaurs, was totally fine with imperio-ing a goblin, that one year after the "or worse, expelled" line thought up the plan to sabotage a student's potion so as to steal from a teacher.

The obvious answer here is society, and in particular the way in which peer pressure, the media, societal customs etc make girls much more aware of their looks (or lack thereof).

People react to women differently to men, and this is especially true of pretty women.

It's even present in the way we talk. If you want to complement a women, the default is to complement their looks. And it's not just between men and women: female friends regularly complement their friends' looks. If you want to complement a man, on the other hand... well, you don't compliment men. I don't think I've heard a man complimented in my life. It's just not done.

Given the existence of Witch Weekly, the behaviour of Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, it seems likely that the magical world is similar to the Muggle one in this respect. Though perhaps less so, given the lower penetration of media into everyday life.

Respectfully, I almost take the entire opposite position to your own: how could fem!Harry possibly /not/ be more aware of her looks than male!Harry?

He's described in PS as "small and skinny for his age" and in POA he's said to be the same height as Hermione. Quick google says average height for 14yr old girl is 5'2" so if Harry's going to be considered tall by the time he's, say, 17, he'll have to have one hell of a growth spurt. (Which, I suppose, /is/ possible, but personally I doubt he gets much taller than 5'9" at most, which for a British adult male is the average.)

**** Google says a Lich is a type of undead creature. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lich][According to Wiki]]:

#+begin_quote
  Often such a creature is the result of a transformation, as a powerful magician or king striving for eternal life uses spells or rituals to bind his intellect to his phylactery and thereby achieve a form of immortality. Liches are depicted as being clearly cadaverous, bodies desiccated or completely skeletal. Liches are often depicted as holding power over hordes of lesser undead creatures, using them as soldiers and servants.
#+end_quote

Sounds kinda like Voldemort, especially as a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylactery][phylactery]] is "an object used by a lich to contain its soul and protect it from death, common in fantasy games", he is described as skeletally thin and whiter than a skull in GoF, and he likes using inferi as servants...

** I dislike overly vilifying the Dursleys. They were plenty horrible, but many people take it into the ridiculous.

I dislike many author's depictions of Dumbledore as evil and/or stupid. Manipulative and willing to sacrifice: yes. Evil: no. Stupid: hell fucking no.

I dislike it when Voldemort is made out to be incompetent. He has certain mental inhibitions that cause him to do less logical things, mainly through arrogance, but that doesn't stop him from being one of the greatest wizards to ever live.

I hate making Harry overly super. I love powerful characters. I want Harry to be a boss. But an 11/12/13/etc. year old boy is no match for a grown wizard, never mind Dumbledore, Voldemort, Bellatrix, everyone else authors like to use to show us point blank how ridiculous their story is.

I hate slash stories in which the characters are made gay for no other reason than so the author can form the pairing. I get that it's fanfiction; I just find it annoying.

I dislike it when Snape is portrayed as a "good guy". He is not a good guy. He is a bad guy. The only reason he's on the "light" side is because he was pissed off that Lily died. Had Lily survived, he would have been as happy as a pig in shit to continue on with murdering, torturing, etc.

I dislike it when Lily and James are bashed. I don't understand where it comes from. James was a dick and Lily wasn't perfect, but they weren't nearly as bad as many fics make them out to be. There's no problem with a negative portrayal, but there are limits. Many authors take it into the ridiculous.

I hate Ron bashing. Again, negative portrayals are fine, but bashing belongs only in comedy fics.

The Ice Queen Daphne thing. It's annoying. The basic first layer is acceptable, but most authors take it too far. Why authors have to try to boil down a character into one trait is beyond me.

The portrayal of Luna as the epitome of "Loony Luna". She's a character like any other. Pretty much the same thing as my complaints on Daphne.

*** On the topic of Luna, I hate it when she's portrayed sexually. They always make her bi, sexually open, and super experienced. A nymph. It's really weird to me that they make so much out of her sexuality and that seems to be the extent of her character and purpose in their fic.

Maybe because Rowling does no better? Draco was a one dimensional bigoted bully for 5 books, Zacharias smith is pompous and that's about all u know of him, Luna is odd. Half of the characters even crucial plot driving ones can usually be summed up by one character trait. I don't know why you expect anything different for fans who are just having fun.

I read a fanfiction once where Voldemort wasn't evil, he was just /misunderstood/. You see, in a move of pure genius, his plan was to deal a harsh blow to the mean Purebloods who made fun of him in school by inciting a war between them and Muggleborns. To do this, he strategically set everything up so that Harry would end up winning and Pureblood society would take a huge hit after the war.

It ended in the purgatory/Kings Cross scene with Voldemort explaining all of this (giant monologue of course) to Harry and Dumbledore. They forgave Voldemort and Dumbledore called him Tommy. Tears were had. Voldemort became Tom again and presumably went to heaven or whatever.

Funny thing is, it was a completely serious fic, not a comedy or parody.

Slutty party characters of any kind. Basically any crap about (insert character) getting dressed up in tight PVC hot pants, and having dancefloor sex in a muggle club.

Well, theoretically it's possible. She went home winter break of sixth year and she was seventeen by that point so she could have taken some intensive driving lessons (or get taught by her parents) during that holiday and the spring holiday (there's no mention of that break at all in HBP so she could have gone home) and then taken the test.

End of the Christmas holidays in her sixth year would definitely be the earliest she'd be able to drive, if she picked it up pretty quick, but it is a bit redundant in a canon setting.

**** Hmm. I forgot about Hermione being a year older, but HP doesn't mention half term breaks, so that would still only give her four weeks to learn how to drive.

Even if she spent the first few weeks of the summer learning as well, she would have had to focus on nothing but driving.

Well, I agree that it's more possible than I first thought, but it still seems unlikely.
