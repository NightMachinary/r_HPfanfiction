:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read part of this awhile back. The story is told from the perspective of a mum who befriends Ginny as James and her son meet primary school.

It has alot of very /normal/ suburban / rural chatter, but it's well written, fun and for the life of me I can't remember it's name.

What I remember: Ginny and Harry buy a manor in this small British town. They are pretending to be muggles so their kids can have a normal childhood pre-Hogwarts without their parents shadow looming over them.

It follows the story of a stay at home mum with two kids (one James age, the other a baby). She forms an unlikely friendship with Ginny. Her husband is a solicitor.

The only other thing I remember is that that tell people in town that Harry works for the government in counter terrorism

This was read on fictionpress, I think!

If anyone knows the title or something similar, please let me know :)
