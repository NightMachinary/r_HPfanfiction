Can be Canon compliant or not. So as the Title says, i would like to have Ginny being in a "Relationship" with 2 People. Doesnt matter, if its canonically, so one partner being Harry. Both Partners know, that they are not the only ones for Ginny, but they dont mind.

Although i accept affair fics aswell, i would prefer it to be without bondings.

Lemons are also welcome.


** so... polyamory?

idk, "love triangle" seems more like unrequited/rivalry shit, not like a healthy relationship.
