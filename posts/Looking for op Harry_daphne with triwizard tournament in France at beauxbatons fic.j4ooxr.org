:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Can't remember if this is a multi fic story or just a really long one. Anyway I remember a part where Harry suggests a way around the protection of the goblet and one french student tries it and ends up shattering her mind. Just for the life of me I can't remember the name of the fic or the author

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
