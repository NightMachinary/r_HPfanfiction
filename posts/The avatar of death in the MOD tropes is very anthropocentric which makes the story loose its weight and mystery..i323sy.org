I love the concept of being the master of death and the possibilities of what that might entail, however whenever I read it in fanfics I always get disappointed because the ‚Äúdeath‚Äù depicted in those stories always closely resembles any human on Halloween night with only a scythe and black cloak that differentiates them.

What I mean to say is that its very anthropocentric! It doesn't have to be written in a Lovecraftian way but when the death depicted in the story acts like a handbook to explain the rules to Harry and is predictable and human than there is no mystery everything is spoon-fed and it makes such an awesome concept boring. Death even in the magical world is something that transcends the understanding of even the greatest wizards its a mystery its cosmic and so awe inspiring that they make legends about it. There is an element of existential horror to it. So I wish that people would either stop writing Concepts like death/fate as a clich√©d plot device that are anthropocentric in nature. Or at least take out the whole concept of the avatar of death and just make the Master of Death concept more ambiguous. Maybe let the reader imagine what it could be like making it more interesting and chilling. What do you guys think? And do you have any good recommendations for properly done mod tropes in fanfic?


** Most fics using MOD are about Harry going into another dimension/timeline/fandom, so Death is not really an important 'character', just there to actually spoon-feed readers the reason behind Harry being reincarnated/reborn/sent to past/ whatever.

Unless the fic is about the exploration of Death or Harry's MOD status, I don't care what Death looks like. If it doesn't serve the plot, then why waste time on it?

*** Yes I agree with you on the first part death as an in depth character or entity would take up too much space in terms of acting as Harry's catalyst to dimension travel, however, taking such huge concepts such as fate, death, or other cosmic powers and just turning them in to guidebooks kind of cheapens the story in my opinion at least in terms of agency and intensity. I mean death could be used as a vessel to explain things but I think a little bit of creativity can be used. But mostly my grievance is with how Harry's Mod status is explored and How using death as an anthropocentric character makes everything more boring I wish authors weren't afraid to use more ambiguity. Sometimes less is more. But I agree with you on how exploring death when dealing with stories of dimension hopping etc.. might be too much to squeeze in.

  ...Don't necessarily make the master. If anything, it's the other way around. ‚ÄúThe Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one Master of Death.‚ÄùExcept, Beatle the Bard was not quite right---and neither was Xenophilius Lovegood. Now Harry must find his own path as the Master of Death, all the while dancing a one-man tap dance between Death above and Death below. What's worse, unmaking and remaking the Hallows is only the first step.

** Yeah, I like the MoD stories where Harry stumbles into figuring things out. Like ones where he starts seeing ghosts (beyond normal hogwarts ones), or starts getting new abilities related to necromancy, but never has it explained to him. Any time a story makes Death into an actual speaking character I usually lose interest immediately.

Whispers in Corners by esama (HP/Sherlock xover) has a MoD portrayal that I really like. Harry can summon the spirits of the dead and somehow stumbles into being a professional medium as a living. I like the idea of the Hallows following him, and I like Harry's strange disconnected personality.

Resurrect the Living by fascinationex is probably my favorite MoD fic. Post-DH Harry's MoD powers start to kick in and he starts to see dead people. It starts to get so bad that he can't go anywhere without seeing spirits of people who died there and the stronger his powers get, the more they can affect him (even hurt him). I love how this fic portrays these abilities very much as a curse, one that Harry is desperately trying to get rid of.

You might also give dead things by EclipseWing a try. That one has an unsettling, dark Harry that's deeply affected by being the MoD. It's told from Hermione's point of view so you get an outsider's perspective on how Harry changes.

****** Sisyphus by esama is one of my favorites 'doomed atmosphere' fics. It's not explicitly MoD Harry but has the same time travel/immortality tropes.

tell me whether he is dead by LullabyKnell is an interesting MoD Harry take with some creepy elements but ultimately a bit more fluffy/hopeful. So might not be of interest but I figured I'd rec it anyway.

There is also All Hallows by esama. It's a Harry Potter/Rise of the Guardians crossover. It does have a personified Death, but it's one that fits thematically with the Rise of the Guardians story.

I don't generally read a lot of dark/insane Harry stories because it's hard to find ones that makes his descent feel real. And there are a lot of stories that use 'Harry is insane' as reasoning behind any random action.

***** I totally get you when I looked at the tags I was like wtf but the the rape is not between HP/TM and Harry isn't underage. Basically Harry is a jaded auror in the story somehow gets hurt during his missions and because he is the MOD he goes back in time and switches bodies with a suicidal boy from Hogwarts who was apparently raped by some of the disgusting students. Harry in this story is trying to get revenge on every single person get used to his powers and shit on Tom every chance he gets. Its not Hp/Tm its hp&tm though the subject matter is still heavy I think the author was inspired by some south korean light novel. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone but if you want a bamf Harry getting revenge for the body he swapped have cool powers and shit on Tom riddle every step of the way I would recommend it.

** What specifically is it about the MOD trope that you enjoy? I think it's hard to write a "master" of death without falling into that trap, just because it's hard to write an inevitable force of nature that's subservient to a human. Depictions of Death and the Hallows that ignore or subvert that aspect tend to be more effective in my experience, like the Black Queen series for instance.

*** I like the more Lovecraftian aspect of being the master of death. The existential horror of it the vastness and ambiguity of the title. I think that Lily and the art of Sisyphus explores that concept a bit. In the story Harry is the master of death but there is nobody to explain what it means and he sits alone at Kings cross and suddenly things start to transcend go beyond his understanding of what it means to be a human being or what reality is. I just like ambiguity and the play on the fickle nature of reality especially in such a setting as the magical world. So when authors try to compartmentalize such a vast concept such as death and tie everything up with a neat bow it just gives a really cheapening effect to such an incomprehensible and interesting concept.

Other than fics already mentioned, there are also two fics by tardisistheonlywaytotravel on ao3 with Lovecraftian Horror!MOD!Harry, but you've probably already read those. Mentioning them in case you haven't. There's also another short one by LullabyKnell (I think?) where after the war Harry acquires certain ghost-like qualities from having died once.

Also, nice username! I'm still working through the Archives. It's slow going.

** I would like to read a fic where it explores how Harry became Master of Death. I don't want it to be a title he gets simply by having a stick, a stone and a cloth. I want Harry to actually earn it. Maybe each Hallows has a test lined up for Harry. Maybe one becomes the Master of Death only after they overcome it, i.e. come back after having died, like Harry. Or literally something like since Harry didn't submit to Death (the killing curse, two times) death chose Harry to be master of Hallows.

But after everything, I want there to be a plot twist, Harry is the master of Hallows, but not death. In fact Harry is the servant of death, it's vassal. I have not seen this plot twist, and I would like it very much.
