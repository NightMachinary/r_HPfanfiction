Feel free to name some of your favorites, or ones that don't get recommended/talked about much.

Can be as canon as possible or as AU as possible.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not that's fine.

** Harry goes back on time and goes to school with Dumbledore in this one. The pacing is pretty slow (we haven't met Grindelwald yet) but the writing has been pretty good.

*** Making a fic like this about relationships or romance would be a MASSIVE missed opportunity.
