I just finished reading the fourth jumper novel, which is about the main character building a space program through their ability to teleport and the change momentum.

Looking for more in this vein, would love a story about a magical push to space, or where wizards already colonized space. If not, a good crossover would do, too.

Ta muchly!

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

*** First time commenting on Reddit, but i couldn't ignore your post. Blue magic is probably my all time fanfic on FF.net, and is the fic that got seriously got me into exploring fan fiction. I cant recommend it nearly enough. I think its a shame that it hasn't been updated in a long while, but the author seems to be fairly active and has always responded to my reviews and pm's.

there are several good HP/ME crossovers out there, another one of my favorites (very different in tone to blue magic) is Harry Potter: Geth linkffn( 10784770)

Give it a read if your interested in a humorus, zany adventure!
