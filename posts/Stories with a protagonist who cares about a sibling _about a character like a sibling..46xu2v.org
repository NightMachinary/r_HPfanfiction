I'm looking for stories where the protagonist has a sibling as his main motivation for his behaviour.

I'm talking about things like:

- Harry has a brother/sister and is really protective about him/her
- Harry timetravels/visits different dimension and becomes a older brother figure for a younger version of himself or his friends (brotherfigure, not fatherfigure!)
- selfinsert / OC character being the older (or younger, but more mature) sibling of any character

What I'm not interested in are weasley twin stories, nor stories where the protagonist is at odds with a sibling.

Suggestions?

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.
