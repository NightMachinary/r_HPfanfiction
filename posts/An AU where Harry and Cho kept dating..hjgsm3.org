We need more of this ship. I found a fanfic called Harry Potter and the Autumn Swan. It was good, even though it took some liberties with Hedwig. I don't any crazy changes. The only change is that Cho and Harry go to the Yule Ball. I'm not a writer so hopefully someone notices. Must start by GoF.


** Hey im having some trouble finding the fic you mentioned, could i get a link?
