Maybe some time in the past there was a way for Muggleborns to claim vaults of a Squib ancestor but it got the Purebloods all Noses out of joint, so in the next treaty with the Goblin they banned the Inheritance Test but allowed the Goblins to keep offering it to kill off any uppity Muggleborns, then later a more pro-muggleborn ministry made it so the Goblins could no longer advertise it leading to it being forgotten but couldn't remove it from the books.

really if a familly died out there Vault would ether go to the closest family member found it the family tree going backwards or if there are none it would be spilt between the Ministry and Gringotts( with mabye Hogwarts getting copys of any books)

I remember one were Harry tries to take a Gringotts Inheritance test only to end up decapitated

How would you even justify the wizarding world bothering to invite muggleborns to Hogwarts if they hate them enough to set up traps to kill them?

*** Its more about subverting the normal helpful goblin bullshit.

Take a guess at what is one of my most hated common Harry Potter tropes(two really I also can't stand the trope of all muggleborns being decendant of squibs)

  COMPLETE. When Harry is called to Gringotts Bank to meet with the goblin Boneclaw regarding financial matters, things go unexpectedly. Harry is furious. Will Boneclaw come to regret his actions? Goblin bashing. AU after OotP. Oneshot.

** LoL

If the fact its a trap has been forgotten I could see Draco getting caught by it Turns up to Gringotts demanding to take A inheritance test to claim that Black "lordship" that potter stole from him and then the goblin take his off to a disguised guillotine. and then the Goblins are like are you sure you want to do this Mr Malfoy" only for Draco to tell them to hurry up.
