****** The people that wrote it and pulled it off had "connections" and pitched it to her, with a decent sounding pitch, probably along the lines of "There will be a bit of nostalgia when traveling back, but it will all be about the amazing character arcs of the next generation, where Harry's children learn that being a hero isn't easy".

She then probably discussed a few things with them, started to like some of their ideas, and the rest is history.

Yeah, they were essentially pitching fanfiction, but they were pitching it directly to her, in a totally different medium and were probably recommend to her by some of her friends.

I am 100% sure that while the writers of CC were talented and proven, they only got the chance because they were well connected.

And from what I heard the play is great as a play - it apparently just doesn't work well as a script.

*** Cured Child is a great piece of fanfiction (I wish there were more stories of that quality frankly-it's readable, not a bad story and consistent within itself) but not a particularly impressive Harry Potter story.

If it were released as fanfiction, it would undoubtedly be praised.

Edit: I'll be honest I was hoping I would be able to stop this comment taking over the thread, but clearly not.

Firstly,

A) This is an unbelivably low effort comment. It's posted all the time and is /always/ tangential to the topic. So at /least/ post a response to the topic.

B) It's blatantly ridiculous. This is a fanfiction sub. The Cursed Child is no different to the majority of stories posted here. It would be praised because we accept different standards for fanfiction and Harry Potter stories.

***** Not as common as one would like the best authors, I'll check it out :).

Cursed Child is funny because it rather shows the difference between fanfiction and legitimate stories within the world. As fanfiction it's pretty good. Not excellent. But good.

As a Harry Potter story? It doesn't work. Fanfiction is allowed to play with the world and use time travel devices and have crazy plot twists. But a proper Harry Potter story has to tone it back.

***** ... You missed my point. It's silly to pretend that every piece of fanfiction is a work of art. Anything written by JK Rowling is going to better than 99.9% of fanfictions, so of course it's going to be praised.

People are lying to themselves if they do not believe otherwise. I read the recommendations here. They can be a worthwhile read but I'd hate them if they were Harry Potter, because a lot of them are ridiculous in truth.

Anything by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][Floreatcastellum]] is also similar in style.

They have no account description, no favorites, they never wrote any author's notes, haven't been active since the story finished and the story itself portrays the characters and world of Harry Potter better than almost any other story I've read before or since.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
