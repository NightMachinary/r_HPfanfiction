Anyone know this fic from ffnet?

Parenting class fanfic where they use a globe to create their kids but they argue and it cracks spilling water around the room. I specifically remember Draco and Hermione son studied in New York and says Hermione and Draco are divorced. A side pairing I think was Luna and Harry and they have a daughter with an Australian accent. It was also published years ago
