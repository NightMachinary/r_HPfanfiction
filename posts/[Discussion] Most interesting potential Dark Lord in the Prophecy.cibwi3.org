I read one where it was Dumbledore, as he marked Harry as his equal by inflating his legend as a fellow defeater of the dark lord. I've seen a couple with Grindelwald. Voldemort goes without saying.

What's the most unique interpretation of the dark lord of the prophecy?


** I like the completely AU interpretation that the only true "Dark Lord" is Death, and "those who thrice defied him" were the Peverell family, meaning that one marked as "his equal" is the Master of Death.

*** That's pretty interesting. Has there been a fic where it's done. As a theory that's great though.

**** I've read many "Master of Death" fics in which Voldemort isn't the main enemy, but HPMOR is the only one which outright suggests this as an alternate interpretation for the prophecy. I enjoy fics that take the plot and story themes in a completely different direction from canon.

** u/InquisitorCOC:

  "The prophecy said that my parents had to defy you three times... how could this possibly work?" Neville asked, confusion written all over his face as he pointed his wand at the Dark Lord and Traitor, Harry Potter.

  As the Fourth Battle of Hogwarts was raging around them, Harry contemplated this question and replied:

  "Your parents knew me and must have visited my parents. They probably didn't give me toys or candy three times in a row, or something similar.‚Äù

  Neville thought about that answer, it seemed to make sense, "Oh... wow."

Snape's the Dark Lord of Hogwarts, Neville's parents thrice defied him and he got marked as his equal in the first potions test.

I did like the concept.

** I like the idea that the prophecy is about the outcome of tabletop RPG campaign, and as tabletop gaming becomes more popular, fewer and fewer prophecies are meaningful. I don't remember ever seeing a fic that does that, though.

Edit: Also, the idea that any prophecy that doesn't name /specific/ people could be about anyone, fictional or real, and that with sufficient knowledge and effort, it's possible to construct scenarios that allow prophecies to be fulfilled in a controlled, non-harmful manner.
