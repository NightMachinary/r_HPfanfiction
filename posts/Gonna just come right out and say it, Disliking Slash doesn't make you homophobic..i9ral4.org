So alot of threads are going around talking about slash, and a comment on one of them that basically is a giant discussion about why Drarry is or isn't trash caught my eye. It basically said "Haphne is Drarry for people who are Homophobic."

That's stupid, that's like saying something like Harry/Ron is Hinny for Heterophobes.

people like what they like, yes their are Homopobic people who dislike Slash because they're assholes. But most people don't like slash either because they aren't Gay and it doesn't interest them, or they don't enjoy reading Sex scenes which a decent amount of ALL romance fics have in general, especially on AO3.

People like what they like, get over it.

*** Yep I got down voted on that thread mentioned above because I laid out my personal opinion about the drarry ship (and dramione and harmony). I thought the down vote was for bad posts, not for ones you just didn't agree with! Not that its a big deal really, and I'm not here for the karma, but it kind of hurt my feelings a bit that people couldn't take the time to explain why they disagreed with my opinion... I was hoping they would that's why I posted! I love debating HP (and other fandoms of course) but to just blindly slap a down vote seems nasty and passive to me for some reason. It's a pretty negative environment around here to mention any ship at all it seems like. I like understanding why people would pair off characters I wouldn't normally, because it might open me up for reading something new.

Also, are you saying that all, and I do mean /all/ relationships between 16 year olds and adults are unhealthy? Bold claim, quite hard to prove aswell. Impossible, I'd wager. It's an absolute statement, and nothing is absolute in the real world.

Also, fiction is a reflection of the real world. Fact is, those kinds of relationships exist in the real world and, as such, they also exist in the fictional world.

*** My personal opinion is that ships are the worst part of fanfiction. Don't get me wrong, I have OTPs and like to read shipping fics, but I also think that ships lessen the quality of fanfic in general for non-romance-centric stories. They distract from the main plot and are often not that well written. I wish AO3 had a way of showing that the ship isn't very central to the plot. In general, I find that M/M means that the ship is going to take over too much if in fics that didn't start off as romance, F/M is default so it's a gigantic toss up whether it's romance or just a side plot, F/F is default romance, Multi is not going to be very good, and Gen half the time is a lie and that "platonic" pairing of "Character A & Character B" is actually just pre-slash. I love AO3, but its reliance on authors to tag properly makes the search useless half the time.

i'm not reading fics for gay stuff, it's nice to have some queer literature as a queer person but that isn't the driving force. it's frustrating and childish. when people won't read a well written fic bc of slash- this feels like it could be homophobic.

it's the same in the media, people won't watch series because they have a gay relationship etc, it's honestly angering as a queer person.

i agree that some shippers of slash, particularly drarry are fetishising gay relationships but this is just as bad as people refusing to read a slash fic just because it's slash.

*** Yeah. Fics like Crammer, Of a Linear Circle, Of Wizards and Heroes... people miss out on great stories because they just don't want slash. I HATE Snape as a character, but I've read Linear Circle like 6 times because I love the hell out of the story.

A lot of the resistance against reading slash is upbringing, I think. I know that it took me a long time to get over my avoidance of them, partially because of the whole 'women who read slash are just fetishizing it' thing (which is hilarious in retrospect because asexual), but also because I was raised catholic by homophobic/racist parents. It's baggage, and I eventually trashed it, but dammit it's /hard to do./

But, woe be the author who dare post a het fic about either one of them (or even a gen, really anything that is not the two of them in a lesbian relationship). Authors have gotten bullied off platforms over it. It's ridiculous, really.

Avoiding fics because you don't want to spend your free time reading them is fine. Being nasty to people who don't see your ship is NOT. I know multiple people that'll only read slash, and others who won't read MC slash. And others that'll read both, or sometimes. All's good as long as you keep respectful towards each other.

Now, underage or non-con stuff I think gets more leeway for criticism or snark and idealising it can be very problematic. Whether that be school-aged admm or mmhg or sshg or snarry or harry-bellatrix or whatever other pairing regardless of gender.

**** i feel like a lot of the language around slash being unreadable also centers around critiquing a generalized vague notions the user has of slash fandom - vague since often the person critiquing slash has not interacted with slash very much.

rather than talking about slash fics themselves, like they would any other het fics, where some fics are bad and other fics are good, they generalize slash niches to all of slash, like saying all of it is DE pairings or whitewashing or pwp etc.

it would be akin to saying all het fics are indy!harry curbstomps, or harems.

slash critique also centers around vastly generalizing the people who write slash & why - it's all "girls looking to fetishize men". and generalizing the people who read it.... as just all being straight teenage girls. lol. despite, again, the person critiquing rarely having interacted with people who read and write slash.

why not just focus on the fic than get trapped in this weird narrative of trying to show how slash is bad because of teenage girls. which is also rlly odd?????? whats wrong w teenage girls.

and to me it frankly often feels like skirting around the issue of why it is that people find it uncomfortable to read about two guys liking eachother, when it's just harry/cedric, 1899 albus/gellert, harry/ron, etc.

as a side note, often harry/ron gets lip service as the "good pairing" or "allowed pairing" in a way that comes off really strange to me.

Literally the three out of the four most popular slash pairings on AO3 are exactly that, Death Eater whitewashing and revisionism. Namely Harry/Malfoy, Harry/Snape and Harry/Riddle. And they make up over half of all slash fics in between them (61804/113982). Although to be fair, some of them might have the whole thing as rape and therefore not whitewashing.

I did not know that 54% was a small niche, because the word I would use there is absolute majority. And that's just with the 3 most popular characters, throw in the other Death Eaters and you are probably beyond 60%.

****** It's not "because I've grown with het as default" that I can't identify with a non-het relationship. As a matter of fact, I grew up with a good amount of non-het influence in my family, and it never really did more than make me go "huh, you're gay then ?".

Through to be fair, if we're going by personal experience, then I can't read ship fics because I'm asexual at best, or aromantic, never cared enough to discover which one it was. And after ten seconds of research I know even less because apparently, for what I'm talking about, *in the english language, it's not spelled asexual*, so I'm now quite confused. So let's go with aromantic, that's the same idea with the other thing I was thinking of anyway.

I may have gone off the rail there, so let's go back to what I was trying to say : if you're talking about "not being able to read slash because of personal experience", then I just shouldn't be able to read pairings at all. If you're going with influences in my life, I shouldn't have any difficulties reading slash. Which I kinda do, but not that much ?

​

So let's back off a bit, just so I can approach this at a better angle and explain how I see it.

I think we do not swear off slash fics just like that. It's just that it's kinda less enticing, because it's one of the biggest changes you could "inflict" upon a character - making them suddenly thirsty for the same sex, I mean. And depending on what you're trying to read, it can really makes you believe "to much is to much".

For example, to stay in HP communauty : Harry and Draco are as straight as can be depicted without stating it. So, to pair them up, you either need to genderbend one of them, or to use the "homophiby beam" on both of them. Or my personal favourite (lies), genderbend both of them THEN turn them gay.

In a way, all of those options sucks because you're changing the character(s) at its or their core. Especially if your fic is there for the pairing.

​

Aaaaand now to be honest with you it's been like 15 minutes since I started writing this and I'm kinda lost with what I was trying to say so I'ma cut it there with these words :

Slash isn't cringe but writing slash just because gayz kinda is

(And to be honest, if you see slash in the same way as you see Dark, Indy Harry, then it all starts to make sense as to why people don't like it : as a plot device, if it's the only thing you have, which is quite common in fics, it sucks)

---[Part 2]---

Now something else, yeah there's not many LGBTQ+ in medias but that's kinda normal, because even IRL the LGBTQ+ are a minority, like less than 5% total I believe ? (I don't have the exact numbers but I'm pretty sure that it's still a minority)

So it's a loop, people don't read/write LGBTQ+ content because the majority is not, so the LGBTQ+ write their own to have some, but the majority don't read because it's far removed from what they feel at their core.

Unless the author tries to holds me hostage until I say his fic is great because it's slash in which case I'd have worst problems than just gays people kissing in fictional writings.

But quite frankly, I don't know if that's how I came across with all my posts, but I don't hate slash fics. I don't even dislike them - they're just a bit like the "dark" or "indy" tags : warnings that something I don't particularly care about is gonna be one of the main selling point of the fic. And sometimes, writers don't know how to tone it down so it's not really good, and combined with the fact it's slash romance, it puts me off. But it's because it's /slash/ *romance*, and not because it's *slash* /romance/. Romance as a whole seems like a bad main selling point to me, and the slash bit just adds to it because I can't even identify to it. (I don't know if I'm expressing myself correctly here so I'm gonna stop)

​

I'm pretty sure everyone has been a cringe writer at first. Hell, I remember the first fanfic I ever wrote, which I never posted ; not a self-insert (thankfully for my ego) but a really bad OP OC. I still have some sketches, and nowadays I still use him as a villain in my writings because I wrote what ultimately was a better antagonist than hero lead.

It's kinda sad that you burnt your first creations - you should always keep them to see how far you've come. Sometimes, I look back, and I'm sitting there, just thinking "wow, I really sucked, THAT was my best main character ?". I also started writing female lead characters only after a bit of maturing - and also because I absolutely wanted to explore a constantly drunk 14 years old asshole, and I wanted to play the sole female character of this RP game we were doing with friends. That really helped. A lot. And now it's my favourite (and most fleshed-out) character. And also an antagonist. Kinda. My story is complicated and a big lot of bullshit.

Aaaaand I have gone off the rail again. Yay me.

​

Also I misused the word "asexual" because in my language "asexuel" means a totally different thing, so I'm always confused - so I'm sorry about it.

That's kind of my point, really. We pigeonhole people as gay or straight, but I don't think the vast majority of people are actually incapable of leaving the pigeonhole. If those labels mean that you're literally incapable of romantically loving someone of a non-matching gender, then I think that both "straight" and "gay" are disabilities - but I think very few people are actually afflicted with either one.

In practice, of course, as long as monogamy is the norm, /behaviour/ can be described as either gay or straight. /People/, though, are more complex.

It's like, you can write either left-handed or right-handed, and we call people left-handed or right-handed based on what comes easier to them, but just about anyone ought to be able to learn to write with the other hand given enough practice.

******* I made this thread in response to a comment someone else made on another thread, i'd do the same if someone had said "disliking Het pairings makes you a heterophobe"

Het fix, like i slightly touched on in the original comment but didn't elaborate can be just as bad and as much of a coin toss as Slash, I have plenty of instances where i've opened a story only to nope out because of shit that I don't like in regards to the het pairing.

A good example is theres a fic where Hermione fucking dies and Harry ends up fucking her mother because "she looks like her" and her mother goes with it because her Husband dies and "She needs someone to love"

it's cringey bullshit, and a coin toss the same way a good amount of slash fiction is.

People need to get it through their damn head that Fanfiction AS A WHOLE is spotty at best and their is a reason most of the fics that are recommended on this reddit are the same fics every day.

You keep coming up with reasons why you don't want to read slash (all of which also apply to het fics, but we'll leave that aside). But the reasons aren't good enough on their own, you just "generally" don't like slash at all. That's the part where you're being homophobic.

**** > reading slash a bit of a coin toss for a lot of straight readers

Exactly this! I'm cool with reading a slash romance. I'm not looking to read slash smut. It can be incredibly hard to tell the difference from a description and it's not always a clear line.

I can only imagine this is equally annoying for gay readers reading het stories that become surprise het smut with no warning.

I guess the solution would be better tags but we all know how inconsistent authors are with tagging.

#+end_quote

Not the guy above, but I tend to insert myself into the characters. So if the male character is gay, there is a big disconnect which throws me out of the immersion since (from my perspective), why would you want to bang some dude if women exist? And yes, I also vastly prefer lesbian PoVs for that reason, wanting a woman is something I can relate to. Hell, most male tropes are utterly worn out on male characters (Macho soldier, strong leader and so on) but are refreshing if the character is female since it is rarely done.

If the story has many switching PoVs with no thoughts (just dialogue and exposition) or minimal romance, I don't mind gay characters, even main ones (Frederick the Great in Arose out of the Azure Main over at alternatehistory.com would be a good example). But fanfiction is not written that way in 99/100 cases. It usually follows the MC.

Also, more specifically to the HP fandom, the only interesting guy in Harry's age group is Harry, with the next two being Sirius (fucking your dead best friend's son would be very weird) and James (only interesting due to his relationship to Lily), followed by Moody (again, no suitable partner in the age bracket).

*** I think it can really depend on your perspective. A well written fanfic which involves a large portion of Harry trying to get with Draco would be of no interest to me, slash or no slash. Just like any fic where it is primarily about unrequited love, or anything that is just PWP. I want to read a storyline, with well developed characters. If that character happens to be gay, then that is fine, but if the author has focused on a person's sexuality as the main focus of that characters personality in the story, then that's where I find I don't enjoy a story. People are more than their sexuality. I enjoy reading HP because they aren't romance novels with a side of a problem/resolution, and I want the same if I'm reading fanfic.

*** Disclaimer: I don't hate gay people and I accept them like every other person around me.

Slash that is denoted in the summary of a fanfiction is usually an indicator for me to stay away from the fic, because the times I tried one of those they were overly filled with sexual themes and in some cases depicted not only borderline criminal stuff.

That is not to say that it is true for all of them. Many are probably good stories without these problems, but when I am on the search for a good read I go by my own experiences. The best slash contents I read were the ones that simply so happened to be in the story without being denoted. They felt like a natural inclusion to the story and not like something that was tagged onto pre-existing characters and felt almost cartoon-ish.

I personally like both and will devour any good fic with them that I can find. And no one sees me hating people and downvoting them because they like to pair Harry with Voldemort because I can't understand how you can pair Harry with Voldemort who's like fifty years his senior and bloody insane.

***** lol the justification the author provided on his discord was INSANE

#+begin_quote
  Okay, I'm going to make a statement about Harry's behaviour in regards to the girls since it is a contentious issue, but I only want to say these things once. This statement can be referred to any time someone brings this up in future.

  Firstly, let's clear up some outright erroneous assertions.

  Statement: Harry engages in grooming.

  This statement is categorically not true. Grooming is, “the befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a child, and sometimes the family, to lower the child's inhibitions with the objective of sexual abuse” (definition randomly grabbed from wikipedia). While Harry certainly does do the first part (the befriending and establishing an emotional connection), he is not doing it with the intention of committing sexual abuse. And that is very important.

  What Harry is doing would more accurately fall under two other categories.

  The first is ‘Wife Husbandry.' That is, training, educating (and, yes, manipulating), the girls to be inclined to marry him later on in life, and to meet his ideal of what a wife might be.

  This is still totally morally unacceptable by the standards of our society, but we'll get to that in a moment.

  The second is Child Soldier Training, more so in the case of some of the girls (Ginny, Luna, Alex), than others, but even Hermione and Daphne are receiving basic combat training. This is, arguably, far more horrific than the first category, but people tend to have morality blindness in adventure stories because, Rahh! Action! Now that we have accurately assessed what Harry is in fact doing with the girls (and what he is not) let's move to the second statement.

  Statement/question: Your character's actions are immoral and disgusting. How do you justify it? I don't. Nor do I need to. The characters in the story justify what they do to themselves and others, but I, the author, do not justify their actions. They are characters in a story. They are a. not real. and b. not me. If by the question you mean, “How do I justify writing this story?” my answer to that is, “because I enjoy it, and because many people find it entertaining,” in the same way that many people find BDSM enjoyable and entertaining, despite the morally questionable nature of the actions within the lifestyle, when taken out of context.

  Like BDSM, this story is a fantasy (a power fantasy, in this case). In BDSM the behaviours are morally acceptable because all people engaging in the experience consent. By reading the story, you also consent, and I do not need to obtain consent from the characters in the story because they don't exist. I made them up. Enjoying this story does not make you immoral. Engaging in these behaviours in the real world makes you immoral.

Hermione is Harry's most faithful and steadfast friend, the only one who never left his side except for when HE pushed her away. She is his most trusted confidant, and he'd be dead so many times over without her help.

MOST Drarry fics I've seen start around fifth or sixth year. After Draco has cursed Hermione, literally and figuratively. Insulted her. Belittled her. Told her she was scum beneath his boot in all but words. Hinted that he would be thrilled if she were murdered.

How in the hell is that realistic? I can suspend my disbelief pretty far. But for someone to ignore all the terrible things someone has done to their best friend and literal lifesaver just because Draco's a pretty boy? Draco as a character has absolutely no redeeming traits. It can't be his personality Harry is attracted to.

It's not that it is OOC. It is that nobody wants to read about someone basically telling their best friend, "I dont care what he's done to you in the past, I want to snog/shag/date this boy. Fuck your suffering at his hands. Having sex with him/spending time with him is more important to me than the relationship we have."

The absolute worst ones are where Hermione even continues being friends with Harry after he gets with Draco. They turn Hermione into a masochist so desperate for human companionship that she'll endure the presence of her tormentor just so she won't lose her friend who already chose the tormentor over her.

It's sickening to read. It's not the sex, it's not the kissing or romance, it's the sheer, unmitigated betrayal inherent to the plot.

Not gonna lie, at 16 and in that situation, I would have killed about anybody if it meant saving my family. I'd never have the strength to leave them and I'd reckon a lot of teenagers aren't emotionally independent to make the right choice there. Not every one is a brave and righteous hero (at 16!) and denying those who aren't any chance for redemption is a flawed outlook on humanity.

*************** Look, when you kill someone, you take away their future. Whether they're old or young makes no difference. You take away their relationships, their dreams, their aspirations, and everything else that makes them who they are.

Everyone knows from the time they are young that killing is wrong, barring psychopaths and sociopaths.

Draco was old enough to know better. It's not about being a hero, it's about not doing the one thing that virtually everyone agrees is the worst crime you can commit on someone else. He had options. He chose not to take them.

If you take someone else's life, you forfeit yours. You may never, every raise a hand to harm someone else. You may become the next Martin Luther King Jr. It does not outweigh that single, cold-blooded murder.

He had nine months to come up with an alternative. He had nine months to figure something out other than killing a man in cold blood. He, at least from what the books tell us, never even tried to find another way to do things.

He could have forced his mother out of the country. Hell, stun her and hide her away. Put her in his trunk and ask the head of the wizarding equivalent of the head of the UN, his headmaster, to find them refuge somewhere else. Dumbledore could have put them under the fidelius with himself as secret keeper.

If someone tried to force me to kill someone else and was threatening my family, I'd do my absolute damndest to find a way. He didn't even try.

Now, if it had been a heat of the moment thing, or in self-defense, I could grow to forgive. He wasn't protecting himself, and he didn't have the excuse of having snapped due to immense emotional pressure/trauma. He wasn't some kid just messing about who caused an accident. He killed a man because he didn't want to look for other options.

He deliberately let terrorist war criminals into a building full of other children, many of whom said terrorists would want to kill by virtue of who their parents were. I don't remember them mentioning how many children died, but I dont believe it would have been 0. I don't care how much I love my parents, I wouldn't murder children for them, and they'd be utterly ashamed, disgusted, and disappointed in my actions had I done so.

So, attempted murder 1, accomplice to murder 1, aiding and abetting the deaths of children because of an immutable aspect those children posessed(hate crime), torture(a war crime), accomplice to who knows what other crimes, perpetrator of who knows what other crimes, and possibly more.

No, Draco was a shitty human being, like every other death eater, and his crimes don't warrant leniency. At the very, very least, he deserved life in Azkaban.

Edit: Oh yeah, almost forgot. He murdered Katie Bell, so add on murder 1 to his list of crimes.

Really just want to pick up on this. The level of hatred and vitriol that can form between two gay guys who are both in the closet and afraid of coming out should not be underestimated. They don't know how to deal with the emotions they're feeling about the other guy, and in the end they go to the human default of anger. And that compounds itself because they're both feeling and acting like that, and don't know how to deal with it, so it gets worse and worse.

They're at each others throats, but still find each other attractive and the anger turns into hatred because it has no other outlet.

I'm not saying thats a canon representation of Draco and Harry. But...its a real world phenomenon and you could very, very easily take the canon relationship and put it in that frame.

Draco attempted to cause Harry to faint in a quiditch game when the last time nearly killed him (dressing as a dementor). Harry and co drugged and impersonated Dracos best friends to interrogate him because they suspected him of being a bigoted murderer. Draco stomps Harrys faces repeatedly on the train in 6th year.

As a matter of fact, he married a pureblood. One he didn't interact with much in his school years.

From Year 1 through 7, he still believed in pureblood superiority. From the beginning to the end.

Also, his parents never said that. They said that they were disappointed that their son was beaten by a lesser being - not that their son WAS the lesser being. A Malfoy is a pureblood, and so is better than all the filthy mudbloods. To be beaten by one is to cast dishonor on the family.

****** And Hermione physically attacks Ron multiple times in the series and they end up married, actually /in/ canon. As I said in my post yesterday on the issue, setting the story in an AU automatically nixes a lot of those actions by butterflying them away or adding detail to show there was e.g. coercion involved - which to me is one of the reasons fanfic, for any fandom, is so compelling.

I subscribe to the theory that hermione was holding a bit of a candle turned torch for harry and he was far too dense/emotionally stunted to see it, ever since he saved her life, and sat by her side while she was petrified

Although that's a bit of headcanon mixing with canon, cause I definitely don't see JK thinking that through.

but most drarry either are toxic or require one character to be changed to hell and back

and most snarry takes place in the present day where Snape is still simping for a girl who died indirectly because of him, and is the boy's mother. Which means, at least an 18 years difference.

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

I don't mind MHA slash, I don't mind Naruto slash, but I kinda hate HP slash.

Draco, Severus, Tom, Bill, Charlie. It's all kinda fucked up. I don't want to read Deku/Shigaraki, I don't want to read Naruto/Orochimaru.

If the main Slash pairing was Harry/Ron, or Fred, George, Seamus, Dean, or whatever else, then there wouldn't be as much hate for the genre in the HP fandom. But the three main slash ships are Snarry, Drarry and fucking Harry/Riddle.

​

Also, about the "But harry isn't Bi/gay" argument. I refuse to read any Dumbledore or Weasley bashing fics, because I think they're not based on anything in canon. I also don't read "Dark/Grey Harry". Sure, it's fanfic, but it's changing details that I don't like to see changed.\\
So, not wanting to change a character's sexuality in fanfic is just as valid a opinion as not wanting bashing fics, or not wanting "dark harry" fics.

***** That's not what the mods are doing.

They banned a frequently used word with zero warning to appeal to an extreme minority.

They banned the word “trap”.

The word is common in anime circles and is used to describe female appearing male characters, it is not used to describe trans people.

After the first wave of backlash, instead of the mods doing their job and actually listening to what people want, they instead insulted their users and said that they wouldn't roll back the rule.

Throughout all of this, the mods have been doing shady stuff.

The mods secretly changed the rules to allow them to ban lurkers.

The mods went to other subs to complain about the backlash, painting an utterly one sided picture so that people would come to the sub and defend the decision.

The mods initial post about the rule change was set to contest mode so it would be impossible to see how the user base actually felt about the change.

The mods follow up post had the comments disabled.

The mods have started to artificially shadowban users by using a bot, users are now doing constant shadowban checks.

The actual ban of the word itself broke their own rule concerning current politics.

A new subreddit was created for those leaving the sub, the mods banned the name of it.

The mods are on a high horse and refuse to listen to their users.

They aren't doing what they should, they aren't following their own responsibilities.

It's not just the ban of the word itself that's got everyone riled up, it's the response of the mods.

I can see him with males and females alike, so why on this reddit liking something like Harry/McGonagall, Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Bellatrix, or whatever okay, but liking Harry/Snape, Harry/Draco or whatever wrong?

It's called fiction, we can use the characters in ways that the creator hadn't intended.

Not all slash is smut, not all slash is bad. If it's just a preference thing, that's one thing, but if you never tried to read it, or such, that can be considered homophobic.

I see people be like I'm fine with all pairings, just not slash. So what? Harry/McGonagall, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Bellatrix is okay, but anyone in a slash pairing is wrong? That's why people think they're homophobic.

Edit: Also Daphne is a made up character, with nothing more then a name attached to her, Draco is an established character. There's a huge difference between them.

*** "but if you never tried to read it, or such, that can be considered homophobic" You see, I really have nothing against gays in real life, but I never could read slash. When I started reading fanfiction I heavily avoided slash because I knew I wouldnt like it but a friend of mine said I should give it a go at least. I read a fic where the MC was gay but the relationship was very background. I found it way more disgusting than I tought I would. I always project hard into the character I read about so this was really not something for me. Anyway, where Im going with this, is that yes, you can in fact know you wont like slash before you try reading it and no, it shouldnt be considered homophobic. Another thing, even though Daphne is pretty much a non-existent character, there is still more of a chance Harry would end up with her than someone he's pretty much hard wired to hate like Draco.

When a MC of the opposite sex to you is in a heterosexual relationship do you feel disgusted? Because you can't relate to them?

If you feel disgusted at two same sex charaters having a background relationship, you have to think why that is. You say you have nothing against the "gays" but you use a term that makes us sound other, different, something you can't understand.

Say you find a fic that is perfect for you. You read it, two charaters are perfectly suited for one another and they end up together and it compliments the story being told. If that romance was slash, are you saying it would disgust you?

If you're disgusted by two consenting people finding love with eachother, you need to wonder if the prejudice in the world you've been brought up in, where 72 countries see it has breaking the law, has shaped you.

Not all MCs I read will act like I do, in fact, most of them wont but it only really matters to me when huge things like gender and sexuality are involved. Why is that? No idea I just dont like them. Also, I think I should reiterate something. Ive been using the word disgusting very liberately and should probably change it to uncomfortable. It used to disgust me but the number of disturbing things Ive seen on the internet pushed it out of this category. For your "the gays are different than me" point. Does having 3 gay friends count to disprove that? Not sure. Also Im pretty sure my favourite cousin is gay yet it doesnt really faze me, does that count for something? I really couldnt care less for what turns you on I just dont like reading about 2 male characters, people that could be the equivalent of me and my friends.

Ron not being a jealous berk is out of character. Hermione having proper social skills is out of character. Harry being remotely interested in self improvement is out of character. Almost every fic involves people being out of their canon character in some way.

Hell most fanfiction has Harry be OOC anyway because they have him be a super proactive Protagonist when he has never really been one, Harry's a reactive Protagonist who tends to wait for something to happen before he acts, at least in the first 5 books.

A disturbingly large chunk of the fandom is disgusted by slash because a disturbingly large chunk of the slash fandom consists of H/Snape, H/Draco, H/Voldemort, H/Lucius.

** Not wanting a single queer couple anywhere in the story is homophobic. Not wanting the main characters to be queer is a personal preference to some extent but it's also privilege. If you're straight and you get frustrated by the amount of slash fic in the fandom, imagine being queer and going into a regular bookshop. It's so much worse. If queer people only read queer literature they'd struggle to find books and miss out on classics. Imagine if someone said ‘oh I haven't read any Jane Austen because I don't read books where the main couple is straight' that's what it's like if you won't read some of the best fics in the fandom because the main couple is queer. (To be clear, not liking a certain couple is fine “I started reading pride and prejudice but I didn't like Mr Darcy so I stopped reading”)

The fics that make me the most uncomfortable are the ones where EVERY. SINGLE. CHARACTER. has to be paired off by the end of the story and all in het relationships. To me that screams homophobic author.

Personally, I frequently start gen series that start in first year without checking what the pairings are going to be because if it's written well enough then the couple should make sense by the time they get together.

JKR /literally/ modeled him as a Hitler Youth, you can see it in the movies.

He never shows anything other than bigotry, hatred, and only backs off out of self-preservation.

He basically turned to the whole school and said something to the effect of "And you will be next -perjorative term equivalent to whatever the nazis called jews-"

As he grew up he only got worse, he supported Voldemort, the genocidal maniac, from the beginning, he knew his goals and actively went with them, he only started backing off when he realized he and his family could be in danger too.

People say he was feeling guilty in the sixth book, but all evidence points he was only afraid of failing and being punished by Voldemort.

AFAIK he had no redeeming qualities, at all.

I enjoy some fics where Harry befriends him, either by turning him into a decent person when he's young or when the Malfoys are not evil.

But I know that's just a different Draco, practically an OC with almost nothing of the actual character.

At least explain why he's different.

It's almost the same thing with Daphne, BUT, she's not defined in the books, so she's a blank slate and the author can write her as anything they want.

If you want a believable Malfoy romance, you need to diverge so early and in such a way that Malfoy is unrecognisable and basically an OC as well (I outlined two possibilities once). So you might as well go with Daphne and spare yourself the mental gymanstics.

***** I'm sorry, but Drarry is my original fic love from when I was a teen, and I can't give it up! Admittedly I read other ships these days anyway, and rarely anything with Harry himself in it. But I've seen so many good fics with Drarry.

I think part of it is that a lot of great Drarry fics came out before book 6 and 7 did. Draco was more redeemable when he was just the school bully and not Death Eater Jr.; you make a great point about how what he did to Katie is a crime that should put him in jail, and I totally agree. Nonetheless, my love for Drarry remains and I still find good fics with this pairing.

If you ask me, having Draco turn good isn't the biggest trouble with any Drarry fic; the dude is clearly a coward and terrified of Voldemort, after all. The biggest “leap of faith”, “suspend disbelief” that Drarry fics ask from readers, IMHO, is the idea that Draco Malfoy could be handsome and tall and muscular, rather than a weaselly skinny pale kid. But, many fanfics ask this (Ron, Harry etc. aren't known for being handsome, Hermione isn't a hottie, etc.) so, in that sense Drarry isn't as different from other ships as you might think. :)

I used to read her fic in my highschool computer class secretly, after finishing the assignment.

Yeah, Felton only increases fanfic power. I certainly had a crush on him watching the films as a kid so, that didn't help matters. After seeing Felton, it's easy to imagine a handsome Draco Malfoy for any fic in any ship he's in.

this includes Harry's (who goes by a different name) best friend as well as his mentor (defacto king of the vampires and inventor of that universe's version of Blood Magic and Necromancy).

Yes. Spoiler alert: there's not a gay person like that out there. We've all been inundated with near unceasing het romances in fiction our entire lives (forced down our throats, if you will). Everyone is very much used to them and quite capable of dealing with them without the instinctive dislike so common in reverse.

It's not a question of demographics. A movie with a black main character isn't meant just for black people, any more than a story with a gay main character should be restricted to gay readers.

I'm actually heavily interested in seeing other slash couples in a story as I find they provide an enjoyable addition to the story. But it just doesn't catch my attention if it's the main character. Same reason I will often ignore fics not focused on a main character of a series (in this case harry). I've seen some really well recieved fics with "side characters" being the main focus but I find them easy to skip over. I really don't think that needs a rationalization. The idea that I could be called homophobic because I just haven't put my personal reading time into a story that hasn't caught my attention is really baffling and off putting. Similarly, down voting a post or fiction rec because its slash is stupid. The arbitrary hatred (and attempted perpetuation of said hatred) is quite firmly homophobia. One day it might just click and I finally decide to pick up the slash side of Fandom but if I do or don't I really don't understand what business it is of anybody else what I read or don't read regardless of how well its written or how mutally agreed upon its greatness is.

I'll usually avoid weird pairing stories because as soon as you see something like Harry/Dumbledore you know it's going to be bad. But I'll read a story where two people get together in a realistic way - and I don't care if it's m/f, m/m, f/f or anything that adds extra "f"s or "m"s *as long as it's written well*.

Having said that, I do tend to dislike most Gay!Harry stories but because they're shit - not because of the idea. Irritatingly, my go-to story for explaining why seems to have been deleted. It was by "Athey" and was great except when Harry tortured Skeeter to death but that was okay because... reasons. Everything in that story basically broke because of that.

** My thoughts on slash: this is one of the worst fandoms for popular slash pairings because of how uncomfortable they are to read. With the exception of Wolfstar, the popular slash ships all involve Death Eaters. Similarly problematic are a lot of Hermione's ships. The good thing for me though is that outside of those DE slash ships, the stuff is pretty good. The characters tend to remain mostly themselves without dissolving into mushy gay caricatures, a problem I've found with a lot of BNHA fics. Harry/Ron and Harry/Neville are excellent ships.

** My reason for avoiding slash here is different. I specifically avoid slash on the HP fandom despite reading it in other fandoms because here, it tends to be one of two things: either having the romance completely overshadow the plot (drarry), or sounding like it's written by a sex offender (65 y/o voldemort possissively petting 12 y/o Harry, anyone? Or worse, "You just think you're straight and I'll molest you until you change your mind"). Like I just don't get what it is with this particular fandom. Obviously there are some good slash fics, but if I went through my entire stash of links I'd probably be able to count ones I bookmarked on my fingers, and only one comes to mind right away.

***** oof not on ffnet (as in ways to find fics). And off the top of my head I can't think of much slash on there other than

there's a lot of good slash on ao3 and with the tagging system it can be a lot easier.

and you know I'm scrolling through my bookmarks and there is often ust for at least a little, but I just had a thought. it might be because a lot of queer people (and just general poly people of every orientation) reeeeeally dislike the love triangle trope, which JK used and is found in a lot of het stories, so perhaps there is a grain of truth about it being used a lot in slash.

Writers need to create some tension if it's not just jump straighg in bed, but I tend not to like when it's dramatically drawn out for fifty one chapters either lmao'

also, at least in the world of sapphic love...we're pretty useless at asking one another out for various valid and also sometimes stupid reasons.

ok so is one that I read recently that is pretty cute. Sorry it does have sex in it, so if you're not into sex scenes I can keep trawling for another that doesn't. It is femslash with background but still very present slash

***** I don't read them because the ones I've come across are pretty bad. Maybe some are good, I wouldn't doubt that there are some that are well-written, but like I said, I don't like most if the popular pairings.

Not interested in Drarry, I've seen very few fics that do Draco well in general fanfic. Don't like him in canon and I don't think any fic would make that work without going down a Draco in Leather Pants trope or make Harry a Death Eater sympathizer, and I just don't think the pairing works at all.

Wolfstar I'm cool with, but I'm not really interested in Marauder-era fics so I generally see it as a background ship set when Harry's at Hogwarts.

I also don't look for Dumbledore/Grindewald fics as I'm not interested in that generation or their relationship, but I could see that being decent.

Snape is a vile creature and I don't support shipping him with any of the main cast. You'd have to drastically change his character to make it work, making him an OC with Snape's name, or have a really fucked up relationship between him and whoever you pair him with. The only way I see him paired with anyone is if it's someone outside of the main cast, and even then I have my doubts about how well that would work considering how much of an obsessive creep he is towards Lily. Ultimately canon Snape doesn't deserve a happy ending and all of the parts of him that make him a good character vet stripped away when people go the DH route of making him a "nice guy" all along.

***** This is true, A lot of Romance in general seems to be written by people who have never really been in a relationship

***** Yeah, a lot of slash is written by straight girls in their teens or twenties. Stuff written by actual queer people is generally better.

**** Because almost all of them have to go through huge hoops inorder to sexualize non sexualized characters. There was only one fic that i enjoyed that was a slash TMR / HP but the main character was a necromancer who was developed as thw past lover of TMR and reincarnated into HP. I care way more about the magic of the world than petty sexual pairings. HP verse didnt even delve into relationships so that isnt part of the story i focus on. I care about magic. ppl can downvote me its fine. Easy way to filter most bad stories is to look at pairings and keep scrolling

** There are three reasons to dislike slash for me. First, I don't like characters behaving OOC. Most characters in most books are heterosexual. So, most slash fics contain an OOC behavior. The second is that while you can to filter out all the slash in search results, there are no option to exclude all slash fics *except* the ones from specifically chosen authors or with specifically chosen keywords, so the only option is to search for them manually. It's very annoying. Third, some authors are forgetting to use tags properly so you can didn't find a good fic while searching for gen only (or het, or gen and het) because it's didn't labeled as gen, het or slash at all. I also want to point out that dropping fic at the smallest hint of slash isn't the same thing as just not being interested in reading slash fics for the slash relationships sake.

*** It's fiction though, we can write them however we please, even if it's not what the author had intended.
