*** As an alternative to veritaserum, you could use the commonly used idea that blood quills are used for contracts. And when Umbridge makes him write out "i will not tell lies" until it sinks in, well, it really does sink in.

Also, re the idea of a potion having a permanent effect, i had the idea that baby Harry fell into a cauldron of felix felisis. Ala Asterix and Obelix, only substituting luck for strength.

** Voldemort has to rely on a really really shitty tattoo-artists for the dark mark, and so every single deatheater ends up with a really horrible snake on his arm that looks like it was drawn by a drunk three year old.

And then we have a trial where the deatheaters are asked to show their arm, but they all refuse, and eventually they either choose to plead guilty rather than showing that embarassing tattoo, or they are forced to show it and everyone just laughs, and a whole chapter of the story is wasted on describing this horribly shitty tattoo in incredible detail.

Harry then starts gaining some new powers, some of which scare people. He dresses up as Dumbledore the next Halloween and has fun doing exactly this- acting all wise and Mysterious while people try to guess who he is (wizard costumes being better than muggle costumes because transfiguration). Later he tries to act calm and gentle like Dumbledore, especially at press conferences, to avoid scaring people who fear he might be turning dark, because Dumbledore was a very powerful wizard but people weren't afraid of him.

Harry and Voldemort are forced to go to France to investigate some disappearances in the region by the wizened minister of magic, Draco Malfoy. Here's a quote:

#+begin_quote
  The goblin leader spoke, running a long pale white tongue over his lips in between his words, "Send out the thief and we will leave the rest of you alive."

  Tom blinked, but answered, "There are no thieves here."

  "The hound would not have alerted us had it not found the scent of a thief, they can smell the crime. If you do not hand him over ... you will die."

  "I really have no idea to whom you refer," Tom replied, shushing Harry with a finger as he tried to speak up.

  The goblin turned his back on them, marching back to the rest of his party. He had barely taken a step when Tom's killing curse hit him between the shoulder blades and he collapsed. Tom looked at the others in the moment of silence which followed.

  "What? He was boring me."

** I had this crazy idea of a conference taking place that decides Harry's life and future. In order to magic to function it needs teen angst. Lots of it! It would be a parody critique about all the bullshit stories that people write. Various members would recommend all sorts of Fanon cliches. Add Veelas, Mary/Gary Stus. All for the sake of ramping up Angst. The more Angs recommendation generates the higher its approval :P PM me I can give you all sorts of bizarre ideas for this if you wish to write that story ;)

Soon, several orphans continue to arrive at the Weasleys with Harry and Neville being the last ones. Also, Luna's dad is killed with her mom so she too lives with the Weasleys.
