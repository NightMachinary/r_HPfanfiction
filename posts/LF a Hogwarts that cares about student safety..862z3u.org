Along the lines of teaching first years shielding spells. Sure they may only have the power to block one spell before they collapse but that might be enough for them to get away from their attackers. Maybe stricter rules are put in place on how students can use their wands. Any wands pointed at another student is considered intent to harm since wands are a weapon. Anything along those lines where the teachers recognize that there is a school full of children with deadly weapons and actually take real steps to keep them from hurting each other. Maybe separation of the older students from the younger completely so there is no chance an older student would have a chance to harm the younger ones.

Probably the most notable one (though this is focused on the basilisk so not entirely your request).

*** in Hogwarts? considering all the other shitty "safety measures" they have, I'd agree.

"don't go into the forbidden forest"

"I'll put a simple lock we teach first years to open on a room with a dog that will eat your face"

"I'll hire Voldemort to teach defense"

etc..
