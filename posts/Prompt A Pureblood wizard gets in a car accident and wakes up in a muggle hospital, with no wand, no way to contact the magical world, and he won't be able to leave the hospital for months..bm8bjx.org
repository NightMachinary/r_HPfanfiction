Since he can't tell anyone about magic and he can't get out of the hospital without magic he'll be stuck and will have to learn to get along with muggles.


** Even without a wand and the spell is completely screwed up, he can do SOMETHING. It's detected magic in the presence of muggles and the obliviators show up to fix it.

** My first though was that most adult magicals should be able to apparate, but then I thought about the lack of wand, and it occured to me that the biggest thing keeping the magical in the hospital, aside from unconsciousness, IV drips of painkillers, or paralysis, would be that the magical would want to recover their personal effects first.

It's probably a violation of the Statute of Secrecy for emergency first responders and medical personnel to so much as lay eyes upon the personal effects of the magical, whether thier wand, or a coin purse with an invisible extension charm, or other such belongings with obvious magic to it. Even if it isn't necessarily against the law, the magical might believe that they can face legal repercussions for "allowing" the muggles to see their personal effects.

(What exactly do hospitals do with the personal effects of patients who are going to stay for months, who were probably injured enough to require some kind of immediate surgery, and whos' next-of-kin couldn't be identified? I imagine that prepping an already-unconscious patient for surgery would necessitate the removal of the patients clothes, probably via scissors, so any trousers, shirt, underpants, waistcoats, etc. are a loss. But what about cloaks, shoes, jewelry, coin-purses, or wands?)

Now, getting injured in a car accident severely enough to need a months-long hospital stay speaks to some very serious injuries. The first month or two might be spent in a coma, or doped up on painkillers and seeing pink hippogryphs on parade. I would expect that some kind of familiarity with the hospital staff would develope through the painkiller-induced haze. The magical would find themselves capable of civil discussions with the medical staff, perhaps to their surprise. The minute that the magical is ambulatory and is allowed to have their personal effects back, they'll be out the door, against medical advice. Even if the medical staff tries to hustle them back into the hospital bed, they'll apparate the minute the medical staff aren't looking.

Despite their adventure in the muggle world being slightly less awful then they feared, they won't be able to bring themselves to fully trust muggle medicine, and will get themselves to a healer at their earliest convenience. They won't really learn much of a lesson, since the healers will probably tell them that magical healing could have done in a few days what the muggle hospital couldn't have done in a few months.
