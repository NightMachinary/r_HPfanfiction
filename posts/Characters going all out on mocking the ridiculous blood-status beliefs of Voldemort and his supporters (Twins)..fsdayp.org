  If your mother is your cousin clap your hands

  If your brother is your cousin clap your hands

  If your brain is all a-flicker

  If your skull is a bit tender

  If your mother is your sister clap your hands

  If your wand gets a bit fuzzy clap your hands

  And if all your aunts go barmy clap your hands

  If you find yourself a-bothered

  By the blood of every other

  If your brother is your father clap your hands

What's on the tin :D.

Seriously, I want to see a fic where Fred and George play Dueling banjos whenever the pureblood slytherins enter the great hall.

** Good prompt. I want to know something though.

How can your brother be your father and your sister be your mother?

***** If your parents were siblings, then your mother is also your aunt and your father is also your uncle, so your brother would technically be your cousin.
