** That godforsaken smut between Hagrid and Hedwig that unironically featured the phrase "Hedwig cooed seductively", which has become a bit of a meme between my friend group

Oh and that one where Hermione puts Rita Skeeters Beetle form inside her

  THIS IS NOT MINE. It began after I got rejected by Signal again, though at the time I had no idea what was happening. Titles and levels suddenly appeared above people's heads and then weird things began to happen, as if I was in a game. And then, I realize I was in a game. But...if my life is a game, I'm going to win it. My name's Jaune Arc and I'm the Gamer. RWBY/The Gamer.

**** You read it too? It is an absolute atrocity. Of all the things that need to be purged from the internet though... it's a very low priority. Although, it is of the case that it is so bad it's good. Maybe.

****** I liked the magical airforce, island, I was twelve and enjoyed the smut much more than I had any right to, but still... Yeah, the one where Harry get's first year hermione pregnant is probably more disturbing now I think about it... No sex actually happens so I don't think it breaks rule 8... I'll link it for the curious. linkffn(8631152)

  When Harry Potter rescued Hermione Granger from the troll, he didn't expect it to complete a ritual that would give him a real family. Hermione Granger, on the other hand, was doomed to loudly regret that rescue laboring under much pain the next July.

** Sparky's Surprise by WizardWriting

Sorry for the cursing that will follow. That fucking thing scarred me. It was good at first, writing and story flow was not so bad, but when Harry and Hermione got home, their son was eaten by the house elf they rescued. The author didn't even have the courtesy to put the right tags. No tags for cannibalism or anything. If you see this fic in AO3 or FFN don't read it.
