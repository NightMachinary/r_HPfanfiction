Hi, please be gentle with me! I'm new to looking for fics. I've binge read HP for the umpteenth time and when I said to a friend it has left me wanting more from the 1970s Hogwarts characters she said I should read fanfic.

I am not having a lot of luck. I have found a lot of fics with Harry and Hermione and them paired with the adults but I am not looking for Harry's era or epilogue stories or Snape getting with Her.

I am interested in what could have happened in the 1970s timeline if something changed. Is there stories where Snape and Lily stayed friends or became involved?

What's best to search for? "Snape and Lily" or does their friendship or relationship have another name or search term that writers use? Thank you for any help and thank you for reading. I'd love to hear any recommendations too if anyone else is a fan.


** At work right now but I'll send links for you when I'm home! Also don't be discouraged if you get grumpy anti-Sev comments here.
