hello i have a question which i would posted on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] but i feel more comfortable posting it here if this not allowed then I will delete it.. my question is how is being half giant physically and mechanical possible with the massive size difference between giants and humans that have troll blood dosnt seem possible for the same reason but is referenced in fanfiction and canon


** Magic. :D

And I don't think people think too hard about it. Half-whatever type characters are a pretty common thing in fiction (eg. Half-Elves in D&D) and people tend to keep that idea without necessarily having an idea of the genetic science or simple anatomical geometry behind it.

** Engorgio charm, pain potions, aphrodisiacs...

When there's a will, there's a way.
