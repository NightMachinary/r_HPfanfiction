***** *Paracelsus*

Paracelsus (; 1493/4 -- 24 September 1541), born Theophrastus von Hohenheim (full name Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim), was a Swiss physician, alchemist, and astrologer of the German Renaissance.He was a pioneer in several aspects of the "medical revolution" of the Renaissance, emphasizing the value of observation in combination with received wisdom. He is credited as the "father of toxicology".He also had a substantial impact as a prophet or diviner, his "Prognostications" being studied by Rosicrucians in the 1700s. Paracelsianism is the early modern medical movement inspired by the study of his works.

** - Albus: white (without lustre) / clear, bright / pale, fair, gray, hoary / (figuratively) favorable, fortunate, auspicious, propitious
- Percival: Possibly related to Welsh Peredur, from ber (“spear, lance”), from Proto-Celtic *beru (“spit”) + dur (“hard metal, steel”)
- Wulfric: wulf "wolf" and ric "rich, powerful"
- Brian: It is possible that the name is derived from an Old Celtic word meaning "high" or "noble"

^{sources: Wikipedia/Wiktionary}

It's very clear: Bright, noble and powerful wolf with a spear.

​

And since I'm at it:

- Tom: Diminutive of Thomas (Aramaic תאומא‎ or תאמא‎ “twin” )
- Marvolo: Does not exist, created only for anagrammatic purposes

... Huh... a small twin who likes puns I guess ?
