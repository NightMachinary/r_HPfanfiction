** wat.

This sounds like horrible premise, but the kid being nicknamed Alien makes me incredibly curious. Was Hermione unfaithful with some non-human, giving the child a halfie look? Or did Harry's superpowerful man-seed overpower Hermione's bookworm genes and magically distort their spawn's appearance? The more I think, the more I wonder.

** You caught my attention and started to read.

The grammar is awful! How do you handle this?!

I do like the plot idea but I couldn't handle it 3 paragraphs in.
