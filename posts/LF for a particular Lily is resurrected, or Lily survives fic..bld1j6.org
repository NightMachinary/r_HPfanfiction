:END:
Lily gets resurrected (or just survives), and then proceeds to go to Severus, this takes place barely before the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry finds out Lily is alive a little after the first task, and is offended that she revealed herself to Snape.


** Do you remember any other details that might help narrow the search down?

** linkao3(Coming Back to You by Animalium) barely started and seemingly inactive, but fits your description.

The author has several fics like this, and has a habit of deleting his/her fics, so if you find something you like, you'd better save it.

EDIT: Naturally, the fic updates the day after I say it's "inactive".

#+begin_quote
  An unexpected reappearance topples everything Severus thought he know about the events of Lord Voldemort's defeat. Everything is put at risk, his position beneath the Dark Lord, his career within the school, and perhaps most importantly, his relationship with Harry Potter.Events in this fic are canon until Goblet of fire. Rating subject to change.
