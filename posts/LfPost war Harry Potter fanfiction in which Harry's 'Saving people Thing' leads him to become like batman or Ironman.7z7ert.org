** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), is exactly doing that. Because Dumbledore was up to his game, Voldemort got dissed early and Harry had it a lot better. He dated around at school, and was very inclined to go into the law and order business after graduation. Hermione, on the other hand, got kicked out of Hogwarts early and literally became the Catwoman.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.
