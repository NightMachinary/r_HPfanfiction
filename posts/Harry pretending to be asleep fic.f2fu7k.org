All I remember from the story was that Hermione somehow ends up in the boys dorm, specifically Harry's bed, in the middle of the night. She practically proceeds to take care of his “needs” while he's asleep. The story goes on to Hermione eventually bringing Parvati, and Lavender if I'm not mistaken, into the mix. Harry wakes up I think during the first incident and pretends to stay asleep while enjoying the girls attention. Anyone know the name of this fanfic?

  After the Death Eater attack at the Quidditch world cup sends Harry into an overworked panic trying to get stronger, Hermione resorts to desperate measures to get him to relax. Namely, secret nightly visits to help him let off some steam, but Harry's not quite as sleepy as he lets on, and Hermione is in for a while slew of surprises to come. Commission for Lord of Bones.
