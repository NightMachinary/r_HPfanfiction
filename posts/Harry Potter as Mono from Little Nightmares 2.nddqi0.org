- Nine-year-old Harry Potter disappears from Number 4, Privet Drive. Maybe he wants an escape, to be somewhere else.

- He winds up in a world where things are stretched out and adults aren't safe and children learn not to talk for they have to survive

- Memories are fuzzy, but he learns and he learns fast. He attracts attention, his eyes are too green, so he dons a paper bag and a coat, muted, so it doesn't stand out

- When he helps a girl escape from a Hunter, he introduces himself as ‘Mono'. From ‘monochrone'. It's a safe thing to be. (Her yellow raincoat is eye-catching and the least safe thing he has ever seen, but he doesn't dare tell Six that)

- Children this old, in this world, have to be magical, to be able to survive this world. As survival-focused as they are, their magic manifests differently. Like Mono being able to swing hammers which should be too heavy for him, and Six lifting a child who weights more or less as much as her

- He accidentally releases the Thin Man, and he tries to help Six before she ultimately gets taken. Because she's his friend, his only friend, and he wants her back

- Six told him he had a saving-people thing, once. Mono thinks it's more of a saving Six thing. And here's a big change: she doesn't let him go when it matters.

- After the Maw, after trying to survive, he's sent back to his world, Six in tow. Can you imagine those two traumatized children having to readjust to a completely different world. A world in which they fit and adults aren't trying to eat them or kill them? (well, not so much the latter but still)

- They would probably take Hogwarts by storm. Let's be honest Six is feral but I can't see her as anything other than Slytherin. Mono is a complete Hufflepuff too.


** Omg yes! I didn't know I need this, but now I really want to read a fic like that.
