* Operation Trans Canon

  :END:
Trans wizards aren't even mentioned in the books or movies. That isn't too surprising, history books used to be the same way. Just like how trans people have been alive throughout history, it stands to reason trans wizards exist too. But who tells their stories if J.K. Rowling doesn't want to?

Why not us, the fans? It's no easy task, and it shouldn't have been left to us in the first place, but considering the situation I think it's the best solution. Fans should establish a new canon for trans people in the wizarding world, trans wizards in particular.

Here are just a few of the many questions left for fans to answer:

- Do the stairs to the girl's dorm of the Gryffindor common room activate for all trans boys? Or do they have to pass as a boy first?
- Can unicorns tell? Could make Care of Magical Creatures awkward for trans witches and wizards who haven't come out yet.
- Is the wizarding world even less tolerant of trans people than muggles? It could explain why they aren't mentioned in the books. Would that mean there's muggle-born trans rights activists at Hogwarts? Arguably just as important as elf liberation.
- Where do trans wizards congregate? Is there a Diagon Alley hidden in Diagon Alley that only trans wizards know about, where you can get specialty goods, spells, and potions?
- Can the sorting hat tell? Has it been secretly helping trans students? Are any of the ghosts/portraits in on it? Did Dumbledore know?

It's pride month, and there's a fresh batch of transphobic tweets from JKR; let's turn this around. If enough fanfiction authors can band together, if we can put our hearts into it, I believe we can establish a new canon for trans people in the wizarding world; one that's strong enough to stand the test of time. In a couple of years the tweets will be old news, but good fanfiction will still be getting reads, and still be offering a sense of belonging. The time to write is now.

Why would they be? Magic makes something trivial like body changes a work of seconds rather than years (eg Polyjuice or Tonks' changes). You would not notice at all that someone was born with different plumbing.

And given that Harry doesn't even know what Hermione's parents are called (or the narrative doesn't name them), why would he notice/why would the narrative focus on some random background character just because they are trans? They make up ~5000 out of a population of 58 million in the UK (less than 0.01%), probably a lot less back when the books were written. There are many groups you ought to represent before that if you aim at a realistic depiction of society.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Based on the numbers above, it is unlikely that there would be more than 5 of them in magical Britain. So it is unlikely that there would be an entire industry centered around them due to a lack of demand.

** To be honest, I'm not sure that trans people would exist in the HP universe. Changing a person's physical sex seems likely to be within the capabilities of magic. It might even be something that a child's accidental magic fixes early on, so that by a certain age all magical people have bodies that match their gender identity.

Here's an explanation of human transfiguration I use in VP:

#+begin_quote
  In the end, it was a good thing that Victoria hadn't tried to attend her classes. Her symptoms only got worse, and Madam Pomfrey was forced to maintain a roaring fire in the hospital wing just to keep her warm. She was on a strict regimen of potions to help manage her symptoms, but as Pomfrey explained, she would have to get better all on her own.

  "Your magic will fight it off, with a bit of rest," she said. "The body of a witch or wizard doesn't much like being transfigured, you see. The disease is trying to turn your bones to stone, but your magic will turn them back faster. When no stone remains, you'll be free to go."

  [...]

  "I've been thinking," Victoria said between reluctant sips, "if all it takes to get better is to transfigure away the stone, why can't someone just do it for me?"

  "Oh, a healer could do exactly that," Madam Pomfrey said. "But then your body wouldn't have learnt how to do it, and you could get infected again. No, best to do it properly and never have to worry about it again."

  Victoria took another sip, grimacing at the taste. "But it would work? You said that transfigurations on a witch don't last..."

  Madam Pomfrey smiled, crows feet appearing around her eyes. She was middle aged, in wizarding terms, which meant she was probably around eighty-years-old. "You're a sharp one, aren't you?" she said. "I misspoke. It's more that your magic will always try to return the body to its proper state. A healer can use transfiguration to help that along, and the magic won't resist it. But if you try to use transfiguration to take a witch out of her proper state..."

  "Your magic will reverse it," Victoria said. It made sense. "So that's why beauty spells don't last?"

  "Just so."
#+end_quote

Under this view of human transfiguration:

1. A person's magic would work to put the body into its proper state, which would be the state which the person's soul believes it should be in.

2. If you are born in a body with the incorrect sex, your magic would fix it (if it doesn't do so while you're in the womb).

3. If you transfigured someone's sex against their will, they would revert to their correct sex. But if you transfigured someone's sex to be what their magic believed to be the body's correct state, then that person's magic would not resist it.

Mostly I developed this theory to explain why wizards don't constantly transfigure themselves to look young and beautiful, but as a byproduct I appear to have eliminated the possibility of trans people within the VP universe.

What might be better would be to create a magical analogue for trans people, something that magic can't fix. This is how the HP books generally approach social issues: blood prejudice for racism, lycanthropy for HIV/AIDS.

*** I guess that makes sense. I'm not sure about a fetus casting magic though. Couldn't the same logic be used to explain that wizards never need glasses? But we know many wizards need glasses (Harry, Luna, Dumbledore, etc.), why didn't their inborn magic 'correct' their eyes?

I think gender/sex might be even more complex than eyesight. It's easier for me to imagine inborn magic slightly reshaping an eye than it is for me to imagine it completely rewriting DNA, transfiguring gonads, etc.

I do like the idea of magic pulling someone's body to the correct state though. Maybe that's something that speeds up when living on campus? Hogwarts is a magical place.

** I'd personally write trans people in as being 100% accepted as a medical situation, and there's a simple medi-magical process to change gender that can be applied when or how the person wants it. And if they want to work through their feelings and thoughts first, mind healers are more than willing to help them work with that. But because its something that can be dealt with through magic, its treated as perfectly normal by society.

A quick potion, maybe some form of human transfiguration, then a few follow up appointments to make sure you're happy with how everything has gone. The potion could even be "If you were born (gender) this is how you would have looked" (designed for prank purposes but then adapted by a muggle born trans wizard in a fit of innovation), and then the spells make it permanent.

For gender fluid folk, they have the option for you to use the potion/spell combination as often as you want. And because of them being used to the idea of people's outward appearing gender changing, they don't have an issue with non-binary folk who have a different form of presentation or address.

I feel like transitioning isn't a huge problem because magic can enable wizards to transition physically completely (maybe with a potion?). Maybe it's not covered in conversations because it's a quick medical procedure.

I think Polyjuice potion changes the drinker to exactly how the impersonated person is. If the Seven Potters needed actual glasses, that indicates that Polyjuice changed their eyesight, so there is no reason to believe it doesn't change any body parts.

Lastly, I think Tonks is very fluid in her identity being a Metamorphmagus.

I agree magic would make transitioning easier, but I still think it would be interesting to read about characters who do it.

Even if the physical changes are just a quick spell, there's still the social aspect of somebody changing their gender. How do their friends react? How is it explained to muggle parents? How is it treated by society? I think there's a lot of room to explore.

** I've read some great trans headcanons, and a few fics where Tonks is intersex/gender-queer. And I've seen some fics with minor original characters pointed out as trans, including one from Snape's POV where he helps a Slytherin student change dorms. But I've never found a full length fic with a trans main character that I personally enjoyed. (I prefer fics where being trans isn't the main plot, but merely acknowledged in an accepting society. Nothing wrong with angst and drama, it's just not my cup of tea.)

I think it'd be a neat subplot to have Harry return to the Wizarding World where everyone's looking for the Girl-Who-Lived. It'd hammer home the point that they haven't seen him since he was a baby. It'd be another reason to resent his celebrity and another reason to love the Wizarding World where Madam Pomphrey can just hand him a potion, where he can say "it's Mister Potter, not Miss" and have everyone respond "got it" without skipping a beat. Another reason to hate the Dursleys where "freaks" don't get haircuts and Harry sneaks Dudley's old clothes out of the bin because even those rags are better than Aunt Petunia's hand-me-downs.
