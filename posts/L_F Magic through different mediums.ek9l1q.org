I was hoping someone could point me in the direction of any fanfics that explore magic through different mediums like music, dance, art, cooking, etc. For example, Dillon's tribal dance shield spell in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]] by Angela Star Cat or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7971405/1/Birth-of-Bardic-Magic][Birth-of-Bardic-Magic]] by Bard of the Glade or that one fanfic I can't name where Lady Zabini is a master songstress and it's represented by bells in her hair. Even in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10278549/1/Intent][Intent]] a Harry Potter/Avengers fanfic where harry infuses magic into his cooking.

Fanfics with skills like compulsion through voice or creature!harry where he's a siren or Veela, etc.

Anything where magic sorta takes on a different form from the usual spell, incantation, and wand or wandless form, but I'm specifically looking to explore magic through music and dance.

Thanks!


** "percy take the wheel" has some interesting hedgewitch and cooking magics
