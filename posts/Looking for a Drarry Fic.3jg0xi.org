Hey, I can't find a fic I've been looking for. Draco and Harry are both starting auror training. Draco has been living with Harry in Grimmauld Place and they've developed a romantic relationship. They break up in the middle due to misunderstanding and end up reconciling in Blaise's apartment against a window... Also Harry is a dog animagus.


** Doesn't sound familiar to me... If you don't get results here I'd try [[http://drarryficfind.livejournal.com][this LJ]] or [[http://accio-hd-fics.livejournal.com][this one]]. Both are really great and helpful communities :)
