:END:
I remember a fic where Harry went to Azkaban on fanfiction.net. I remember him being on the boat going to the mainland where Voldemort wants to kill him, but Harry does so first. Afterwards Harry goes to a hearing and gets asked, “do you know what this means?” And replies with, “7 years for assault on a wizard”


** Sounds familiar, I believe it's the one with Banshees at the title... yes, /Curse of the Banshees/ by Sheyda.

  (Title-changed) AU. GoF. Harry was sent to Azkaban for mass-murder. Now, after defeating Voldemort he returns to Hogwarts and all those who abandoned him. Sorrow can be your downfall or your greatest strength. And banshees are just the beginning.
