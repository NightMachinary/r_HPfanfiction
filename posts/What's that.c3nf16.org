:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
this is going to be big

It's harmony not sure which year it happens these are the things I remember in the fic

1. Harry has visions from Voldemort, so he and Dumbledore do something with their finger nails where they pull it out painfully and put it back in after some spell which allows them to communicate with each other instantly and Harry tells Dumbledore when Voldemort's about to attack someone

2. Harry helps Vernon repair his vintage car Inturn Vernon helps harry rebuild Sirius's bike by getting him the parts

3. Harry starts smoking weed or drinking alcohol due the visions and Hermione finds this out while hiding in his room cause she wanted to surprise him

4. In Hogwarts while having breakfast one day Hermione out of the blue asks Ron if he wants to have sex with her and instantly realises her mistake and before she embarasses herself further Fred and George help her out of the situation by asking everyone in the table the same thing

So these are the things I remember in the fic...it wasn't a completed fic...so does any of the above the ring any bells ???
