I am looking for *long* fanfic stories where Harry is out in the world *mixing Magic and Muggle together*, like in Investigator Harry Steel, he drives cars, shoots guns, but they still use portkeys and shrink the cars, etc.

Crossovers and AU's are fine, any rating is fine. I normally don't look for stories under 80k words. Doesn't have to have romance, but *No Slash.*

Harry should be at least neutral (*not dark/evil*) I prefer a Harry who actually cares about others, no "doesn't affect me" attitudes..

Obviously from saying I like when magic and tech mixes, I'm fine with it not following canon rules about electronics, or the story has shielding runes or whatever..

Perhaps the weirdest part of the request: I don't really care if Harry has an enemy in the story.. I don't want the focus to be on Harry vs Evil Overlord or anything.. I am thinking more like: if James Bond had Magic, he'd know he wouldn't need to worry about most of the issues normal people do.. Like chasing down a bad guy -> just throw a tracker on him and get him later. I guess at that point I don't care if the story is complete or not, since there's not a "final boss" to defeat.. (it's fine if there actually is, as long as it's not the main focus of the story?)

This is my first request, (first reddit post actually) so, sorry if it's not all correct, I just thought I'd give it a try. Also even though I posted this on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]], I guess if there's any stories similar to what I am looking for that aren't about HP, that would be cool too, just seems like Harry would be best choice for Magical MC.
