:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I took a screenshot of a fic a few years ago because it amused me. I have tried all sorts of Google searches to find what fic it was, with no success. The excerpt follows:

"So Minerva was quite ready to defend Potter on that aspect with the fierceness of a lion. Only apparently she needn't have worried. She wasn't sure, because the damned picture was everywhere but apparently Harry's expression of extreme disinterest (the picture almost looked muggle because he wasn't moving) had sparked more humour than derision.

Madam Pince complained that somebody kept hanging the picture in the aisles of the library with a text reading

"Potter is not impressed with your work” And “You call that an Essay?" and according to the prefects most bathroom stalls had the photo too. Harry Potter judging you while you took a leak."

Thanks in advance for any help!


** Brushed off this old account for this. Putting a phrase in quotes will make Google search for exact matches. Some sleuthing gave this chapter of The Meaning of Dandelions by Endrina.

*** I just finished a reread of this series yesterday, and yep, this is it! One of my favorites.

Edit: seriously, the socialist revolution subplot at Hogwarts is hilarious.

*** Thanks so much! I tried putting different bits in quotes but wasn't getting anything back for some reason.

#+begin_quote
  The stupid hat was stupid and refused to help Harry. The whole school and its division in houses was stupid too, and the teachers.Harry was in Hogwarts, but he didn't want to be. He wanted to go back home.
