My niece turned 11 earlier this year, and was finally able to read Harry Potter. She finished the series twice in a month. And now wants to read fanfiction. My sister knows that I also read fanfiction so I am in charge of curating her collection. I was thinking of starting her with missing moments fics. Most of what I read of that type are older and on different sites than AO3 and FF.net. So I'd like suggestions from those sites please. Rated G or PG please.

Thanks


** There's a chunk here. Mostly from the same authors. Most are one shots. Sally Anne and Wizards Gambit are longer.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks]]) is also good for a young reader. It reads a lot like the early books. A mystery story.

If your neice (or you) watch Doctor Who, this was also a fun adventure story, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/]])

Then linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13854078/1/Ornamental-Precautions]]) is the Staffroom discussing how to set up the Philosophers stones tasks.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13843320/1/Osiris-Grain]]) is Bill Weasley having a curse breaking cave adventure

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13873728/1/To-Hell-and-Back]]) is Minister Fudge going to Azkaban and seeing Sirius Black.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28794234/comments/424569203]]) is Ron and Harry playing chess together over 7 years.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30427758]]) are Letters Charlie Weasley wrote home over the course of HP.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13788122/1/Lessons-in-Parseltongue]]) is Harry teaching Ron how to speak Parseltongue

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13779576/1/Independent-of-Time]]) is the Marauders talking the Map.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13772250/1/Dorm-Rule-Number-79]]) is James turning into a deer in the dorm and Remus getting mad at him.

No idea if these are any use to you? But maybe? I find oneshots are generally more PG and 11 year old friendly so I just hoofed a bunch at you there.

*** Thank you! I've been reading for so long I almost panicked so I thought back to my early days and had the same thoughts about one shots. I will check these out.

  Harry accidently gets good at chess after playing Ron for 6 years. Pity he doesn't even notice.All the chess matches are real and linked in the fic for you to follow along for context since, as it turns out, writing chess is bloody difficult!

** Hmmm...Missing Moments....I think I can help:

*One-shots*

- [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] might be my favorite one-shot for Harry Potter ever. This is Luna and Ginny's friendship and Ginny's musings therein. Absolutely wonderful. A beautiful story of platonic love.

Virtually anything by Realmer06 but my favorites are as follows:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740311/1/A-Molly-Weasley-Tradition][A Molly Weasley Tradition]] is focused on Molly and Molly II (Percy's eldest) and the Christmas jumpers.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12252431/1/Pawn-to-C3][Pawn to C3]] has Ron teaching Lily Luna how to play chess...and she takes to it like a fish to water.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8035006/1/The-Noticing-of-Lucy-Weasley][The Noticing of Lucy Weasley]] shows Percy's dynamic with his younger daughter--soft-spoken, awkward Lucy who idolizes her pencil-pushing daddy. There is a little bit of coarse language in this one--but no worse than a latter book in canon.

--------------

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7721379/1/The-Burn-of-the-Phoenix][The Burn of the Phoenix]] is one of the saddest stories I've ever read--Harry perishes at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. Dudley attends his funeral. But darn it, it is beautiful.

*Long-fics*

You may want to read this one first, but I love /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection./

This is Luna's perspective of the events of /Order of the Phoenix,/ and it's wondrous. Luna is delightfully odd, possibly insane, but also driven to search for the truth and maybe find a friend.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”
