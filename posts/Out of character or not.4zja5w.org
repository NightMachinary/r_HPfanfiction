** If nothing else, I would find it OOC for him to do something like that out in the open where any passer-by can see. He is a Death Eater, then, and later becomes an excellent spy. He has to have at least some amount of subtlety and situational awareness.

I would find it kind of OOC for him to do it at all, but if he did, he at least wouldn't Polyjuice the girl until he was somewhere private.

** I think it's out of character for him to be going somewhere like that in any context that would risk him being caught/seen. In canon he's rather reserved regarding his personal life- we see his attitudes and behavior, but it took finding out from other people, or a pensieve, to find out why.

As for the polyjuice part, ehhhh. As much as I dislike Snape, his draw to Lily was on an emotional attachment level, not so much a get your rocks off level. That's not to say I can't see him doing something like this, but I think that doing so would cause him pain and he'd quickly call it quits.

*** Snape, unfortunately, wasn't drawn to her because of an emotional attachment.

#+begin_quote
  "Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?"

  Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair.

  "No," he said. "It doesn't make any difference."

  "Good," said Lily, relaxing: it was clear that she had been worrying.

  "You've got loads of magic," said Snape. "I saw that. All the time I was watching you ..."

  His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground.
#+end_quote

(DH, ch 33)

Snape was a selfish child, just as much as he was a selfish adult. He was the one that created the initial wedge between Petunia and Lily, and the one that encouraged Lily to disassociate herself from her sister. He showed controlling and manipulative behavior (eg telling her he "wouldn't let her" be with James Potter) from the time they met to the time he called her a mudblood . All the proof is right there in the memories he gave to Harry.

** I think it's pretty unlikely that anyone with as avoidant and depressed a personality as Snape's would solicit a hooker, much less make her look like Lily. I say this for three reasons:

1) Snape wouldn't just want to fuck Lily. He'd want it to be real. Contrary to popular belief, he never shows that he wants to use Lily for her body. He loves her and then, after their friendship ends, he pedestals her. After she dies, he basically saints her. He wouldn't want some dirty hooker (who is the lowest form of sex worker) to look like her. It would make him sick.

2) I imagine that his Death Eater friends would hook him up with a higher class sort of sexual encounter if he showed any interest in it. Most were wealthy and high class and wanted to show off.

3) Snape is a private, self hating and brooding sort of guy. I don't think he'd want to do much more than wank off if the alternative was interpersonal sex with a stranger. He's really fucking damaged and not good at relating to anyone. Where the whole "lothario Snape" trope came from, I shall never know, but it seems weird from what we see of him in canon.

*** I dunno man, I feel like if Snape really loved Lily he wouldn't have: deliberately pushed her away from Petunia, tried to control who she was friends with, willing to let her husband and son die just so he could have her. And then probably not bully her son for more than half a decade afterwards...

That's not real to me. That's a stalker's obsession.

I think to Snape, Lily was always an object. He always had muggleborn prejudice in him, and more of a prejudice towards muggles. Lily is the only one he associated with because of whatever fascination he had with her as a child. In Snape's memories that Harry watched, JKR uses the word "greed" many times to describe how Snape looks at Lily. I think her usage of the word was very deliberate.

**** I don't honestly think that your reading comprehension level is high enough to understand a messy, complicated and often unpleasant/wrongly acting character like Snape, so I think you would do well to avoid writing his character.

He's mean and nasty and has terrible people skills. He can't socialize well because of obvious neglect and poverty. I'd say he also suffers from clinical depression, which is obviously not treated.

But he still actually loved Lily in a real way. I mean, I'm not really sure how many times JK Rowling has to explicitly say it before people will believe it.

Meanwhile, there's an actual canon quote from James trying to force Lily into dating him by saying he'd stop beating up on Snape. That's shitty to say to someone, I hope you know: "date me and I'll stop hurting your friend."

But I still don't think that James was some horrible irredeemable guy. People screw up. Kids act possessively and immature.

But Snape was literally chained to a shitty job he hated and literally died in his efforts to keep Harry safe and defeat Voldemort. He had to be antagonistic towards Harry. If he wasn't, he'd have no good excuse not to be like "Pip pip Harry, my buddy! Come along to an easy and series ending death at the hand of old Voldy!"

And if you can't understand the complexity of a character that can be awkward and ugly and shitty at relating to other people and still does heroic things for noble reasons, then you really shouldn't be writing him.

***** I'm not convinced that you understand him all that well yourself. It seems to me that you're basing your analysis more on what you want Snape to be - the version that a certain genre of angst writers are in love with - rather than what he was presented as being.

Snape's social skills are perfectly fine. He gets on well with people he wants to get on well with, such as the Malfoys. See, for example, how he interacts with Narcissa at the start of HBP. His treating people like shit isn't poor social skills, it's a choice.

Snape was not chained to a shitty job he hated, nor did he have to be antagonistic towards Harry (especially not for the reason oft-quoted by the fandom, that of maintaining his cover, which completely misunderstands the nature of his double-agency). Snape was at Hogwarts because he wanted to be there, and he was antagonistic towards Harry because it gave him sadistic pleasure.

I think there are three key aspects of Snape's character you're missing.

Firstly, that his loyalty to Lily never transferred to Harry. That's why he treats Harry like shit. Keeping Harry alive is an obligation he feels he has to Lily, but at no time does he come close to actually caring for Harry. That's what the doe Patronus and "Always" means, when Dumbledore asks Snape if he has come to care for Harry: Snape is showing Dumbledore that everything he is doing is still for Lily, not for Harry. By all appearances he genuinely hates Harry.

Secondly, that Snape's motivation was personal not ideological. There's no evidence that Snape ever actually disagreed with Voldemort on an ideological level. He merely wants vengeance for Lily. Snape prefers to associate with Pureblood supremacists as friends, both before and after Lily's death, and indeed they seem to be the only people whose company he genuinely enjoys. Similarly, even after switching sides he continues to like the Dark Arts - "loving" was how Harry described his approach to them. Further, his casual, everyday cruelty, especially towards Muggleborns like Hermione, indicates that he hasn't absorbed any of Lily's world view. He has committed himself to her side of the conflict out of personal loyalty, but his world view appears to remain bigoted and sadistic.

Thirdly, that Snape's love for Lily is not pure. It is a selfish, obsessive love. It is no coincidence that Slughorn's warning about the power of obsessive love comes in Half-Blood Prince, the book largely about Snape. Yes, Snape loved Lily, but it was not love as you and I know it. He wanted Lily as a possession, not as a person. He cared nothing for her desires or beliefs. He was happy for James and Harry to die so that he could have her, and his continued maltreatment of her son years later indicates nothing has changed on this front. Treating the child of the person you love with such hatred and cruelty is completely incompatible with that love being wholesome or "noble". Many people would hesitate to call it love at all, but I would say that love can become a twisted and even evil thing in the right context.

JK Rowling has called Snape a hero, and she's had Harry do the same, but JK Rowling's personal philosophy (which is projected onto Harry) is one that allows a huge amount of moral leeway for actions motivated by love.

Snape's actions are canon. JK Rowling's moral beliefs about the status of those actions are not. She and Harry may call him a hero, but to me he has always seemed merely someone whose selfish and distasteful motivations conveniently line up with the good of the wizarding world.

***** Sounds way overblown. Complex character and all that doesn't change the fact that he was a child-abusing teacher who joined a bunch of mass-murdering racists in the full knowledge that they wanted to kill Lily just for being born.

I don't really get how people think Snape had to be nasty to Harry as his cover as a spy - do you honestly think that a double-agent in the British intelligence services would be loudly repeating communist propaganda in the break room so Moscow would think he was a staunch spy for them?

That's not how it works, duh.

I've got an easier take on Snape: He hates everyone, including himself. He just hates Voldemort more than anyone else. Neatly explains his whole behaviour.

****** Okay.... Well. You're allowed to write characters OOC, so feel free to write Snape sneering and twirling his mustache while he dances the can can with hookers or whatnot, but it's still OOC.

He's written as damn near asexual in all the books but the second you put the word love next to an opposite sex character, somehow it has to be gross and perverted.

I have a BA as well. Doesn't mean your ability to read and write a character as canon would is at all high quality.

Am I bitter that people act like Snape is this gross pervert and often fangirl on goddamn Voldemort more? Yes. Yes I am.

But if you're determined to write a flat character for shock value, far be it from me to stop you.

** Well, as someone else has also commented on the story I wrote once about Metamorphmagus hooker Tonks and Snape (a disaster), I don't think Snape retreats in this sort of roleplay fantasy. I think he doesn't care for a mere illusion and he seems to hate people in general, so I don't see why he would make an exception for hookers. That hooker will never be Lily, so I think that such an experience is actually painful, not pleasurable, unless Snape was so shallow as to only care about her looks, which I don't think. I also don't think Snape thinks he deserves Lily. I think he's very aware that his chance for love has passed, otherwise why would he still have a grudge against James?

** Hmm. Interesting problem. Let's think about it.

First I'd point out that for the Snape we came to know, yes, it sounds incredibly out of character. The Lily he was attached to was nothing more than a memory he had the upmost respect for.

But, BUT! THere's other things to consider here. Namely the fact that we're talking about 17 year old Snape. Who, as much of a bastard as he may be, has more hormonal activity going on than our Snape ever had. There's the fact that Lily is still alive, so there's no excessive disrespect happening or anything.

Honestly, I can see it happen. Frankly, the most unbelieavable part of it is the fact that he's just strolling down Diagon Alley with her. I'd think he'd be inteligent enough not to be seen by anyone.

** Ehhh. Maybe. I don't think he'd really see it as creepy or amoral the way James and Lily would, but I also don't know that he'd find it appealing. His interest in her had a lot to do with their history together, her magic and her friendship. I doubt he'd be able to immerse himself enough in the fantasy to be able to enjoy sex with her double. On the other hand, he might try it once before realizing that.

The real trouble is in the details. I doubt there's a love hotel within sight of the Quidditch store, and Snape wouldn't parade around with someone polyjuiced without some very careful planning. And definitely not in Diagon. You'd be better off with James needing something just questionable enough to go to knockturn, and some way for him to see them together that's more believable.
