I'm looking for new Harry/Ginny stories from the last 18 months or so. No need to mention stories by Pottermum or Brennus. Thanks.


** This is a fun post-DH one-shot. Linkffn(12085475). Featuring a reunited Harry and Ginny.

The same author has a number of post canon fics that have Harry and Ginny in the background. They are cursed child compliant they don't focus on the events in the play.

***** Yes, so? The average quality is still higher than on FFN. It's basically like any collection of 'above average' fics - sure, you can find them anywhere, but they are easier to find there.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12310652/1/Hiding-in-Plain-Sight][Hiding in Plain Sight]], linkffn(12310652), is an interesting alt Year 7 H/G story. I haven't read the whole thing yet, but I believe Horcruxes were not hidden in canon locations and Grindelwald would get involved.

  When the Weasley wedding is attacked, Harry grabs the first hand that comes to mind - Ginny's. They find Voldemort has hidden his Horcruxes in plain sight out of some of Muggle history's most important artifacts. Now the pair go across the continent, risking capture by both the Muggle and wizarding worlds, to end the war. Post-HBP. AU. It's JKR's world. We just get a sandbox.
