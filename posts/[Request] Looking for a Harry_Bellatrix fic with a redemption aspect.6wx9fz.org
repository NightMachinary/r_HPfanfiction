** Off the top of my head, I remember these. Do be aware that the only Harry/Bellatrix story the community likes is Delenda Est. Otherwise asking for the pairing gets you some tasty downvotes. I'm not a huge fan of Delenda Est's plot though. Watching Over Harry has mediocre writing at times but the plot is decent enough. Earl of the North was written by the same author as Delenda Est, it's a lot shittier. I haven't read all of Passageways, but I liked what I read. I'd say give it a read first.

*** If you change Bella story so she isnt a Death eater it's not really a redemption story. Earl of the north meets the requierement but it is pretty bad

**** I don't think bad sums up just how bad Earl of the North really is. When I originally read it a while back I wasn't so jaded to poorly written stories. I tried reading it back in May and I couldn't even finish the first chapter.

***** I'm not sure it's even possible to write a good redemption story on Bella. It might be possible for the Malfoy but Bella is too far gone imo.

****** I think you can write a good redemption story for any character. Some are a lot harder to write though, assuming that you are mostly using the canon scope information, and not AU characterization.

****** The badder the character, the more painful the redemption has to be.

I think a Bella / Hermione fic did it pretty good once, but I can't find it. In any case, in that fic Bellatrix is a grade A asshole/psycho/sadist. She /is/ Bellatrix at the beginning. Throughout a ton of chapters, the reader eventually sees that this hasn't been just psychopathy. Bellatrix was to a large part shaped to be like she is. From there you have Hermione, helpless in her hostage-situation, trying to strengthen those last remaining, single remnants of Bellatrix' good part in a painful, tedious and often violent process, first out of a need to survive and eventually out of a need to save.

I think the fic was abandoned when the hostage situation ended and Hermione came back to her "normal" life, and I could understand. The fic was 100% built on the interactions of Bellatrix and Hermione.

Eh. Delenda Est isn't much better after the bullshit "travel to the future" part of the story. That was totally unnecessary.

*** A lot of people really don't like Delenda Est, I don't know why. Sure, the second half of the story was less interesting and the climax/finale was rather boring. But the entire first half of the story IMO was fantastic. And I always thought that anything with Bellatrix as a main character would be cringe-worthy or gratuitous. I dunno, but there it worked very good. A bunch of times it felt like the rug was pulled out from under your feet in that first half. I think there are few things wrong with that, from a HP time travel fanfiction standpoint; is it just the second half that turns people off.

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.
