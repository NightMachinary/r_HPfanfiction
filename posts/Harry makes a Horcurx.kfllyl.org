Any good fics out there where Harry decides to make a Horcrux? And please no fics where there suddenly is a moral way to make one.

  Ron and Hermione died due to the events at Malfoy Manor and Harry was on track to join them. Alone and beaten, Harry resorts to the most horrendous magic to try and save his own life and continue the hunt for Voldemort's Horcruxi. An act that would start him on the path to becoming a monster so much greater and more terrible than the one he had set out to destroy.

** The most heart-wrenching example I can think of is linkao3(Blood Crest by Cauchy), where Harry is pressured (by his mentor) into making a horcrux while being sorta-deceived about the full implications (he kills a unicorn, not a human, but we're told this is a moral alternative by a pretty bad dude who lies and obfuscates at other times, so Im not buying it).

The first few chapters are a little rough but it works out.

  Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-   I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?
