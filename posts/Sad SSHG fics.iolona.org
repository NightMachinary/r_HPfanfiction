Don't get me wrong, I love hurt/comfort stories and want the annoyingly smart couple to live happily ever after, but I am an absolute sucker for tragic romance.... or just a tragedy overall, doesn't have to be romance. To give you an idea, here's some works I really like: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7622024/1/House-at-Row-s-Edge]] (SS obliviated HG, and HG recollects their relationship after SS dies - One of my favorite SSHG fics if not the favorite one)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304284/chapters/486496]] (They cross paths years after the war but can't be a part of each other's life )

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7009]] (HG grieves the death of SS)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20511581/chapters/48679898]] (SS survives the war and just when we think the lovely future awaits them....)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5058076]] (HG and ghost SS)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24040924]] (SS trusts HG with his precious book collection. I hesitated to put this one under 'tragedy' but SS dies and there is a warm subtle wistfulness.

So, I am ready to be heartbroken for the star-crossed lovers (lover or not, friends, teacher- student will totally do), over anything: SS dies, both dies, unrequited love, requited love but unable to tell each other...

Plus, its even better if it's non-romantic. Again, I adore this couple but I think there are many more possibilities than just a romantic couple


** Never really read this pairing, but I came across Of Myth and Magic from a different post on here, think it might fit what you're looking for.

  She knew it wasn't good for her, standing here like this, waiting for something that wasn't there to appear. Something spectacular to happen between misnumbered houses. Something to prove that magic was real. Eventual SS/HG. AU with purpose.

** I'm stumbling across this post way late also looking for sad SSHG fics. If you haven't read it yet I would highly recommend Aurette's The Tattered Man. That's what made me, inexplicably, want to read more tragedy.

** I've read this story maybe eight times, a story about SS forming a connection and relationship with HG as he's treating her for a terminal illness during post-DH and her eighth year.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22065178/chapters/52658686]]

You mentioned wanting to be heartbroken - originally this fic was going to end on the second to last scene which makes it highly ambiguous, although the final scene makes it more hopeful. However, when it was a work in progress and she said it had no Happily ever after I was a miserable tap reading it. Couldn't read it at the bus station, personally.

It deals with all the stuff you get with terminal illness very realistically - people telling you to “keep fighting”, people treating you overly nicely, the exhaustion creeping in and the way that others try capitalise on your impending death. The way you have to comfort others because they're so worked up about your death that you don't have time to process it yourself.

It's good. It's very good. It progresses slowly and is full of conflict and Snape is in character, which is to say he's like a feral cat. Defensive, reclusive, curt and slow to warm.
