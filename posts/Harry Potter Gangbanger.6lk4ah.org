Is there a fanfiction where Harry grew up in South Central or Compton and is part of the Crips or Blood Gangs?

  Harry wakes up in a mysterious place after crashing his broomstick, unaware that an old enemy was on his tail. This story uniquely blends Harry Potter's wizard fantasy with African-American/hip-hop culture.
