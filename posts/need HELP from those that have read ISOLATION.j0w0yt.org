Hi!!!!\\
so I'm writing a fanfic (Dramione obv) and the idea is that Draco left after the night of the astronomy tower and Hermione is tasked to find him (together with Blaise Zabini). So after they find him I want to have a period of time where Draco, Hermione and Zabini are obligated to live together one way or another to keep Draco safe. My first idea was for them to have to live in a safe house in the middle of the Muggle world so Blaise and Draco can learn about the Muggle world by Hermione and slowly (very slowly for Draco) learn that there's no reason to feel superior to Muggles BUT I just read Isolation (amazing fanfic def in my top 5) and now I'm scared it's gonna be way too similar SOOO I need your help. Does anyone have an idea on how I could have them live together one way or another so they can start getting to know each other without it being a copy of Isolation, which is not my intention at all.... HELP :)


** “Characters begrudgingly live together and slowly come to understand each other” is in lots of stories (fanfic and otherwise). It's not a bad thing when different writers come up with similar premises. Write your fic.
