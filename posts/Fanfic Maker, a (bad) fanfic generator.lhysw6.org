So are you having trouble writing your fanfic? going through a creative block where words just don't leave your mind for the page? I have the solution.

the fanfic maker can generate a fanfic ready specifically for you, select your fandom, select how much violence and sex you want, distribute the characters in their roles (sidekicks, protagonists, etc.) choose their genre and enjoy.

You can't believe it, here's the fanfic generated by me.

Harry Potter and the Kitchen of secrets:

Today was the day of the big Quidditch contest.

The world championship!

Harry and Ron had made it into the final after a intensive competition which The seeker won easily.

"I am really proud of you Harry! You were amazing!", said Hermione.

"You too the freckled boy you were also reasonable. "

"Gosh thanks the smartest witch of her year" said Ron Weasley

Harry Potter was still practicing Quidditch as they walked along. They were taking a tour of the Quidditch-ing Arena to prepare for the big day tomorrow.

"Oh, look who it is, its the pathetic Harry and his pathetic friends. Your all pathetic! "

It was Voldemort!

"What are you doing here You-know-who?" The seeker said gruffly.

"Why I am here for the contest."

"Wahhhhaa?" said Ron and Hermione.

"Yes I am taking part. I am going to win the world Quidditch medal and there's nothing you pathetic people can do to stop me! "

With that Tom Riddle marched off.

"Tom is taking part in the contest! I didn't know he even did it."

"He didn't. He must have learnt over the summer" said Potter "But....why?" he then queried quizzically.

"I dont know" said Ron ignorantly. He didn't know the bespacled boy was asking a rectangular question.

"I guess we will find out tomorrow"

With that they all went back to their rooms in the arena's hotel.

(Fade out)

The next day, Harry was nervous.

He was good at Quidditch, some would say the best. But was he really the best? The best at Quidditch on Earth? The bespacled boy was about to find out, as the contest started soon.

Harry thought back to a few years ago.

Meanwhile Riverview was sorted into Slitherin.

Happy times, before all the the troubles with The dark lord got really bad.

Breaking out of his deep thoughts, Harry decide to go to the Arena early, perhaps do a few laps as a warm up.

Harry casually strolled to the Arena while practicing Quidditch.

As The chosen one walked out he was surprised to see Voldemort already there!

Tom Marvolo Riddle was clearly upto something. Harry had to find out what it was!

"What you upto Voldemort?" yelled Potter.

"You will never find out!" yelled back Voldemort, who wanted to keep his plan a secret.

Frustrated, Harry started practicing Quidditch, never taking his eye of The tall man as he did so.

Ron joined them a few minutes later.

"Hi Harry!" he said

"..and hello.....Voldemort"

"yes. Hello The long boy. Good to see your in the contest too. For now"

But before Ron could hear what villain had said, it was time to start!

They walked to the start line, and bent down ready.

The crowd was getting big. Many fans had banners saying stuff like

'Go Harry Go The seeker Go The seeker'

or

'Go Go Go Riddle your the best!'

The starter pulled their throwing knifes out and got ready to fire.

Ron, Voldemort and The green eyed boy all waited with anticipation.

Ron started breathing heavily

2

Voldemort tensed. Ready to go.

1

The Brunets skin glowed with excitement

0.

BANG!

The starter fired the throwing knifes.....at RON!

RON COLLAPSED instantly. The dark wizard started Quidditching, laughing manically as he did so.

The short boy was in shock, and raced over to Ron Weasley.

"He shot you!" but why?

"Owww...I am shot bad"

The starter stared at their weapon.

"I didn't mean too...my throwing knifes acted weird!"

Harry looked at the throwing knifes.

He then licked it.Using his famous forensic skills, The gryffindor made a deduction.

"Yes....this throwing knifes clearly has been sabotaged to shot at Ron."

"Typical" said Ron.

"What now?" said The boy who lived.

"You have to go on" said Ron, still bleeding.

But just then the clack-son went off!

It was half time!

As Ron Weasley was carried taken to hospital by pure black horse, Harry and Hermione retired to the locker room.

He-who-must-not-be-named was already there, still grinning.

"Oh what a shame. The long boy isn't going to compete any more. Even doing nothing I'm going to come second. You know...I might just let you win..out of my....generosity... " Voldemort sniggered again.

With that Voldemort left out the backdoor.

"Gosh darn-it" Hermione said. "The evil man drives me mad! "

"You know, I think he had something to do with The blue eyed boys accident "

​

Harry was thinking. hard.

"The heir of Slytherin is never generous. Lack of generosity is his number one defining characteristic. Well, that and evil"

"That means..." said the brunette, her slow cogs working.

"...He wants to come second!" said the boy who lived, thinkingly.

"Do you think thats..."

"....because he wants the second prize medal!" said Harry, winning again.

"It must be because the second prize is really Horcrux "

"Yes, now that Iook at the second prize I notice it now. Its clearly the Horcrux"

"That explains why someone would want to become second!"

"Exactly!"

​

"So we have to beat Voldemort by being the best at coming second? How are we going to do that...you have never lost before! "

"I know" said the boy who lived. "I am not sure I know how"

"You got to though. Just this once you got to come second!"

"No I cant. But I have an idea....you could compete!"

"Me?" said the brunette, surprised. "Do they even allow girls like me to do Quidditch?

"Yes, its a modern contest, a few girls have already competed. I'll win the contest as normal, and you will come second. You can do this!"

"Ok Harry, I'll do it. I'll do it for you"

Then the Gong went again, the final leg of the Quidditch contest had begun!

The smartest witch of her year and Potter walked boldly into the World Championship Quidditch-ing Arena.

It was time for the final part. But first Hermione Granger had to be registered.

"I, HERMIONE, WOULD LIke to compete!" she shouted proudly all ready for her big day.

"I am sorry but afraid its not allowed" said the contest judge.

Devastated Hermione Granger started sobbing.

"But I have wanted to compete in a Quidditch-ing contest all my life! "

"Its not in the rules I am afraid."

The seeker took Hermione in their arms.

"I'm sorry I thought you would be allowed"

"Its not fair...I have every right to compete."

"Its probably just because you are a girl"

"Probably. that's just typical!"

Hermione sobbed some more. The floor was quite wet now.

"I know, I'll have to lose now"

"Its so unfair, why should you have to lose? Why should you have to come second?"

"I'll...be ok The brunette, I can do this." said the gryffindor holding back his emotions.

"*snuff*" said Granger

"Its so unfair on you! They will all make fun of you for coming second!"

It was true, the other Quidditch-ing fans would make fun of him.

"I'll take it" said Harry manly. The witch was already so upset that Harry would have to lose, The chosen one didn't want to make her even more.

With that The Brunet stood up and went to the starting line next to Voldemort.

"So its just you and me"

"As it should be"

"Lets end this"

He-who-must-not-be-named gave the contest judge and nod and the contest started once more.

Harry and The parselmouth did their Quidditch-ing intensely. Harry Potter tried to control himself but it was hard. Every instinct in him made him want to win. He could not be put on a leash.But He had to control it!

The bespacled boy struggled

"Could he do it?" "How could he not win?" "He Loved Quidditch!" "This was not possible" "But he had too" "For the sake of the Earth" "He needed too" "But how?"

Finnally defeating his inner monologueing he overcame his bloodlust for Quidditch-ing. He could lose now. Harry stopped. A calmness washed over him and they entered a zen-like state. They did nothing. Voldemort didnt see this and rushed ahead Quidditch-ing like Harry was still going. Before they could see what happened they had won! The chosen one had come second by default!

"I....won....?" said Voldemort confused.

"Yes..you see we knew your plans to come second and get the Horcrux as it was the prize. So Hermione and me planned to come second!"

"But I won!!!"

"Yes"

"I never won anything before! I was always bitter and evil because I never won anything!"

Suddenly Harry realized that Voldemort was a good person and they just did evil because they never won anything before.

"Now they I have won this prize I feel all my evil thoughts leaving me, I dont need the Horcrux now...I am sorry I did anything bad"

Harry and Voldemort forgave eachother and the crowd cheered.

"I forgive you!"

"Yayyyyyyy!!!!! Horrrraaayyyyy" said the crowd.

And then, everyone went to home together and they live happlily ever after with no more problems.

the end.

Such a profound and moving fanfic. This beats even Cauterize in the oneshots category.
