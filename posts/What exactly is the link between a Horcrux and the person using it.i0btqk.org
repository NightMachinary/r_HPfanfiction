Does the Horcrux have to exist in the same reality as the user for it to work? Suppose you sent a Horcrux to the year 2100 with a time machine and killed the user. Would they truly die since the Horcrux doesn't currently exist? Would they get resurrected in the next century or would the Horcrux just fail to establish a connection with the master soul? Or would they just stay immortal for that long since it's never destroyed?

If Voldemort used a time turner to return to a time where his Horcruxes were still in existence, would he regain immortality or would they only protect past-Voldie? If he made a Horcrux and turned back to when he was mortal, would the soul anchor in the future protect him or not since it would not exist at the time?

Or suppose a Horcrux is destroyed, but very far away from the user. Would the user instantly turn mortal or would the effect be delayed by light speed? If it was delayed by light speed, would tossing a Horcrux into a black hole guarantee eternal immortality as the information of its destruction would not be able to make it out of the event horizon? Or if the destruction event instantly affected the user, which inertial frame are we using exactly, because absolute simultaneousness really isn't a thing that actually exists. If the event of the user becoming mortal happens before the light-speed signal of the Horcrux's destruction reaches it, then there would have to be a reference frame in which the loss of immortality happened before the actual event of the destruction of the Horcrux.

Maybe if the connection was some sort of wormhole? That might allow both soul pieces to keep in touch without paradoxes, but it might be possible to destroy a Horcrux and have the effect happen much earlier or later depending on how much time dilation was experienced by the Horcrux and the user. If the user time traveled a long way into the past, created a Horcrux there and hid it on earth, then accelerated to near light speed to return to the present time before returning to earth, then destruction of the Horcrux would not take effect for quite some time because the user would still be linked to the Horcrux in the past.

Sincerely, a physics student learning about Relativity while also trying to write a space traveling dark wizard.


** My advice is to take science (ironic since I'm a science major) and toss it out the window. HP is a world where you can create matter, repel objects no matter their mass or velocity, and where souls exist. If canon doesn't contradict an idea you come up with, it's a possible option. Go with what your intuition says.

*** Am professional scientist. Can confirm that applying real world science to Harry Potter is a silly idea.

**** Right? It's not just a bad idea, it's a bad literary idea as well. Who reads fantasy and stories with magic in them for the science?

***** It has a place in the fantasy genre, but it has to be explicitly part of the worldbuilding. Dresden Files, Cosmere, etc. Though I think it is starting to get a bit overplayed and therefore boring.

** Given that horcruxes don't prevent aging, as amply demonstrated by how Tommy-boy isn't locked into his 17 year old self after making the first, it wouldn't really matter.

The only concern is the subjective lived time of the host, as an 'inmortal' who is nothing but a shriveled and dementia ridden skeleton is of no concern. One of the more traditional fates worse than death, that.

** I would say, if no horcrux is present he dies. Then a different version of him could return in the future with the newly arrived Horcrux. Like diary-riddle
