In it Harry keeps living his life over and over again, think Groundhog Day but on a bigger scale. Only 5.6k words long, but pretty satisfying imo. Of course I'm majorly sleep deprived atm and that /just might/ have affected my enjoyment. Anyone know of similar fics?


** Sisyphus is one of my favorites. It's written with a kind of dry, wry menace that's very hard to pull off, and executed well here. So many great lines, like:

#+begin_quote
  There's no adventure to find who and what Sirius was to him, of course, as he already knows... and as he has no one to have adventures with.
#+end_quote

Also some great meta-commentary on the life cycle of a reader of fanfiction:

#+begin_quote
  He's spent time with Sirius now, asked millions of questions and gotten the same answers - a life where Sirius lives has lost its shine. He's saved Cedric dozens of times and watched him be killed equally as many times, and can't quite figure out what difference it makes if he lives or if he dies. His friendships with Hermione and Ron had been lived through so many times, that he no longer wants to remake them - after all the lives, he hasn't only gotten bored with his friends, but sick of them. He's replaced them many times with all sorts of people, with Neville and Luna and Dean and Seamus and Terry and Susan and Lavender and Padma and Parvati, even Draco and Daphne and Pansy and Gregory and Vincent and Blaise and so forth and so forth. Even they feel boring now.
#+end_quote

Yeah. A great read. Short, and not at all sweet.

** I love the fic /Getting the Hang of Thursdays/, in which Severus and Hermione find themselves the only ones able to perceive a dreadful timeloop which is degrading everything caught within it. It's quite long and very good, but right now I'm struggling to find a link to it, as the domain it was hosted on has lapsed. I'll keep looking and post a link if I can find one--it's definitely worth the read.

/Edit: There's a copy on Ashwinder [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6501&i=1][(here)]] but it's got awful formatting, which is a bit of a shame./

** If you're okay with slash(LV/HP), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] has Harry repeating his life.

** Personally, I enjoy infinite loop style fanfics: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops]] While the Harry Potter universe is looping, I don't know of a compilation of all of the Harry Potter loops, most unfortunately. I find crossover content keeps the loops fresh, rather than the groundhog day style stories that restrict themselves to one particular universe exclusively.

** I recently wrote one. Just 6k words (one-shot) but seems to be pretty well received: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11022402/1/Recursion][Recursion]].

** Wow, that was great. I was so hopeful for a final loop for Harry that the end totally caught me off guard. Nice.

** Esama is a good authoress but I really recommend you download that fict if you enjoyed it. She is in the habit of purging her stories without warning.
