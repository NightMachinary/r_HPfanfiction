I'm looking for stories where Harry's supposed greatness as the Boy-Who-Lived is real. Like he, as a baby, defeated the worlds most powerful dark lord, and not Lily.

I don't necessarily care how it's done, so long as Harry is powerful. Maybe Lily set up a ritual that used Harry's magic to rebound the curse, idk.

No angst please, nor do I want a Harry that acts like an entitled brat that knows he has the power of a god.

If anything like this exists, please drop it below.


** I mean, if Harry was powerful like that as a child, he would be an arrogant, entitled brat. Just look at Tom Riddle, who had command over his magic from a young age and used it to get his way. ðŸ˜‚
