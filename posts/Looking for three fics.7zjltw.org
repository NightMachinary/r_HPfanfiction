1. Neville and Harry reside in the same orphanage before Harry is taken away for killing a rabbit. Neville is sorted into Hufflepuff and spends his time at Hogwarts alone. They find Harry in a mental institution and he gets sorted into Hufflepuff too. Hermione becomes nosy after some deaths at Hogwarts and Harry kills her. Harry smiles this particular smile throughout the fic.

2. Neville is more independent and believes in himself. It starts off about Neville wanting to learn everything he can, including sex when he catches his grandmother doing it. He meets Harry when they are discussing thestrals (I believe) Neville doesn't see Harry lick/wipe blood from his face. Neville might be dark/evil in this fic.

3. A fic dealing with Harry and Percy. Begins with Harry knocking in to Percy, causing their glasses to fall off. Then, they end up having sex and Harry's room. Harry's a bottom.


** You have weird taste in fics yo. Good luck on the hunt
