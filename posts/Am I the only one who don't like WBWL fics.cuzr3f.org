I don't categorically hate all these fics, I have read good Twin/brothers Potters fic without bashing and I don't have anything against fics with Harry having Jealous siblings. I get that Harry may have a twin and that there may be sibling rivalry, but I feel like these fics are over the top in their character bashing and drama, and I don't get how a fic could bash so many likable main characters and still be popular. Also, the very phrasing "WBWL" sounds so weird.

What I really hate about this trope is that they demonize Harry's Parents. It's hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that in /any/ Universe, Lily Potter would be a bad parent.. I guess not lot of Fans who like these fics, feel this way. Is it because she could be written as shallow and materialistic? And if you are writing her this way, is it because of her looks or because of how popular she was in School? Also, why would Lily and James Potter abandon their son, especially when both of them /literally/ gave their lives for their son (when they could have abandoned him or something in Canon) ? I can imagine some idiot Death Eater Parents doing that, not the Potters. (Funny thing about these fics, most of them idolize Death Eaters like Malfoys and they sympathize/adopt Harry or something, we can talk about Pureblood idolizing fics but that's a discussion for another day)


** It's just so impossible and predictable.

Impossible because I can't comprehend how Lily or James could ever ignore a child. I mean, I'd understand favoritism, but not to the extend where they forget they had another kid.

Predictable because the trope follows this pattern:

Some injury befalls the other child, causing a scar. Dumbledore somehow, despite his century of experience, assumes that scar is the super, dark, evil scar and ignores Harry. Lily/James agree to raise the kids differently. They either send Harry off to the Dursleys or ignore him. Sirius and Remus either roll with the punches or are super anti-Lily/James. (Don't forget the 'Pup' and 'Cub' diminutive.) Fast forward to Hogwarts, Harry is either in Ravenclaw or Slytherin. He is a prodigy and quidditch pro. Super popular with the girls and edgy/mysterious. Snape realizes that Harry isn't his father and respects him. Daphne, Tonks, or Fleur pairing. Harry's sibling Max/Andrew/Skylar/Rose is a conceited pompous dick that doesn't know how to hold a wand correctly. Let the bashing commence. Harry is better in every way and has to do everything. Did I forget super edgy? Parents find out Harry is like 400 IQ and decide to pay attention again. Harry hits them with the fat */NO./* Yelling, yelling, yelling. The End, it's incomplete.

***** Nobody ever goes with a malignant and subtle curse centered around the whole Boy Who Lived business cast either by a Death Eater very soon after the announcement or by some rival or someone who haste Lily or James. Not necessarily Snape either, its too cliche and unoriginal.

So as time passes the insidious nature of the Curse makes people pretty much ignore Harry or give him the bare minimum of attention.

Now you have two options. Harry goes to Hogwarts blahblahblah or decides to go to another school to try and forget his cold and indifferent home life.

Now as for removing the Curse and entering the Act 2 of the story you can start it after the first meeting with Voldemort on first year. Voldemort either mentions the other kid and because he is the bad guy somehow it shatters the Ignoration Curse going on and suddenly everyone starts the usual denial trope in this stage of the story and trying to reconnect or some such crap.

​

Of course, by then Harry is already in Second-Third-Fourth year quite happy being with friends doing hormone riddle teenage stuff (non of that super genius edgy shit superstar shit) so he will not want what they are selling. He is a teenagers, we were all insensitive, edgy, woe is me asshole once.

Just to make the story different his young-er brothers-sisters are just regular kids too without acting like shitheads like 100% all other stories make them be. It was all the Ignoration Curse at work until that point.

​

Got nothing else after this. It will always return to being some generic canon copy/paste at the end.

***** There was one I read, which only got a few chapters in before being abandoned, that seemed a bit less bashing and slightly more plausible than usual premise wise. James and Lily thought Harry was a squib, and set him up in a nice townhouse in London basically by himself, and only visited occasionally. He basically fully integrated into the muggle world, and was super surprised, and fairly angry at his parents, when he got his Hogwarts letter.

**** There is some fics that does a pretty good job at dodging the usual cliches in my opinion. One common points in all these fics is that the Potter are pretty good parents who either don't treat their children differently, or when they do, don't go full neglect and justify it pretty well :

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cuzr3f/am_i_the_only_one_who_dont_like_wbwl_fics/][Fraterculus]]
- This fics where Harry's sister, the Girl Who Lived is a big associable who hate almost everyone except her family (including the remaining Maraudeurs) while Harry is some kind of social butterfly, but can't remember the name of the fic at all.

The sad thing is that all of these good fics are unfinished (and if we are honest, abandoned) while the "/Abandonned Harry take Hogwarts by surprise and show everyone he is the best banging half the girls on the way, oh and he will yell at this parents exposing how much they suck at one point/" reach the 400k words and are finished.

***** WBWL from an author's perspective is ridiculously hard to write. I'm not trying to defend myself in any way, but this sort of backlash and discontent is super evident from the author's perspective. A lot of comments or reviews or private messages pop up after chapters, and the story has to constantly adjust given these issues or risk the rising backlash of the community. WBWL isn't for everyone, and in my personal opinion it shouldn't be either. In comparison, Diablerie is easier because it's deviating from the common tropes of WBWL writing, and fails to “stir the pot” so to speak because it's something not commonly done.

  Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot.

**** Horrid parents are the natural flaw for most WBWL fics. Either the parents are OOC, or Harry has to be. If both the factors were the same then the story wouldn't shift into the direction most darker stories go.

***** I understand that sad fics in general tend to take the darker route, I do avoid fics with tragic ending or when the MC suffers a bit more than what I think is allowed (in my mind). The popular, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, is a good example of the limit of MC suffering that I'm okay with.

As for as HP fanfiction is concerned, this may sound stupid- I blame Dursleys, Death eaters, Voldemort primarily responsible for his misery. This is probably why Harry's Parents (the only ones in the world who would love him for what he is without judgement) causing him abuse directly, puts me off and I avoid fics like that. Because if they turn on him, for me personally, it has crossed the line of suffering a human - a child can experience, and it's just very tragic.

****** I agree with all of that, actually that was incredibly well put. A lot of stories don't dedicate the time and thought necessary to fully embrace the story of trauma and neglect. It's almost offensive to individual who have felt it before. I often say that writers have a obligation to their readers. Authors have the ability to hurt their creations and characters so so much, but they then are required almost morally to then pull that character back up from hell. When we hurt characters, we hurt our readers. If we then allow that character to heal or find some sort of peace, then we have an incredibly rare opportunity to possibly help someone in the real world- a chance to allow someone to grieve in company of a story, but then guide them through it. Stories that don't do this, that focus on neglect and pain and refuse to find the brighter side or the redemption, are the types of stories I struggle to read simply based on the principles of the one who wrote it.

** Yes, same. I can't with the demonization of the Potters into some abusive monsters while Snape is usually depicted as this man who has a heart of gold underneath it all. There was one story that I thought kind of worked, but I think it was taken off, and it worked simply because James was an alcoholic (not abusive or anything, but somewhat neglectful) and completely mentally exhausted at seeing marked death eaters get off and not having to serve prison time despite working to put them away. So he sees Harry, who buddies up to the kids of former death eaters and likes Snape, as kind of "betraying" his work and Lily (who was dead in the story) and Harry's brother sees it sort of the same way. Like logically, he knows the kids aren't to blame for the parents but he yells at Harry that by befrieinding Draco he has to go over and be polite to Lucius when he was visiting Draco...and that in itself was a betrayal of their mother to smile, shake hands, etc. with Lucius.

There are a few stories which aren't WBWL but instead have Harry's sibling be the BWL/GWL, and they are the only ones without ridiculous bashing although the story by The Grey Maze is critical of Dumbledore.

**** The James bashing does not really go away, but he is given more depth and reasons are given for how he is towards Harry, even is they are twisted. The Sibling bashing is not given much focus, and last I remembered, they were something xlise to friends at the beginning of third year.

The story is above average in the first year, epic in the second, and the third year is great. The author is consistently improving his writing and there are quite a few twists and turns and a lot of original elements in the story. If you get over the first year, the story turns into something that's almost a masterpiece.

** I thought the sentinent was basically the opposite -- that most people seem to /dislike/ WBWL fics?

My issue with this trope is twofold: while I don't like bashing at all in first place, this trope is especially bad about it. It has a habit of bashing basically all of the "good guys". The other issue is an issue I also have with Marriage Law fics -- they're all /exactly the same/ with very few deviations. Both of the tropes follow very consistent rules about how things go. This makes reading more than one fic of this kind more or less pointless. Now, fics with similar plots that go similar ways isn't automatically bad -- sometimes I just feel like reading something simple and safe where I know how things will go and can enjoy the ride. But I'd rather have at least /some/ sort of deviation making the fic unique and original -- which these kind of fics usually lack.

** I hate them so much that I rarely give any of them a chance. Especially ones where Harry has a twin or older sibling. Usually what happens I'd the sibling is favored over Harry mostly to extreme degrees with alive Lilly and James either abusing, neglecting, or abandoning Harry altogether. Then there's the part where the sibling almost always turns into some spoiled brat that is actually too much of a coward to fight Voldemort when he returns. I hate these fics so much.

**** Because Alan Rickman was an attractive man and the movies made Snape a lot more sympathetic than the books. Also, many people who were bullied at school in their own lives have a very knee jerk response to the flashback scene in Snape's Worst Memory, uncritically taking Snape's side, despite this scene happening immediately after Snape having a session of mindraping Harry and humiliating him over what he uncovers. When Snape saw Harry's life through his own eyes, including his mistreatment during his childhood, and didn't have a Damascus road moment, he became trash in my eyes.

For Snape to be good, in these writers' minds, James and the rest of the Marauders have to be bad.

This is a premise I've never really liked. Now, I usually read SS-centric fics and while I'm not blind to his faults, I'm definitely far more sympathetic to him than the majority (which I think is a result of my own past in school, and the fact that I watched the movies far more recently than I read the books where he's portrayed as far more cruel). However, that doesn't mean I hate the Marauders. Sure, I dislike the bullying (reasonably, I think), but I prefer fics where they grow up from it in the end, and where the author doesn't continue making them into bad people for the rest of time.
