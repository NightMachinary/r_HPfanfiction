Like one of the older generations of Blacks or Potters, or Frank and Alice Longbottom.

Or, failing that, one where Dumbledore discovers he's a time traveler and decides to allow him to go about his business after being assured he's here to help.


** The ones that come to mind for me are:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24792544][my head is bloody, but unbowed]]: Post-War Harry gets sent back to the First Wizarding War and lays low for a while until a Death Eater attack happens and his 'saving people thing' kicks in. Moody basically adopts him afterwards and the Longbottoms and Flamels are rather prominent characters. It very good

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966][Second String]]: Harry gets sent back in time during the summer before Fifth Year, and, not wanting to disrupt the timeline, pretends to be a squid and eventually gets taken in by Aberforth Dumbledore. Lots of minor canon characters are a lot more prominent like Alice Longbottom, Filch, and the Prewett Twins. It has a very well-conceived plot and world. This one is Slash, but romance is a very minor focus.

*** For a second I thought you said Harry deadass decided to just be a squid and Aberforth apparently has always wanted a pet squid.

  Harry's attempt to time travel and fix the past went badly awry. Time shattered, and the various pieces of the universe clung to each other as best they could. Harry finds himself in 1961, with Albus Dumbledore the Minister for Magic, Gellert Grindelwald his loving husband, Voldemort newly defeated...and Severus Snape being proclaimed the Boy-Who-Lived. HPOB, ADGG.

** Delenda Est features an older generation of purebloods that work with Harry against the young people being taken in by Riddle's propaganda. The older Blacks & particularly Lucius' father are awesome.

Wind Shear features Harry working with Charlus Potter & his old comrades who fought against Grindelwald back in the great war.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
