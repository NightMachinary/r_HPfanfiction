By that, I mean fics that resemble the ones written in 2000-2005 that focused on Harry's fifth/sixth/seventh year (continuing the books as were then published), but written in the 2010s. So essentially AUs that completely ignore the plot and revelations of the latter books, not necessarily out of dissatisfaction with them (i.e. bashing and such), but simply out of a desire for exploration.


** Mine is like this if you want to check it out. I wrote the first version in 2003 pre-ootp and then redid it all this past summer. The concept is a bit unique, but it is a very book-style adventure/mystery story and I did my own thing with Voldemort. :)

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. AU OotP.

** !linkffn(10417400)

Follows the basic start of year five, but has several twists, a unique climax, and an original (if unfinished) sequel

  In the trio's fifth year nothing seems the same. There's more work, a new High Inquisitor and new relationships beginning. If only the world wasn't sick and actually lived up to people's expectations.
