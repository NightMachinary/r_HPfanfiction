Can I please get an AU where voldemort never went bad or something like that and poly and James have a lot of kids and Harry is a big brother. Like Harry loving them so much and he cheers when they get sorted no matter what house they get in because he loves them so much. When they are small he carries them on his shoulders and stuff like that. Maybe Harry is still the youngest seeker in a century and his siblings think they have to meet some high expectations and Harry comforts them and us like why would you change who you are or stuff like that. Just Harry being a big brother loving every or his siblings unconditionally and making sure that they all know it too and also being their protector and if anybody dates to mess with his siblings. ( He still should be friends with Hermione and Ron and they can still go on adventures together just without voldemort).

EDIT: it doesn't have to be all of the things I listed it were ideas but if you know something with all of it I would love to know about it.


** Lmao it's too specific, I doubt you'll find anything

The only fic I know with Big brother Harry is

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

  Two alcoholic men decide to jump through the Veil. This takes them back to August 1st, 1993. They don't have much to lose, anyway - the only thing left to do is to go around and piss everyone off, true Marauder fashion. So they do exactly that.

***** Noticed that, pretty entertaining overall though I've got to say that...

I found the epilogues distasteful... a prime example of power corrupting absolutely as the four hop from world to world, killing and controlling for their own amusement. I get that it's supposed to be funny, but it really falls flat, especially after earlier comparisons between jaded/scarred Harry and Voldemort.

** Batsutousai's /Like a Ghost in My Town/ series has a loving big brother Harry in the second book, /Nose to the Wind/ (which you can read without reading the first book). Harry is MoD and reborn to a Lily and James Potter who are not killed. Unfortunately, he is sort of a squib, as far as normal wizarding magic goes, so he doesn't go to Hogwarts, but he has a different kind of magic related to being Master of Death. And he still befriends old friends--even gets the Potters to foster-parent Hermione. However, Voldemort is still alive, dark, and in a position of power--it's just that he's on Harry's side.

  While Harry had been content with his second chance, that didn't keep him from thinking what he could have done different, how many people could have survived if he hadn't been set on the very specific path he'd walked. Third time is the charm, though, right?
