*** Right, I'm trying to create a OC Potter who is kind of the opposite of Harry in that she looks like her mother save her eyes and has a lot of her father's inner personality, being arrogant and having somewhat of a mean streak, but also being noble and charismatic. Does this sound too perfect?

******* Okay. I mean she could fight with Scorpius but I always pictured him as being a better man than his father. By the time she goes to school, Draco (and Harry) are both grown men with children.

** British. I just assume any exchange student, particularly from America, is an self insert and they tend to become way too important. Oh that's another one, they have to be able to come into the story in a believable manner that could have been in the original series. So if you have someone that becomes Harry's auror trainee, grand we've seen that with Tonks and Moody. There are no transfer programmes, no Japanese senseiis, no chosen Veela.

**** Even the Triwizard Tournament was pretty much a giant visiting student program. Rowling doesn't show it because Harry has no reason to see it, but the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang contingents /probably/ didn't just miss out on nearly a year's worth of classes and their final year at that. Many of them likely had to take NEWTs or the equivalent after the tournament.

** Besides the points already mentioned, I have to feel the OC has a history. It could be mentioned briefly (like 'a small scar on her chin from trying to fly her dad's broom') or existent in her personality (Lily tried teaching her to play nice, but James made her his partner in crime). Following along from that, her past has to link to her future. (James realized he taught her jokes but didn't teach her not to go too far.) History makes a character feel real and not like they were born on the first page of the fic.

Another thing to remember is that 'this character is like their parents' is not a good enough motivation. Harry is not exactly like either of his parents, even if you merged them together. His history and his interactions made him someone unique. When it's children of established character, people tend to do that. When they're not self-inserts, they're still a flat copy of their parents.

** The key to a good OC is that you have an actual reason for it being in the story. It's not just "I have this cool idea for a character."

No. Unless the story is entirely impossible to do without the OC, keep it out of the story. This is Harry Potter FANFICTION and there is very rarely any point in adding OCs.

Aside from that, all the stuff that makes a well-rounded character. Goals, aspirations, fears, loss, flaws.

** That they fit in the story and the role that they have. An OC can fill a lot of roles: comic relief, a mentor-role, a parenting role, the main character, the main character's love interest etc.

Every different kind of OC needs other qualities of course, and it varies between stories as well. In general, they need to be relatable and have flaws. No person is perfect, and flaws are what make stories interesting and exciting.

** As someone who loves reading OCs (specially if the OC has a major role on the story) I think that a well-written OC, besides being a well thought character with a realistic personality and background history, needs to add-on with something unique to your fic. What I mean is... We don't need another bookworm girl who is super intelligent and get all answers correctly. We already have Hermione, who already does this job brilliantly. Why instead don't portrait a pure-blood girl who is having all her old values shaken?

And then you guys will ask me: Wouldn't be better to use Daphne instead? Well, I personally would find that much less attractive, even that character being almost an OC by all means. I much prefer a blank slate character that you could make it be Draco's sister, Bellatrix's daughter, Harry's half-sister from James secret mistress...

I know that unfortunately these tastes of mine are not very popular, because not only there are not many good OCs fanfics around, but I think that the fandom demonizes OCs so much, that some authors might be intimated by that and make then even more rare.

** That they don't become too important to the plot.

It's a mistake, I believe, to say a Mary Sue is identifiable as being too perfect. Rather a Mary Sue is identifiable by the way in which they become rapidly important.

*** Which they usually do by being too perfect because it means that too many plot points hinge on the OC being there to not fall apart. I think that's where the misconception comes from.
