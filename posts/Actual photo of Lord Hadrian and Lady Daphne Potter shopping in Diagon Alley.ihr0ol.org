*** Speaking of Eva Braun, she got [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Fegelein][her brother-in-law, Hermann Fegelein]], into very high positions. This man was a war criminal and an opportunist through and through.

When things began turning hopeless in 1945, he attempted to flee, but was caught when Hitler found him missing from the /Fuehrerbunker/. The next day, BBC published news about Himmler (Fegelein's boss) in negotiation with the Allies, Hitler flew into a rage and drew the connection between Fegelein's escape attempt and Himmler's betrayal. He ordered Fegelein shot later that day. Eva Braun did not speak out for her brother-in-law.

In the HP world, Daphne's brother-in-law would be none other than Draco Malfoy.

**** Your analogy would make Harry Hitler though. And if we're doing WWII analogies, Lord Potter would be Stalin (greatly profiting from defeating the baddies at the expense of the good guys, not much better than the people he defeated).

*** Tell that to the House Elves which are not considered slaves because they aren't human. Especially given the "BuT tHeY nEeD tHe BoNd" revisionism.

I mean, usually Harry has a buttload of money in those fics anyway. So where would be the harm in actually paying them a galleon or two a month?

**** It would be in DiSrEsPeCtInG ThEiR cUlTuRe! You see, they /love/ working and serving! That's not at all evidence of either a brainwashing effect of the bond or cultural indoctrination, no siree! They are just brownies, because anyone who has read brownie lore knows that they act exactly like that and not in any way else, nope!

Honestly, have you ever actually /asked/ a house-elf if they don't like being enslaved? See, it is right here in "REINES BLUT FÃœR REINE ZAUBERER", the premiere guide for all things pureblood, that they just love being enslaved, compelled to hurt themselves, worked to the bone and living in squalor!

Because you see, they aren't human, which makes slavery okay.
