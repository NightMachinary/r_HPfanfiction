** I just finished the fourth fic in the Pureblood Pretense series yesterday. I loved it so much!!!

I'm super interested to see what the author is going to do for the fifth year given the outcome of the fourth year.

** I read and am currently waiting for updates on linkao3(How to Succeed in Dark Wizardry (Without Really Trying) by technically_direct) a while ago. It's a Ron-centric fic starting in first year tailing his journey in becoming a dark wizard. I like the nuanced take on the alliance of magic and how one could be Dark wizard without sacrificing your soul lol. Ron canonically longs to stand out in his family and be more than what his brother's are, and in this fic, dark magic is his way to do so

The characterisation of Harry and Snape is also pretty unique, I would say. Snape is portrayed more as a disgruntled and tired teacher if anything, which is pretty humorous, and Harry is more flawed, but in a teenage sense I suppose?? like he's a tad bit self-centred but is still a realistic teenage boy. Ron and Hermione's friendship is nicely developed, I don't know if they're the final ship since the fic is still in the Third year, but if so, the relationship would be well-established.

pretty cool :)

  Ron maybe accidentally-on-purpose becomes a dark wizard, and everything changes. (a canon rewrite, with a bit of a twist)(also this is not a 'Ron is Evil, actually' fic so if that's what you're expecting, maybe give this a skip)

** Recently found linkao3(22022296) .

It has interesting portrayal of divination. It is largely the same as in canon, but taken seriously and it works. Interesting relationship with Voldemort too, where Voldemort resurrects in first year and finds out Harry's his horcrux in second year.

Regarding MCD warning: horrible things happen to Harry, but Major Character Death tag is not for him, at least so far as 59 chapters the fic has right now. I would call the person the tag is probably for a secondary character. If someone like me, dislikes surprises regarding to this, it's for Percy Weasley .

** I'm re-reading The Incalculable Power linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28632333/chapters/70181604]]). I'm usually not into slash but this fic has been gen so far so it's fine, but mainly I'm here for the absolutely /amazing/ snark between Harry and Draco. There's also some truly excellent Marauders content. For example:

#+begin_quote
  Lily took the spot on Sirius's other side, across from Harry, while the rest of the girls clustered nearby.

  She looked at Sirius's plate with an expression of fond exasperation. "Going for the Ultimate Everything Bagel again?"

  "The ultimatiest," Sirius confirmed. His bagel, last supporting a tower of bacon and eggs when Harry looked, was now stacked with strawberries, cantaloupe, porridge, potatoes, and cornflakes.
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  "Poor sad sod never takes it any easier, either," Sirius added. "Quidditch tryouts or no, he'll be moping the rest of the week."

  He gave Lily a dark look, as if blaming her for ruining their first Quidditch event of the year.

  Lily glared right back. "How's your everything bagel?" she asked cuttingly.

  Sirius looked down at the spot where his plate had been and went slack with shock. "MY BAGEL! PRONGS!"

  He leapt up and tackled James on top of the table.

  Harry, Remus, and Marlene dove out of the way as the boys went careening off the table on their side.

  "HA!" shouted James, holding up a round, feathery mass from the tangle of his and Sirius's limbs. "Go, Gingerweed, go! To Potter Manor!"

  He threw the owl into the air and then promptly disappeared under Sirius's bulk with a surprised /ack/!

  "I almost had it this time, Prongs! Everything on my everything bagel! Everything!"

  "You say that every time, Padfoot!" James shouted, wrestling him for position on top. "But it's a pipedream! A pipedream! You can never fit it into your mouth! Not once have you---"

  Sirius got him in a headlock and toppled him off to the side. "I had it this time! This time, I only put edible things on it! It would have worked!"

  James bucked until he managed to flip Sirius off-balance and get free of the headlock. "Then it's not an everything bagel, is it?"

  Sirius gasped as if he had been stabbed.

  "They'll be at this a while," said Remus. "So, what are you studying in the library now?"

** I'm keeping up with Harry Potter and the Bucket List linkffn(13709304)

It's a SI/OC with a very humorous Slytherin protagonist. It's AU from Voldemort's first defeat but the power of Plot keeps it from diverging too far. The protagonist does not claim to be a good person but she seriously loves her family and the fluff is real. While it has a dark comedy disclaimer (and the story definitely has dark elements) it's never dived into anything that has unsettled me yet.

Also at the end of each chapter the author asks a question and gives their answer to the previous chapter's question. It gives you a good feel on what the author likes most about the HP universe.

** I've started to read this new fic, called Mendacium.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13850007/1/Mendacium]]

It's a non-BWL Harry, who grew up with a different identity in an orphanage. He enters the Wizarding World when he receives his Hogwarts letter and the author is trying to make a parallel between young Tom Riddle and Harry. The twist, is that Harry has a brother who is the BWL (for real, no WBWL), his parents are alive and we still don't know why he was in an orphanage (the author claims not be due to "We need to focus on the BWL" type of explanation).

So far, there's been no bashing, no childs politics, kids acting like kids, no OP characters and no manipulative Dumbledore.

I've quite enjoyed the fact there's been no common tropes so far. I think it has a lot of potential. Therefore, I'll give it a 8/10.

I think the author must have tried to avoid more common fanfiction names like Harrison, Harold or Hadrian. And I don't know the authors intentions, but maybe keeping the name as Harry wouldn't work for the plot.

** I am reading a Post-Hogwarts fanfiction (It's kind of canon compliant ? Since it doesn't change pairings etc ...) Anyway it has Harry and Ginny raising little Teddy while a new villain rises and is after Harry and his family and wants to take over the wizarding world.

A lot of the chapters are from little teddy's point of view ( he's a little bit over 5 years old ) and I really like how it describes Harry's relationship with Teddy. And it portrays him as Teddy's favourite person.

I love fanfictions about Harry raising baby teddy and giving him the life he always dreamed someone would have given him.

** Just started Re-Reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][Birth of a Nightmare Man Chapter 1, a harry potter fanfic | FanFiction]]

​

I would rate it 8.63/10, because while it is a very good (and dark) fic, there are a few places where either another whole chapter or just a few paragraphs could go, make it flow better and all.

It is, in my opinion, a very unique idea (ive never seen anything like it), and has a full trilogy.

Again, it has some less savory scenes (Its quite graphic with violence).

It is a dark!harry fic and also has a bit of Time Travel thrown in.

** I'm currently about halfway through linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord). It starts out rough, the author is quite repetitive with the usage of names and lack of descriptive creativity, BUT that didn't last very long. By the second chapter I was interested in the storyline, and having gone halfway through it I can honestly say that I love the way the author handles battle scenes!

They have to be some of the more exciting fight and action scenes I've ever read, and also: HP fighting nazis! What's not to love? It's got a bit of OP Harry, but his skill and strength are justifiable in this plot. Also kind of OP kid Tom Riddle, but it didn't bug me like the usual OP 11 year old clichés. Also, the names of many characters are not correct but I assume it's creative liberty. Hopefully it stays good to the end, but in case it ends in an orchestra of sad trombones, I'll apologize preemptively.

CW for some descriptions of violence in the first scene. The rest of the story so far hasn't revisited that theme.

As for other stories I found interesting recently, here's a couple that strayed from the usual formulas and caught my interest!

*** I'm sorry, but what the fuck? I don't understand the point of /But It Breaks Your Heart/.\\
Am I supposed to feel sorry for this ... character?\\
Is the goal to make her even more despicable than normal?\\
At least in the books she's just a jealous, hateful person, here she's what, a person who tortures a young family member because she loves them? Oh, she feels guilty about the 10(+6) years of mental, physical, and emotional abuse - that makes it all better.

(I'm also curious as to the point of the second person view. Is it supposed to engender sympathy because the actions are being put on me?)

**** I think it's just supposed to make you think. It's not about making you feel anything for Petunia, but it's a really interesting look into the idea that everyone is the good guy from their own perspective. Of course, that's my take on it. When I read it I found it to be a surreal and somewhat disturbing perspective that I'd never seen before, thus it's interesting in my opinion.

** I am reading The Wand That Chose Two Wizards linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15273564/chapters/35429892]]). I'm only on chapter 12, but man is it good so far! I was just browsing random fics before falling asleep and it caught my attention and the quality of the writing just woke me right up and I sat until 4 in the morning until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore because it's so well written.

So the reason it's so good is because the author is building onto the world, using it, and it really feels like a Harry Potter book. For instance, so it's a year 8 fic, right? And the gang is there and Harry is in Slughorn's class and he is worried because his whole performance in the 6th year was a lie lmao I never even thought of that tbh. Another thing as an example, you get a chapter with a boggart and the focus is not just Harry or Draco, it's /all/ the characters who are mentioned and who do things, that has nothing to do with the two, and the characters are so /them/! It's the characters from the books living their lives independantly and it just adds so much. I love it. The only thing that really stood out to me in terms of nitpicking is that Theodore Nott's father is not a DE even though he very much was, but the author has build trust in me to look past it because I believe they have a plan, because everything else is just spot on as far as I'm concerned.\\
Also it has some really funny lines.

  Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts to finish off his seventh year, but finds that it's very different than the Hogwarts he once knew. He's sharing a common room with all the other eighth year students, he's no longer sure if he wants to become an Auror, his best friends are constantly off snogging, and his Potions partner, Draco Malfoy, is acting nothing like his usual bratty self.Draco Malfoy wants nothing less than to go back to Hogwarts, but for his mother, he does it anyway. While he hopes he can hole up in his room and do nothing but homework for the year, he finds himself despising his terrible new wand, befriending an inexplicably odd Ravenclaw, secretly taking Muggle Studies classes, and willingly helping the Saviour of the Wizarding World himself, Harry Potter. It's going to be a very interesting year.

**** I think it's most similar to canon, actually, without being the same as canon. It has lots of creative worldbuilding, evoking the same sense of whimsy and awe as the original books. It's Harry's Hogwarts years, but definitely doesn't just go over the same old stations of canon. The plot diverges significantly, so it's constantly surprising me.

It's part of a series, so start at the beginning of course.

Edited to add: details like all the other things hidden in the Chamber of Secrets, and the powerful treasures that the many Triwizard champions had to find, were so interesting, they made Rowling's original worldbuilding kind of pale in comparison.

** Found an intresting story /start/ on AO3, but it was only 2 chapters. Did a search and found 28 chapters of same on QQ, the last update being Sunday April 4.

The story is called Red Hair and Red Eyes by Alstreim. The MC is a half kitsune, and we get hints that she is a reincarnation of a canon character reborn into this AU. She suffers from nightmares and 'memories' of canon events that are still in the future. Turning eleven she runs into fem-Harry and becomes her best friend. The story so far has just passed getting Norbert away from Hogwarts.

I found it to be an interesting AU, Lily (fem-Harry) and Izumi (half-kitsune), both in Ravenclaw, are rather adorable and quite OP for first years. I'm looking forward to future updates and I'm very curious how the summer and the Dursleys will be handeled.

It's been a while and I'm finding a bunch of happenings that I'd forgotten, like Dudley turning out to be magical but agreeing to have nothing to do with it because Petunia doesn't want it.

One thing it does quite well is incorporating Ginny into the Horcrux hunt. It occurred to me while reading it that Harry canonically /never asked Ginny for her opinion/ on breaking up with her for her safety. He had the courage to talk to her about it, of course, but he presented it as something that was definitely happening, rather than a joint decision or even getting her input first. Revisiting the issue makes sense.

** I'm reading Lord Mortis the Accident by BlueLaceAgate, there are only eleven chapters so far (57,197 words) but is really funny. Essentially, Harry accidentally becomes a necromancer. There isn't any character bashing and the rating is teen and up. We get a darkish Harry who is still very much in character and helped by his two friends (I really like the portrayal of Ron in this fic). Maybe not for everyone but I'm loving it so far!

*** Thanks for posting this rec. I'm really enjoying the story so far! I just wish the author didn't use "killing curse (colored) eyes" so much. That's really my one ding.

** So far I have these that I have read and about to read that are from HP:

-Luna goes to Azkaban, Harry accompanies her and they become friends with the dementors.

-Harry breaking the magic and having Pikachu as a pet.

-Harry, a magic geek who likes to transfigure things.

-Harry has lived with dementors since he was 7 years old.

-An OC dies and is now Harry's guardian ghost spirit.

-Merlin (the one from the BBC series) loses her memories of him and now has to attend Hogwarts and save the magical world from Voldemort. It is a series with three works so far.

The other two stories I have are from BNHA.

** I read 'Psychosis' by SnowWhiteOwl ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9040382/1/Psychosis]]) and because I"m feeling maudlin and the story reminded me of 'Digging for the bones' by Paganaidd ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones]]), I reread it as well.

Those are the best hurt/comfort stories I know that feature a Harry/Snape bonding relation. Well written and deeply disturbing in an emotional way (Digging more then psychosis but it's close.

Read the update on 'Road to power' by Chaos65. (h[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13701999/1/Road-to-Power][ttps://www.fanfiction.net/s/13701999/1/Road-to-Power]]). A more than decent HP-Marvel crossover SI that is starting to get traction action wise. I'm really curious about this fic and recommend it despite it meddling with tropes.

I've started reading 'Mendacium' by SomeoneFromBrazil ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13850007/1/Mendacium]]) on account of it being mentionded last week. Its a WBWL story with a somewhat more novel approach. It hasn't quite found it's feet and I'm not really convinced of the story. There a lot of things bothering me but I'm waiting to see what happens.

I'm trying to read 'Serpentine advice' by ubiquitouslyverbose ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13653786/4/Serpentine-Advice]]) and find the author's name to be what's bugging me about this story. I'm 4 chapters in and it feels like an info-dump and hardly anything happening. In contrast to that the hart of the matter of this information is really interesting as a foreshadowing to what might happen but storywise the pacing is off. I'll pick it up and try to get further in the future, maybe.
