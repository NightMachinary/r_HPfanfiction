Lots of fics just go with the inexplicable standby of 'if you don't participate, you'll lose your magic oh noes', which I felt was a wee bit excessive for a school tournament.\\
I thought it'd be more sensible if there were actually someone in charge of making sure the magically binding contract is upheld. So...

*The prompt:*\\
Write a snippet where Harry Potter refuses to participate in the Triwizard Tournament (after all, like he put his name in), and a /somebody/ is summoned by the Goblet of Fire (in a big puff of flame, most likely) to convince, coerce, annoy, or brute-force Harry into participating, or else punish him for /not/ participating.\\
It might be a canon character, it might be a magical creature, it might be a spectre of a former champion, it might even be a crossover character.

*Bonus points:*

- Whoever's summoned bribes Harry to participate by promising to teach him secret creature magic to make him Powerful!Harry.\\
- Harry learns about the First Task and decides that the punishment for not participating is preferable to being roasted by a dragon.\\
- Harry successfully negotiates to have a 'whipping boy' punished in his steed for not upholding the contract. And convinces a few unsuspecting Slytherins to sign up.\\
- A careful examination of the binding magical contract, reproduced in parchment form, reveals a Barty Crouch as the culprit and getting the summon-ee after him (much to Sirius Black's amusement).\\
- It's funny.


** I read the title and my brain immediately went "And his name is John Cena, doo doo do doooo!" and now I'm incredibly disappointed in myself, so today has been quite a journey.

  The Goblet of Fire doesn't just bind you to compete, it insures you will, calling you from wherever you may be for each event. So what happens if you happen to be under wards that are more powerful than the goblet itself?
