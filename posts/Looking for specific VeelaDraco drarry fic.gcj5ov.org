:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So all I remember is that draco chose harry as his mate and that because of this Draco needed a specific amount of skin contact with harry every day and needed to be close to him? I think they got their own shared rooms and they had to switch their schedules around so that they could stay in proximity to each other. Maybe draco couldnt be away from harry for longer than a few hours? I think I remember a scene where harry got back and draco was all tense because they had been away from each other so long. And i think there was another where harry presses his ankle to dracos during class because draco needs the skin contact.

Pls help me find it!!!!

  Draco is a Veela and guess who his mate is? I've tried to write a Veela story where the two don't jump into bed immediately, hence the title. Will contain Dumbledore bashing. HPDM LMSS AU from book 5

*** I'm not sure this is exactly the one I meant but I'm really liking it so far. It's a really good fic and a shame it's not complete.
