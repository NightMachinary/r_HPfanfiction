** Out of curiosity, how is this list generated? Is this like a list we can nominate/vote on? Or is it like how often these fics have been linked to on reddit?

**** Don't actually read Worm stories (just haven't seen the show, so reading fanfiction would be kinda pointless) but considering how many of my favourite authors are switching over.. maybe I should have gotten into the fandom earlier.

** Happy to see On a Pale Horse. I thought it was just me :D Another sadly abandoned fic.

There should be some protocol. "If I abandon this fic (defined as no updates after x time) it can be completed by others". Something like that.

*** Agreed- on the bright side izzyaro just said that they plan to have the next chapter of strange visitors up by the 11th and to have the fic completed by 2022 so that's exciting

Of course then we wait for the sequel at its own pace but honestly- their stuff is worth the wait
