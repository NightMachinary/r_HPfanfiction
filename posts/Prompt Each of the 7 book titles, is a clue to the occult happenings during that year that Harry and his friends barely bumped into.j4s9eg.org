Philosopher's Stone: Suspicious that Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel took the events of that school year, after everything that must have happened to them, to be a sign that they should suddenly accept death.

Chamber of Secrets: The Basilisk was only one Secret, and not nearly the most important, that was let loose.

The Prisoner of Azkaban: How were so many Dementors able to be in the Forbidden Forest that night, when their permanent home is Azkaban? And why did Firenze say Mars is Red-- this seems like a higher portent then just a British Civil War. Are Dementors really at Azkaban only because of a contract with the Ministry? Maybe the true Prisoner of Azkaban... is someone or something that holds the Dementors' loyalty... and maybe Harry and Hermione changed something important when they time traveled.

The Goblet of Fire: We're told that the Triwizard Tournament was inspired by the Ministry wanting to distract the public from its failings. But the structure, the divinely-chosen strongest youths from each of three countries, and the life-riskingly dangerous competitions, is reminiscent of ancient religions that required human sacrifices from their empire's territories. In these, the sacrifice of the strongest and most beautiful youths would complete an ancient ritual that preserved the empire's good graces with its gods.

The Order of the Phoenix: Names matter. Almost every spell has its action as its Latin root. The Order of the Phoenix, obviously has defeating Voldemort as its main goal in the present, but is that its only goal? Was political power the only goal of the Order of the Walpurgis, or did the political tie into the occult? How did Dumbledore end up bonding with Fawkes? Did he ever give up his quest for immortality?

The Half-Blood Prince: The whole book we kind of have the feeling that the "Prince" has some kind of important wizarding lineage, that Prince means royalty or some kind, and then finally we find out that, oh, it's just a coincidence, that's just Eileen's maiden name. Why is it so significant to Snape that he's a half-blood, again? Is being "half-blood" significant to occult blood magic? Is there a deeper reason the purebloods don't want intermarriage?

The Deathly Hallows: Like, again, this book obviously looks like its a book about the 7 Horcruxes, not the 3 Hallows, to Harry. He does unite the Deathly Hallows, but it doesn't matter because he throws them away. But, Dumbledore clearly engineered the plot a little with his 3 gifts from beyond the dead (haha)-- what did he mean to change?
