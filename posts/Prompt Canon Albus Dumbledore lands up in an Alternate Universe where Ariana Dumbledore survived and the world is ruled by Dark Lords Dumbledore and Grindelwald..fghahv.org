*** Tom riddles mother in this timeline kept using the love potion for a bit longer she died after giving birth to him and then tom riddle snr raised him

Tom's father died shortly before he entered hogwarts but he will always cherish the moments they spent together

Tom in this universe was still sorted into slytherin and founded his own social group to oppose the growing power of the grindalwald backed followers in britian.

Tom in this timeline became professor of defence after leaving school and become headmaster by the time of the marauders

with them leaving the school and joining his group there was a civil war in the country with Tom's side narrowly winning against grindalwald supporters.

In this timeline there was a prophecy, but peter did not betray the potters in this timeline the potters where ambushed.

Harry grew up with sirius black and spent alot of time at the weasleys due to sirius becoming fond of arthur during his time in the ministry

***** Well I agree with the Grindlewald HC, Hermione is the only canon muggleborn we know enough of to write about; although I just realised Good!Voldemort likely means Lily Potter lives, so I suppose she could. I mean exclude them, who is left? The Creevey brothers? Although I suppose Moaning Myrtle might live to do it as well. That.. I'm not so sure I'd read.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.
