** There is /Betrayal of the Best Kind/ by Draco664, where the 5th year DADA teacher is a female Ministry employee (a full on Death Eater though), and Fudge spends a full year denying Voldemort's return. The sequel came out after Book 5, and has Peter killed by his silver hand. I also remember some old (likely deleted, since I tried to find it in vain a couple of times) fic where Voldemort returns again, and Harry has to die to keep him dead due to some soul bond they have.

*** [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=290][The Last Dance]] by Sushi and the [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][If You Are Prepared series]] by Cybele both have Voldie and Harry soul bound in this way. Snarry, tissue alert.

I remember that several authors predicted that one (and only one) of the twins would die.

*** There was a story in Hungarian that was also called to be a fan translation of the leaked ending. I haven't fully read it, but a few chapters in we found out that Hermione was Dumbledores's spy who reported everything to him, and later she gave up SPEW after realizing house elves are unhappy without their owners. I guess all of it is pretty toxic.

** I remember a satire fic which kinda accurately reflected the Epilogue. Even the name Albus for one of Harry's kids. This fic came out sometime after GoF. The story is similar to the Epilogue as the characters send their kids to Hogwarts and meet up on Platform 9 3/4. Lupin and Sirius were alive in this one. Can't remember the title.

** One of the oldest Harry/Draco fics around is Transfigurations by Resonant. linkao3(59676) AFAIK it was started before GoF came out and got finished before OOTP. It is set during the re-building of Hogwarts after the war.

So in a way this story predicted the battle of Hogwarts.

I also saw quite a few fics where Harry had to die in some way. In one Harry/Ginny story that I dimly remember he ended up drowning and Hermione rescued him via CPR. Harry was clinically dead for a few minutes, thus fullfilling the prophecy.

** Not fanfic, but recently I was browsing some archives from the "Harry Potter for Grown Ups" mailing list from circa 2000 and people were predicting there that there has been a prophecy that caused Voldemort to go after Harry and also that Snape had been in love with Lily.
