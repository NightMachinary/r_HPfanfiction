I'm looking for a good long and interesting story. I read a lot of fanfiction, so it's getting harder to find something really good. If you have any suggestions, maybe something you discovered that was very good, but not so popular, please share. I have a 10 hour flight tomorrow. (no slash, please)


** How do you feel about Snape/Lily? linkffn(obscura nox animae) has a really unique premise and it's long enough to keep you busy for quite some time!

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

** Seeing as you don't really say what type of fic you'd like beyond it being long, (without giving any range on number of words) and it not being slash, I'm just going to throw out a variety.

I recommend: "Proud" linkffn(11456392), a fic where Harry is raised by a widowed Vernon who doesn't know about magic.

"Breath of Life" linkffn(11038778), a Neville/Hannah fic about their path to parenthood.

"Stronghold" linkffn(11263274), a Percy/Audrey fic about them becoming a couple and recovering from the aftermath of the war.

"Things That Go Bump in the Night" linkffn(9078784) a Snape/Hermione fic, which, if you can get past that, is an actually pretty entertaining mystery story where they work together to solve a murder.

And, finally, "The Unfixables" linkffn(11262352) a Barty/Luna AU fic where an arrangement between the Crouch and Lovegood families leads to Barty and Luna starting a relationship and the two of them dealing with Barty's mental instability together as Luna is pursued by Rolf Scamander, and a girl that could be Barty's daughter trying to start a life in England after the war while figuring out if Barty is her father.

  "People change, you know, and then you find you have less in common with old friends and more in common with the strangest people." Percy had built a tall wall around himself - a stronghold - and the only way it was going to come down was by crashing into someone else's soaring fortress. Perhaps, a collision was exactly what they both needed. Percy/Audrey.

** I've been reading fanfic for about 5 years and just stumbled onto this gem: linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) which is the first in a series of long, interesting books. This is probably the first fic this year that I literally haven't been able to put down.
