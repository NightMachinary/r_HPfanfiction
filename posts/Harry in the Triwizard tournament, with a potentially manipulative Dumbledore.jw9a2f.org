:END:
It's been a while since I've read this fic, so I don't remember all the details (namely to title, go me) but some key points I do remember; 1) Harry has a pet snake 2) It seems both Ron AND Hermione are estranged from Harry because of him being chosen as a champion and Harry is a wee bit less forgiving. Because of this, his pet snake ends up being used as the hostage for the second task. Harry becomes pretty upset about this because it could've killed his pet 3) An addition was made to the second task, the champions were to find things that didn't belong in the black lake. They were muggle items, Harry felt this unfair because the other champions were purebloods and may not recognize that they don't belong. 4) Its decided that Dumbledore tried to cheat for the second task by giving Harry, a muggle raised wizard, an advantage with the addition.

I know it isn't like.. A whole lot to go on? But that's all I remember. It's killing me not being able to find this fic, I don't even know if it's particularly good lmao I just wanna know what it is. Thanks in advance, folks!
