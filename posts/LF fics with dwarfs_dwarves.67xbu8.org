Never knew which is correct. Anyway, bonus points for other races as well.


** Apparently Tolkein wanted dwarfs, but everyone else thought dwarves sounded better.

Or something.

*** Tolkien wrote that in English there is only one correct plural form for 'Dwarf', and that it is 'Dwarfs'. However, he wished to differentiate in the text between then modern 'Dwarfs' (See Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) and the more proud and noble people who lived during the period of his own legends. I think he imagined that fairy-tale Dwarfs like those found in Snow White, inspired by European legends, were a similar people, but so much reduced that calling his own 'Dwarves' by the same name was somehow insulting them. He wanted to draw a line between the comical fairy tale version and his own.

Of course, nowadays you might argue that Tolkienish Dwarves have supplanted old Dwarfs in the public perception, so the choice of plural has become more muddied.

**** Tolkien was a linguist. He was upset that "dwarfs" didn't follow the traditional "f" -> "ves" pluralization (leaf -> leaves, for example).

Linguistically though, it doesn't really matter which one you use, since both are pretty common.
