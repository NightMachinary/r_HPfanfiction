** It is recommended that you read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Iron Lady) before reading this story. Special thanks to [[/u/InquisitorCOC]] for betaing this story. An epilogue to Harry Potter and the Iron Lady will be posted soon linking to the new story.

Expect updates around every 10 days or so, I'm still writing/editing this one despite the long break.

** I will try to give it a read. Your story had been recommended a lot. (It's 5th mention in 2 days). I an afraid to open the link.

Ron and Hermoine centered stories usually turn me off.

*** This one is definitely not centered on Ron and Herimonie. The first one is centered far more on Harry (though Ron and Hermione are important). Really, the only main character in both is Percy, who is far more important than canon.

***** Percy is actually one of my favorite characters in the series to write fanfiction for. That's why he's featured so heavily in both this series and Like a Red Headed Stepchild. He probably won't really show up in Why Time Travel is Wrong and Other Morals just because I'm focusing more on adult wizards, like Dumbledore, Black, Snape, and of course the Weasley parents.
