just like the title says. i read this fic years ago and can't find it for the life of me. like the title says, harry falls into an alternate universe (maybe neville's the BWL but I'm not sure on that detail). One thing that happens is that Draco messes up, but Lucius covers for him and Voldemort has wolves kill Lucius for that mistake. In the end, Harry wakes up and realises his experience was a dream but then he takes the lessons he learned from it to defeat Voldemort for real.


** Is this the one where Pettigrew sacs himself so Harry can escape Voldemort and Harry's got a sister?
