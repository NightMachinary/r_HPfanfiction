I've been considering getting into writing but the one thing I could never quite get down was chapter length, so I'm wondering, what is your preferred length, both for reading and writing


** I think the best advice I received in terms of chapter length is for each chapter to be however long (or short) it needs to be. By all means, plan out your chapters but don't think you have to adhere to an exact word limit. For example, if your goal is for every chapter to be at least 5,000 words long but the current chapter you're working on in 3,500 words, don't force yourself to write the other 1,500 words. Forcing yourself to reach a certain word limit per chapter could be a recipe for disaster. Just let your writing write itself, if that makes sense.

With that being said, some chapters are too short (anything less than 1,000 words) and some chapters are too long (anything more than 10,000 words) so it'd be best to avoid those chapter lengths if you can.

*** I agree with this. The canon rewrite I'm doing has chapters ranging from 4000 words to 9000 words, most chapters so far seem to hover between 6 and 8000 though. I haven't dragged a chapter beyond roughly 9000 words yet and don't intend to do so as that just gets too long, and at that point you start to loose the audience as your likely introducing too much stuff inside the chapter that your not resolving, or you are wasting the readers time with filler words that you don't need

** However long it needs to be.

I've read chapters 30k words long, because if you split them into two, the story wouldn't flow.

I've read a chapter that was 12 words long, and it was one of best experiences I'd had.

** If I read all the story in one go it doesn't really matter that much. If the story takes more than, let's say, one week to update, during that week I'll probably read a load others fanfics, some even with the same concept , so you have to give me something to remember your fic by, otherwise I'll lose interest in it.

Personally I would say: -Everyday= ahahaha you wish -Twice a week = 1k/2k is alright -Once a week= more than 2k, 4/5k would be ideal -Once a mont or more= at least 10k if not more -Once a year= if I'm still waiting on an update after 1 year then it doesn't matter, just give me something.

** As a reader, I'd posit that the /minimum/ length for a chapter should be around 1-2k words, because any less than that and you're basically just writing a single scene. Maximum length is harder to pin down; the only thing I'd say here is that unless you're making a deliberate stylistic decision, they probably shouldn't wildly vary in length. (Good Omens does this well, to give an example.)

That said, as long as something actually /happens/ in each chapter (plot advancement, foreshadowing, character introductions, etc.), you can get away with whatever length you want.

** If a fic is updated frequently I don't mind shorter chapters (2k-4k) but if there's a long wait I much prefer at least 8k.

** I do think this kind of thing depends on the type of fic, and the experience that you want the reader to have. Some of my favourite fics are updated on Sundays, with long sprawling chapters that have Harry or whoever getting things done, but they aren't too stressful.

Other fics are fairly action packed and having shorter chapters helps keep suspense up.

Are you going to update as you go, or are you going to finish it before posting, every day or weekly or bi-weekly, i do think that all of this impacts things like chapter length

** I write chapters that are between 4k and 7k, because that's usually how long it takes me to write 4-5 scenes and when I outline, I put 4-5 scenes per chapter.

When I read I'm more open to variation, though I generally don't like chapters that are shorter than 3-4k.

** Anything longer than 1k and shorter than 10k would be acceptable but personally 3k to 5k is the goldilocks zone for me. Main exception to this are oneshots where i can easily accept over 10k.

** Chapters can be just a couple thousand words long, but I recommend not having chapters longer than 8,000 words (and preferably not more than 6,000). I read a report a couple years ago that said that engagement drops off sharply past that point (folks with reading disabilities find it especially difficult to read e.g. a 12,000 word chapter vs two 6,000 word chapters).

** Here we go again...

There's no "right" answer. Every chapter is different and will serve different purposes in your fic, and everyone has different preferences for what they want in regards to chapter length. Don't try to force a chapter to be longer or shorter than it needs to be, or you'll just add unnecessary filler.

That said, most people have a lower limit of 2k and an upper limit of 20k. I prefer reading chapters between 3k-10k. 15k is pushing it for me unless the author updates sporadically. There's no bigger turnoff than seeing a 50 chapter fic with something like 40k words, or a 10 chapter fic with 250k words.

For writing it's usually 3.5k<x<8k, but if the length stunts the flow of a chapter, I'll cut or add as needed.

** Honestly I just try to imitate real novels which are around 3000-5000 words. So as long as I'm in that ballpark, then I think it's a good chapter. Also make sure that your stuff is quality over quantity. Your readers will thank you.

** The just about only rational argument for how long or short a chapter should be that I can come up with is reading time. Chapters mark places where a reader can put the story down, if you can't leave a bookmark in between two paper pages. So if it takes three hours to read one chapter, but you haven't /got/ three hours, it's annoying.

It's not a really strong argument, though. I suppose there are ways to fix this with whatever software, too.

So, beyond noting that a typical scene is at least a couple hundred words, and usually, you want more than one scene in a chapter, it's the definition of /~whatever/.

** Depends how many things happen in that chapter. I much more prefer shorter chapters with as few as possible words to describe the action rather than a lengthy chapter with unnecessary words in it. If you manage to stay below 5000 words for the regular chapter I will read it. I will read chapter with +10000 words as well if a lot of things happen in that chapter. However to give you an example from canon: the longest chapter is "Detention with Dolores" which comes at +9000 words. The only things that are plot relevant to that chapter are the actual detentions and Hermione coming up with the idea for DA. I think that those two could have been summarized in much fewer words.
