Tired of being hunted, turning the other cheek, disgusted at the spineless and corrupt Ministry letting Death Eaters go free, tired of stupid people preaching reconciliation with terrorists and murderers, the victims of Voldemort's wars /take the law into their own hands/ and kill the Death Eaters who are now without their master.

I don't care how "dark", brutal or ruthless they are. Something like linkffn(Dark Marauder by BajaB) for the Marauders taking revenge for Lily's death.

Time travelers of the second war coming back and drawing a bloody red line through the list of Death Eaters is also fine; like in linkffn(Reunion by Rorschach's Blot; Faery Heroes by Silently Watches).

Stories where Voldemort's forces are crippled because he's lost most of the Death Eaters and the rest are terrified of putting their toe across the line.

Edit: Obviously, nothing nasty like Death Eater apologism or Death Eater pairings. Yes, that includes Snape and Malfoy.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922615/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance]] Harry does not pull any punches in this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2477819/1/Lily-Potter-and-the-Worst-Holiday]] Harry kills them all. Snape is put in his place by Ron but not killed as he is with the Order.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12140398/1/The-Purge]] Graphic Displays of violence

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start]] Harry has killed them before and he will do it again.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19889305]] Outrages so hideous. Harry acts outside of the law as a last resort

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12676941/1/The-Howler]] Harry goes vigilante in 5th year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12820209/1/A-Serious-Hunt]] The war is stopped before it can even begin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts]] Harry becomes a dark lord and hunts down death eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13266686/1/Not-Dumbledore]] The death eaters really should not have gone after Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar]] Ron dies. Harry and Hermione are out for revenge. Snape is ultimately left alive.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13349364/1/Atonement]] every death eater dies in the first chapter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]] A lot of death eaters die in this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]] Harry kills a third of Voldemort's army on his own. Malfoy never became bad and Snape was with the Order.

That is all I can think of at the moment. Hope this helps.

*** Remembered a few more.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10300874/1/Weary-Wizard]] Harry and Hermione kill Malfoy and Snape. Other Death eaters are also killed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good]] Voldemort and death eaters die.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12117770/1/Who-Will-Fill-a-Coward-s-Grave]] and many of his other stuff also kill death eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8418356/1/A-Darkened-World]] and sprinter1988's other stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11782884/1/Not-even-a-first-chance]] Harry comes back as Dobby

That is all I can think of at the moment.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), is IMHO the ultimate revenge fic. In addition to Death Eaters, the Ministry and Wizenmagot were also systematically purged. But that's only the beginning...

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.
