Google translate so you can get more help:

They know a fanfic (in English) where Harry is locked up in Azkaban and when he is released, he pretends to lose his sanity, the only ones who know that he is sane are Remus, Severus and Sirius.

Harry was locked up in azkaban for some time; he goes crazy and after receiving his majority (or maybe it was his inheritance as a child, I don't have a very good memory) he recovers his mental state (or a part of it), because when Severus enters his mind to check if if he was sane he discovers that his mind is damaged and almost completely dead. If anyone knows the name or the link please answer me.
