I don't mind if it's Harry, or not, nor do I have a true preference on what their a genius/master of. As long as said main character is a genius in at least one area, or multiple areas. Like a scientist who's also a spell-crafter for example.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** Linkao3(C'est la vie by cwycross) has Harry time-traveling to an alternate dimension, where he is so proficient in Ancient Runes that he passes his NEWT in 4th year and becomes the Babbling's assistant/whipping boy. The author somehow makes all the cliches still utterly entertaining. /Incomplete/.

Linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher) has Harry as a mad genius/savant who created his own runic language to explain his history to an outsider. /Complete/.

Linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal) has some interesting scenes with Harry attempting to create new spells and magics and the methods involved therein. /Complete/.

Linkffn(Blindness) has Harry as a blind scientist who gains some wildly OP magic insight and abilities that he experiments on to the hilt. /Complete/.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** HPMOR, but it is... polarizing - most people either really love it or really hate it.

IIRC there's a SI fic where the main character does all kinds of fun and interesting magitech, it's crack, but fun crack.

There's also some 'Merica big guns in an RV that he does together with Sirius.

** At a first glance it's the classic Harry is op, has harem, dumbles evil, ron stupid fanfiction. But I think it handles the tropes really well.

And this is honestly the only fic I've ever read (and I've read a lot of Harry/Harem fics) where he is in an actual healthy polyamorous relationship where everyone is an equal and is in love with each other, instead of Harry getting 50 marriage contracts and then binding all of them with his big fat magical core so they love him unconditionally or something.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way!
