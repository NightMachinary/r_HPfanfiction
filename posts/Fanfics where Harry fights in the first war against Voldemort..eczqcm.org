I was curious if anyone knows of any stories where Harry fights in the first war. Preferably as an adult. I have found a few, but not many. Also stories where he fights against Grindelwald. Thanks

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Stepping Back, linkffn(12317784)

​

Harry has to go back into the past after the DoM battle. The wizarding world is screwed because of Voldemort. Too many families wiped out, this causes too many squibs. Throw in the fact that too many Death Eaters got away with it. The British Magical world was on its way to a slow agonizing death.

​

Harry goes back into time for Marauder's Era 6th year? This is right around the same time that Voldemort made his first "public" appearance in recruiting.

​

It has a bit of angst about the whole "look at who people are /now/ instead of who they are in the /future/"

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
