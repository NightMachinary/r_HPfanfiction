/So I posted this prompt over on the DLP forum a little over a year ago, and I decided I might as well post it over here as well, after I noticed it when going through my old posts. Anyways, here goes:/

---

At the night of his resurrection, Lord Voldemort finds to his horror that the blood protection he used to create his new body works a little too well, and that it will even act to protect Harry from itself. Or Voldemort learns that because of the blood protection towards Harry Potter in his system, he actually can't/isn't able to kill Harry, no matter how much he wants to.

This would try to keep everyone with their canon characterizations, the only difference if Voldemort's own body prevents him from trying to harm Harry in any way (an example is that when he aims a spell, no matter how hard he tries, the blood protection makes it so that he keeps missing Harry), even outright forcing him against his will to defend Harry if need be. Also, though Voldemort can verbally ask someone else to kill Harry, his body will then force him to protect Harry, and essentially kill the person he asks to kill Harry.

The closest analogy I can think of to this situation that I could use as a comparison is the three laws of robotics, with Voldemort representing the robot bound by the three laws, Harry the human the laws bound the robot/Voldemort to protect, and the blood protection the laws itself.

Voldemort's goal in the story is therefore trying to find a way to both complete his goals in a way that doesn't bother the blood protection, and to try to make so that the blood protection no longer can control him, thus allowing him to kill finally Harry, while at the same time keeping the benefits of the protection in order to be able to touch Harry.


** I would picture the Blood Protection working too well as making Voldemort burn from the inside out as soon as he steps out of the cauldron.

** Easy: Voldemort just orders some minions to offer the best protection for Harry, which is to dose him with Draught of Living Death, and lock him behind wards magnitudes stronger than Nurmengard.

That way, Harry will be able to live for a very very long time, no harm and disease will ever come to him, and Voldemort will totally abide by the terms of Blood Protection. Another added benefit is that Voldemort gets to keep another Horcrux safe.

Meanwhile, Voldemort can royally fuck over his other enemies!

**** Well, your premise is that Voldemort can't kill him anyway due to blood protection, so the next best option is simply to neutralize Harry Potter without harming him physically.

As I said before, the Horcrux thing is just an added bonus.

** An AU where after Voldemort comes back he's magically compelled to protect Harry at all times would be GREAT. Harry just recklessly endangers himself continuously to prevent Voldemort from doing anything else while everyone else wrecks horcruxes.

*** Is something like

1. They won't let any human be harmed if they can avoid it

2. Always obey humans unless it contradicts rule 1

3. Avoid being damaged if it doesn't conflict rules 1 and 2

*** First Law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law

Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law

Zeroth Law (introduced after the original three): A robot may not harm humanity or, by inaction allow humanity to come to harm.

This is canon, isn't it?

But yeah, when I picture "working too well", I figured you meant that Voldemort's resurrection would fail due to Harry's blood burning him.

*** In canon, Voldemort can't kill Harry, however in this scenario, it's much more extreme as he can't even physically harm him. So he can't even cast a Cruciatus curse at him.

** This was pretty funny up until you made the three laws analogy. Then I remembered how badly that can go for humans and started imagining all the things Voldemort can do to Harry under the auspice of protecting him.
