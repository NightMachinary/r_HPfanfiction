I was feeling bored and wrote an AU one-shot.

A scenario where Sirius had a trial, and a dead 20-year-old James was indirectly responsible for the entire mess.

Give it a read, and tell me how it is! I wrote it in the spur of the moment :p

Doesn't seem as if it was ever done before. With both canon and fanon generally assuming the guy never reecieved a trial. And if he did, he was generally pronounced innocent of all charges.

I also realize there are grammatical errors in it :p I didn't read it over (probably should have)


** I was actually a bit mad at first but then I looked at it from a different angle and started laughing.

Legally though I don't think any will made in that sort would be taken seriously or allowed as the actual official will. Lily also wouldn't have let it happen as well. As funny as this would be, and great job by the way, I think you got James' personality pretty well, I don't think this scenario in any shape or form could happen.

*** To be honest, with how corrupt the magicial court is, I doubt anyone would really care what is used as a will or not. Our modern legal system and the magical legal system can't truly be compared.
