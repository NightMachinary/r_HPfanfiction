** Harry learns programming by doing. No one can decipher his code, not even himself, but it somehow works.

Hermione is upset about underrepresentation of other Beings in the community and spends most of her time drafting increasingly complex Codes of Conduct.

*** Harry write a good code; with proper logic, excellent decomposition, and everything. But he's too lazy to write any documentation.

Hermione's documentation is good, but she write a very verbose code.

Ron's the guy who you called when your code isn't working and he somehow fix it like magic. He basically lives his whole live by codes. His father works as a project leader in a certain open-source that recently gains popularity and his mother make his whole house a smart home using zero money.

The ministry scorns everything open-source, they don't believe that those muggles can create a better code than a proprietary one.

** No way, Snape definitely teaches C, as his rant will be "I will teach you how to write your own compilers, manage your own memory and yes, optimize your code."

The Dark Lord delved deep into asm, creating spells on the fly to meet all of his needs.

Filtwick will develop fancy systems using C++, writing each system from scratch and creating his own multi-threaded containers.

Mcgonagall is in charge of Inheritance, teaching the students the beauty of OOP and how to change a class to another in a few simple steps.

Dumbledore does what mcgonagall do and double down the craziness with template magic. You'll see classes generated even before run-time, calculations done in compile-time and types will never ever be the same again.

With the elder wand, he pushes it one step further with functions that behave as objects and objects that behave as functions. In the end, he will have many tricks up his sleeves and will always be several steps ahead ( due to template being done on compile time ) to foil the scheme of the Dark Lord.

** Harry is mostly a Java/Javascript developer. He's alright, but has a couple problems. First, he isn't able to break down problems very well (decomposition). Second, he solves most of his problems by importing libraries he doesn't understand. For example, most of his Java objects inherit/extend from a LeetLordHorcruxxx.java class (from a library created by: anonymous) and LoveResolver.java class (from a library created by: lilypotter60). He doesn't know what they do, but they sure make a lot of that nasty red syntax highlighting go away. Once Harry learns about Java 8 Streams, he tries to use them to solve all of his problems (he uses it like his old standby: expelliarmus).

Hermoine is actually more of a data architect/DB admin. She knows exactly how to retrieve, structure, and store whatever data a program needs. She worries that other programmers don't use their data correctly. She has very verbose documentation, and often complains that nobody takes the time to read it. She's really good at grep (but Harry doesn't fully know what grep is). In classes, she's one of those kind of programmers who asks the professor about weird semi-relevant fringe cases while they're describing an algorithm. This tends to earn her points from her teachers, but groans from her classmates.

Ron tried his hand at a few programming classes, but didn't really do well in any of them until he started doing HTML/CSS. He has a particular knack for that stuff. One time Hermoine walked in on Ron describing to Harry-- Ron: "So anyway, I found out that if on button-click: I just remove this CSS class from this div, hide it, add the class to this span, do it on a timeout to avoid any 'flickering', and slap a bootstrap animation over it, it looks great and the user is none the wiser!" 

Hermoine: "That's barbaric!!"

Ron: "That's CSS."

One of Ron's main problems is that he can't imagine the user not understanding his interface "Oh come on, nobody's that stupid."
