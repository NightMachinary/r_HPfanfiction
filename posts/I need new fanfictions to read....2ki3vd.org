I was wondering if any of you have any good recommendations for any fics with Rose/Scorpius pairings or even Scorpius/Albus? Or just any fics that you would recommend to someone? Thank you in advance!


** Try [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=272808][Al Potter and his Very Epic Plan]] - a really fun ensemble with the three of them :) I like [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327979][gladly beyond]] for Rose/Scorpius but it's not very shippy. I have other next gen recs [[http://oddhour.tumblr.com/post/42049412559/hey-recommend-other-hpff-fics-like-with-awesome][here]] if you're interested in the era.

An older Harry's gets thrown into a new dimension where he isn't the boy-who-lived. But instead he has a family, friends, popularity, and women.

Adaption/Continuation of Silver Aegis's Harry Potter and New Life.
