When people looking for fics say "No Slash please I'm not homophobic or anything". Today I saw a post and the OP said "No Slash. Im not homophobic or anything but I don't want to see characters I like being gay"(not an exact quote but that's what they said). I realize many of you disagree because you're the ones who do it but as long as you're not masturbating while you read it why does it matter if its slash or het? Same thing for "No het" fics requests but I doubt that ever happens.

Edit: Im not going to fix the quote as I don't want to point fingers at the person who did it.


** I think the only thing wrong with that quote is the "I'm not homophobic or anything..." part. I'm not interested in slash, but I'm also not going to bother explaining myself to strangers on the internet that I'm not homophobic either. Who cares what the people behind the bits thinks about my fanfiction choices?

However, to answer your question, no. It doesn't bother me for the reasons above.

** I don't read slash ever. It's not that i'm homophobic, it's not that I have issues with gay people, it's just not something i'm interested in. Books for me are brilliant because you can see inside someone's mind and reading a book with a gay character doesn't bother me in the slightest if the character is just gay and it's a story.

I take issue with romance and gay characters. To me it's just not interesting, i'm straight and have no desire to read a gay love story because there's just not really anything there for me. Now like I said if the main character is gay and it's not entirely romance orientated that's wonderful and it's not an issue.

Unfortunately in fanfiction there's little point in making Harry gay if it's not going to be a romance story as otherwise it changes nothing. I'm not interested in reading about Harry wildly falling in love with Draco or whoever, I just don't care. I also won't read Hermione/Snape. I vaguely get the appeal, it's just not for me so I don't care about it.

Also Harry being gay would change very, very little unless it's a totally AU story it's the same reason i'll never read a Harmony story with no deviations from canon and many slash fics fall under one year stories that never go anywhere and skip most of the actual plot of the overarching series. On the other hand if the story is AU I don't see the point in Harry being gay and assume the author is and that's totally, totally fine and I get wanting to read about your sexuality (obviously from this post)...but it will likely lead to my next point...

I also have no desire to read a gay love scene, wouldn't read one on a fetish I wasn't into or one with an ex's name in the main story. It's just not something I want to read about from a POV perspective.

Most slash fics also have horrendously unrealistic pairings, i'm sorry but Drarry isn't happening even if they are both gay.

So all things considered it's just not worth checking out a slash story because I know there's going to be /something/ that I don't want to read in it. So when I ask for recs I ask that someone doesn't rec slash.

** I have no problem with somebody recing slash, but I wouldn't read it for the same reason I wouldn't read Snape/Lily. It's icky. Now if there's a tasteful slash relationship between two side characters then that's fine.

I dunno there might be a slash pairing I'm ok with for main characters, but most slash I've seen involves Snape or Malfoy and I dislike both of them.

I'd read something like Sirius/Remus before I'd read Snape/Hermione or Draco/Ginny, but I don't particularly want to read any of them

Want to write a Sirius/Remus story? Go ahead - that's why fanfiction is a thing, so we can imagine a story in a different way. I just don't get why people feel the need to go all Twin Peaks on canon looking for evidence of H/Hr, S/L, evil!Weasleys, or whatever random fanon nonsense. If you're going to write S/L, just go for it. Do you own thing, reach for the stars! Just don't twist canon into a pretzel trying to "justify" it. It needs no justification - it's simply an AU and you get to change whatever you want via authorial fiat.

**** Debating your word-choice, I hope you don't mind /;

Rant:

I think, Johnlock is practically canon, because it's acknowledged by the characters that John and Sherlock act like a couple sometimes, even though they're (theoretically) not.

Crowley/Aziraphale is practically canon, where they've been in each others' lives for 6000 years, have pet names for each other, go for dinner at the ritz together and feed ducks at the park together. And, especially, when they have other characters thinking they're /together/.

R/S, though, is a relationship between two best friends who have lost everyone else, and while the idea of them being in a relationship at some point in their lives is entirely possible and definitely dear to the hearts of many fangirls (and boys), it's not ever acknowledged in the same way by JKR. We never see Sirius and Remus going out for dinner or a walk just the two of them without the other marauders or order members, or at least I don't think we do (but I last read the books when DH came out).

** I don't mind people having certain tastes. I personally prefer stories with het relationships. (Mainly because they're more relatable to me). That being said, I've read and enjoyed the occasional story with same sex couples. Generally, though, I find that the story writing for the main slash fics (HP / SS or HP / DM) tends to be subpar, or not very compelling.

Overall, I don't think certain fics should be discounted, but I'm not really going to begrudge someone for not wanting to read a specific story.

On a side question - I thought that 'slash' referred to any relationship. The posts here seem to imply that it refers only to same-sex relationships. Which is the correct usage?

Not necessarily, which is why I said "chances are". Though if you believe being bi makes you incapable of being homophobic you're mistaken.

It depends on the context obviously, if the spirit of the rest of the post is /"because I don't like those pairings"/ I don't see a problem with adding that little disclaimer to cover your ass from the spoiling-for-a-fight crowd, but if it's just a polite way of saying /"I don't like to see characterX as gay because fags/dykes are icky"/ then yeah, that's a bit fucked up, and adding /"I'm not a homophobe tho LOL"/ doesn't make it any less so.

** It bugs me. Part of it is for the same reason that all pairing warnings bug me--if a pairing is written well enough, I shouldn't need to ship it to enjoy the story. The romance should develop naturally and in a way that, even if I've previously never imagined it possible, I don't doubt that within the confines of the story it makes sense. Whether that's gay, straight, or anything else.

But no lie, part of it bugs me because I'm queer and more often than not, the phrase "I'm not homophobic" comes out of homophobic mouths. (*Disclaimer:* And before anyone wails on me, I'm not saying everyone who says it is a homophobic arse.) It's not always "urgh gay people are /gross/ and /wrong/ and you all need to kill yourselves" homophobia, but "it's fine as long as I don't have to /see/ it" and "not in front of the children!" homophobia. It's this idea that gay people aren't quite as normal as straight people and shouldn't be out in the open, and it fucking sucks. Straight romances are shoved in our faces constantly on TV, books, adverts, walking down the street--gay people should be equally portrayed and those that don't like it need to deal with it.

*Just to be clear* I don't mind if people don't want to read slash. Requests are meant to be about our preferences and if you want to list slash alongside the do-no-wants then fine. I wouldn't consider it any different than my adding a request for no Harry/Hermione or something. But if you insist on adding that you're not homophobic my first thought is going to be, "Well if you're not, why did you feel the need to mention it?"

** Personally I'd much rather have people say "I don't want to see characters I like being gay", because at least that doesn't feel like bullshit excuses. You're being honest about your preferences, and that's fine. Your real-world friends can deal with whatever that says about your lack or presence of homophobia. For people who say "it's not realistic".... It's like sandpaper. I can't stand it. Because that is that reader's opinion superimposed over everyone else, and telling them what they should or shouldn't find valid. "I don't enjoy reading about gay people" is about you and no one else, unlike "it's out of character!" Honestly, people who dismiss anything on the grounds of OOC absolutely baffle me. If you want them to behave exactly as they do in canon, then why on earth are you reading fanfiction. Anyway .-.

Can we spread the word to replace the words "no slash" with the word "het"?! I loathe when authors put "no slash" in summaries because it messes up my search results. If it's not slash, then I don't /want/ your story in my search results, so please don't include the word in your summary! Plus, I totally agree with [[/u/DandalfTheWhite]] about it being like answering a question no one asked.

If they have to say, "No slash, I'm not homophobic", there's where there starts to be a problem, because they are trying to explain away something. The same with if they ask for fic centering around Slytherin characters, and then say "No Blaise, please, I'm not racist or anything".

** I'm hopping onto this thread so late, but I just discovered this thread and I figured I'd tell the abyss of reddit my opinion.

It's actually really weird for me to read through all of these posts on this sub with primarily het recs or preferences. Mostly because when I started dabbling, I began on ao3 which is essentially all slash. Plus my fanfiction reading spawned from being obsessed with the TV show Supernatural, which anyone can tell you is only guys. If you want a het pairing there, you really have to stretch for it.

So for me, I'm the opposite of a lot of the commenters here. I'm straight (and female) and prefer slash. Not that I have a hand in my panties while a Hogwarts-wide orgy occurs or anything, I just often hate the way female characters are written romantically. I've read far too many bodice ripper romance novels that I fear the het romance genre of reading holds no surprises. And I don't mean this in an anti-feminist manner at all, because I love strong female characters. I just have gotten so sick of the innocent giggling virgin girl trope, that having both characters be gay males makes everything a little more fresh.

Once I started reading slash heavily, then het just felt unsuccessful. Unfulfilled. I struggle with reading Harry/Hermione because they often don't have nearly the chemistry of Harry/Draco. I tend to avoid all Harry/Ginny stories because they tend to stick so closely to canon that I can predict all of the plot points.

Tldr; sorry for posting when I'm sure everyone is done reading this thread. I just find it amusing that I'm biased in the opposite direction, avoiding het stories even with the strongest recommendations.

** It does bug me too. I've seen the ‘no het' occasionally but seeing the ‘no slash' tag in a summary of the fic or whatever pretty much makes me think that a 13 year old is writing it and shouting ‘no homo' every time Harry and Ron do so much as talk.

I don't mind it in requests. I mean you request something you want and there's nothing wrong with not wanting slash (or het) when your looking for something to read. But seeing ‘no slash' or ‘no het' in in a summary of a fic is a turn off got me. It's like the author is answering a question I didn't ask.

It's just not a big deal to me, slash, het, who cares? If it's well written and a well thought out plot, I don't care if you pair Harry with Dumbledore. (I'd not read any sex scenes there, but hey I'd try it if it was recced to me.)
