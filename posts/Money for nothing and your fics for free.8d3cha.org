** Usually writers are full of ideas and many of us are short on time to write our own ideas completely. I don' think you will find too many writers who are just looking for ideas, but if your idea is really original and exciting writers just might take you up on the offer. And like someone already mentioned, you are free to post a writing prompt.

***** You only need to pay them enough for them to try again until you get what you want. That endeavour might cost you a couple grand, however. It would be probably cheaper to take a professional writing class, but never say never.

** There might not be many takers, if any, for your offer. Writing is time and effort, and most people will probably want to write their own stuff.

But here's a writing secret: *It's practice, not talent.*

That means that the more you do it, the better you get at it. So don't be discouraged! There are a ton of terrible fics out there, and those are your bar to clear.

The best things you can do to improve the skill (besides writing) are:

- Refresh grammar skills.
- Refresh/learn common spelling mistakes.
- Learn proper story formatting.
- Read both (published) fiction and nonfiction.

A tip specifically for /fanfic/:

- Go over the source material again.
- Look at popular fics and tropes, then do your own twist on them.
- Use a reliable canon database to look up different things.

Fandoms often accumulate headcanons, trends, and fanon that isn't in canon. This can lead to a lot of cliches, or distorted views on what's "really" canon.

The best database for HP is the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/][Harry Potter Lexicon]] since the folks there pay very close attention to canon. The [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][Harry Potter Wiki]] exists, too, but it mixes up book and movie canon, along with a variety other sources, and is less reliable because of that.
