I always think Hermione could have done so much more in the books and movies, and when she did, her actions were either overshadowed or underplayed. It can be Grangerverse, or really just any female character that is the protagonist, can be OC. Can have short pairings but no permanent or all-encompassing ones. Please and Thank you!


** Granger Verse has interesting ideas, but it doesn't seem to do much with them and often has too much of a good thing.

Y'know, in the movies, they took some of Ron's best scenes and lines and gave them to Hermione, even when it didn't make sense...

Anyway, here are my recs; I might add more later:

- Off FF.net:[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived by Diane Castle]]. (Note that it has canon 'ships, but it's not "shippy".)
- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacbok)
- linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19)
- linkffn(The most gifted witch of her age by Bagge)
- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah): has language issues, and YMMV
- linkffn(The Snow Queen by Darklooshkin)
- linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) and its sequel.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
