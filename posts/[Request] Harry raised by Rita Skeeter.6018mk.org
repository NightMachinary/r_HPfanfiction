I don't know how there is not one of these, I think that would be hilarious, harry gets raised to become the most poisonous reporter of all time, No ones secrets are safe.


** linkffn(12376384) Has it (well, post-CoS at least), but it's sadly only one chapter in with no updates since it was published. It looks very promising.

*** Its... okay-ish. Not gonna judge too harsh after only one chapter. But "King's Crossing" and "to be examined at Gringotts" as well as Rita berating Harry for "giving the Weasleys the chance to legally steal from him" makes some red lights flash up. It sounds like a bash-fic in the making, and the AN hits in the same vein.

I followed, hoping that I get a 2nd chapter to judge.

**** Yes, however it does acknowledge that characters can have more than one motivation (Rita Skeeter), which is a step-up from from the usual fics. If the Author builds on that it might be a rather good fic. Well, if there is an actual story there.

***** Oh, definitely. Having a character like Rita be anything but a obnoxious, venomous muckracker is a very big good point for any fic.

  If there's one thing Rita Skeeter is good at, it's sniffing out a story, and when she sees a downtrodden Harry Potter at King's Crossing, by Merlin does she find a story! One that will change the face of the Wizarding World, Harry Potter, and even Rita herself. Harry was always more Slytherin than Gryffindor, really, and with someone to grow those traits...they won't see it coming.

** Could be interesting, especially if Rita herself is conflicted on how to report on the various shenanigans Harry gets up to.
