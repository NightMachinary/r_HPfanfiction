I must admit to being a big fan of the cliches, at least the well written ones! So give us the best of: Harry kept in the dark about his lordship(s) Weasley/dumbledore stealing from him Harry shops/trains, gets custom made wand etc Blocks on magic core/abilities Helpful goblins

Bonus points if they include deatheater killing and developed occlumency usage (dumdum, snape and moldy uses legillimency 24/7 when near him, idiotic not to know it!) Bonusbonus if its 100k+ word fic!

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** linkffn(A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned) uses a lot of common tropes and still ends up being pretty decent.

linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) uses a lot of common tropes too, but there's plenty of originality there as well.

Honestly if you want to read decent fics that read as very tropey or cliche, just check out (or re-read) some of the older fics -- pre-2009 -- that defined today's tropes and cliches.

The prominent examples being things like linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land by serpant-sorcerer; A Black Comedy by nonjon; Taking Control by fake a smile)

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
