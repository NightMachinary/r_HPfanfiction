:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading a fanfic a while ago, but I can't seem to find it again fsr... I thought it was entitled "Harry who?" but evidently I was wrong. It was about harry potter being a supposed imposter and being caught at gringotts as an imposter of potter's heir. Can't tell more because that's all I got up to :(

  When Harry arrives at Gringotts, Hagrid produces the key but there's nothing else proving that the child is Harry Potter. What if there is a dark story behind the origin of the Boy-Who-Lived. Bashing Potters, Sirius and Dumbles. Good Goblins and Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. HEA in the end.
