I've read many fics, and looking for something new. Only long fics, ideally 300k+, with Harry who is witty, smart, powerful, royal, political in any combination. Basically, kickass hero :)


** Amalgum - Lockheart's Folly is awesome. Harry takes Gilderoy's place and makes a better Gilderoy than Gilderoy himself. It's awesome and funny.

** Linkffn(Saving Connor)

This is a huge series, even if it's a Drarry, the focus is not as much on them as it is on Harry. His brother Connor is the BWL, and it's amazing. Highly recommend reading all 7 fics.
