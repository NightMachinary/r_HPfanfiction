the most used time traveler is Harry, but for Harry, the war was won. some people died, but none of his best friends or girlfriend. he defeated Voldemort, I don't think he would want to do that one more time. so unless the outcome of the war is AU in that fic or the time travel is accidental, then Harry doesn't make sense.

Draco, who didn't win the war, but he did want that outcome, he wasn't persecuted, his mother escaped azkaban as well, I don't know about his father but... he also didn't lose his riches if we go by his character in the epilogue.

Hermione is also pretty often used, but she makes even less sense.

by canon, the person who would try to fix something about the war and be able to the most (from the winning side, so not death eaters), is... George. he lost his twin brother. I don't think people without twins can imagine that, but having a twin myself, it is your second half. your best friend and family in one. the other you.

the twins were incredibly clever and creative. I wouldn't imagine Harry manufacturing something. Fred and George had already multiple products made by the time they left school. they made their own potions (not just brewed, invented), and lots of other magical merchandise. Draco used the peruvian darkness powder in sixth book and no lumos could break through. I think George would try his best to turn time back and fix this one death, and he could actually succeed in it, based on his character's brilliance.

a.k.a., why isn't there a fic where George time travels to save Fred. as Ron's brother, he would also be informed about what was happening with the horcruxes and such so he would have knowledge to fix other stuff as well. not to mention it would be a fresh POV it being the twins, because of course he would tell Fred everything, why wouldn't he. twins POV fics are so rare in the first place. and if he traveled to the time they still had the map, they could use that as well.


** Fred and George are just really hard to write. I can see why Rowling used them as a spice, not a main ingredient. Sorry I haven't updated this in a while: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23568460/chapters/56543527]])

  Part 1 of The Computational Error Series. George Weasley may be 40 years old now, but he still misses his twin dearly. And when he has the chance to go back to 1989 and see Fred alive again and stop everything from happening, he can't resist. George's relationship with everyone he loves, however, will change in the process. Time Travel. NoSlash. COMPLETE

  The Weasley family is deep in mourning after the battle of Hogwarts, but George has better ideas than to sit around and cry about something he'd rather just fix. And Charlie believes he can do it. Post DH, Charlie's POV.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]

** Counterpoint it really only makes sense for those who know about horcruxes to go back as only they can ensure a different outcomes- the rest don't know how to make Voldemort mortal and cannot end the war any earlier- furthermore george might be afraid to go back without knowing how to end the war because due to his inability to end the war earlier he may make things worse and get more of his siblings killed or worst case scenario force an early harry-voldemort confrontation before harry learns everything he did and Dumbledores last plan backfires on Voldemort and harry dies and the whole war is lost and the weasleys are in an even worse position than only losing Fred as death eaters likely would do all sorts of stuff to torture them emotionally after they win

** That's actually cool.

Although, there are some points in which I disagree. For starters, fuck yea Malfoy has a reason for wanting to time travel back and change stuff. He's still going to be discriminating against. He's still going to be attacked by self-righteous shits who don't think he got what he deserved and think that they have the right to give him his 'punishment'.

I can totally see Harry time traveling. Remember, the war was won but he still lost people. People who's deaths he would probably feel responsible for. So yea, I can definitely see him going back and changing stuff.

Hermione? Not exactly sure. I mean, if you gave me some reasons I might be able to counter them or agree, but I have nothing at current. I don't agree, but I don't disagree either.

If you want some good time-traveling fics, I recommend

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?
