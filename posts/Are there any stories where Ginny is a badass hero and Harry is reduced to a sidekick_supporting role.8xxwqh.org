I'm looking for Ginny true to her OOTP characterisation, not the dull love interest from the later books or the generic sports star/mother/journalist from the epilogue and Pottermore.

Preferably with no Ron/Hermione or Happy Weasley family in the background.


** I feel like I write a reasonably strong Ginny character. In my AU, Ginny has a thing about helping magical creatures out of sticky situations. Ginny is the primary actor in these and Harry is mostly along for the ride. The latest one of these is The Ghost of the Redcoat where Ginny has to re-home a ghost. Warning: Explicit.

  Ginny is in Boston for a conference and gets more than she bargained for when she buys Harry a gift.

** I think [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128050][Bonds of Blood and Magic By Duelist]] might fit in your request.

Because of, let's say Harry's physical limitations he suffered right at the beginning of the story, Ginny is the slightly dominant part of a couple of equals. Sadly, the last two or three chapters of the pretty long story are still missing.
