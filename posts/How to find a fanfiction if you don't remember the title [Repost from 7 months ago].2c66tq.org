It's a self post, so no karma for me, but I hope this can help you:

There's a ton of people here looking for fanfictions they read a long time ago, but can't remember the name of. A good way to find this is using the " " function in a Google search.

Put any words you know were used in a specific fiction on a single page(even the tiniest thing), along with the name of the archive, and if you keep trying different combinations, it'll eventually show up. To give an idea of how powerful this can be, I once found a fic almost solely on the fact that I remembered characters eating yogurt and almonds.

For example: I'm trying to find HPMOR, but I can't remember the actual title. However, I remember that it's on fanfiction.net, it's popular, and it has a ton of science. Enter this into Google like this: "Harry Potter" "fanfiction" "science" and it comes right up.

Another, less common example: One of my favorites, Harry Potter and the Guardian Wand. I remember that it includes lots of discussion of EMP's, magically changed seeds, and a few other unusual things. It was also on Fanfiction.net. I entered in "Harry Potter" "fanfiction" "Emp", and it came up as the 2nd result. Had it not come up, I would have tried several different things that I remembered from various parts of the story


** Thanks for the search tips. On the flip side of the coin though, I have discovered more than a few that I enjoyed through people posting here seeking help remembering the title.

*** I agree. I also find that, especially for older fics, sometimes they've been taken off the net, and one needs to locate an author's name or specific archive to find it, and this comm is good at that!

** I kept a running list of my favourite fics with links when I was really reading a lot. That doesn't help you find something you are looking for but it helps prevent losing it in the first place.

*** Of course! An ounce of prevention is a worth a pound of cure, but even then, this list could help if you don't have descriptions of each fic under the link.
