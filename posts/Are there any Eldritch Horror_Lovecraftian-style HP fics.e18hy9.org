It's a weird subgenre of fanfiction that I really enjoy, mostly just to see how you can manage to seek in that cosmic, existential horror into a fandom you might not expect. For instance, there's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14572500/chapters/33674223][this]] from the BNHA fandom. But in my attempts to scour AO3's tags for it in the HP fandom, I've not had the best success.

Can ya help a pal out?

** There are a surprising amount of them, yeah. None where Harry is oblong though, just weird and esoterically mind-bending. :)

Firstly, my personal favourite is a series called 'The Master of Death, Eldritch Abomination' - [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/532063]] - where Harry got the Hallows and became Eldritch over a long period of time.

There's 'It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I feel fine)' - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12748842/1/It-s-the-End-of-the-World-as-We-Know-It-And-I-Feel-Fine]] - where Harry is sorta half Lovecraftian God-Thing. It's quite a comedic attempt at Lovecraft. Emphasis on attempt. :D

I'm not sure if Monstrous counts - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12754810/1/Monsterous]] - but he's relatively demonic in that, IIRC. I think it might've been for Eldritch-ey reasons?

If you don't mind crossovers, there's The Master of Death - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7779108/1/]] - which is a crossover with the Dresden Files.

The Nightmare Man is another 'sort of but not quite what you want' thing - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/]]

I have to run for an appointment rn, but I think I've got more somewhere so I'll check when I'm back.

** There's linkffn(9911469) which starts out with a bit of a Lovecraftian feel though it moves into a bit more of a comedic tone as the story goes on. Cosmic horror elements remain but aren't shown to the reader in that tone. The problem is that the POV character is effectively the Eldritch Horror but doesn't see it in those terms. So, you have lots of events happening that would be straight out of Lovecraft and many side characters reacting appropriately but the POV is reacting as though it is no big deal.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
