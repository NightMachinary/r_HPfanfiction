** In my alma matter a class president reported his classmates for being anti-goverment. Here that's serious. The students he reported were incarcerated, they have been tortured in jail. So other classmates beat the class president. He ended up in the hospital with several broken bones.

So, should we implement beating as a method of punishment? No. But he doesn't get my sympathy. Thanks to him several of his classmates were arrested and are being tortured. They can beat him all they want, I don't care.

Edit: I'm not making this one up, I'm unsure if I can find anything in english on this specific case in a sea of human rights abuse going on here, but you can google SOSNicaragua. There are plenty of similar examples.

** While Marietta retained some scarring, I can't picture it out and out spelling 'Sneak' like the acne did unless she really kept at scratching it, I'd imagine it'd just look like scars from acne that any number of regular people have, if slightly more focused.

And usually scarring/branding is considered barbaric because it's perpetrated through violent/painful means, and was used in repressive societies to mark criminals/wrongdoers in such a way that it essentially precluded them from being free from the taint of their past. This isn't the case here, it was perpetrated through nonviolent jinxwork, in retribution for ratting them out to an authoritarian agent of misery who herself was putting people through painful self-scarification for not being 100% devoted to the regimes BS speil.

None of that even touching the brands associated with Voldemort and his Death Eaters inflicted upon themselves for decades, and upon undesireables such as Hermione (which you can view as poetic justice if you like), or even whatever wizarding ailments leave scars such as smallpox did until fairly recently. Then yeah, Marietta can deal with some minor freaking blemishes.

About his hand- that does make some sense.

Tattling to a teacher in school isn't "collaborating with an authoritarian regime". Get off your high horse.

AFAIK, only three students had that done to them - HP, Lee, and Colin - and they didn't advertise their mutilated hands to anyone. Among Harry's friends, only HG found out about it. Marietta couldn't have known about the hands thing as HP somehow conceals it throughout the year - literally no one else knew about it, not even Cho, who went on a date with him.

And, it isn't as if the students complained to anyone about their punishments, did they? If they'd actually gone to their teachers or parents, it could have been stopped, but they didn't and continued carving their hands like morons. All they needed to do was write to their parents or tell them when they went home for holidays, but they didn't.

How specific would you make it, considering they're in a magical school? Does talking about curses trigger it? Does asking Umbridge about curses trigger it?

It might make sense to you, but not to me. The stakes were already as high as they could go. Prison for life was on the table. Expulsion was on the table. Wand-snapping was on the table.

So you think Marietta would have used HINTS , not even actually telling them anything, but HINTS and everyone would take her seriously and be able to break the curse without even knowing what the cursed object was?

And even if that happened, by that point people would have understood there has been a betrayal, someone would have noticed that Marietta was gone and that something suspicious was going on. Especially Cho who was her friend, would have noticed that something weird was going on and she would have told Harry. Therefore, it's likely they would have learned about the betrayal either way and the results would have been the same.

I, personally, don't think that acne is bad at all, and there's zero evidence that Hermione intended the scarring. That only really happens if you pick at the acne, you know? I don't accept that there was no way to cure it (especially from Hermione herself). If Edgecombe was too scared to approach Hermione to ask for it to be cured, then, frankly, that's on her.

  So you think Marietta would have used HINTS , not even actually telling them anything, but HINTS and everyone would take her seriously and be able to break the curse without even knowing what the cursed object was?
#+end_quote

Yes. Anyone would be able to pick up on the hints, and Curse-Breakers routinely raid cursed tombs. I doubt anyone knows what the curses in there are ahead of time.

#+begin_quote
  And even if that happened, by that point people would have understood there has been a betrayal, someone would have noticed that Marietta was gone and that something suspicious was going on. Especially Cho who was her friend, would have noticed that something weird was going on and she would have told Harry. Therefore, it's likely they would have learned about the betrayal either way and the results would have been the same.
#+end_quote

...Why would anyone think that was suspicious? People were being pulled out of school left and right, including, if I remember correctly, at least one case where nobody knew that they would be taken out. They were just gone one day. Cho knew that Edgecombe's mother was getting pressured by the Ministry, so it would make sense to just take her away. Which, by the by, would have solved everything if she actually had.

Although, I suppose someone /truly/ paranoid could invent a new curse, and then arrange for that curse to be triggered by revealing its existence in general. But in this case that is both overkill and insufficient (you don't want a traitor to reveal that they are under an unspecified curse).

We know from the example of the Mirror of Erised that it is possible to use a specific intent to trigger a magical effect. The mirror was configured to produce the stone only for someone who wanted to retrieve it, but did not intend to use it. Similarly, Hermione /should/ have designed her cursed paper so that any action with the intended result of someone outside the DA finding out about it, without the consent of the DA leadership, would trigger the curse. Conspicuously reading a book about secrecy curses in Umbridge's class is right out.

Furthermore, the curse should have obliviated any knowledge of the DA, or maybe the entire last 6 months if Hermione couldn't manage something that specific or couldn't be sure the members couldn't be identified by the holes. (She's totally ruthless enough to do that, which is what this whole discussion started out about.)

That way the curse would /actually prevent/ someone from betraying the DA, instead of only identifying and punishing them after the fact.

*************************** You have no idea how much control Hermione has over the terms that trigger the curse. The Mirror of Erised is a centuries-old artifact that has never been reproduced, and Dumbledore placed that enchantment on it specifically under the belief that Voldemort would never figure out how to break it. That's very far above Hermione's weight class.

There's every reason to suspect that the curse is triggered in a similar way to the Fidelius Charm, where only by speaking specific words of betrayal can it be tripped. Furthermore, we don't know how much control Hermione had over the results of the curse. She might have just found a spell that said "Yeah, so, cast this on a list and figure out your trigger phrase - if someone on the list says it, they get a pimple pattern on their face that says 'SNEAK.'"

Also, and here's a big fucking thing that everyone seems to overlook - ACNE IS NOT A BIG DEAL. It wouldn't have scarred if Hermione had been able to undo it, which she couldn't because she was busy dealing with the fallout of Marietta's betrayal. There's a huge gap between erasing large swathes of memory from people, and a reversible enchantment that makes you embarrassed. I /don't/ think that she's ruthless enough to do that - her stunt with her parents wasn't Obliviation, it was Memory Modification, which could easily be undone.

And so, again, it's better to have an unknown alarm system that lets you know you have been betrayed than an upfront threat that can be worked around.

If we're talking about scars, why not talk about Harry's 'I must not tell lies' scar? Edgecombe tried to sell Harry out to the one who put it there, but Harry took it because it meant that evil wouldn't win. What about Harry's lightning bolt scar?

How about Hermione getting trapped in the hospital wing for weeks because of a failed Polyjuice potion taken in pursuit of the Heir of Slytherin?

Harry told them what happened in the graveyard, and Cho Chang was her best friend. I'm pretty sure everyone knew that Arthur got attacked, too - why would they keep that quiet? Umbridge was abusive toward everyone, not just Harry - he was the only one she scarred, but she delighted in tormenting Hermione, Neville, and Trelawney, too. And when Dumbledore himself told everyone that Voldemort was alive... well, everyone had a choice as to what they would believe. Edgecombe chose wrong.

The idea that the roster for a group opposing a corrupt regime and trying to prepare the students enrolled in it for the war on the horizon had to be kept secret at all costs isn't exactly Ender Wiggin levels of strategy.

Hermione didn't scar Edgecomb's face. She didn't force her to give up the DA. As Cho says, Marietta's parents were in the Ministry, and so she was facing pressure from that sector, but as Hermione shoots back, so were plenty of other DA members. Hermione simply put a hex on the list that Edgecomb signed.

Bear in mind, nobody forced Edgecomb to sign the damn thing. She did it of her own free will, /after/ Harry made it clear that the reason he was establishing the club was so that they could be prepared for Voldemort's return. She was, quite literally, sabotaging the Voldemort resistance effort. Hermione never singled her out.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that there /needed/ to be some kind of unpleasant and immediately obvious way to spot a traitor, and giving her pimples that spell out "SNEAK" was a pretty good way to do that. Harry himself says that he thinks it was "brilliant." Hermione might not have known that she'd try to pop them and scar herself, or that Madame Pomfrey wouldn't know how to cure it.

I think I posted on here somewhere before under a different username about how, for all we know, the hex could have been reversible had Edgecomb approached or apologized to Hermione, but instead she avoided the DA group for several years, trying to hide the pimples with makeup.

But, and this is very, very important here, Edgecomb was trying to take a selfish action that would have permanent consequences for people she'd promised to help. Getting some damn acne scars is honestly getting off pretty light.

I think she was too ashamed to go to anyone for help. Some scars remained because she tried to pop them herself. Until or unless we get confirmation from Rowling herself that Dumbledore was unable or unwilling to cure her, something that would be mind-bogglingly unlikely and out of character for him, we have to assume that she didn't go to him.

Again, this was not a legal contract. This was a resistance movement's formation.

No, the fact that they could be treated doesn't mean that the scars don't remain. It might mean that the healers can prevent the curse from doing something even worse. Like, sure they even put a bandage on George's ear to "treat" it. It doesn't mean he ever got his ear back.

Your assumption that Marietta never tried to be healed is absurd and makes no sense. Why wouldn't she tried to be healed? Even if she just felt remorse and accepted that she was scarred for life, surely at some point she would have seeked professional help . In fact, if she just never asked for help, I would say that is even MORE horrifying and sad.

As I have repeatedly stated, I think that she waited too long out of shame, after which it was too late to get them healed. Supporting this:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It's a thoroughly nonmagical injury that nonetheless never got healed. If a scar is there for too long, then apparently magic can't heal it. Hagrid was trying to keep Grawp a secret, so he didn't seek treatment. We see Marietta trying to hide the results of the curse with makeup after the initial excitement. She tried to hide it during the confrontation with Umbridge as well. I think she was too ashamed to seek help until it was too late and the scars had set in.

It was clearly both an alarm and punishment, but mostly an alarm. Can you prove that there was a better way to set an alarm? We know the Fidelius doens't have a better way, and that's supposedly the best there is. But, my initial point was "what proof do you have that if she'd known about the curse she wouldn't have betrayed them, instead of just finding a way around it or having someone undo it then betraying them?"

***** Yup. If Hermione randomly scarred her for no reason, it would be unquestionably wrong. But Hermione did not curse her or another DA member. She cursed a list with a spell which was triggered by treason. And everyone knew that Umbridge tortured people, was establishing an authoritarian regime and later played a leading role in a genocide.

And while I am not suggesting capital punishment for Marietta, she did more to endanger the war effort than pretty much everyone else who was not a Death Eater and/or a war criminal.

Anything that Harry is part of is automatically part of the anti-Voldemort movement, purely because everyone knows Voldemort wants to kill him. Harry was put into a very obvious kangaroo court earlier that year, with the intent to snap his wand and throw him in a cell. Edgecombe knew all of that.

The fact that "Sirius" broke out Death Eaters from Azkaban proves that there's a need for students to know how to defend themselves. Sirius was supposedly obsessed with killing Harry - "He's at Hogwarts," remember? The Lestranges tortured the Longbottoms into insanity.

No, the Minister with the backing of the Parliament relieved its Speaker (or ex-officio chairman) from his duty because he was making ludicrous claims. Saying that Voldemort was back with flimsy, circumstantial evidence is rumourmongering.

They didn't do a power grab, the government thought that the standards of the school were slipping - which was the truth. Five years with five successive Defence teachers, two of which suffered mysterious accidents, one werewolf, and one kidnapped for nine months. Literally any state government would look into something like that. Hogwarts falls under the Ministry's jurisdiction, since it is the Ministry of England.

The Ministry was well within their rights to step in - I'd be surprised if they didn't after all the shit that went on Hogwarts. Dumbledore literally treated it as his playground during HP's time.

And don't go on about veritaserum or pensieves or any of that crap. If someone makes a claim, the onus is on that person to provide actual proof. Neither Dumbledore nor Harry do this, and expect the rest of the country to fall in line.

See, this is your problem - you have no idea of the sequence in which these events happen. You're just listing out the events that happened in the fifth book. Marietta tattles on the group long before the Death Eaters escape from Azkaban. When she goes to Umbridge, there were no Death eater breakouts from prison.

You're also wrong when you say that the reason behind the DA is a group against Voldemort. The sheer ridiculousness of child soldier groups aside, the main reason why people attended the DA in the beginning was to get a decent grade for their Defence exams. Most of the students did not believe Harry when he claimed Voldemort to be back from the dead.

You seriously need to take a step back and listen to the shite you're saying. There's not a sane man in the world who would think that tattling on a study group in a school is somehow equivalent of treason. You either have no clue what treason is, or are purposefully being a troll.

Yes, I think Harry was fucked up for casting the Unforgivables, especially the one on a Goblin civilian. I don't blindly hate characters, I'm not focused on just Hermione, if you're getting at that. Don't try to insinuate it. I see the problems all characters have.

************* You said you're not singling her out. I am honestly curious what you think about the other characters - whether or not you consider Hermione's actions worse than the actions, and especially the inaction about slavery, of everyone else. Take Harry - he cast Unforgivables, attempted to cast the Torture Curse twice, once just because the intended victim had spit at Professor McGonagall. And he wasn't exactly on board with the anti-slavery campaign either. Is that meaner than Hermione's actions?

************** Actions do not cancel out other actions. Hermione's actions are bad, Harry's actions at times are bad too. Everyone's actions are bad for endorsing slavery at the same time. It is not "zero sum". It doesn't matter if it is "meaner" or not. I do think Sirius and the Dumbledore and the magical world have issues with supporting slavery. Yes, I think Harry was fucked up for casting the Unforgivables, especially the one on a Goblin civilian.

*************** Actions do not cancel each other out - but if you judge a person, you need to take into account both the circumstances of the actions in question and the person's goals and morals. Hermione acted to protect and avenge her friends in most of the situations you quoted, and compared to the threat Harry was under in the match and when Marietta betrayed him, Hermione's actions were rather mild. Marietta deserved far worse for what she did and Snape wasn't even hurt. Rita, too, deserved her ordeal for what she made Hermione go through. Maclaggen is questionable - but he was an ass. All in all, I don't see anything worth writing home about, compared to other characters. Certainly no real cause to hate the character, as you professed to be doing, if we take Hermione's tireless work to help others into account.

**************** Rita's still doesn't seem proportional to me. She got kidnapped in a jar for invading privacy and writing bad news articles a few times? :( You can't just go kidnapping people for writing bad newspapers. If someone did that in real life they'd be in prison real fast.

***************** Rita deliberately lied and riled people up by portraying Hermione as a gold digger who broke Harry's heart, leading to people sending her a letter with buotuber puss. She also attacked Harry while he was in the middle of the tournament, adding to his considerable stress. Rita is a despicable person.

She's also a criminal - she broke the law by being an unregistered animagus as well as invading the privacy of people. That would have earned her Azkaban. Compared to that, spending a little time in a jar was her getting off lightly.
