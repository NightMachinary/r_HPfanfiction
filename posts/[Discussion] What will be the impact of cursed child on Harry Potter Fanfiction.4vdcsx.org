** I've read the summery of Cursed Child and to me it sounded like a fic. Slightly longer and more complicated but definitely similar to the ones I have read about the next generation.

There will probably more Bellatrix/Voldemort now that it is confirmed. Plus writers will maybe make the personalities of Rose, Albus and Scorpius more similar to those in CC.

I think the impact won't be big seeing as most people seem to hate it (as far as I have seen). Most don't even consider it canon.

Which doesn't surprise me. I mean, yeah, sure, Rowling-approved; but written by someone else, and violates one of the rules of that created world, a rule that Madame Rowling herself talked about.

And with that, it might as well have been called “Harry Potter: The Play: Official Fanfiction: Return to the Future: Cursed Child”. And yes, the title is supposed to be half a joke and half a mockery. As I hadn't the possibility of watching the play, for those who did I hope that at least the effects were decent.

** Not much on this sub, given how people responded back then: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4nihhp/effects_of_cursed_child_on_fanfics_major_spoilers/]]

But in the general fandom, I do expect many writers to pick up things mentioned in the Play. Scorpius will become a fan favorite, and tons of Scorose and Scorbus fluff fics will appear.

** I think people will pull parts from it that they like and that agree with their head-canon. I don't see it having much of an impact though.

** In my opinion, it will have little to no impact on the stories we have right now. It will have a noticeable effect on next-gen fics, and give them more canon to work from, but also restrict them.

** When the spoilers first started leaking I was horrified. I honestly felt betrayed by the scale of the retcons necessary. I thought it might be th end of my participation in the fandom, never mind the fan fiction works I had in progress.

But then I realized that as much as I despised /this/ story what it *did* do was render any and all AUs possible/valid. By retconning the lore on time turners it made anything as likely to happen as anything else.

So for all I loathe and despise every story and plot detail I have heard I am still inspired by the floodgates of possibility it opens.

** Very little. The fandom's been stable for a long time, and the play is unlikely to change that.

** Don't know, don't particularly care. But don't think it will be large.

** I think the impact will be mostly on the canon-compliant post-epilogue stories, especially for the personalities of the kids. But besides that I don't think we will see any lasting impact.

** I hope we get more fanfictions that focus on Harry's journey as a parent. I am intrigued by the theme of Harry's abusive childhood impacting his ability to parent, or his comfort with parent-child interactions. I'd like to read more about it.

** I hope and pray that it brings some long retired authors out of retirement whether they enjoyed CC or not. I hope it will bring infrequent writers back to being more active in writing again. I think I may cry tears of joy if Miranda Flairgold or Jbern or even S. S. Idget update their stories. So many great stories abandoned waiting for their author's to return. That's what I've wished for since I heard CC and Fantastic Beasts would be coming out, I doubt it will come true, but a guy can wish.
