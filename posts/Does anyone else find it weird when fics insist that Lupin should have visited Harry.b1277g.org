I've come across a lot of fanfics that either implicitly or explicitly state that Remus Lupin should have looked in on, or visited Harry, or should have in some other way taken care of him during his childhood.

Does anyone else think that this is rather odd?

I'm a grown man and I have several close friends who have young children. But if, God forbid, something were to happen to my friends and their children went off to live with their relatives, I probably wouldn't even ever think of stopping in for a visit with them. It honestly seems kind of creepy; a violation of healthy interpersonal boundaries. Furthermore, if I was to ever, again God forbid, have to take custody of nieces and/or nephews, I would be /very/ suspicious of any of my hypothetically deceased siblings' friends that showed up at my door looking to visit with a 3 year-old. I'd probably slam the door and call the police.

Obviously it's different if the parents designate the friend to take some sort of care-taker's role, but if they're just a friend, even a good friend, I don't think there is any expectation whatsoever for them to try an maintain a relationship with the children of the deceased, and furthermore, it is wrong for them to try and do so.

So I think fanfic authors should stop giving Remus crap about it.

I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. Thoughts?

*EDIT: After reading many of the responses and thinking about this a bit more (especially after my mind went back to [[/u/4ecks][u/4ecks]] 's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/azvjq9/fanfiction_analysis_the_best_fanfics_are_written/][recent post about gender and authorship]] ), I think there's another element at play here, men and women view and engage in friendship differently. Now this obviously doesn't hold for all cases, there are always exceptions, but I think there are two generalizations that can be made. Male vs female friendships. Neither form of friendship is better than the other, they're simply different. Also, there will, of course be men who gravitate more to the female type of friendship and vice versa.

Friendships between women are often very relationship oriented. Women are interested in spending time catching up on the details of each other's lives - how the family is doing, what the spouse and children are up to. They want to know all those details, and through that engagement, they feel connected to the significant people in their friend's lives.

Friendships between men are often activity oriented. Men have drinking buddies, or golfing buddies, or D&D buddies, etc. They like hanging out, engaging in an activity that they all enjoy, and having a good time. It can happen that men who are friends often do not know very much about the details of each other's personal lives because that's not actually important to the friendship.

Remus, Sirius, and Peter were primarily friends with James - thus I assume that they had a friendship built around a common activity, namely, pranking. It might be reasonable to further assume that while Remus probably knew some things about Harry, he simply didn't feel as connected to him as many readers think. Since I'm a man, and since they are all men, this makes perfect sense to me.

However, I can also see how people that tend to form friendships that are more on the female end of things would automatically assume that Remus would know all the intimate details of the Potter's lives and would likely feel a deep connection with Harry. That makes sense form a woman's point of view.


** In the context of your argument definitely agree. However the bonds between James et Al were described as closer than friends, more like brothers, in which case Remus could be argued to be a surrogate uncle... However canon actually supports your argument, Remus spends majority of Harry's life pre Halloween being suspected of treason and in hiding & isn't visible in Harry's photo album he got from hagrid, so they probably had very little interraction during his toddler years. This I think would justify his decision.

To me that reads more like an adult feeling the impulse to comfort a hurting child, but then realizing that it would be a breach of professional conduct and personal boundaries to do so. You don't have to be a surrogate uncle for that to happen.

Lupin was probably suicidal in the years after the war.

Lupin would have known this, though I still think he should've at least checked up on him. I can't really hold it against him too much, considering no one else in the Wizarding World did either.

Basically, Remus showed up on the Dursley's doorstep asking if he could see Harry every once in a while. Petunia says that he either takes Harry now, or never show his face again. She doesn't want any wizards coming into the house and if Remus really cared, he'd take Harry. Remus, knowing that he can't take care of a baby as a werewolf who can barely hold a job, heartbreakingly decides that it's best if leaves Harry, hoping that his aunt and uncle will take care of him.

**** Oh, I agree with you there. I'm just saying Remus would've also seen himself as a threat to Harry if he ever went to see him. IIRC the only reason he went to teach at Hogwarts was because Dumbledore promised him a monthly supply of the Wolfsbane potion. Add in all his issues post-Volemort's attack, along with how he himself was turned into a Werewolf and no access to the Wolfsbane potion, you get a guy that is likely terrified of going near kids. I'm just speculating here but that's what I think.

But in the culture I come from, close friends are supposed to "keep an eye" on each others' children. Parents' close friends are often called "uncle" or "aunt", and sometimes give gifts at Christmas. Many of my peers have stories of truancy or some other illicit teenage adventure getting interrupted by an "uncle or aunt" yelling at them and threatening to tell their parents. I can see that it's clearly not the cultural norm where you're from. I think it's important to note Harry Potter is a global phenomenon, with fans and readers from around the world and not just the US and Britain.

**** I've seen your edit and I have to say, this sort of gendered projection of friendship seems very culturally derived. Calling a close friendship "female oriented" sounds pretty insulting of men, as if we can't form close friendships, and if we do, we're acting outside our gender. It's like when guys comment on reddit saying things like "I'm a real man and my friends are real men, I could never cry in front of them" and all I can think is that this person needs to get better friends. I have several close guy friends, and if I were emotional about something, I could absolutely cry in front of them. I'd probably get roasted to hell and back if they deemed my reason for being emotional invalid or humorous, but they'd still be there for me in the moment.

The Marauders were more than just "pranking buddies", they were best friends for years from the first year of boarding school till that fateful October night in their early twenties. How do you justify how Remus acts towards Harry in the Deathly Hallows (willing to abandon his wife and unborn child for Harry, making Harry the godfather) without accepting that there is a special bond between them due to his parentage? How do you justify Wormtail's guilt-ridden final moments and how he spares Harry's life? They were in a sense Harry's "uncles", and if it weren't for the war and choices made would have surely spent Harry's childhood spoiling him and bonding with him.

I don't think Remus should be bashed for not making an attempt to contact Harry, he had mountains of his own issues to deal with, but I do think Rowling was leaning on a relationship in Deathly Hallows that she seemingly forgot all about for the majority of the books. And I'm not surprised some fanfic authors picked up on this relationship and interrogated it with a little bit of their own cultural logic to form a picture that's not very flattering of Remus.

Masashi Kishimoto, creator of Naruto, is a lot worse with this. In Part 1, Kakashi is introduced as Naruto's mysterious Sensei. He's a typical shounen teacher, which is to say he's useless and often borderline abusive of the main character (Naruto). He tends to show more attention towards Sasuke, Naruto's rival and the most competent of the three people on Naruto's team. In Part 2, it's revealed that Naruto's father (Minato) was his Sensei, and as Kakashi was an orphan, Minato basically adopted him (anime only I suspect) and doted on him. He introduces these new details to flesh out the character and make him seem cooler, but it has the unintended effect of making Kakashi seem like an incredible asshole. Naruto's childhood is even worse than Harry's, and Kakashi does nothing to help Naruto throughout it, even though he idolized and loved Naruto's parents and they did so much for Kakashi. I think in a long series, details like this are just inevitable, where an author loses sight of a character beat and fanfic authors focus on it with results that seemingly contradict canon.

That's not what I was saying. I was saying that there are different types of close friendships. Then I gave two examples of general types to help show the distinction. And I also said, "Now this obviously doesn't hold for all cases, there are always exceptions... Neither form of friendship is better than the other, they're simply different. Also, there will, of course be men who gravitate more to the female type of friendship and vice versa." I never said that one type of friendship was better than the other, or that if men had "feminine" elements in their friendships that there was something wrong.

I also don't think that there's anything insulting about men expressing something feminine. If someone thinks that's an insult, that's for them to deal with.

The fact is that we don't know a whole lot about the friendship between James et al. It isn't shown in canon. I think that it's highly likely that they were pranking buddies. And that does not exclude the possibility of their being close friends of that type.

Furthermore, I think that to say that all close friendships must be built upon sharing feelings and relationships and cannot be built upon sharing common interests is a rejection of the lived experience of many people in the world. It's telling people, "Your friendship doesn't fit my model. Therefore it is not really friendship."

I've proposed two models of close friendship based upon the natural division of humanity into male and female and the differences that are often (but not always) exhibited by each. The distinction, as I mentioned, is not absolute - there might very well be gradations. There could be more divisions. Someone else might come up with a different method for making the distinction that better speaks to their experience.

Having a close friendship that is based upon shared activities and not based on sharing emotions does not make it a lesser friendship. The bonds can be every bit as strong - just with a different focus. The individuals therein will know different things about the other.

As for Peter, I would think he would be guilt-ridden after betraying a friendship of either type. I know I that if I was betrayed by one of the guys I've been playing D&D with for years it would be absolutely horrible.

(And there's also the whole Life-Debt thing that JKR almost forgot about...)

I can't really speak to Naruto - it's not something I've ever been into.

First of all, you imply in your edit that because they are "prankster buddies", that James' family and what happens to them is somehow less important to his friends than if they had a more "female" friendship. What many people, including me, are reacting to, is that what you are portraying is in no way an equal friendship. I understand that there's "side by side" and "face to face" ways of interacting. What I'm disputing is that somehow being "side by side" friends with someone means that you know less about them, and care less about them and their family.

What concerns me is that you're making it completely a gender thing when it's clearly also very much a culture thing. Much of the rituals and stereotypes of contemporary Western male friendship is in reaction to public acceptance of homosexuality in the West. Rewind just 100 years and you'll find correspondence between male friends ("macho" soldiers at that) that's a lot more "female oriented" than what we expect between two straight male friends today.

Men have drinking buddies, or golfing buddies, or D&D buddies, etc. They like hanging out, engaging in an activity that they all enjoy, and having a good time. It can happen that men who are friends often do not know very much about the details of each other's personal lives because that's not actually important to the friendship.

Let me try to work through this using my own friends as examples. With my best "bro" friend, I don't know when his daughter's birthdays are (only remember his because facebook reminds me), I don't know what their favourite cartoons are, or their favourite meal. I don't interact much with them aside from giving them chocolates or small amounts of money when I see them with their Dad. Yet, if I were walking on the street and saw someone bothering them, I would be moved to protect them (even willing to use violence to do so), especially because they're my best friends' daughters.

#+end_quote

This made me think. What would constitute a betrayal by your D&D buddy? What do you expect of him and what sort of actions would be considered a betrayal of this? James and Lily both entrusted Sirius and later Peter with their lives and the life of their son. *They expected that these men would be willing to die to keep them safe.* These are not the actions of men who only spend time with each other to be "pranking buddies". There's clearly a strong bond there that goes beyond the scope of just pranks and to other parts of their lives. And that is why it is strange that Remus, who ostensibly had this same bond with James and Lily, makes so little effort towards Harry in books 4 - 6. Till book 7, then suddenly Harry is the godfather of his child and is so important that he offers to abandon his family to help Harry.

To reiterate, I don't think Remus not contacting Harry makes him a bad person. But it definitely highlights his weaknesses and character flaws, and this makes him interesting.

I don't think I'm saying that. I'm saying that you'd know and care about different things about those friends, not necessarily less about them.

Gender is simply the tool I used to make the distinction. As I said in my previous response, other methods to make the distinction can be used as well. To me, gender seems to work well for making the distinction between types of friendships that exist within the same culture. If you'd like to broaden the conversation and bring in other cultures, that's great. But I don't think it negates anything I've said - especially as the friendships in question (James et al.) exist within one specific cultural context - Britain in the 1970s and 1980s. But again, if you want to widen the conversation, go for it! What distinctions would you make between types of friendships in another culture?

I agree. I'd have the same reaction. But to further the example, if something terrible happened to your "bro friend" (God forbid), and you heard that the child was placed with other family members, would you think there was anything strange with that? Would you be compelled to check up on the child? Would you simply assume that the family had the child's best interests in mind?

I think you're over-thinking this. Just consider normal friendships and why they might fail. It happens all the time. It doesn't have to be something super dramatic like Peter betraying James to Voldie. People talk about each other behind their backs. Spread lies. Abuse trust for self interest. Steal your girlfriend. Whatever. If one of my "Bro Friends," to use your term, did something like that, I would feel rather betrayed. "Bro Friends" can still be close friends.

Why can't my closest, best friend be the guy that I've simply drank beer, played video games, talked current events, and cracked jokes with for 15 years? I've designated one of my friends like that as my medical power of attorney - I trust him to be willing and able to make life and death decisions about me should the need arise. And I think he'd do a great job should the need ever arise. He's one of my closest friends, and it's a great friendship. Yet we've never talked about or feelings and I don't know his sister's name or where she lives, etc. And I don't think the friendship is in any way lesser for that.

** I think Lupin is crapped on because cowardliness is his worst trait, and it taints some of the most emotional moments he has with Harry. It's not that he doesn't visit Harry at the Dursleys that makes him come off as a "bad" person, but the way that he /knows/ James and Lily died when Harry was too young to remember them, and when he has a chance to tell Harry about it, he chickens out.

Courage and bravery are traits that are most often recognized in a person by others. Heroes say things like, "I was scared the whole time." A person can easily think that they're a coward when they're really not.

I don't think Lupin withheld information about Sirius because he was a coward, but rather because he was conflicted about how to deal with the situation. That's not cowardice.

****** He doesn't make any decision, as opposed to making the decision to do nothing. Being a coward is bowing to fear, and Lupin definitely does that. He's afraid of reaching out to Harry, of choosing between Sirius and Dumbledore, etc. He lets that fear make choices for him. Lupin believes Dumbledore to be THE good man, who is in a position of power, potentially able to help Sirius if his innocence is proven.

On either side of the fence, guilty or not, Lupin SHOULD have gone to Dumbledore with the information. If Sirius is innocent, a real chance of proving it arrives. If Sirius is guilty, Dumbledore wraps up the situation nicely.

Honestly, despite whatever lingering friendship Lupin felt with Sirius, it was 15 or so years since Hogwarts, and 13~ years since he'd last seen Sirius. And with him in Azkaban the whole time and with the implication Lupin believed the official story, it starts looking like Lupin is aiding and abetting a fugitive by withholding information. But either he's /too scared/ to turn in Sirius, or he's on the decision making level of a sponge.

  Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. ‘All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly.'
#+end_quote

I don't think this was just cowardice though. Lupin might see it that way himself, but he's frequently self-critical, especially in relation to his judgment when it comes to his school friends.

If Lupin was afraid of Sirius Black, it would have been easy for him to take that Animagus information to Dumbledore and the Ministry. A more cowardly man would have done this immediately, and slept easier knowing that Sirius had no secret dog form to sustain his fugitive lifestyle.

As you point out, it came down to friendship. On some level, Lupin must have still had some faith in Sirius's innocence, or at least Lupin was unconvinced that Sirius presented a threat to Harry and other innocents. If I was certain a dear friend had committed horrible acts of betrayal, violence, and murder, I wouldn't hesitate to turn that person in. Lupin didn't do that, because the friendship they once shared left him doubtful as to Sirius's guilt and/or the justice of his sentence. That takes trust, loyalty, and to an extent, even bravery. In this case, Lupin's faith was well placed.

Notably, Lupin was immediately prepared to kill, incapacitate, and/or turn in Pettigrew to the Dementors, on first sight, and without hesitation or remorse, so it's not like he wasn't capable of standing against an old friend, provided that friend was actually guilty.

****** The pretty heavy implication there wasn't that Remus weighed his two options and made the agonizing decision to leave his wife behind for the greater good--- it's that he'd completely lost his shit and wanted to run away from the consequences of impregnating Tonks, for the more glamorous prospect of joining the Horcrux quest. Even seventeen-year-old Harry (not exactly a paragon of self-control) was mature enough to realize that his motives there were far from selfless.

I don't hate Remus or anything, but one of his defining character traits is his cowardice and avoidance of conflict. When shit goes south, he either pretends it's not happening or runs in the opposite direction.

ETA: I actually went back to reread this scene in DH, and it's even worse than I remembered it--- Remus doesn't imply anything, he outright says that he regrets marrying Tonks and that he plans on abandoning her and the baby permanently. ‘And if by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!'

First, his own words, in which he admits that, out of cowardice, he has refused to provide Dumbledore with valuable information as to how Sirius - a suspected(if never convicted) traitor and mass murderer, is entering the castle. Of course, he is innocent of both crimes, but Lupin has no way of knowing that.

Second, his attempt a few years later to run off with Harry, Ron and Hermione, abandoning his wife - who, at the time, was pregnant with their son. Harry rightly calls him out on this, and he does go home eventually.

1. Soon after Halloween '81, the Death Eaters were rounded up and put on trial. Those that escaped justice weren't about to jeopardize themselves by going after the Potter baby. It would be hard to claim the Imperious defense when Voldie was already gone.

#+begin_quote
  ‘You might ask -- and with good reason -- why it had to be so. Why could some wizarding family not have taken you in? Many would have done so more than gladly, would have been honoured and delighted to raise you as a son.

  *‘My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but I realised. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters -- and many of them are almost as terrible as he -- were still at large, angry, desperate and violent. And I had to make my decision, too, with regard to the years ahead.* Did I believe that Voldemort was gone for ever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure, too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.

  *‘I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power.*

  ‘But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated -- to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.'

  ‘She doesn't love me,' said Harry at once. ‘She doesn't give a damn --'

  *‘But she took you,' Dumbledore cut across him. ‘She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.'*

I know he stated his reasons. I think his reasons are terrible. If one of the greatest wizards, both in terms of power and intelligence, of all time could not come up with a better solution then to leave a child to an abusive household, then the bar for 'great wizard' is far too low.

This is shameful behavior, regardless of what his reasonings are. Genuinely despicable.

Even if he had to leave them there... if there was truly no other way, then he should have directly stepped in to ensure Harry was not abused and neglected.

If I"m a little fiery about this, its because of my real life experiences. I work as a foster parent with DCS and see what really happens to abused and/or neglected children, and it is nasty. It can be hell on Earth, and that is what Harry experienced. In real life, he would come out of that home damaged and in desperate need of therapy.

So I can and will take issue with how he handled the situation and I will criticize the hell out of him for his crap decision.

He could and should have checked on Harry at least once a year. Relying on Arabella Figg is just one more example of Dumbledore relying on a ridiculously incompetent lackey. It would have taken very little input from him to curb the Dursley's worst behaviour, such as housing Harry in a cupboard when there are 2 spare bedrooms upstairs.

They certainly changed their behaviour quickly from just a letter being sent. I understand why the Dursleys were never curbed for Doylist reasons, but there are no real Watsonian reasons why they weren't. They are mere muggles in the face of wizards and witches The bond of blood keeps them safe as well, which was the main reason they allowed Harry to stay after 4th, 5th and 6th year. Just being relatives of Harry Potter made them targets, and giving Harry a home, powering the blood protection, was for their benefit too.

The letter I'm talking about is the Hogwarts letter. When they realized that the wizards had some way of finding out where Harry slept, he was suddenly upgraded to a proper bedroom (albeit the smallest). This shows they had some awareness that the way they were treating Harry was wrong, and that they didn't want other people (including wizards) to know about it.

I can see part of this from their perspective. As muggles they're utterly powerless against a hostile wizard, and they don't really know that keeping Harry with them keeps them safe outside of that one letter Dumbledore leaves them. Had he visited later, tried to reassure them or intimidate them, he could have curbed their worst impulses. Canon Dumbledore is a manipulator extraordinaire, and I don't doubt he could have handled them had he bothered to. In HBP when he comes to collect Harry he manages to cow them quite completely, and never do they show any willingness to abandon Harry, Petunia even tries to argue that Harry isn't an adult until 18 (by muggle standards). In this Dumbledore is correct when he tells Harry that at some level, Petunia did love him. Microscopic though that concern might be.

What I am saying is that this concern, this fleeting glimpse of love, could have been marshalled and encouraged instead of how canon turned out.

He certainly seemed to be doing a lot to defeat them, that's why so many walked free with the Imperius defense in 81. Dumbledore literally had a spy on the inside who could give him intel on not just deeds but even motives of the various Death Eaters.

Even when the situation moves into a secret war after GoF, Dumbledore still expends most of his group's efforts on patrolling Harry's house, and then the Department of Mysteries. There are envoys sent to Werewolf and Giant communities, but very little is shown to us of these, and they result in failure anyway. Dumbledore and his followers were constantly on the back foot, reacting to Voldemort's moves and not making any of their own that we are shown. This... Is not the behaviour you'd expect of a paramilitary organization with a spy in the enemy camp. Snape must have been a terrible spy. Most of the information you see him relaying to Dumbledore revolve around Harry and the prophecy. Not Azkaban, not Amelia Bones or Emily Vance's murders.

Dumbledore had the personal power to defeat large groups of Death Eaters singlehandedly, a spy to identify them and he had in his custody many of their children. Had he been more ruthless, he could have totally decimated their ranks, and made a Ministry takeover much more difficult or even impossibe. I don't see any sort of attempt to actually attack the Death Eaters at all in any of the books where Dumbledore is alive. Don't get me wrong, a Dumbledore willing to hold children hostage would be completely OOC, but still, his plans that we can see are focused almost myopically on Voldemort. Could you point me to anything that would back up your claim?

********** It may have been worse, but maybe not. The attitude towards "exonerated" Death Eaters would not have been so lenient so recently after the war - if they had even had a chance to clear their names before Harry gets placed somewhere. It was a different Minister, and Crouch was the head of the DMLE and we know he takes a hard stance against anyone he thinks was associated to Voldemort.

Either way, that still means Dumbledore decided he knew best, and made it happen despite advice to the contrary provided by someone he trusted.

He's not Harry's "magical guardian", but he doesn't hesitate to act like it when he wants to. You don't get to control someone's life like that and not be responsible for their well-being.

#+begin_quote
  When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.

** ... I think you're viewing this through a very contemporary lens. The Marauders weren't high school friends who drifted apart when they all went to separate colleges--- they were like brothers. They fought in a war together. Sirius was Harry's godfather. How could it possibly be creepy for Remus to be involved in Harry's life? I don't think it'd be the slightest bit creepy even in the real world.

I don't even really want to condemn Remus for never visiting him--- I doubt Dumbledore would've divulged the location for Harry's safety, and I'm not inclined to judge a grieving twenty-year-old for not stepping up to be a responsible parent--- and I agree that the whole ‘Uncle Remus' thing is pure fanon, but come on. These guys didn't play on the same soccer team here, they were willing to die for each other.

There is no indication that Remus wrote to Harry or otherwise kept in touch with him at all during 4th year, 5th year (despite when he went to order meetings) or 6th year. That to me is more shitty. By that time he had a relationship with Harry and was no longer his teacher so there is no reason he could not send him a letter every now and then.

***** I understand your perspective better now that I've read it, and I suspected that gender might be playing a role in the disconnect here... I found it interesting to read your POV, but I still just don't think your conclusion applies to Remus and the Marauders exactly.

At least in my mind, I wouldn't call anyone I had a 'guy friendship' with my friend, much less my BEST friend, if we didn't talk about feelings or our personal lives--- if all we do is hang out together and our relationship is just about performing a certain activity, IMO that's an acquaintance at best. Of course, I'm approaching this from a female point of view, so you might feel differently.

But even putting all that aside, the Marauders... weren't linked by a mutual love of pranking, and that seems like a major oversimplification to me. That might've been the beginning of their friendship, and I do believe that the group was sort of more the JamesandSirius show, with Remus and Peter somewhat on the outside of their inner circle, but they were all very tight even during their Hogwarts days (I believe McGonagall outright described James and Sirius as being like brothers in PoA).

And by 1981, they were all fighting in a devastating war together; they weren't exactly drinking buddies who'd drifted apart since their schooldays. Sirius was Harry's godfather, James's first choice as secret-keeper, and the best man at his wedding; I'm pretty sure he, Remus, and Peter regularly visited the Potters in hiding and saw the kid. I'll buy that towards the end of Lily and James's lives, there was a lot of tension and suspicion between Remus and Sirius, but Sirius snarls in the Shrieking Shack that Peter should've chosen to die before betraying his friends, like any of them would've done for him. That's evidence of a very close emotional bond between them all--- would James have trusted Sirius and Peter with his family's lives otherwise? Would Peter's defection have been nearly as devastating?

I actually agree with some of what you're saying here--- I think James was by far the closest to Sirius--- but I'd still say Remus was one of his friends, and in the 'female' sense. I think you're applying your personal experiences to what was, canonically, a much deeper and more serious bond between four soldiers in wartime. I don't even want to condemn Remus for not playing a greater role in Harry's life (he was grieving, his world was in shambles, and I doubt Dumbledore would've allowed it), but your argument that it would be inappropriate or outright creepy for him to have? I just can't get behind that.

I think you're illustrating my point about male vs female friendships rather well. In my experience, women are often confused about the way men "do" friendship. I can see how you might think a male friendship was nothing but an acquaintanceship. But that's just how guys work. For example, a typical conversation a man might have with his wife/girlfriend/mother/sister/other female figure in his life after hanging out with his friends might go something like this:

Woman: How does Bill like about his new house?

Man: Fine I guess, I don't really know.

Woman: What do you mean you don't know? He's your best friend! You were together for hours!

Man: It didn't come up.

Woman: How could it not come up? What were you talking about?

Man: Umm... the best strategies for surviving a zombie-spider apocalypse.

Woman: /Stares at the man as if he's crazy./

Man: /Wonders why the woman is upset./

I've had plenty of great friendships with other guys. Men I'd easily call "best friends." Guys that I would readily entrust with my life. Heck, I have entrusted one with my life as I've appointed him my medical power of attorney. I saw one of my best friends from school for the first time in a couple years this past summer and we spent the whole time playing video games, drinking beer, and cracking jokes. I've never once had a conversation with any of them about our feelings. Nor have I had such a conversation with my actual brothers. Most guys don't do that.

As for the bonds that develop through experiencing war together, etc., that obviously makes something very strong, and while I can't personally speak to such a friendship, I highly doubt that it would result in something that would resemble a female friendship among men. I simply can't see that happening. Guys don't work like that.

James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter were men, and from the glimpses we were given in canon, it seemed like they had a pretty typical male friendship.

** I agree that it's odd that people insist Lupin should have visited or even taken in Harry. He was 21 years old when Lily and James died. I think people forget just how young the Marauders were. At 21, if any of my friends had kids and were killed, I would assumed that their extended families would be the best place for the kids. Unless someone explicitly asked me to raise their kid or something. I don't think Remus has any reason to believe otherwise. Remus might have asked Dumbledore how Harry was doing or where he was out of duty and Dumbledore probably gave him some cliff notes version that he was fine and with family. Remus probably spent the rest of his time extremely depressed and trying to survive.

Also, the Marauders thought Remus was a spy. It's why Peter was secret keeper. I doubt Remus was around much if that's what they believed. It's possible that Remus only met Harry once or twice. It's also possible that he was living with the werewolves as he did in HBP and had little contact with any of them. I think fandom paints a picture that he and James (as adults) were closer than they were. The Marauders might have been close in school and then started drifting apart as adults between the war and adulthood.

**** 1) Again I would argue that it's debatable that James and Remus were close after Hogwarts. We know they were good friends between ages 11-18. We don't know what happened to Remus after Hogwarts. We do know that 3 years later there was enough distant that James and Sirius thought Remus to be the spy. Unless Remus promised the Potters to look out for Harry, there's no debt or promise to fulfil there.

2) Your point here is filled with assumptions and influenced by what we as readers know. We don't actually know that “everyone” knew that Lily and her sister didn't get along. I would imagine James knew because he was married to Lily and Severus knew because they were childhood friends and actually knew Petunia. Anyone else knowing is debatable. I read a discussion here a few weeks ago about Remus and Lily's friendship and learned that there was very little evidence in the books that shows they were close. That is pure fanon. He never mentions Lily, and the letter from Lily to Sirius in DH makes no mention of Remus, but mentions Peter. Remus might not have even known that Lily had a sister, never mind the relationship with her. Sirius knew because Lily mentions her in her letter to him in DH. However even Sirius seemed surprised when Harry wanted to leave the Dursley's to live with him in POA.

Furthermore, someone's relationship with their siblings as a child or even as an adult does not impact what kind of guardian they would be for their nieces and nephews. Lily and Petunia did not have to be “best friends” as you put it for Petunia to be a decent guardian. I have a brother who I didn't get along with as a teen and still don't see eye to eye with as an adult. However if something happened to him and I was ever in a position where I was asked to take in a niece or nephew, I would make sure I did the best I could. People can love their nieces and nephews while having a complicated relationship with their siblings. Unfortunately we as readers know that was not the case with Petunia. But we're given all the information, we don't know what information Remus had. My point is that if you're told that your high school friends' orphaned kid is being raised by their sister, it's not unreasonable to assume that's the best place for them.

This seems most likely to me. By the time Remus even knew what had happened, Harry had been placed with the Dursleys, Peter had disappeared, and Sirius was already in custody for multiple murders and quickly condemned to a life sentence at Azkaban. It's likely that the first thing Remus would've heard of it is everyone toasting to the now-famous baby Potter as The Boy Who Lived.

I think it's likely that Remus reached out to Dumbledore or McGonagall or perhaps an old school acquaintance to ask after Harry. At this time, there were probably a lot of inquiries about Harry (and any number of other topics related to the Potters), and any insiders would have been careful to keep details quiet, for Harry's safety.

Any response to Remus would've been perfunctory and designed to discourage further inquiry. “Harry is unharmed and in good health; for his own well-being, I will disclose only that he is being brought up within a family and in a safe environment, and everyone involved has requested, and expects, that their privacy be respected.” That would definitely be enough to satisfy Remus that Harry is cared for and convince Remus that he shouldn't try to connect or impose himself in the future.

I'm sure he probably took an interest and kept tabs on mentions of Harry once he resurfaced, and of course he took the opportunity to teach and mentor Harry at Hogwarts. Once the relationship was established he maintained an appropriate role in Harry's life.

I'm not sure what else anyone could ask or expect of him, under the circumstances.

There are no given details about what the Potter's wedding was like. For all we know, the Dursleys might have sat in the corner quietly and then left early.

In my experience, it's normally the bride and her friends that are involved in planning the wedding like that. The guys don't often do that. There can be exceptions to that, sure, but exceptions are just that: exceptions. I have a hard time seeing James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter sitting around with Lily and her friends, picking out place settings. The guys were probably off somewhere else, drinking beer and planning pranks.

#+begin_quote
  No I understand, your point in question was to isolate the scenario entirely from Wizards, Muggles and Harry Potter. My point is that this makes little sense.
#+end_quote

My point is to ground the actions of the characters in the way that real human beings act. The fact that the characters in HP can wave sticks that make pretty colors does not change the fact that we as readers can relate to them because they act according to human nature. The fact that Remus is a wizard doesn't really change the scenario.

** I think calling the police might be a bit extreme, but I do agree that if he showed up out of the blue after two years with no explanation, it would definitely look fishy. However, what about the middle ground where he shows up after a few days or weeks?

Here's my thinking: even if the fanon "honorary uncle" status is overblown, there are two reasons in canon why Remus might want to visit Harry. One is if he fears Harry will be mistreated. And the other is that Remus knows Harry personally and is also his closest remaining link to the magical world, so he would would probably want to see him and would also be a natural point of contact for him.

Remus knows that Lily didn't get along with her sister, but he never met Petunia personally. Even if he did, he probably wouldn't /a priori/ expect Harry to be mistreated--probably less so than Dumbledore or McGonagall, who also never checked up on him. But suppose that he does. He would then ask Dumbledore if maybe someone should check up on Harry (not necessarily himself). Dumbledore would (most plausibly) tell him Petunia would react badly to a visit. If Remus still fears there is trouble, he would probably observe them in secret (objectively creepy, but no one needs to know), and if he does find something amiss, he would tip off a social worker. In this scenario, there is no need to visit in person until that is resolved.

Option 2, that Remus just wants to see Harry and provide support, has two possibilities. First, if Remus decides to step in right away, he might then visit directly. The sensible way to break the ice would be to talk to Petunia and say, "I'm very sorry about your sister; this must be very hard for you; I was a friend of hers. I know you're not very comfortable around magic, so if there's anything you need help with in dealing with the magical world, I wanted to let you know you can contact me."

This probably gets the door slammed in his face. In fact, this could well have happened in canon, and Harry would never have known.

On the other hand, if Remus chickens out of visiting, but wants to reestablish contact after a couple years, the sensible thing to do would be to write a letter. This would be regarded much less suspiciously than a visit. If Petunia is smart, she would politely reply to say she doesn't want any contact with the magical world, and Remus would respect her wishes. He would probably assume, like Hagrid, that the Dursleys at least told Harry about magic, so there's no worry there.

If, on the other hand, Petunia is /not/ smart, she doesn't reply to his letter. Given Remus's character, he would probably try a second letter, and if there were no reply to that, he would ask Dumbledore if everything is okay. Return to Option 1.

So, I think you're half-right. There aren't a lot of reasons for Remus to visit Harry; there are some that would make sense, but it would almost certainly not be the first step.

*** I doubt it was possible for anyone expect maybe Dumbledore (and possibly the Ministry) to contact Harry or the Dursleys at Privet Drive, particularly before Harry started Hogwarts.

Given all the protections placed on Harry, the Dursleys, and the house, I doubt Dumbledore would've left open the possibility for just anyone to be able to find them or send them mail, even if they knew where they lived. Imagine the fan mail, hate mail, solicitations, and other correspondence he might have gotten --- it would've been overwhelming, and probably unsafe. Even well-meaning notes from genuine acquaintances of the Potters would have been confusing and painful to Harry, who would have had no way to verify the contents of the notes or the identity of the sender.

I think it's also likely that Petunia may have established expectations with Dumbledore at some point, or otherwise made it known that she would only begrudgingly accept Harry into the home, and /only/ if any and all magical freaks stayed well away from them. Given Dumbledore's desire to keep Harry hidden, I'm sure he was only too happy to oblige. After all, that would shield Harry from any potential threats, and also prevent him from hearing any “unauthorized” versions of significant events from anyone other than Dumbledore.

It's also pretty likely that Harry's mail was screened at Hogwarts, to prevent strangers from bombarding him with mail while at school.

All this to say, it's not like Remus would have the option to just write to the Dursleys or show up at their doorstep to see Harry. Once he was informed that Harry was living with a family in an undisclosed private location, he didn't really have a choice but to wait it out until he had the chance to meet Harry in an appropriate setting.

**** Harry's mail was almost certainly screened or blocked, but I'm not convinced he would have been unreachable. I feel like he almost certainly /wouldn't/ have been by muggle post. At worst, Remus would have to ask Dumbledore to pass on a message.

However, I doubt Petunia ever directly expressed her wishes not to be contacted. "Remember my last" was the letter Dumbledore left with Harry, so it would have been a response to that letter. It's possible that Petunia did reply to it. It's even possible that she had to give written consent to seal the +blood wards+ bond of blood charm, but I doubt it. I was under the impression that Petunia's intent in taking Harry into the house and not driving him straight to an orphanage was enough, and that she never attempted to contact Dumbledore after that.

***** I don't think Dumbledore was inclined to pass any letters or messages onto Harry though. I think he actually quite appreciated the benefits of keeping Harry isolated in the Muggle world and unaware of his background and the circumstances of his parents' death. Harry spent his early years as a Muggle, and got to start out in the wizarding world without any preconceived notions about magic or his identity, and I think it was very, very important to Dumbledore that Harry have those experiences.

Given that, I think Dumbledore would do what he could to discourage or prevent the formation of any connections between Harry and the magical world, at least prior to Harry's 11th birthday. Dumbledore knew or should have known to expect that Petunia Evans Dursley wasn't going to be raising Harry with a ton of warmth or an open-minded view on magic or the extraordinary (or at least, it was well within his power to keep tabs on that, and I have to believe at least Minerva was checking in). And if Dumbledore thought it was important for Harry to have a connection to magic or his parents' friends, then Dumbledore could have and probably would have facilitated that. But he didn't, despite his position of knowledge and influence, and from that I can only assume that Dumbledore thought the status quo was acceptable.

Maybe Petunia didn't specifically ask him to lock down all communications, but I think it's almost certain that Dumbledore did just that (either for his own purposes, and also because he likely realized Petunia would want it that way). The Hogwarts letter was the very first piece of mail of any kind that Harry ever received, and the books are very clear on that.

And regardless, Remus was never going to be Harry's guardian or caretaker. For one thing, he wasn't nearly as close to Harry's parents as Sirius, so his taking custody of Harry was probably never something he contemplated. For another, he was a friendless, unemployable 21yo lycanthrope whose condition made him unwelcome in polite society and suspect as a possible Death Eater sympathizer. He would not have considered himself a suitable parent (let alone single parent) and he would have been right about that, under those particular circumstances.

A more interesting question would be what would've happened if Sirius wasn't sent to Azkaban. I think Sirius would have been much more insistent on raising Harry, and Dumbledore would've had a hard time keeping Sirius away.

The guy was one of Remus's best friends for years, he was just brutally murdered, they were all willing to die and kill for each other in the war. I'd expect him to take a little more interest than THAT in the welfare of James's orphaned son--- hell, McGonagall was a lot more concerned about Harry's living arrangements, and she certainly wasn't half as close to any of them.

I don't see why we need to go to either extreme, where he's a doting uncle or Satan incarnate. Maybe Remus tried to maintain contact and Dumbledore told him to remain at arms' length, maybe he was too broken by depression and grief, maybe the Dursleys told him to go kick rocks and he never dared show his face again... there's a lot of potential explanations. I won't necessarily call him a ‘scumbag' for not whisking Harry away from the Dursleys, by any means, but if he was too wrapped up in his own self-loathing and pain to so much as enquire about Harry's whereabouts or want to make an occasional visit, I'm fine with calling it another example of his cowardice.

The example dialogue has an intentional tongue-in-check tone. The tone is meant to reflect off the previous post and help emphasize the point while only using a few words. It's not meant to be taken literally. Obviously that wouldn't be an actual conversation between real human beings after a personal tragedy.

I agree. But that just seems to be the tendency in a lot of fanfiction. And then in those fics where the author tries to stay away from the extremes, there's often some sort of awkward (and unwarranted IMHO) apology from Remus to Harry for "never checking up on him." Coming across another such instance on that is what motivated me to make this post to begin with.

Whether it's for a good reason or a bad one. YMMV of course.

BUT I'm coming to the conclusion that debating this from a Watsonian perspective might be pointless... because the real reason why Remus wasn't in the picture until PoA? Was probably because JKR just hadn't invented him yet.

I was genuinely surprised it was such a huge problem for some fans. Well, maybe they are more observant than me. I find it hard to judge Remus, since I know that my parents friends wouldn't have gone out of their way to be involved in my life. I've seen many comments here where people say that they would expect their friends to be a part of their children's lives, and I was very surprised by this. It seems that here, like in many other cases, our own experience influences our expectations. I also would like to add that Remus doesn't strike me as someone who finds it easy to reach out and I suppose that would be a character flaw, but it's a bit unfair to judge a character for not meeting our own expectations. I mean, we don't know so muchh about their friendship, but we want so much from him. I don't read Harry-centric fics, but it seems that people are so focused on Harry's unhappy childhood that they want to find and punish every single character who in their opinion didn't do what he/she was supposed to do.Though I have to admit that I find it hard to be objective since Remus is my favourite character.

** I also think everyone forgets that no one in the wizarding world knew where Harry was, minus a few of the Hogwarts faculty and staff. They kept it secret to keep him safe from vengeful Death Eaters. It's unlikely that Lupin would have known where to look, even if he did want to check in.

** Got to agree, unless the parents asked said friend to look after their kids, it would be kind of creepy. And remember, they thought Lupin might be a traitor, so they certainly didn't ask him to. I'd argue that their friendship had broken down considerably because of that.

** From the viewpoint of Lupin I agree with you. Why would he "stalk" the child of a dead friend just because the child lives with close relatives? That would be a bit creepy.

But from the viewpoint of Harry I disagree. He's had a shitty childhood for 10 years, and when he discovers that a very close friend of his father didn't rescue him from the Dursleys I can understand Harry's anger. Harry is also an unreliable narrator, so his anger and disappointment would necessary colour the narrative. The same goes for Dumbledore. He had no reason to check up on Harry, but Harry would of course not accept that.

You're right, but you're wrong.

It doesn't help that Dumbledore admits that he knew Harry would have a bad childhood.

*** I agree with you that from the emotional point of view of a neglected child it makes sense for Harry to be upset. But that doesn't mean Remus did anything wrong or that he owes Harry an apology.
