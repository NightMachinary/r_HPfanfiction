  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

*** Can I ask how you (And OP as well) would qualify 'good' since I'm sure the answer varies a fair bit among readers.

I assume things like being as typo free as possible are assumed as a baseline, but there's other things that some people seem to care about very deeply about, while others can't be arsed to care. For examples:

Does it need to be canon compliant? Do you care if the SI makes believable butterfly effect ripples or would you prefer the story follow canon's... general progression of events? Do you want the SI to do a possession sue of an existing character or be an add-on to the cast?

Well, for my own stories that I recc'd elsewhere in this thread, I admit to struggling with when to use a semi-colon outside of programming in Java, but I've noticed that I get far less replies pointing out typos now than when I first started writing.

Also, the versions on FFN have been through a few rounds editing and of letting readers call me out on any such things.

********* Yes. When two sentences are related but separate, you /can/ use a period to separate the two, but this runs the risk of dissociating sentence two from sentence one.

Example:

#+begin_quote
  My uncle has hairy knuckles; he loves washing them.
#+end_quote

Both halves are independent clauses, but while the link between the two clauses is obvious in this, it does not always need to be so, and the semi-colon is then used to ensure that the reader knows that the second clause /is/ connected to the first. Excellent for strengthening relationships between two sentences or highlighting contrasts.

A second use is in sentences with internal punctuation, or to separate items on a list that already have commas (one site I know refers to it as a super-comma).

An example in a sentence with internal punctuation:

#+begin_quote
  When Mcguffins agree on something, they high-five each other; Mcguffins are all about the high-five.
#+end_quote

A bare-bones example of the super-comma:

#+begin_quote
  My travels led me through Denver, Colorado; Wichita, Kansas; and Washington, DC.

Or canon including all the add-on stuff via Pottermore?

  Opening the door I find myself looking down at a young Miss Granger.

#+end_quote

I think that meets some of your criteria (inverted in the movie vs books case), but the story is just getting started and since the SI thinks he's Tom Riddle... YMMV.

Also, [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/]] is a less commonly referenced site with fanfictions that seems to have an unusually high ratio of SI and Quest type stories. You might find something there that appeals to you.

I should warn you that it's incomplete and ends somewhat abruptly. Also, as is typical for me, I enjoyed it mostly for the humor and my tastes there may be different than yours.

I actually enjoyed WttH enough that when it ended, and there was no more, I got angry and grumped about my condo for a while before starting the journey that eventually led to me writing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11608334/1/Blood-and-Chaos][my own BTVS SI - Blood and Chaos.]] in which I die in the prolog. The rest of the story follows the vampire that rises a few nights later and has my memories of the show. Said vampire's favorite sport is trolling Buffy.
