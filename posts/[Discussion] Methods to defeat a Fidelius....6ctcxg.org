I'm wondering what ideas we can come up with to defeat a Fidelius. A lot of this will probably be based on speculation, but we should allow everything that doesn't *directly* contradict canon, for example Wikia writes

#+begin_quote
  Additionally, it appears as if the disclosure must be voluntary (as evidenced by the fact that no dark wizard is ever seen attempting to coerce the disclosure by means of Veritaserum, Legilimency, the Cruciatus Curse or the Imperius Curse).
#+end_quote

That's a good argument, but it's just by implication (because the Fidelius would be less awesome and borderline useless) and not exactly watertight. More on that later.

--- 1. Since the secret can be written down by the secret keeper, do other methods work as well?

Can I spy on the secret keeper and create an audio recording? What about extendable ears? What happens if I create a foto-copy of the written down secret? Or is the magic somehow contained in the parchment itself? There seem to be a lot of possible weaknesses here if an opportunity presents itself.

--- 2. Circumventing the secret.

The wording of the secret in OotP:

#+begin_quote
  The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London.
#+end_quote

Wouldn't it have been a better idea to make it something like "There's a house at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London"? or something to that effect? What if I'm not looking for the Headquarter of the Order of the Phoenix? Can the mail man still see the house? Since magic is all about intent, I probably can't just pretend that I don't want to know about the location of the Order of the Phoenix, but could I maybe confund myself into believing I'm the mailman? Or imperius someone else and ask them to look for a house that looks like it belongs to a wizard if I know the general area?

--- 3. Area of effect spells.

What happens if I spray paint in the area? Seems pretty simple to find the area where the paint disappears and then gather 20 of my friends and pepper the area with bombarda maxima for a week if necessary.

--- 4. Coercing the secret-keeper

I don't want to get too philosophical here, but what does 'voluntarily' even mean, when Pettigrew was able to divulge the secret? Are you telling me that he wasn't coerced? That he was just an evil fuck who wanted to see his friends die? He was afraid of Voldemort and wanted to save his own hide. I guess it went something like this: "Pettigrew, tell me where they are and you will be one of my most trusted leutenants" -> That's coercion. So either Peter Pettigrew is even more evil than presented or at least some degree of coercion works. Surely Pettigrew couldn't have kept the secret without fearing reprisal from Voldemort. "Volunarily" my ass. [Fanfic idea: Death Eaters can't tell their Lord the secret of the Fidelius around Malfoy Manor they've just cast, because they're perpetually coerced by him]

I don't see any reason why I couldn't selectively obliviate the fuck out of someone, give them some leisure time with Dementors and scare the shit out of them until they are just as terrified and weak-willed as Pettigrew and divulge the secret. Or just torture them day and night (magic seems to have great healing capabilities) and suggest - without explicitly stating so - that they'd have a better time if they cooperate and think hard and long about how they could be helpful. It's totally voluntary!!1 Sorry for the snark, but seriously though: If the Fidelius truly required that the secret is given 100% voluntarily no-one should ever be able to tell the secret to Voldemort or one of his henchmen or in fact to anyone that they are even slightly afraid of. In fact it will probably be impossible to tell it to anyone that you don't have a very close trust-based relationship/friendship to (like if someone is your boss, they might fire you if you don't please them).

--- 5. Polyjuice + Obliviation

"Oh, but Harry, you never told me the secret to your Fidelius" "Oh, right I didn't! Well "The super secret batcave can be found..."

Any more ideas?

Edit: Fic recommendation for Fidelius mechanics: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]]

There's some really clever ideas in that story. For example the fact that only the secret keeper can tell the secret to someone who doesn't already know the secret is used as a check for polyjuice impostors and listening charms.

** There's only one broken Fidelius we know of in canon: the Fidelius charm over Godric's Hollow is apparently no longer in effect at all, as it is visited by tourists and can be seen by any witch or wizard. All other Fidelius charms have stayed in place and merely been undermined by e.g. the death of the secret keeper.

I would suggest that this indicates that one way for the fidelius to fail is for the secret to no longer be true.

** A few observations that may be helpful.

The Fidelius is only ever used on a property- the Potter's house in Godric's Hollow, Grimmauld Place, Shell Cottage, Aunt Muriel's place.

It appears that the owner of the property needs to be involved with the casting, probably because /they're the ones who have the right to secure it/.

The root idea of 'fidelius' is trust; I would infer that the secret must be entrusted to someone other than the owner of the property, or else there really isn't any trust being leveraged. My workaround for Shell Cottage on this is that Arthur may have bought the house for Bill & Fleur, so for the time being it was his property and not Bill's. [That still doesn't explain why Ron could tell Dobby to take everyone there, as he shouldn't have been able to tell the secret unless Shell Cottage's orginal secret-keeper had died.

I would think the way the Fidelius charm secures the knowledge in the secret-keeper prevents them from confessing the secret under duress of any kind. The knowledge would be impossible to find in their mind, impossible for them to say or write down unless they were choosing to betray the trust. Wormtail chose to side with Voldemort before he was made secret-keeper for the Potters, so he intentionally betrayed the trust. There doesn't seem to be a penalty for this, other than a desire by the entrustors never to trust them again.

The actual hiding of the property seems to erase any evidence of its existence, so anyone in the right area will not be able to catch it using physical or magical ways to counteract invisibility. Area of Effect spells and explosions may be effective, though a protected property might already be charmed to resist the effects of bombs, conventional fires, floods, tornados, or other acts of God. Even Fiendfyre might be flummoxed, since the fiends in the fire seem to pursue what they see as worth consuming- moving creatures, anything flamable in the way. For them, they might not attack a Fidelius'd building simply because they can't sense it. Their collateral flames may not be strong enough to burn through to the property, if it's properly charmed against it.

A nuke might work (I think Hogwart's protections may be enough to survive one when they're fully engaged, but most places don't have that kind of defenses), but that's a bit of overkill.

I think [[/u/ABZB][u/ABZB]] has the right idea; try to deduce who may be in on the secret and force them to deliver destruction within on their next visit. Don't try to break the Fidelius; work around it.

I think this explanation is "as good as it can get", but I really have difficulty with Death Eaters telling Voldemort anything without being at least a little bit under duress.

How do you suppose magic determines ownership? Is it looking through the filed papers at the Ministry of magic? What about "unregistered" properties? Is ownership even a thing that a natural force like Magic would recognize? Seems a bit silly...

**** In Wormtail's case, he knew that Voldemort was going to kill Harry and probably James and Lily, but he believed Voldemort was too powerful to lose the war. Peter chose to betray them because his allegience had changed. If anything, magic would abide by what the secret-keeper intends; if he doesn't wish to betray the secret, it would help him keep it unto death.

As for ownership, there's some explicit effects of inheritance that Dumbledore used to prove that Harry owned Grimmauld and therefore could command Kreacher. How that is established or ensured is left vague, but I imagine signed contracts or declarations would be involved. The more enchanted a place is, the more likely that it has the beginnings of its own personality and might have rules to follow to determine such. An empty cave or campground on a bluff probably doesn't have enough inherent 'self' to define ownership, and can be claimed by a wizard willing to go to the effort of defining the place and assuming ownership.

Since Ron got splinched in the process, they had to fix him up and decided to set up a camp with a bunch of protective and concealment charms.

Hermione's assumption was that Yaxley had been effectively 'told' the secret because Hermione brought him there. I think she's wrong, but I also think Yaxley might have been able to work around the Fidelius from the inside by using the Floo to call out for assistance. So long as they kept one of their guys in the house and he Floo-called out regularly, that access would remain open.

** It is a small mechanic, but worth thinking about. The fidelius charm must be used on a secret. The secret must have no one other than the casters know about it when it is cast. So when the Grimmauld Place Fidelius went up, people could know about the Order, but in order to cast it, Dumbledore and Sirius would have had to decide that they were going to make it the Headquarters without anyone else's knowledge.

It is a bit of a nerf, but it makes sense. It means that you have to be choosy with your wording. You can't Fidelius the Ministry, because the secret is already out. But if no one knows that you are in the Ministry, then it works if you are casting the Fidelius on yourself.

The other thing is that it must be a secret. A secret with one person knowing it, and another one being Secret Keeper. And if you are part of the secret, you can't hold it. So the Potter family couldn't use James as Secret Keeper, because he is part of the Potter Family.

That is why Dumbledore was not the Potter secret keeper. Because if he was and then died, then everyone with the secret becomes secret keepers, and if they die, then the Fidelius breaks as it is no longer a secret between people.

Another thing is that the magic which powers the Fidelius is used to keep a secret, absolutely. That is the point. You use it to shore up every other defense, and then place all your vulnerabilities on one person. So spray painting it won't work, it is practically in a different dimension, and everything is warped so it is the opposite of a black hole, in that it warps space so that nothing can get in, unless they have the secret.

As far as coercion goes, it cannot be tortured out of you. Veritaserum will fail, you will not scream it under Cruciatus. What happens is that you must make a deliberate decision, in full mental capacity that you will give up the secret, with all the consequences which follow.

As far as ways to manipulate how the secret is shared, I would argue that it must be shared. While you could get it by eavesdropping, any recording devices will fail, and photocopying a written secret will give a blank page, because you are not the Secret Keeper, and only the Secret Keeper can give out that information.

That's an interesting idea. Instead of creating a secret it hides a secret more. It wouldn't be able to hide the whole building at Grimmauld Place then though. Just no-one could conceive of the idea that the Order is hiding there (which would work just as well).

It's not really clear where the line is drawn here. An information given under duress can still be given deliberately, in full mental capacity. I think I have explained enough about how I see a conflict here with how Pettigrew was able to divulge the secret.

Especially with magic in play I just see way too many way to terrible options to make someone more inclined to share information with you. But let's stay in muggle territory: What if I put a gun to the head of your child and ask you to tell me the secret? Will the Fidelius force you to sacrifice your own child or does that count as 'voluntarily'?

  The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!
#+end_quote

-- Flitwick, PoA

I've interpreted this to mean that the spell interferes at the point where a person learns the information. Voldemort could look in through the Godrics Hollow window, but still not learn anything interesting from what he saw.

The description in OotP seems compatible with this:

#+begin_quote
  Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside hadn't felt anything.
#+end_quote

Nothing is physically moving. The building appears door-first, while the door is what Harry is most looking for. I interpret that he saw the building all along, but sort of glazed over it because he couldn't notice there was a house there.

This interpretation assumes that there are two secrets: that the house exists and that the order is there, and that Dumbledore's note really revealed both. Which suggests you /can/ fidelius a secret some people already know, but maybe it gets harder the more people know, or something like that.

If all this is correct, that allows for some exploits. A spy who knows the secret but is not the secret keeper could write it on a piece of paper, but no one would be able to read it. He could similarly type it into a computer -- the guidance system for a cruise missile perhaps. He might even be able to tell a vampire (because they have no souls).

(This last suggests that Glorificus was concealed within Ben via a fidelius charm, if anyone's writing crossovers.)

If the secret were only that the order were based there, it should be possible to use a two-person attack. Tell Alice "carry Bob to number 12 Grimmauld Place; don't ask why" and tell Bob "let Alice carry you to Order Headquarters, then kill everyone there, don't ask where it is." Alice won't be able to see what Bob's doing and Bob won't be able to read street signs on the way in, but together they can kill everybody.

Making the entire house's existence secret permits other attacks. If you suspect they're somewhere in London, you could throw a bunch of satellite pictures at Mechanical Turk and have people count houses, measure house-width, measure street lengths, and look for discrepancies. This would only get you "there's something weird near numbers 11 and 13 Grimmauld Place", but that might be enough.

  What? Fidelius is DPaSW is a completely different and much more boring spell. Why would you recommend it in regards to this?
#+end_quote

This is [[/r/hpfanfiction]] not [[/r/prayatthealtarsofhpcanon]], no?

#+begin_quote
  Also instead of reading wiki, check this Pottermore article. It answers many of your questions.
#+end_quote

How is that 2 paragraph "article" answering any questions? There's nothing new in there... even if there was, I'm more interested in discussing book-canon than Pottermore stuff.

Quoting you:

#+begin_quote
  A lot of this will probably be based on speculation, but we should allow everything that doesn't directly contradict canon
#+end_quote

Also, as I said, the mechanics in DPaSW are boring and bad and the author should feel bad. They switched it from protecting secret to protecting space and eliminated all restrictions connected to it so it could be abused. Additionally, the rules of how the secret is protected were changed for the same reasons. Fidelus (and magic in general) in DPaSW is a great example "how to not write it".

Except that's the only way it makes even a little bit of sense. If you could hide any kind of secret, I'll just hide "Human beings have to Eat and drink through their mouth" and everyone will starve.

There's an interesting fic that explores the idea how broken the Fidelius is as a concept if you can hide anything you want:

Fanfics constantly change the rules, because the rules of the HP world only work for children's books that aren't questioned. I do not understand how you can enjoy any fanfic if your requirement is that the rules shall not be changed, because that's everywhere (not to mention that the rules in canon are often at best very unclear and at worst contradictory/inconsistent).

DPaSW is amazing for what it does with such a flawed concept.

Edit: By the way, I'm wondering now, why didn't Fumbledore cast a Fidelius on Harry then? "Harry Potter is the boy who lived" would have been really useful.

It's not. Look.

Potters choose Sirius to conceal their secret about where they live.

Sirius chooses Dumbledore to protect his secret. That he let's the Order use his house as a headquarters.

Muriel chose Bill to protect her secret, that she hides him and his family in the Shell Cottage.

The rules can be changed. For ones that are more interesting and make more sense. So the exact opposite of what DPaSW does with its Flammelage, and space limited runic enchanting etc.

I understand that. What stops anyone from hiding more fundamental secrets? What stops anyone from hiding the secret "Avada Kedavra is the incantation for the killing curse"?

Edit: Also, for someone who's obsessed with canon you're playing fast&lose with it. This...

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

... is a simplification of what happens in canon. The whole house disappears. The Death Eaters know the general location, patrolling the area, yet can't find it. Bellatrix or Narcissa surely remember the ancestral home of their family? So they're not just hiding "The headquarter of the phoenix is here", they're hiding the house from everyone.

Anyway, it all sounds very much like hiding a location to me. Why again are you against that idea?

Because it's not their information?

The question is "would it disappear to someone who is looking for the particular house in completely different context". Of course the answer is "we don't know"

The moment they connect the information it falls under secret which they cannot get to know.

Because it's boring. Also

#+begin_quote
  As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!

From PoA, Voldemort could've see the building, but nothing that would indicate the fact that Potters live there.

** So while searching for other discussions on the fidelius charm, I found this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10893602/1/1001-Uses-for-the-Fidelius-Charm]]

I'm only a couple of chapters in but it's already given me a good laugh. I'm hoping that it'll come up with some interesting ways around it, as well.

** It's a pretty foolproof charm if your not a idiot when using it

I recall a fanfic where harry puts the secret in a random muggle and lives in secret for years only being discovered because said muggle randomly got run over and died

if it had featured a more heartless harry he could have petrified the muggle and dumped him in the ocean

Edit I think it was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Paranoia]]
