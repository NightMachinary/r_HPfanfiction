** Harry: come to the future and help us!

Grindelwald: why don't you ask future me for help?

Harry: well Dumbledore beat you and you've been rotting in prison for a few decades.

Grindelwald: So you want me to help save the country that defeats me? Also, I am a little busy orchestrating a war that will leave millions dead.

*** Harry: But you'll still be beaten by Dumbledore and imprisoned for decades!\\
Grindelwald: You're right. But as you come from the future I assume you know how he beat me.\\
Harry: Yes, mostly, but...\\
Grindelwald: /Legillimens./

**** Ha. Yep.

Basically any variation ends in mind reading.

** What about the opposite? Newt accidentally travels forward in time and ends up at Hogwarts sometimes during summer 1992, and Dumbledore hires him, not as a Care For Magical Creatures Professor, since he has already someone at that position, but as the Defense Professor.\\
It would be interesting to see how he deals with the Basilisk and the Accromentulas. Would be interesting to have him interact with Luna and Hagrid, too.

**** Why would Dumbledore seek out old Newt for a position as Defense Professor?\\
Also, Newt traveling in time could have had a lot of consequences, depending on when the travel occurs since he wouldn't be there before reappearing in the future. If the accident happens sometimes before he stops Grindelwald plots in New York, for instance.\\
Something like 'Newt Scamander disappeared for 50+ years and is now Hogwarts' Defense Professor, and he hasn't aged a bit'.

** Super excited to see fanfic ideas based on Fantastic Beasts. It means the fandom will be alive and kicking for this next generation. That said, the only way I'm likely to see Fantastic Beasts is through fanfiction.

**** I pledged never to give JK Rowling any more of my money after Deathly Hallows came out, so the last movie I saw was Order of the Phoenix (which was released 10 days before book 7 was released).

So... The real answer is because I've been butthurt for the last decade.
