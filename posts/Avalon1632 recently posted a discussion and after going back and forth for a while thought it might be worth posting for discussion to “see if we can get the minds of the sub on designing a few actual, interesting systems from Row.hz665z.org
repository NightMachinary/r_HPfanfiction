** So essentially, you rip off Dresden magic mechanics, and call it an "improvement on Rowling's magic system". At least credit where you got your ideas from. Going to be honest, it seems like a pointless nerf to HP magic with little improvements for literary purposes. HP magic isn't just incantation and wand movement or they wouldn't need to go to school.

Rowling is subtle with her world-building. She doesn't always spell everything out for her authors. There's nuance that can be missed. Schoolchildren write essays, read books on magical theory, and there are research journals for individual magic subjects. It's clear that theory is an important part of magic.

The disparity in canon is easily explained. Not everyone is intelligence and studious. Not everyone goes to school and comes out with the same skills and base of knowledge. Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, and Sirius don't have affinities for only a subject. The most skilled wizards are good at all of them. Sure, some may prefer a particular branch but they aren't weak in others. Many people can't cast shield charms because they're out of practice and weren't that good in school anyway.

I do believe that magical strength is a trait analogous to phenotypic strengths in canon. I don't think nerfing magic by having casters tire is an improvement.

Potions seem useful because while wand magic may be better in some regards, you also can't cast a charm for better luck.

Magic is HP is already fairly symbolic. Point number 5 is just rationale for the Laws of Magic in Dresden.

Seriously though, edit your post to credit Butcher.

*** Actually I just fucked up in editing it so many times and forgot to copy and paste the part where I mention how much comes from Dresden. Thanks for saying something.

I'm not saying that I think that Rowling's magic system is flawed because while yes we see that there's more to magic than what we see, I enjoy a fleshed our magic system(and I assume other people do too.) a lot of the things I put down are directly related to different things in canon that aren't explained, they just are. This is a post I made to see what kind of fleshed our magic system there can be in Harry Potter.

Ministry workers aren't good at shield charms goes from “oh they can't cast a spell that Harry and co are casting with relative ease” becomes “most people don't spend their free time practicing how to defend themselves beyond what they need for school” it even ties in for people in the real world since how many people spend a lot of time practicing self defense except for people who are expecting to be in a lot of situations where they're gonna need it.

Yes not everyone is studious but we are told that Aurors who are dark wizard fighters have trouble with the patronus. This gives a possible explanation of why that is.

JKR left the world building vague, is it wrong to try and see how many gaps can be filled?

Casters tiring(especially if it's made so that with practice you can go on for longer) means that pitched battles suddenly are a lot more dangerous for everyone involved. I will admit I'm not a good writer but i put this in specifically because of the “Ron the chess master” part Avalon had said and the part where suddenly there's a very good reason the sword of griffindor would be so much useful for Harry to use. Another trope that has been done many times and often in a way that makes (me at least) one thing think “ok but why not do that same type of thing but with magic instead of spending so much time learning to use a sword effectively. If you just make it so wizards can cast endlessly, why would they need

** I'm confused. This is an exercise to build up canon? If so I must say most of this is canon and what isn't seems to contradict it.
