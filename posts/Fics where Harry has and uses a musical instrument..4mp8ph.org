** linkffn(2926255). Harry has/plays Lily's guitar. If you can ignore the spelling mistakes in the first couple of chapters (spelling gets much better after those), and the Dumbledore bashing (Weasleys don't get bashed, more like Harry slowly regains his trust of them after an event he thinks that they didn't do anything about), then this fic is pretty good. Has some interesting/intriguing ideas and plot lines that I really liked. Hasn't been updated in a while though, and is also stuck at a cliffie unfortunately. :(

  Harry is sick and tired of always being kept in the dark, of being lied to, and of being protected. He's had enough and he's going to take control of his life. Takes place at the summer before sixth year. HHR. Slight HBP spoilers. Some Dumbledore bashing.

** my Darkness!Harry story has him with a guitar(of James Hetfield's) that is gained rather amusingly. He doesn't play it right away but I plan to have him taking lessons in a couple years.

I don't know of any others save a crack story where he starts a rock band with Hagrid and Dobby I think. And maybe Draco in Dragon Leather pants.

That's amazing. Please tell me it is Eet Fuk. It'd be perfect.

Also, this gave me a brief idea for a story where Harry's father was not James /Potter/ but James /Hetfield/. Sadly, the timeline doesn't work out.

***** Hmm, Harry would have to be a few years younger, so it could work. I'm just not usually a fan of when they have to change the timelines by that much.

And Fuk Em Up is a good choice too. I just went with Eet Fuk because for some reason whenever I read a darkness!Harry story I just imagine the soundtrack to be ...And Justice For All.
