Let's all continue to upvote showerthought prompts that no one will ever write actual fics for.

PS: Seriously though: I hope you are all doing well in these difficult times.


** I remember years ago when you could see the entire week's posts without scrolling so I guess this is better than the alternative (maybe?)

Happy Festivus and Merry Christmas to you and yours

EDIT: top month sort shows 21 out of the top 25 in the last month were Prompt tags, 1 request, 1 discussion, 1 fic search, and 1 untagged that should have been a prompt. You have to look far to find those since the *top 18 posts are prompts*

*** Yeah, I mean, I appreciate the traffic and interest in hp fanfiction, but it seems like a lot of people are more interested *in the idea* of fanfiction than actually *reading or writing* fanfiction, which is a little disheartening

**** It's the inevitable Reddit effect. Most upvotes will come from people who are browsing their front page and just see a single [[/r/HPFF][r/HPFF]] post mixed in with all the other posts from other subreddits. They see a "shower thought" prompt, think "heh", upvote, and move on.

Meanwhile the true HPFF fans who want to discuss HPFF in-depth - the ones who browse the sub specifically rather than Reddit generally - are drowned out in the noise of low-effort karmawhoring.

P.S. Merry Christmas
