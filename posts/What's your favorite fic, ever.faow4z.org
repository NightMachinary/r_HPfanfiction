  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Maybe a weird choice, but I really like The World as We Knew It (linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It]])) by Lady Alinor.

It is the first cross-dimension fic that I read, and I still really like it. Is it a bit weird that the sister in this universe trusts her cross-dimensional brother so much that she memory charms her parents to keep his secrets? Yes, it is, but if you can come to terms with that part, I think that the rest of the fic holds up pretty well.

** Probably linkffn(3703793). It took me around fix or six times to properly read this fic, because I am an /extremely/ picky reader and something about it always dissuaded me from reading it entirely. But I finally decided to persevere through it and fell completely and utterly in love with the story. One of the main reasons for this (besides the Hinny), is that all of the characters feel /real/ in this story and not like characters, because nobody is bashed and they all have matured from the circumstances of the story -- Harry especially.
