It was a story where Harry finds out Luna is bullied and during the Quidditch match against Ravenclaw, teams up with the Twins to do a lot of damage to the Ravenclaw players and put them in the hospital wing/hospital. It is noted that Cedric makes some comment or another that it is all legal moves, just dangerous.

It is meant to punish Ravenclaw, but the players don't even understand why that happened and later Harry goes to them in the Hospital Wing and says it is because of the bullying that Luna suffers.

Don't remember too much else or if it was even a good fic, just have this scene stuck for some reason and want to go through it to see what it was about overall.


** I vaguely remember something like that, I just don't remember what fic it's from.

Did it also have comments from Cedric about how 'knock out the entire opposing team' isn't a good idea in professional play because it encourages retaliation from other teams during their matches? That's the one I have in mind.

...Great, I'm dwelling on the thing now. Bullying or not, I feel like trying to hospitalise an entire team via on-field violence and deliberate fouls should be grounds for disqualification from the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup.

*** Isn't that how Slytherins tactics are pretty much described? No one does anything except gripe and moan

*** I think it had something like that.It wasn't deliberate fouls but they were all legal moves if I remember right, just not done because of the risk to seekers or something.

** I think something like that happens in linkffn(Child of the Storm). There are probably other stories where it occurs.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

*** This is the one, fic was too long it would have been difficult to search through it without remembering approximately when it occurred so I didn't go through this one. Thanks
