** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. Some bad fics are so bad that they're enjoyable again. But not this one. Gratuitious over-the-top violence without real purpose, awkward portrayal of all female characters and some ridiculously cringeworthy plots (the infamous execution chamber scene comes to my mind) make this fic a trainwreck.

And that's before even mentioning how crazy the author is.

**** Oh right, I forgot to mention it, but the story is full of national clichés indeed. Padma is a snake charmer, Anthony Goldstein knows some ancient hebrew spells, etc. Then there's that german guy in one of the later chapters who is literally wizarding Mengele and named after a Nazi concentration camp. And the Irish characters are walking caricatures, especially Seamus.

****** Indeed. This was just a stupid part of the story and ties in with the overall depiction of the boys as the heroes and the girls as victims.

Wasn't it resolved by that stupid scene in which Neville and Ernie capture and torture Crabbe (or was it Goyle?)

Neville lost his parents due to torture. He saw what it did to them. Even in a story that is full of OOC moments, this was one of the worst. Thanfiction is seriously rubbish at characterization.

Seriously, it would probably be Make A Wish. It's all the bad parts of nonjon's fics without any of the cleverness. The writing is barely passable, every single character is insufferably idiotic, and if I could I would carve the memory of it out of my brain with a spoon. Oh, and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For is a disgrace.

****** The problem with /Second Chance/ is not that's it an AU, it's that it's so far right of an AU that it doesn't bear any resemblance to Harry Potter at all. And to make it worse, Harry isn't even called Harry. He doesn't even think of himself as Harry Potter anymore.

The author created an original story, basically, but was too lazy to come up with a main character or an origin story or a magic system, so she used the very basis of HP magic and lore to create her own bastardized version of it.

The name is also stupid as hell for a white guy who grew up in suburban England. It's like something an edgy 12 year old would think of if asked, "If you could name yourself, what would that name be?"

******** The “who dafuq is Rahkesh” bit makes a lot of sense if you actually tried to read the story or just checked it. It's not a full explanation, no, but how the name change happens in the story is very jarring because it's pretty much an instantaneous thing and thus nonsense.

Because having a Harry who disguises himself and uses a different name is fine. But having a Harry who decides that and immediately has even the narrator use the other name ... well, it feels not good at all, and when you combine it with Harry being completely out of character, you get a flag that is redder than the USSR flag.

**** I could be wrong, but I suspect that much of HPMOR's fandom isn't actually HP fandom or fanfic fandom in particular: for many, it will be the first, and possibly the last fanfic they'll read. So, 1) their tastes might not be quite as refined and 2) they tend to have less investment in HP characters and spirit than HP fandom does. Hence the very different reactions it gets.

***** It also might be people's first or second fic. They're unaware of the larger community and lose themselves in the interesting premise and occasionally decent execution. A few twists are well done despite the overall uneven tone. So readers invest in the story and misconstrue emotion as representation of an overall good work.

For example what happens to Hermione in Chapter 89. It's emotional, almost unexpected, and a very big departure from canon. People ignore flaws and get lost in the feelings.

*** I've said this before, and I will say it again. HPMOR is at its most enjoyable if one can force oneself to stop thinking of characters as representations of hypothetical people and start thinking of them as something akin to pro-wrestling characters: they may have names and identities and "stats", and they may have character traits with which they are somewhat consistently portrayed, but, ultimately, their actions and the plot are scripted in order to facilitate them showing off a series of highly stylized interactions. By thus disengaging from them emotionally and giving up on trying to understand their personalities and motivations, one can enjoy the amusing and sometimes educational interactions and the occasional puzzle.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: characteristics-of-rational-fiction
  :END:

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
- The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

* In Rationalist Fiction:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: in-rationalist-fiction

As well as the above,

- The main character uses (or tries to use) rationalist and scientific methods to demystify seemingly mysterious phenomena.
- The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers.
- The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.

--------------

Not all the stories are fanfiction. In practice, most of them place importance on smart protagonists and antagonists, but that's not necessarily the case. The most recently discussed Harry Potter fanfiction on there is linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Reasonable Explanation) and while there are probably less than 20 really good rational stories of any length, those that exist are (imo) amazing. /Worm/, /Three Worlds Collide/, /Glimwarden/ and /Ra/ are all very very good original fiction, while linkffn(Lighting up the Dark; A Voice Across the Void; The Metropolitan Man; Pokemon: The Origin of Species) are all well-written fanfics that take new ideas and avoid having anyone holding the idiot ball.

In large part, good rational fiction just looks like good fiction, but good rational/ist/ fiction is very distinctive and much less widely enjoyed.

  Enter the world of Pokémon from a rational perspective. Instead of starting his journey in ignorance, Red has spent his years studying the creatures so central to his world... and he doesn't quite agree with all the information in his books. No time for rookie mistakes here: he's on a quest to discover the true nature of Pokémon, and maybe even find out where they really come from.

***** They're fics that feature a character that places a lot of importance on logical thinking. I imagine they can go just as horribly as just about any other genre, particularly with the type of author that might want to congratulate themselves on their intelligence by writing one. However, they can sometimes be really good. Luminosity is an example. It's a Twilight fic with a rational!Bella. Instead of using that to make her something similar the likes of Harry in HPMOR, it's used to develop a different character in a more well-thought out world. Her rational thought actually ends up biting her in the ass because she's not perfect and gets over ambitious.

******* As toask mentioned, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][rational fics]] and originals are not limited to the HP!universe alone; and definition of magic can greatly vary from story to story (universe to universe). In many cases “magic” is just a placeholder for an /unexplained/ phenomenon --- like people having superhuman abilities that don't fit well with modern understanding of laws of nature. And even in cases where the world's magic is inherently inconsistent and whimsical, the characters can still use logic to analyse and describe such inconsistencies for achieving better results ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi][e.g.).]]

Another thing to consider is that this genre is /not/ primarily about magic at all: it's about characters acting in a rational manner, avoiding stupid decisions just for advancing the plot in writer's needed direction, and so on. In practice this means that such stories will be striving to keep themselves cleaner from [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadWritingIndex][bad writing tropes]] (e.g. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills][1,]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][2,]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter][3)]] and more often than not try to de-construct tropes that classically make no sense because of writers' laziness (e.g. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless][1,]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WithThisRing][2).]]

MoR is simply a propaganda piece for his group, it being fanfiction is secondary to that purpose, and that reflects in the bad writing.

******** So called "rational fics" always strike me as somewhat self-contradictory. A truly rational character, when confronted with magic, would consider the possibility that this was something that should cause them to reevaluate their world view. Not once in MoR does Harry consider the possibility that magic may not be explainable via the conceptual apparatus he currently possesses. He continues to assume unity over pluralism, for example, which is a baseless assumption when it comes to magic.

More often they should really be called "dogmatic physicalist fics" because they're not about reason per se but rather about making magic appear vaguely scientific.

I think you are misunderstanding what Hariezer Yudotter's “conceptual apparatus” is supposed to be, because the whole point of the story is^{1} how one should use the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method][scientific method]] to keep their worldview flexible and congruent with observed phenomenons of nature. And I just don't get why you think one of the first ideas the protags should have is that SM may not be able to explain an unknown system with unknown rules^{2} (unless I'm misunderstanding you and building a straw man). The only case in which that would've been a reasonable assumption is when a world's “magical” system had intrinsic properties of targeting, subverting, corrupting, and\or attacking sources of information.^{3,} ^{4} And even then SM could be used, if carefully, to determine how the system\phenomenon works and how to avoid getting burned by it.

“Magic” does not have a strict definition and changes greatly from one author's universe to another, so I doubt anything can be a baseless assumption about it by default (because there is no “default” magic).

Dumbledore had to know the significance of the magic between Voldemort and Harry in order to plan Voldemort's defeat and have faith Harry would survive. There has to be some science-like consistency in magic or else the whole plot falls apart, which means you can use logic to solve your magical problems.

******* 1) Magic does not have to be illogical by definition. That's a childish way to look at it. Generally speaking, magic is just something that is spectacular and seems impossible to explain. Magic is called magic *because* it's unexplained, not because it's illogical.

2) A rational fic is defined by the protagonist's way of thinking, not the world the protagonist lives in. Luminosity is a rational fic because Bella places high importance on thinking things through and making the most logical choice she can. However, there was still no explanation given as to the vampires and werewolves. They were still "magic."

Magic is called magic because it's unexplain/ed/, not because it's unexplainable. There's absolutely no reason a magic system can't have both internal logic that governs its use, but also fit into a universal logic within the frame of that world's universe. If you want a good example, go read Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere, especially the Mistborn Trilogy.

Your argument in that comment is circular, anyway. Magic is unexplainable because logic can't be used to explain it, because it's unexplainable, hence it's illogical.

******* If it were called magic because it's illogical, we would call it "illogic" instead.

Something can be introduced as magic, in magical terms, looking to all the world like something you would call magic, and then get explained later. So your metric looks like it can only co-semi-decide whether something's magic -- given more time, we might find we can successfully analyze this phenomenon, so you can't ever say for certain that something's magic and not parascience or whatever term you'd want to come up for it.

Furthermore, *even if* the characters prove somehow that the phenomenon cannot be analyzed, or the author states it by fiat, if the phenomenon is predictable, it's amenable to analysis. Analysis as a black box, sure, but still analysis. I mean, chemistry was still a thing before the development of scanning tunneling microscopes.

And if that's still too much for you, then I doubt canon Harry Potter has something you'd call magic -- I believe Snape was able to determine with some accuracy how Neville botched a potion based on the failure mode; people can develop new spells and potions; Ollivander appears to have some facility with matching people to wands based on measurements and observations.

The storylines arent that great either. They remind me way to much of Garth Nix's works mixed with Harry Potter. Which is a bit much for me.

The adults are never really useless, they just hide things from her at about the same level that the adults in HP hid from Harry.

*** I couldn't continue this as well. I like time travel fics because they change the time line, and this defeats that purpose for me. I much prefer the other similar fics like 169 or Roundabout Destiny.

**** Basically when Hermione travelled back in time, she wasn't able to change anything and had to watch tragedies unfolding, helplessly.

Well, that's the main reason I hate time turner travels so much, because you couldn't do anything or else cause catastrophic paradoxes.

If I read time travels, I want to see things changed and not relive past events, the more efficient the time travelers change things, the better.

[[/spoiler][That's also why I hate CC plot with a passion. Its final scene featured Harry and Co watching his parents killed by Voldemort, unable to do a thing. That's gotta be really traumatizing for them.]]

***** Although I don't agree with your reasoning, I can understand where you're coming from. I personally find that the heartache of Hermione/Mia going through all of this made the story more appealing. I personally love angst stories, and plus got to experience an amazing background and got to see the entire life of the marauders and company, and that is enough for me.

** Harry Crow. I cannot understand how that piece of dross has 25,000 reviews and 15,000 favourites. It is one of the most painfully written mockeries of a story I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. If I had the ability to travel in time to stop one event the writing of Harry Crow wouldn't be number one on my list, but it would be pretty damn close.
