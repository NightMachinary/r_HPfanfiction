I believe the correct terminology to use in this case is 'Mary Sue'.

(For those who are quick to exit an anti-Ginny answer, at least take the time to read my opinion below the bold text at the end).

The honest truth is that Ginny was one of the bigger Mary Sues across the series, and everything about her was written to merely end up with Harry.

Even minor characters like Cho underwent some changes across the books.

For example: she started as some random Quidditch player (in our eyes), then she became the apple of Harry's eye (figuratively speaking). Then she lost her boyfriend followed by trying to make it up with Harry. She grieved like any normal teenager would but was mocked and turned into a caricature by the text. Why? Because I believe it was to show us that no girl could suit Harry... yet. (Only Ginny later on.)

After this, they had a bad date and, later, it was Cho's own pal (Marietta) who betrayed the D.A. However, Cho stood her ground and stuck by Marietta even through the insults and hating. By book 7, Cho probably realised how overbearing she was with Harry and tried to reconcile by wanting to take him to view the statue of Ravenclaw's diadem in her common room. But then Ginny blocked that by suggesting someone else.

Now let's compare that to our hero's main girl of the series:

Ginny started off as a fangirl who then enrolled into the school and got possessed. She was then saved and, well, what then? By year 5 she gave Harry a little scolding on knowing what it felt like to be possessed, she became a star Quidditch player who (plot conveniently) replaced Harry.

Add insult to writing injury by having Ginny beat Cho in year 5, and the latter was said to be throwing tantrums.

Ginny then became a hot chick in book 6 with exactly the same personality as her younger self: feisty and fiery. Oh, and she defeated Cho yet again which ended up winning Gryffindor the Quidditch Cup.

By book 7, little had changed except that she waited for Harry to return in the end. Cue the epilogue and they were happily married thereafter.

Between Cho and Ginny, I prefer even the background development of the former over the years.

Ginny was written to be absolutely flawless, because the author needed to constantly remind us that Harry eventually wanted her. This whole 'chest monster' thing was also an absolute cringe to read as well.

Nothing that Ginny did ended up being truly, if at all, punished. Not her vandalism of school property (Quidditch commentator's box in book 6), not her Hexing of a student, not her eating toffees with Harry in the library (book 5, Pince just chased them out... that's all. Fricken Pince didn't even follow up on students munching such messy foods over her books).

The author also had Ginny praised so many times by random folks for what reason, exactly? I recall a random Diagon Alley merchant saying Ginny's pretty, then there was a compliment from Slughorn later on, and even a Death Eater at the Battle of the Astronomy Tower said Ginny's 'pretty'.

Why stress that across the text?

Because Ginny had to be accepted, even with her minimal character development, by us readers. She's just a generic 'fiery gal best friend's sister' type.

Ginny Weasley was written as the flawless, token reward for our hero.

But she's goddamn lacking in the character development befitting of the main character's spouse-to-be.

Nearly everything went her way, and she simply could not be faulted at all.

I speak the truth: Ginny was just a bit more than an object across the books, really. This is especially true when comparing her to someone like, say, Hermione Granger.

There was enough time and space in the plot for the author to have better shown us WHY Ginny was as good as implied.

Rowling wanted people to like Ginny and to recognize that she's the only girl for Harry, and so she hammered in the “Ginny is awesome” message in /Half-Blood Prince/ without caring too much for realism or consequences. The fact that Ginny gets invited to Slug's Club /for hexing another student/ is meant to showcase that Ginny is just so badass, she's too cool for rules.

Rowling considers that Ginny hexing people because she's annoyed with them or Hermione assaulting Ron with canaries is “badass” and “empowering”. Unthinking “girl power” mentality at its finest.

Now if we try looking at it from a Watsonian perspective...

Harry. Quite simply, Harry.

Harry is head over heels with Ginny, and he's a 16 years-old boy. When you're sixteen years old, clocking one to the guy that annoys you is one of the awesomest things ever, bonus points if you don't get punishment for it.

Ginny has both Harry and Rowling on her side: Rowling makes Ginny's actions, dangerous as they may be, have no consequences, while Harry is crushing hard and thinks that everything Ginny does is awesome.

Harry has a little less patience for Hermione's actions (especially when she's criticizing his use of the Half-Blood Prince's Potions manual) but Hermione doesn't get much in terms of consequences - aside from Harry being colder to her - because she has Rowling on her side.

And Rowling doesn't like to make her self-insert look bad.

She unintentionally ends up doing so anyway, because she seems to think that a girl unleashing a flock of canaries /at her best friend's face/ is okay behaviour, or that a girl attacking a man is completely fine: like I said, peak unthinking “girl power” mentality, “it's okay when it's a girl who does it”.

*Warning: Highly unpopular opinion incoming:*

Even Neville Longbottom, fricken NEVILLE got more character development than Ginny. I don't care about Neville or his sad parents backstory... we have enough of these in the plot. I would much, much, much rather swap some of Neville's development for Ginny.

Just imagine if it was Ginny who stepped up to berate Voldemort in the courtyard (what a conversation this would've been!).

Just imagine if it was Ginny (Harry's future wife) who got the hat placed on her head which Voldemort tried to burn.

Just imagine if it was Ginny who struck down Nagini while still thinking that Harry was dead! A furious Ginny would've been awesome to read about.

But no, it had to be ickle Neville Longbottom at that moment.

Edit:In Chapter 23 of /Half-Blood Prince/, Dumbledore probes Harry's motivations for fighting Voldemort, pointing out that it's not just the prophecy driving Harry to fight:

#+begin_quote
  “But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, “it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or ---”\\
  “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”\\
  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.\\
  “I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.”
#+end_quote

This is not a thought that gives Harry joy. But Voldemort has caused so much pain, and so much of it has fallen on Harry, that Harry believes Voldemort needs to die, and that he needs to have a hand in it.

What does this have to do with Ginny? Well, in Chapter 30, she explains her perspective on why Harry is going to war:

#+begin_quote
  “Well . . . I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much.”
#+end_quote

Ginny seriously misunderstands Harry's motivation. She makes it sound like he's going to hunt Voldemort because this is what makes him happy in life. Well, it's not. Harry is a /reluctant/ hero; if he had his druthers, he'd be living a quieter life. But Harry sees wrongs being committed in the world, and he feels compelled to stop them. That's very different from the swashbuckling adventurer Ginny seems to believe she's dating.

In light of that, think about the next sentence: "Maybe that's why I like you so much." The person she likes isn't the shy but responsible Harry she's actually dating; it's the adventuring hero of her fantasies. The Boy Who Lived she had a crush on since she was a little girl. The celebrity identity Harry has hated since the beginning.

This would be like Leonard Nimoy (during the /I Am Not Spock/ era) dating a Spock fangirl. She's not attracted to him; she's attracted to her image of him. When the reality sets in---that she's dating some bloke named Harry, not Dudley Do-Right with a wand---she's going to be sorely disappointed.


** I'll admit I like Ginny because +I don't ship Harry with Hermione+ she's generally the type of character that attracts me. However, there are two things that really irk me about her character. Firstly and most frustratingly, Cho is character-assassinated and brushed aside when she's obviously feeling pretty crap about how Cedric has died and nobody bats an eyelash. She's a teenage girl that's suddenly going through quite possibly the first death she's ever experienced, and it's also close to her. Rowling dismisses her in the text as someone who's weepy and weak, and the fandom blindly follows that narrative.

Secondly, all of her awesome comes out of nowhere. First book: regular Harry Potter fangirl. Second book: possessed girl. Third book: ??? Fourth book: is Neville's date to the Yule Ball. Fifth book, she suddenly becomes awesome, and is the coolest girl at Hogwarts. It feels so fake and such rushed development, like Rowling suddenly thought 'who's Harry going to end up with?' and remembered that Ginny existed, and she can fit the Cho bill but 'awesome'. It probably didn't help that the text keeps pointing about through different characters how awesome she is every other chapter. Overall, it could've been a much more interesting relationship had Ginny actually had development. Hell, Harry/Luna is more organic than Harry/Ginny.

*** Yeah the switch from book 4 to book 5 was a total heel turn in personality. If I think back to elementary school - high school, I can't think of one person who was quiet and introverted who suddenly became one of the most popular kids in school. For most kids that i went to school with, their personality, grades, and friend groups stayed relatively the same throughout most of school except some kids stopped taking school as seriously.

We see the wizarding world through Harry's eyes, and so it makes sense that he doesn't really pay much attention to Ginny until book 5 and then starts to see things about her that were already there, but he hadn't paid attention to yet.

**** It happens, a lot. My former best friend was one of these people who did a complete 180 and became the most popular girl in school. The attention she got made us drift apart for a bit, and our friendship isn't the same it was before precisely because of that. I think it's plausible that Ginny had the same arc in high school. After all, Ginny had other friends than Harry and generally functioned in a different social circle, especially because she was a year younger. That applies more if her friends were already popular in her year and she just caught on. However, if we were given a general nudge throughout the course of the series towards her developing into that person, it would've been better.

** I am a Harry/Ginny shipper fanfic-wise for the most part, but I agree on the part that she needs better character-development for it to make sense.\\
Her canon journey isn't the best-written, and part of that is down to her complete absence in books 3 and 4 - her Book 5 characterization, while great, kind of comes out of nowhere.\\
And then Book 6 goes and undoes all the interesting parts of her characterization, turning her into a flat Mary Sue love interest.

That said, she still makes /some/ sense as a love-interest in the books - there are hints throughout of Harry paying attention to her, which is more than I can say for the movies where she's practically absent.

** I feel like the argument that she's not very developed could be applied to most of the students aside from the golden trio, and maybe Draco and Neville.

She changes a bit, which is more than most of the side characters (she's not exactly more developed than the other Gryffindors, for example). Even Hermione doesn't get to develop too much in the series, in comparison to Ron. I think that's just an issue JK has with writing girls / women, for some reason. they never seem to have the depth or development that the boy / men characters do, unfortunately.

I suppose the issue is less that she's not too developed, and more that Harry is paired off with someone not very developed, which is obviously unusual for the protagonist of a children's series. I chalk that up mostly to JK not being too into writing romance, and also the desire to reflect Harry's parents, so it had to be Ginny (Lily, for example, has very little complexity compared to James, so that fits).

The dislike of her is bizarre, though. Probably stemming from a shipping thing. She's not necessarily the most complex, but she's one of my very favourite characters in the series.

** Rowling is just not great at writing romantic chemistry. Pretty much everyone had a partner appear AFTER everything ended.

Pretty much every YA novel I've ever read as a kid had that problem. If there wasn't an absolutely 100% clear, you can see it coming from a mile away, it's only a matter of time, love interest...it was pretty forced. Sort of like a closed loose end love interest, who has to be immediately seen as ‘good enough for the hero.'

There is a major difference between a Mary Sue and an underdeveloped love interest.

If she wanted to actually invest in the romance at all Ginny would have become a more prominent character after book 2.

** I feel like you're misunderstanding Ginny's quote at the funeral. I don't believe she is referring to happiness in the sense of “hunting Voldemort makes Harry happy,” it's more of “Harry cannot be happy until Voldemort is gone.” And he tells her as such during the funeral, when he says to imagine how he would feel if it was hers. Even though he never confided the specifics of the prophecy to Ginny (as far as I can recall) she understood what it was that he had to do.

Ultimately this is incredibly well-written, and I do agree that Ginny could have used more development. But I don't think she's the Mary Sue that people make her out to be. She just suffers from bad writing on Rowling's part and not being part of the main trio or a figure of prophecy. There's great nuggets of characterization in the books that offer a lot of promise that just never got developed.

What we needed instead of the epilogue we got was one where it was just Harry and Ginny talking about what transpired between them and where to go next. Just to fully flesh out the relationship between them, how they changed over the year(s), and what now that they actually can be happy (eventually).

Yes, exactly. Ginny gets exactly what Dumbledore got. That, prophecy or no prophecy, Harry will not be happy /sitting back and leaving it to others./

It's personal with Harry and Voldemort. Neither can live while the other survives, not because the prophecy says so, but because of the burning hatred they feel for each other. Harry wouldn't be able to not try, with everything he has, to end this, to destroy the person who took everything from him before his life could even begin.

Ginny gets that. She gets that there's no point wanting him to not, there's no point crying and weeping and emotionally blackmailing him, because this is his /cause./ She absolutely doesn't think "hmm, what would make Harry happy? I know. Murder! He wants to go off and do a big ol' murder!" She thinks "he cannot rest until Voldemort is gone for good. He won't be happy in a world where Voldemort lives and he has to constantly look over his shoulder. I'm going to be really mature now, tell him I understand, and then I'm going to cry as far away from him as possible."

Yes. She's not a Mary Sue, she just suffered as a character from being an Extra Elevated To Love Interest in books 5&6, and then barely being included in book 7 until the end chapters. Obviously that can't be helped as the books are from Harry's perspective, but absolutely, an epilogue maybe with Harry and Ginny talking to each other and their kids about how they rebuilt everything (metaphor rebuilt, not a brick by brick account of how Hogwarts got fixed!) which could also explain how their relationship progressed would have been so much better.

I think Ginny's fine in Order Of The Phoenix. She has her own personality and comes into her own relatively well. But Half-Blood Prince, she becomes the most hyped up human being in the history of time and space with a one liner every other sentence. I didn't mind them at first, but as I reread the book, I really started to grow tired of how much of a one liner factory she is at points.

It's one of the reason why I feel a Harry/Hermione romance would have been infinitely more satisfying. Because while people have their beliefs on if their personalities would work well and whatnot, at the very least, both characters felt like real people with an organic connection, which is vastly more interesting. And I've never felt that way about Harry/Ginny.

I think it's important to remember that the story is told from Harry's POV and he is a horny teenager at this point. Of course he is going to see Ginny as the greatest thing ever, with zero flaws. He's seeing her with his small head, not his large one.

That said, all character development we see is via Harry seeing and noticing that character development. It's why Arthur goes from the bumbling dad to the outright badass who survived a ministerial purge and has the political pull to sit in the Minister's box. /Harry's/ view of the character changed, and thus how the characters were presented in story changed as well.

***** Well yes. Because they're two completely different people with two completely different outlooks on relationships. Harry sees relationships as very black or white: you're either amazing or you're not (look at how he view his father, for instance). Ron on the otherhand is used to seeing relationships as something more rocky-his entire homelife is filled with arguments but ultimately still loving each other in the end.

If the story was from Ron's POV it would be "Hermione is so annoying, bossy a know it all, she infuriates me...but gosh I love that insufferable know-it-all." Harry, on the other hand, approaches relationships much differently. Look at how many times he flips on either Ron or Hermione for a single slight, and then immediately flips back to them.

By the end the characters were older. Hence why it wouldn't make sense for a sex scene in previous books but would by then.

Plus they were hormonal teenagers and under stress alone in a tent for months. Both were never described as anything but attractive (even with puffy hair). There was definitely a connection there.

Nothing makes a sexual situation between them out of place. It actually would have made them more realistic and again it wouldn't have made sense beforehand but it would for older teens in that situation.

It isnt bad writing just because you dont like that type of thing. I think the only reason it wasnt in there was because of the age group the books were aimed toward. Had they been aimed older or even just less directly at children then the characters would have been more realistic.

Even before the end it would have been more realistic. You cannot tell me a castle full of hormonal teenagers all sleeping under the same roof never had anything going on.

** I didn't want to risk running out of room, so I started a new comment:

#+begin_quote
  Now let's compare that to our hero's main girl of the series:

  Ginny started off as a fangirl who then enrolled into the school and got possessed. She was then saved and, well, what then? By year 5 she gave Harry a little scolding on knowing what it felt like to be possessed, she became a star Quidditch player who (plot conveniently) replaced Harry. Add insult to writing injury by having Ginny beat Cho in year 5, and the latter was said to be throwing tantrums.
#+end_quote

"Fangirl" is a little harsh. Ginny was ten years old.

And in the fifth book, Ginny actually is the best character to confront Harry over his fears, because she is actually the only one who lost complete control of her body.

Her status as a Quidditch player is not that surprising, given that several of her brothers are players.

And she isn't a "star" yet. She knows how to fly well, but she's not nearly as good as Harry.

She catches the Snitch twice, but only wins one match--Harry notes that she hesitated in the match against Hufflepuff.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny then became a hot chick in book 6 with exactly the same personality as her younger self: feisty and fiery. Oh, and she defeated Cho yet again which ended up winning Gryffindor the Quidditch Cup.
#+end_quote

She's grown more confident, and we've already established that Cho really isn't that good at Quidditch.

#+begin_quote
  By book 7, little had changed except that she waited for Harry to return in the end. Cue the epilogue and they were happily married thereafter.
#+end_quote

You missed the part of Ginny */leading the resistance against the Death Eaters./*

Between Cho and Ginny, I prefer even the background development of the former over the years.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny was written to be absolutely flawless, because the author needed to constantly remind us that Harry eventually wanted her. This whole 'chest monster' thing was also an absolute cringe to read as well.
#+end_quote

Ginny's not written to be flawless at all, but if Rowling foreshadows Harry's eventual feelings for her, then that's not actually a flaw.

#+begin_quote
  Nothing that Ginny did ended up being truly, if at all, punished. Not her vandalism of school property (Quidditch commentator's box in book 6), not her Hexing of a student, not her eating toffees with Harry in the library (book 5, Pince just chased them out... that's all. Fricken Pince didn't even follow up on students munching such messy foods over her books).
#+end_quote

McGonagall spoke harshly to her about the commentary box, but there really isn't a way to prove the damage was deliberate.

She hexed Zacharias Smith on the Hogwarts Express, which is before term started, and therefore Ginny couldn't actually be punished for it. Harry and his friends fight Malfoy several times on the train and there's never any punishment.

If you mean Slughorn, he's not exactly a paragon of rule-following, but Ginny didn't actually look that happy to be "included" in the Slug Club.

And seriously? You object to Ginny sneaking Harry a chocolate egg in the library? Sure, she could have waited till dinnertime, but she wanted to make Harry feel better.

** I'm late to the party, but I had to work today. So here goes.

#+begin_quote
  I believe the correct terminology to use in this case is 'Mary Sue'.
#+end_quote

That really isn't an accurate term to use, and even then, as a term, 'Mary Sue' has been used so often, that it's lost all nuance.

#+begin_quote
  (For those who are quick to exit an anti-Ginny answer, at least take the time to read my opinion below the bold text at the end).
#+end_quote

I'll grant you that. Our culture, especially these last few years, has demanded absolute adherence to pre-given positions, with no room for dissent or discussion.

I dislike where this leads us, so I will hear you out.

#+begin_quote
  The honest truth is that Ginny was one of the bigger Mary Sues across the series, and everything about her was written to merely end up with Harry.
#+end_quote

While I agree that Ginny was planned to be Harry's love interest from the start, I wouldn't dismiss her out of hand like this.

#+begin_quote
  Even minor characters like Cho underwent some changes across the books.
#+end_quote

Cho Chang makes for as good a foil for Ginny as any, so I agree that it's a worthy comparison.

#+begin_quote
  For example: she started as some random Quidditch player (in our eyes), then she became the apple of Harry's eye (figuratively speaking).
#+end_quote

I wouldn't necessarily call Cho "random." Even with her introduction, we learn that she's not actually that strong a flier. From Oliver Wood, we learn that she's been injured before, badly enough to risk missing matches.

We also learn that she flies a Comet 260, which is the worst-performing broom we ever see in a Quidditch Match.

And during the match itself, she keeps blocking Harry--to be fair, she doesn't stand a chance against a Firebolt, and it's nowhere near as dirty tactics as Malfoy, but it's also not particularly skilled.

#+begin_quote
  Then she lost her boyfriend followed by trying to make it up with Harry. She grieved like any normal teenager would but was mocked and turned into a caricature by the text. Why? Because I believe it was to show us that no girl could suit Harry... yet. (Only Ginny later on.)
#+end_quote

Her grief for Cedric is meant to be a contrast to Harry. I wouldn't call her a caricature though. Cho wears her heart on her sleeve. Harry bottles his emotions up.

#+begin_quote
  After this, they had a bad date and, later, it was Cho's own pal (Marietta) who betrayed the D.A. However, Cho stood her ground and stuck by Marietta even through the insults and hating.
#+end_quote

This betrayal nearly got Harry expelled, if not arrested. By proxy, it got Dumbledore driven from the school entirely. This allowed Umbridge to tighten her grip over the school even more.

And Cho herself likely risked expulsion--the entire list of DA members was discovered.

Harry is /well/ within his rights to be furious at Marietta, and Cho's defense of her /does/ trivialize the situation.

#+begin_quote
  By book 7, Cho probably realised how overbearing she was with Harry and tried to reconcile by wanting to take him to view the statue of Ravenclaw's diadem in her common room. But then Ginny blocked that by suggesting someone else.

I have no real objection to this description.

*** I'm not saying that the OP is one. Let me be clear on this. I am in no way implying or insinuating that the OP is one.

But ever since the first-generation readers, there have been a lot, and I mean, A LOT of people who have chosen to make their life's aim to bash Ginny simply because she was Harry's love interest. I believe that so many of these people hero-worshiped Harry Potter - the character - so hard, and the arrival of a dapper Daniel Radcliffe on the scene made it ridiculously easy for them to construct all kinds of fantasies about poor ol' Harry Potter. They absolutely loathed a fictional red head girl because the author envisioned her to be his one true love.

As regards to the OP, he/she has a point that at times the character feels underwritten. indeed, for many people the first outright hint that Harry has the hots for Ginny is when that.. ah.. scaly monster erupts (yes, it is a poor choice of words by Joanne) in his chest. But Jo needed to give her hero a reason for living, and for most novelists writing YA fiction, that reason is plainly and simply a love interest. Ginny was there, and would do nicely enough whereas using Hermione would complicate matters. So Ginny it was. TBH, it feels Jo did it because it had become an issue at that point and Harry's love life was something fans were clamoring to read about.

#+end_quote

The "merchant" was a street vendor selling "medallions" that were to defend against Dementors, vampires and Inferi. He called Ginny a "little girl" who had "a pretty neck."

He was trying to manipulate Ginny and her parents. He was, frankly, a slime ball.

Slughorn thinks Ginny's got potential, but I don't remember him praising her looks.

And the Death Eater was an even bigger slime ball than the street vendor. He's trying to distract Ginny so that he can curse her. Because he's a bad guy.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  I speak the truth: Ginny was just a bit more than an object across the books, really. This is especially true when comparing her to someone like, say, Hermione Granger.
#+end_quote

Hermione was a far more present character than Ginny. To compare them really isn't fair.

#+begin_quote
  There was enough time and space in the plot for the author to have better shown us WHY Ginny was as good as implied.
#+end_quote

I actually think Rowling did a good job, all things considered, but I'm trying to see your side.

#+begin_quote
  Rowling wanted people to like Ginny and to recognize that she's the only girl for Harry, and so she hammered in the “Ginny is awesome” message in Half-Blood Prince without caring too much for realism or consequences. The fact that Ginny gets invited to Slug's Club for hexing another student is meant to showcase that Ginny is just so badass, she's too cool for rules.
#+end_quote

Slughorn is ambitious and cunning. He knows when to bend the rules and in so doing allow someone to prosper. But he does have lines he won't cross.

Ginny jinxed Zacharias Smith and she explains that he wouldn't stop badgering her about what happened at the Department of Mysteries.

Given that it's frankly none of his business what happened, and Smith had consistently shown a great disregard for others' feelings and abilities, and Ginny nearly died--and lost a family friend in the battle--she has the right to want to be left alone about it.

#+begin_quote
  Rowling considers that Ginny hexing people because she's annoyed with them or Hermione assaulting Ron with canaries is “badass” and “empowering”. Unthinking “girl power” mentality at its finest.
#+end_quote

While I greatly dislike the scene where Hermione injures Ron, it's quite a bit beyond what Ginny does--a temporary hex that will wear off and is more gross than hurtful is not in the same league as Hermione drawing blood.

#+begin_quote
  Now if we try looking at it from a Watsonian perspective...

  Harry. Quite simply, Harry.

  Harry is head over heels with Ginny, and he's a 16 years-old boy. When you're sixteen years old, clocking one to the guy that annoys you is one of the awesomest things ever, bonus points if you don't get punishment for it.
#+end_quote

That's a part of Harry's character, but it's not really an indictment of Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny has both Harry and Rowling on her side: Rowling makes Ginny's actions, dangerous as they may be, have no consequences, while Harry is crushing hard and thinks that everything Ginny does is awesome.
#+end_quote

These actions of Ginny's are not quite as bad as you imply, but Harry's admiration of her is not necessarily the same thing as the text itself condoning the actions.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has a little less patience for Hermione's actions (especially when she's criticizing his use of the Half-Blood Prince's Potions manual) but Hermione doesn't get much in terms of consequences - aside from Harry being colder to her - because she has Rowling on her side.
#+end_quote

Whatever Hermione's flaws, she's actually got a /very/ good point that Harry copying unofficial instructions is extremely dangerous and doesn't actually help Harry understand the theory of Potions.

#+begin_quote
  And Rowling doesn't like to make her self-insert look bad.

  She unintentionally ends up doing so anyway, because she seems to think that a girl unleashing a flock of canaries at her best friend's face is okay behaviour, or that a girl attacking a man is completely fine: like I said, peak unthinking “girl power” mentality, “it's okay when it's a girl who does it”.
#+end_quote

While this double-standard is pervasive in nearly every aspect of media imaginable, I wouldn't say that Rowling herself condones it.

Ron holds a grudge against Hermione for some time because of the canary attack.

#+begin_quote
  Warning: Highly unpopular opinion incoming:

  Even Neville Longbottom, fricken NEVILLE got more character development than Ginny. I don't care about Neville or his sad parents backstory... we have enough of these in the plot. I would much, much, much rather swap some of Neville's development for Ginny.
#+end_quote

Neville is a hero among heroes. But I will hear your claim.

#+begin_quote
  Just imagine if it was Ginny who stepped up to berate Voldemort in the courtyard (what a conversation this would've been!).
#+end_quote

I actually agree that this would be interesting. Ginny was one of the first victims of the Second War with Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Just imagine if it was Ginny (Harry's future wife) who got the hat placed on her head which Voldemort tried to burn.

  Just imagine if it was Ginny who struck down Nagini while still thinking that Harry was dead! A furious Ginny would've been awesome to read about.
#+end_quote

This would be interesting, but I feel that it would only fuel arguments that Ginny is a Mary Sue.

#+begin_quote
  But no, it had to be ickle Neville Longbottom at that moment.
#+end_quote

While you have a point about Ginny, you're forgetting that Neville's defiance was in part a direct continuation for Harry. Harry asked Neville to finish the job, to kill the snake, for the sake of the war.

Neville did not know the full ramifications of this request, but he trusted Harry.

And this was the last time Harry talked to Neville.

Neville's actions were trying to fulfill his friend's final wish.

And it was indeed awesome.

** That was an interesting read, thank you. I find myself quite agreeing with you overall, but here some counterarguments for the devil's advocate:

- Ginny starts dating Harry quite late because she is young (although she dates boys before him but it wouldn't be 'correct' if her and Harry started dating 'too early', it's intended as a children book..). While she has some good action scenes when they are at the Burrow, she stays in Hogwarts a*nd the books say nothing about how they experienced this episode*, aside from the fact that it was obviously painful with all these death-eaters. *Thus her personality could not be deepened during the last books, which is a shame as she finally became a prominent character.*

- Hexing people and sending birds in their face was shown as brave b*ecause... the book was written ten or more years ago, and that was how girls were shown as 'strong and fiery' before.* *And despite Rowling's 'progressive' opinions* (don't get me started on the last twitter polemics, I don't have anything to say about that), s*he still has deep gendered bias that everyone had at that time because gender didn't matter as much as now, and while we now know that this 'girl power' mentality is overrated and not the best feminist vision, we can comprehend the fact that Rowling could not think differently at that time.* It's like this thing about fat-shaming, where Dudley is stupid AND fat, which makes him detestable all the more. Now she would proudly defend herself, but fat-shaming wasn't even a thing when she wrote the books. *Thus we cannot criticize her for internalized bias that now seem obvious to anyone.*

- *Now to this awfully idiotic line* ' Well . . . I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much'. Yeah, that is not the most clever thing to say. But I don't think that is why she likes him anyway. She didn't know that when she was 11 and crushing hard on him: *I have trouble to think that an eleven-years-old girl might like a boy because he's famous.* His physical appearance and the fact that he was older than her, hanging with her older brother, is more likely to have played a role. And then Quidditch, etc etc...

Now I do agree with your overall argument, which is that Rowling did not give her enough personality and made her fantastic all of a sudden, especially based on physical criteria, which is the easiest but certainly not the most convincing way. As a fanfiction writer, I must acknowledge how pleasant it is not to be constraint by burdensome personality traits when I write about her, and I love to think about ways she could be 'fiery and strong' to give her more personality. That is for example the reason why I hate writing about characters such as Malfoy or Fred and George, because some of their personality traits are really annoying and yet you must use them if you want to stay true to the story.

  Even minor characters like Cho underwent some changes across the books.
#+end_quote

This is just wrong. You spend most of this post pointing out how Ginny goes from one character and becomes another, quite different, character whilst also concluding there is no change!?

#+begin_quote
  Ginny started off as a fangirl who then enrolled into the school and got possessed. She was then saved and, well, what then? By year 5 she gave Harry a little scolding on knowing what it felt like to be possessed, she became a star Quidditch player who (plot conveniently) replaced Harry.
#+end_quote

Ignoring the changes that you yourself are describing is... I don't know how to describe it.

Ginny is very far from flawless. We spend almost the entirety of HBP with basically only Harry actually caring about what Malfoy's up to. He's continually being told to let it go, basically. He doesn't and, yes, it turns out Harry's right (about Malfoy) but that doesn't make the reasoning he used right or the scepticism he received wrong. Ginny, in contrast, basically only knows that Harry nearly killed Malfoy and /still defends him/.

These are books written from Harry's perspective. Ginny doesn't get criticised for things like this because Harry either actively likes Ginny's takes or because he doesn't care about them at all. In contrast, he spends basically every interaction with Cho being confused about what's going on or in an earlier version of CHEST MONSTER.

(And to go back to the HBP Malfoy obsession... Harry spends most of the book unhappy with how unseriously people take Malfoy. And you wonder why pretty much the only person who doesn't comes off looking good?

And, yes, it's just one particular instance but it's representative of the way the Harry focussed viewpoint and moral lens in the book affects interpretation. Read, for example, The Pigman which is an alternating first person text with two narrators. It gives a very different lens on the book's plot to what we get with Harry in canon. I mean, [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/hmzk46/if_you_had_the_choice_of_reading_hp_from_any/][there's a reason why you get posts like this wondering about different POVs.]])

#+begin_quote
  that she's dating some bloke named Harry, not Dudley Do-Right with a wand---she's going to be sorely disappointed.
#+end_quote

As the sectumsempra incident shows, Ginny knows /exactly/ what actual Harry is like. Hell, you can even look at the way he casually forgets about the most traumatic thing Ginny's ever experienced...

Actually, let's talk about OOTP a bit more because I've seen quite a few people ITT talking about how it fits in with canon Hinny. It doesn't. OOTP is merely the first time Harry's really interacting with anyone outside of Ron and Hermione. There's a reason why we know so little about Daphne and the other Slytherin girls even though Harry spent six years in classes with them. In fact, if it weren't for the troll, it's quite conceivable Harry would barely know or care to know Hermione, too. He made one friend really early on and, probably due to having had no friends before this, was entirely happy with just that one friend and a bunch of casual acquaintances (several of whom he slept in the same room as). That we begin to see more of Ginny is no different to seeing more of Neville, Luna, Cho or, yes, the Twins (even though they'd previously been on the same Quidditch team as Harry).

So... now we go from no Ginny, basically, in books 3 and 4 and Hinny in 5 and 6, to no Ginny, basically, in books 3 and 4, to Ginny in book 5 and Hinny in book 6 (/because/ of the time interacting with her as a group member in OOTP and in the smaller social scene of the Burrow in HBP). And, unlike Cho, it means Ginny actually has an existence in the books beyond "object of Harry's affections" or, as Ginny was in CoS, "human macguffin".

Now, maybe there are other issues with Ginny. She's meant to be popular and I think there's some stuff that even Harry "spends years not noticing people who share classes with him" Potter notices, but I'm not sure that suits Ginny's experiences. Maybe it's part of the mean girl thing someone noted earlier (to Harry's *checks character's name* Aaron?) but even then. It seems to me that Ginny wouldn't bounce back just like so from CoS. I mean, it's not just her brothers but everyone that failed to notice what she was going through. She seems destined for being surly and aggressive, although we do get the latter and it is an era where "choosing sides" matters. But, then, we only see Harry's perspective and I cannot fail to emphasise this point enough... Harry barely cares about anyone other than Ron and Hermione. Whatever's happening offscreen could be pretty much anything.

I would similarly stick to fanfiction for good Hinny but I really don't think anyone holds Ginny up as one of the best characters in the series except insofar as she's a supporting role in the back end. It's hard to see her as being overrated, unless you mistake "movie Ginny sucks, book Ginny's much better".

  /“Well . . . I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much.”/

  Ginny seriously misunderstands Harry's motivation. She makes it sound like he's going to hunt Voldemort because this is what makes him happy in life. Well, it's not. Harry is a reluctant hero; if he had his druthers, he'd be living a quieter life. But Harry sees wrongs being committed in the world, and he feels compelled to stop them. That's very different from the swashbuckling adventurer Ginny seems to believe she's dating.
#+end_quote

What? No, she's right. Harry can't be happy unless Voldemort gets taken down, and he wants to be the one who does it, as per his previous quote. She doesn't think that he'd /rather/ be doing that than anything else or even that he enjoys it, just that doing anything else would be an exercise in misery for him. That's the whole point of why the prophecy is bogus - "neither can live while the other survives," not because of fate, but because neither one can go on with their lives while the other one is living. Voldemort has to kill the one giving Britain hope, and Harry has to defeat the guy who hurt his family and threatens his friends.

** Cho/Harry for sure got a better-paced relationship arc than Ginny/Harry.

Book 3: Harry notices Cho is pretty. Cho flirts a bit.

Book 4: Harry asks Cho out, gets rejected, but is left with the idea that Cho does like him.

Book 5: Cho tentatively pursues Harry while grieving for Cedric. Harry is (understandably) not emotionally equipped to deal with Cho's (understandable) guilt and depression. They date briefly and break up, partially as a result of their (understandable) complete loyalty to their respective best friends.

As opposed to...

Book 1: Ginny has a raging crush on Harry, to whom she has never spoken. Harry barely gives her a thought except to be embarrassed by her attention.

Book 2: Ginny has a raging crush on Harry, but is still too shy to speak to him. Harry barely gives her a thought until he needs to save her life... whereas he develops a friendship with Ron's other close-in-age siblings that nearly stands on its own apart from Ron. If Ron had evaporated, Harry still would have been Quidditch buddies with the twins, but would never have interacted with Ginny.

Book 3: Ginny continues to have a crush on Harry. Harry, if possible, notices her even less than ever.

Book 4: Ginny manages to open her mouth in Harry's presence but has no substantive interactions with him. She's still not on Harry's radar even when he's living with her family.

Book 5: Ginny is suddenly a Quidditch star. Manages a few substantive interactions with Harry about being possessed by Voldemort and breaking into Umbridge's office. When Ginny shows up to break into the Ministry at the book's climax, Harry still wishes someone else could have come in her place.

Book 6: Ginny is the hottest, most popular, best Quidditch player in the school and Harry has a dragon in his chest.

Book 7: Harry pines for Ginny while once again not interacting with her at all after the book begins in earnest.

I don't really agree with your points, but they're well written.

Yes, Ginny started as a fangirl, but so did every single character. She was further intimidated by the fact he was older than her. What ten year old girl isn't going to be intimidated by a child star coming to stay at her house. The equivalent of Justin Bieber or Macaulay Culkin at the height of their fame.

There's a lot to address, so what I will just say is...

The criticism that Ginny is underdeveloped could be applied to a lot of characters. /Even Hermione/. There's a great retelling of the stories that I'll look out, but essentially it's a re-read that focuses on Hermione, and...in the actual canon text, she really isn't there a lot of the time. She's remembered as being /more/ impactful partly because of imagination and partly because of the movies, but the boys spend a /lot/ of the books without her, or when she is there, complaining about her.

Ginny doesn't assert that Harry is happy hunting Voldemort. She asserts the he wouldn't be Happy if he didn't hunt him.

It's similar to saying "I knew it wouldn't rain because there are no clouds". That doesn't mean that if there were clouds, it would rain.

​

If Harry doesn't hunt Voldemort then he can never be happy because he will always know that he could've hunted Voldemort and he could potentially have saved lifes, if he did. It's in his nature, and that nature is what Ginny is referring to when she says "That's why I like you so much".

** Lowkey the girl with the most on screen chemistry with harry is Luna, shes probably the only character in the series to actually make harry look inward on his actions and while harry sometimes thinks Luna is weird all of thier moments together have been them supporting eachother.

In the movies this is amplified like 10 fold with how much more lone wolf and confident movie harry acts, Luna is by and by the only character other than sirious (and maybe Hermione's during the sadder scenes of DH) to get to see Harry's more vulnerable side.

And plus out of all the characters in the series luna is the one that's shown the most doing her own thing separate to harry, because she very clearly lives a life outside of harry and harry respects that to some degree even if he sometimes thinks shes weird lol

Idk, I think an argument for cho or hermione for book harry over ginny can definetly be made, but when it comes to the movies I'd say that luna was pretty much the only person who he had actual chemistry with.

*** I would agree with this. Luna I think /gets/ Harry in a way his other friends don't, because she is off-kilter enough that I think it short-circuits his defense mechanisms and so he lets himself be vulnerable around her in a way he doesn't even with Ron and Hermione (and probably rightfully so, as neither of them have dealt with loss at that point in the same way Harry and Luna have and are not really equipped/prepared to deal with Harry in the throes of it).

I think similarly that while Harry definitely doesn't /get/ Luna, and finds her odd, he is closer to her than any of their other friends are, and they have a lot of genuine affection for each other even if he never quite understands her in the same way she does him. At the beginning, the others mostly seem to tolerate her as Harry's weird, off-putting new friend, and while eventually they recognize her value, they never seem quite as close with her as Harry is (even Ginny, who's known her far longer). He's also willing to go to bat for her against her bullies at the end of OotP, even if she asks him not to.

I think this happens because we get to know Luna so well and what makes her tick, even by the end of book 5, and she gets some really good scenes with Harry. Ginny doesn't get either of those things (barring the nice moment in book 5 where she challenges him on the Voldemort possession thing), and I feel like Luna feels like more of a round character at the end of book 5 than Ginny does at the end of book 7, and one with more of an established relationship on the page. (That relationship certainly doesn't have to be romantic, though.)

It's not that what's there for Ginny is bad, entirely, or at least it could be good...it's just that there's not a ton there, especially for the love interest of the main character of a seven-book series who's been there since the beginning. Ginny should have had a larger role earlier, and have been developed more. A character introduced in book 5 of 7, and with a fairly small role in 6 and a small but key role in 7, shouldn't be more compelling.

This is *blatantly wrong*. She's only /flawless/ in Harry's eyes, but to a neutral observer, some of her actions were aggressive, cruel, and mean. For example, she beat up Zach Smith twice for asking dumb questions and making stupid comments (not even insults). She mocked Fleur mercilessly behind her back. She brutally insulted Ron for his lack of 'love' experience. And these were only actions seen by Harry directly. But he actually like these!

I can't believe you fell for this "unreliable narrator" literary tool.

** Ginny always struck me, after she became a relevant character and not just some blushing girl, as an almost stereotypical “mean girl.” I never liked her and she seems to come out of nowhere in the narrative as Harry's crush. With Cho, at least she was mentioned in PoA as being very pretty and IIRC her looks were distracting to Harry in the Quidditch match. Then there's Harry's failed attempt to ask her to the Yule Ball in GoF, culminating with their failed date and all that tension in OotP. That's /three/ books of buildup for a /failed/ relationship!

With Ginny we are given zero indication that Harry feels anything other than friendship and familial (adoptive) attachment to her. Then, all of a sudden, CHEST MONSTER. It's not an earned relationship whatsoever.

**** Earned in the sense that, from a narrative perspective, it came out of left field. Although I'm not definitely not the biggest Harmony shipper I'm the world, it makes sense to me how so many of those shippers felt let down by the final two books. There was a tremendous amount of buildup to Harry and Hermione's relationship; not romantically necessarily, but at least they /had/ a relationship. Ginny has very very few moments on page with Harry. And the one thing they both could have bonded over (being possessed by Voldemort) is never addressed except for a one-off comment. In literature, moments need to feel earned. They need to feel organic. It's why so many people had a problem with the final season of Game of Thrones. The moments were not earned. They weren't organic. I feel the same way about Ginny. Her role as the love of Harry's life is not developed over the course of the series. It just sort of happens.

** Exactly!! She's nothing more than a Mary Sue that Harry is just /supposed/ to fall in love, I've believed this since ages and it is nice to see someone with a shared opinion.

There's not a single flaw that comes to mind when I think about her. The only thing that comes close is that she has a temper, but that is hardly a flaw. Her fiery temper has never landed her in trouble as compared to Ron's insecurities, Harry's recklessness and insatiable desire for truth, and Hermione's narrow-mindedness and believing that she alone has the right answer - these things bore actual consequences for the Trio. If anything, it is used as a cute character quirk. She could also be mean at times, especially humouring herself by making fun of someone (Phlegm comes to mind), but again, it is used as a quirk rather than something that bears actual consequence for her.

After CoS, she was shunned in the background with barely any noteworthy action and then she appeared out of nowhere in HBP.

In Half-Blood Prince, information about Ginny was constantly bombarded to the readers. She is beautiful (even Slytherins like Blaise Zabini thinks so), she is popular (everyone loves her), she is magically powerful (even Fred and George are scared of her Bat-Bogey Hex while Slughorn is impressed by it). That Ginny and the Ginny before HBP are hardly the same.

She cannot do anything wrong and suddenly. She's hardly ever called out for her actions.

I would've preferred if she had lost her self-esteem after the debacle of Diary, and she went to being a quiet, reserved and shy girl, and the rest of the books had her gaining her fire back and trying to be more outgoing and engaging. It would've been much better if the Diary laid some long-term trauma for her that took a lot of time to fight out, and it would've made for an inspiring story unlike the one we actually got.

** This is what I've said about this before:

#+begin_quote
  To be fair, Book Ginny wasn't developed much at all either. I think there were so many opportunities with Ginny, to turn her into a fully fleshed character, but then I read HPB and DH and it just felt like JKR went: /"oh shit! totally forgot to give him a love interest... wait, here's a girl"./ She should have gotten more page time.

  Yeah, she spends time with them, but what I mean to say is we don't get to explore much of Ginny's personality. She's not constantly around like Ron and Hermione, so we don't get to know her through observing her, and we aren't told much about her as a person either. I firmly believe we should have gotten to know Ginny, not /just/ through her interactions with other people (though that is a huge part). I've said this before; I don't know if you've ever watched/heard "Hamilton", but this is the same problem I have with Eliza. We only ever get to see her in relation to Hamilton, and then at the end, she has a song in which she tells us how she told his story. A lot of that would have been more impactful if we knew more about her. But my biggest problem with the character of Ginny is that we don't see any of her flaws. We're told that Ginny and Harry have this deep, meaningful relationship, but we never get to see what makes the relationship meaningful, what's right with it, what's wrong with it, what they fight about, etc. Even if we know what Ginny's vibe is, we don't really know Ginny until we've experienced her flaws. She just comes off as a generic cool girl.

  EDIT: Also, I totally think she should have been with them for at least part of DH. But then I also think the Horcrux Hunt should have been much, much, /much/ longer, which, surprisingly, most people don't seem to like, so.

My internal reaction to that has always been like... really? did i read a different book? what was so overwhelmingly badass about Ginny in the books?

It's always made me uncomfortable that Harry and Ginny end up together. There's something Freudian in that energy, as if Harry is subconsciously marrying a Molly Weasley mother figure in Ginny. But that's just me.

The Changeling is the only fanfic that's made me genuinely excited with Ginny and I think it fixes all the complaints you've laid out. I made a post recently about my dissatisfaction with canon (I got roasted to no end) but one of my main points is that a lot of the time, our heroes aren't really pushed to change or overcome their own flaws. As you point out, so many of their instances of cruelty are laughed off or painted as badass and rarely are they ever challenged to see a different point of view. Which hey, I get it, there's lots of good reasons for that and you can excuse a whole lot with Harry's unreliable narrator argument, but fics like The Changeling really demonstrate how more complexity can be introduced into these stories without losing the plot or the wonder.

** Yeah. Fanon has written some good Ginnys, but Ginny is not a good character in the book(not as in good/evil dichotomy, but high quality/low quality).

I don't mind stories that have Ginny with Harry, but frankly, it feels like the romance just comes out of nowhere in 6th year in the canon books. She's a bit part in the first book, a plot point in the second, and from then on, is more or less a non-entity(more or less just appearing collectively with the rest of the Weasleys) until /Order of the Phoenix/ where she talks to Harry about Voldemort and possession.

The thing is, IIRC, Rowling was actually planning on Harry ending up with Hermione, but ultimately changed her mind, but it was several books in, and she hadn't developed Ginny as a character at all, which lead to the rather jarring and sudden romance.

On a side note, I remember getting into a rather baffling argument with someone over /when/ exactly Harry became interested in Ginny(the other person saying he liked her since 3rd year), and I guess they must have mixed up canon with a fanfic they read, because the only character I can remember Harry expressing any romantic interest in at the time was Cho during a Quidditch match(apparently when she blocked him during the match, it was enough to give him butterflies in his stomach).

One thing I find puzzling in these sorts of threads is that it's acknowledged (by Hermione, I think) that Ginny grew up and got sick of waiting around for Harry so she does her own thing. Harry has quite a narrow view - I'd argue lots of teenage friendship groups do, so he doesn't see Ginny develop.

Yes, maybe it would have been cool if we'd consistently seen Ginny in the books, but teens change considerable in development. It would have been stranger if she hadn't had leaps in development with the amount of attention Harry gives to her.

Also, surely developing feelings seemingly out of nowhere for someone the hallmark of teen relationships? It seemed that way to me. But then again, as a teen the 'chest monster' sounded like a reasonable metaphor for crushing.

** First of all I am a hinny shipper and this comment is quite long so please bare with me. I promise u wont regret reading it. Now back to the topic. I completely agree with the fact that ginny's character needs improvement and wasnt written well.

Now coming to the better characterization of cho. According to me Cho was written in detail because she was harry's first crush. Rowling had to go into great detail because it was the first time the readers were reading about harry's interest in girls. It was the first time he was acting like a proper hormonal teenager.

As for ginny's characterization. Rowling has written her so poorly (one of my all time dissapointments) that she had to fit in small details about her through that random hogsmeade shopkeeper and slughorn's comments.

Ginny's weakness or faults. She has a hella temper which was highlighted during numerous occasions. She says things she doesnt mean when she is angry, like during her confrontation with ron about dean behind the tapestry. She said that ron is jealous that he didnt get to kiss anyone which led to that whole lavender fiasco. She is stubborn af(department of ministries). Harry didnt go through that shy phase with her because they grew up together and knew each other all along.

She wasnt just waiting for harry the last year while sulking around. She was in the DA and gave it her all to help the students there. She never wavered to help people around though she was a 'blood traitor '. But i just dont see cho doing that. Harry needs someone who understands him and gives him space all the while being there for him. None of the other females did that INCLUDING hermoine. She doesnt cry all time like cho and is practical which helps harry. She is so much like harry when it comes to protecting their loved ones. She doesnt let harry's temper affect her like their discussion after sirius's death. In a sick/dark way she knows how it feels like to have voldy inside her head. She didnt step down when harry commanded her to not to come to department of ministries and the ROR during the war. This just shows that she is a strong woman.

As for her not being shown with any weaknesses. Isnt it obvious?. The chamber of secrets!!!. It practically destroyed her childhood which changed her. For gods sake, her whole character started with her getting possessed and almost killed by voldy so ofc she is going to be strong later on. So yeah thats all i got to say. Peace out(btw if any godly ppl have read until the end, I salute ur patience)

** Yo I was gonna make a long essay type post saying the exact same things but was afraid of the backlash. This totally sums up all my points. I never liked Ginny in the books, and I liked her even less in the movies...

** Although Ginny did feel like an object I never got the impression that she was a reward for Harry... It felt the reverse, that Harry was a reward for Ginny.

** Hard agree with almost everything. I've thought this from the very beginning, and my opinion hasn't changed. If anything, I dislike book Ginny even more as time has passed. She should have gotten way more character development, it's pretty obvious that Rowling just stuck a girl in there for Harry.

** Should Harry should have ended up with Hermione? Maybe. I could see the argument either way.

I do think they were by far a better fit than Ron and Hermione. Ron was awful most of the time. Harry at least appreciated her and interacted with her in a meaningful way. Way more relationship development there than with Ginny.

** I am personally don't have a favorite ship but I absolutely hate Harry/Ron or Harry/Hermione. Their too much like siblings

I agree that Ginny is overrated. In a lot of fan fictions I hate how Hermione and Ginny are portrayed. Like seriously I started hating Hermione at some point until I rewatched the movies and realized absorbed in Fanon I was.

I. Never like Ginny much and agree with your points
