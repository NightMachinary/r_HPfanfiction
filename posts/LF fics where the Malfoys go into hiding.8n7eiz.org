At the end of HBP, on the tower, Dumbledore has a conversation with Draco Malfoy where he offers Draco, Narcissa and Lucius a way out of Voldemort's grip - a chance to go into hiding, protected by the Order.

Reading that scene again, I get the sense that Draco is tempted by this offer. Very tempted. Unfortunately, they're interrupted by the Carrows and Greyback, and so this offer is never taken up.

Are there any fics where they're not interrupted quite so soon? Are there fics where Draco says /yes, please, get me out/?

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Lily's sacrifice did a lot more for Harry than protect him from Voldemort. It protected him from the worst of his relatives' abuse, too. But when Dumbledore tells him the whole story, he decides he's had enough and takes control of his life. Set in sixth year.

** Not exactly what happens, but in The Seventh Horcrux, the Malfoys seek protection from the Order after Dumbledore's death linkffn(The Seventh Horcrux by melindaleo).

There betrayal is actually pretty important to the plot here, unlike in DH where the only reason they show up is so Harry can luck into his deus ex machina of the year (and resolve several promises Rowling realized she had hinted at but forgot to deal with a la Pettigrew).

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

**** It would be super interesting, because Draco's character is so conflicted already - a few more moments and he could have caved. I can just imagine how angry he would be when he found out Potter was there watching.

****** And Narcissa would come with him - but would Lucius, would he feel disgraced enough to bend his neck? And if he did come I can just imagine them being protected by effectively being prisoners until Voldemorts dead. I could just imagine - if Dumbledore didn't die that night, Snape wouldn't have died either. I can just imagine the fall out when they find out that Snape was a double this whole time.

******* I think Dumbledore would still have died that night. The Unbreakable Vow was still in effect, and Dumbledore asked him to do it because he already knew he was dying anyway.

The interesting part is that as soon as Dumbledore dies, people are going to start asking Draco and Narcissa “did you KNOW this would happen?”

Lots of anger and grief there, and it's going to be directed at Draco a hell of a lot.
