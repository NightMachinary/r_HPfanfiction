So I've read a lot of fics where Harry gets summoned into another reality where the war is still going on and the "Light" is losing (either his other self is dead or useless or anything) and he always ends up helping.

If he was from a universe where everyone was dead (Like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]] linkffn(6892925)) I would understand that he would help and stay; not really want to go back to basically nothing but if there were still people in his universe (like in canon basically).

Why would he help? Why would he not try to find any way possible to go back. I mean he's just out of a gruesome war where he barely survived (and even died for it). Yeah he can understand them in a way but they basically kidnap someone who they know faced the same hardship to force them to go through it again because they're too weak and useless to do something themselves (as we see the Order and the Ministry in canon "stunning" their deadly enemies). Even worst, often there is no way to send him back. It's just, "Meh we can't win, let's ruin someone else's life to do it for us" without asking if he's got maybe family and people depending on him (like Teddy).

This may sound edgy and all but in his position I would most likely try every way to find a way back even if it means dooming this universe (I mean if the canon universe could win despite the odds who couldn't) or even ask help to the "dark" side who would more likely be extremely happy to get rid of this "saviour" who actually won in his universe. Yeah they would more likely try to kill him but I think Voldemort in this situation could be logical about it and help to send him back instead of making him another enemy... (with maybe a trickery at the last moment or for when he's on the other side) and a person in this situation would also more likely have contingencies in case of Voldemort getting aggressive.

A "hero" in this situation losing his family just after barely saving what was left of it to help strangers? Of course they look the same but he doesn't know them. They're nothing to him. Mere echoes of what he lost *because* of them even. And I can understand the dark summoning outside help (if they're not too proud for it) because they don't care whatsoever about anyone's opinion but the "light" side. They're supposed to be "good guys"... even if I can totally see Dumbledore doing this with his Greater Good vision (if he can sacrifice a teenager why not another?).

I began to read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9649140/1/To-Call-A-Place-Home][To Call A Place Home]] linkffn(9649140) and for now I stopped because I'm in no mood to see yet another Harry roll over to help people who basically kidnapped him (even if reluctantly on his part).

So after this mini rant, is there any completed or on-going/not abandoned fic out there with this plot? (I already read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6320683/1/Yet-Another-Universe][Yet Another Universe]] linkffn(6320683) where he helps but ask to get paid for it).

If not well do consider this a prompt.

  Harry won the war. It's a couple months afterwards and unexpectedly, he's quite literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago and the Potter family's still fighting a war with a Dark Lord whose ruling over the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry doesn't really want in.

*** I actually read a fic like that once. Harry was summoned to another dimension by Dumbledore because he was dead in that dimension, but the new Harry wasn't at all what they expected. He was very much a ruthless, mercenary, pragmatic, and some might say monstrous individual who gave no fucks because he'd lost everything, and was /pissed/ about being summoned. He wound making Dumbledore's life miserable, extorting the hell out of everyone for profit, and in general being a 90s anti hero. His only friend and remanining companion was a fanatically devoted Luna who'd pretty much gone insane from the war and wound up crossing dimensions to find him.

It was really fucking cool.
