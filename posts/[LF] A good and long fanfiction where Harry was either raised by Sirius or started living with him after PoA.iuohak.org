I'm good with all ships(If you have some good wolfstar ones I'll DEFINITELY read them) at the exception of Snarry(unless the age gap is solved like in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7892593/chapters/39108019#workskin]] , srls I hate Snarry but in this fic it just WORKS) and Harry/Tom Riddle(like srls this man murdered Harry's parents and wants to kill him too, I don't understand this ship) but again if you have good fanfics of this ship where there is some time travel involved and Harry meets him before Tom becomes Voldemort I'll give it a try(if it's a Harry/Tom fic,of course it doesn't need to fit in the [LF] context, I'm just curious to see if there are any fics I'll like with this ship) I'm looking forward to your links!üòÅ


** I would say linkffn(8045114) would be a good one!
