He mentions it about twice I think, his dad. But never talks to Harry about them. No discussion at all until the confrontation with Sirius in the shrinking shack. Even had to wait for it to be brought up during expeco patronum lessons.

**** That's a fair out of universe reason, but fanfiction often benefits from dealing with in-universe reasons. There are fics where it's an issue of shame/cowardice, of safety due to being a werewolf, of the protections on the house, etc. Prince of Slytherin doesn't have an explicit justification yet. of course.

This is a common problem that again goes back to the whole evolution of Harry Potter from being reflective of fairy tales to a young adult novel. We see something similar in lots of other longer running popular works- one that springs to mind is Naruto, who is hated/ignored by all the villagers to make him a more sympathetic hero of low initial standing that overcomes challenges, but eventually reveals half a dozen people who could've taken care of him including his godfather.

Sure. I kind of interpret questions phrased as OP's as questions about canon. A question more like "Why wouldn't Remus have talked to Harry about his parents?" would lead me to speculate on how to make a reasonable version of Remus who would have behaved like that.

About halfway into the chapter is a flashback to a conversation between Remus and Peter, where Remus is upset about Harry being sent away for being a squib, and especially being sent to Petunia. "I was willing to go Muggle if that's what it took to become Harry's guardian. To forsake the magical world forever and live as a Muggle. And James laughed. He literally laughed in my face and said 'How could that ever work, Moony? You're a werewolf' "

** I'm of two minds about this. 7 years later I can barely remember the name of my roommates kid from when I was 21, and I couldn't give you more than two or three stories about her even though we hung out every day for over a year. So, can I really expect Remus to have stories to tell? What if his memory is like mine, and he can just say general things about James and Lily.

On the other hand, this is the wizarding world and they have the ability to pull memories out of heads with perfect recall even after 50 years as per Slughorns memory shows. We're talking about a memory that Slughorn tried so hard to repress and deny, but was able to pull out crisp and detailed. So why does no one give Harry penisieve memories of his parents, I'm sure Dumbledore would let him use the thing.

Why did he not mention in school? There is no justification. All we can say is that his character wasn't part of series at that time. But if we are to explain with in-universe reasoning than we can say that Lupin was fiercely loyal to Dumbledore. He usually didn't go against Dumbledore's wishes.

**** What's the canon reason for taking over charge of a kid on the night his parents died?

According to Hagrid (Book 3) Dumbledore sent him to pick Harry. Hagrid picked Harry, Sirirus arrived and asked Hagrid to hand over Harry to him but Hagrid denied saying Dumbledore ordered him to bring Harry to Petunia's house.

Remus probably didn't know where Harry was living. Nobody in magical world seemed to have any idea of his whereabouts before he reached Hogwarts.

Um, because his parents died and he's a toddler? /Somebody/ has to take him. And at the time, Dumbledore thought Sirius was a death eater who had just turned Harry's parents over to Voldemort. But even if that wasn't the case, delivering a baby to the closest immediate family is the action that makes the most sense, even in the muggle world.

Can you tell me where in canon it says he thought something like this?

You mean putting him in a basket and leave at doorstep in a cold night, without any care, and a letter in hand?

And later put people on watch of that family so they feel insecure in their own home?

According to Britian Law:

Offense of abduction of child by other persons.

(1) [F1 Subject to subsection (3) below, a person, other than one mentioned in subsection (2) below.] commits an offense if, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, he takes or detains a child under the age of sixteen---

(a)so as to remove him from the lawful control of any person having lawful control of the child; or

(b)so as to keep him out of the lawful control of any person entitled to lawful control of the child.

Britain minister of magic and other minister were in contact. They both serve the Queen, so their laws are probably same. Dumbledore is a criminal according to Britain Law. So tell me who gave Dumbledore right to send someone and abduct Harry?

In PoA Chapter 21 Dumbledore says:

#+begin_quote
  "I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper."
#+end_quote

I know it's easy to get confused when you read all the bashing and alternate universes in fanfiction, but what happened according to canon is that when Sirius switched with Peter, it was a secret. No one knew except James, Lily, Peter, and Sirius. Dumbledore didn't know, Lupin didn't know... there was an unknown spy in the Order and the objective was to use Sirius as a decoy- everyone thought he was the Secret-Keeper so that any possible DE attacks would happen to him and not the real Secret-Keeper, Peter. So when James and Lily died, /everyone/, including Dumbledore, thought that Sirius had betrayed them.

#+begin_quote
  They both serve the Queen
#+end_quote

Please give me some support for /that/ in canon. I haven't seen any at all. Their laws are patently not the same, the wizarding world does some rather horrible things to muggles, including obliviating them and the age of majority is not the same, to name just a couple of differences.

Additionally, I don't think removing a child from a blasted house where his parents had just been killed to take him to the people who had lawful control of him- his nearest relatives- would count as kidnapping even under muggle British law.

He didn't have authority to do so. His actions on that day are really hard to shove under rug as coincident.

The thing about third person limited PoV is that we only see or hear what protagonist see or hears. We don't know if things they hear or seee are true or false. We have to make informed (or sometimes logical conclusions to fill the gaps) guesses. For example Dumbledore here seems to be implying he gave Ministry proofs. But! Sirius never received a trial. If he hasn't received a trial when exactly did he give proof?

Who exactly are you thinking he needed authority from? We haven't seen any kind of evidence of CPS or any kind of child placement services even existing in magical Britain. Again, their laws are not the same, and every other child we've seen who's lost parents just seems to casually end up at the home of their closest living relative, just like Harry.

As for when Dumbledore gave evidence, a trial isn't the only place to do so. There could have been an incident report. There could have been a hearing to decide whether to have a trial or evidence gathering and statements taken in case they did go ahead with a trial, though they obviously decided not to.

You wake up and see that both the people in the front seat are dead, but their kid, strapped in his car seat in the back, is just fine. You recognize the couple- they're your friends!- and you're very sad, but you know the kid's grandma lives a few houses down, so you take the kid to her to look after while the police and ambulance are on the way.

What's to stop him from abducting other kids? If his morals allow him to sacrifice Harry like a lamb (at the end) who knows how many kids died because he thought he was doing whatever was 'best' for magical world. After all who was going to stop him?

So tell me. Are you okay if some old man comes to your home and decides your kid is better off somewhere else and ships your kid of an unknown location? What if that old man had means (magic) to use and make you do things (kind of like how Ron did for driving license)?

How do we know how much of the behavior of Dursley's was fabricated, modified or false memories? Harry Potter universe books are 3rd person PoV from Harry's perspective. We won't be able to find out things that were out of his sight.
