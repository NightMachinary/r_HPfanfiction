Please give me all your Snarry/Harrymort/Tomarry fanfictions where Harry is not the savior of the wizarding world like everyone believes him to be, he is secretly cunning, manipulative, and cautious and plots to end the light. May have Weasley/Granger/Dumbledore or generally just light bashing.


** The Rise Of A Dark Lord by Little Miss Xanda is Tomarry and has a harry in slytherin who is super manipulative and it also references masks throughout the entire fic.
