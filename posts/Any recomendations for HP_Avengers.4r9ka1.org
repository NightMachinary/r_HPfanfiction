I've already read linkffn(Finding Home by cywsaphyre) and linkffn(Steve and the Barkeep), and I'm looking for more similar stories. In general I prefer adult avengers interaction with either mid teen or adult Harry. Slash isn't a deal breaker but I don't want it to be the main focus.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

** I'm currently reading linkffn(8897431). There are some issues with grammar but on the whole it's very good so far, and very long. Starts in 3rd year.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

In line with Steve and the Barkeep, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/Wanderer][Wanderer]] linkffn(8208936) has an unknown Harry interacting with Marvel. Sadly, just as it starts to get good it been left un-updated. It's by the same author as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8275548/1/Mirror-Mirror][Mirror Mirror]] linkffn(8275548) is also the same (even if it is marked slash, it hasn't yet shown any) and is really excellent with how SHIELD would react to finding out about Harry. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/I-See-The-Moon][I See The Moon]] linkffn(8212843) has a great broken Harry and helping Bruce. Tony is also great in character too. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8643484/1/All-Hallows-Eve-New-York][All Hallows Eve New York]] linkffn(8643484) is a fun little humor one shot. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10177155/1/Tricksters-and-Gods][Tricksters and Gods]] linkffn(10177155) is also fun, and worth a read, and has a good sassy Loki!Harry. It's also complete, which is always a good thing. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8240089/1/Mortem-Cantor][Mortem Cantor]] linkffn(8240089) is a lot of fun, but sadly hasn't been updated in a long time. Harry is boarding on mad scientist and Fury is exasperated. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10835321/1/Behind-the-Shield][Behind the Shield]] linkffn(10835321) is a little AU of Mortem Cantor which is reason alone to read Mortem Cantor. I still giggle when re-reading it. If you don't mind fem!Harry (and really, this fem!Harry still has a backbone, so it's not too bad), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10524028/1/The-Observer-Effect][The Observer Effect]] linkffn(10524028) is a nice little story, with a great relationship built between Harry and Tony. [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/209843][MoD!Harry is Not Amused]] is a great little series of fun one shots in which Harry as Death is very much over the shit that goes on in the marvel universe.

  Harry Potter had never really managed a normal, peaceful Halloween, so he really shouldn't have been surprised when he was suddenly displaced from the grocery store and found himself in front of a maniacally cackling man in a very dramatic outfit.

  After losing everything he holds dear, Harry Potter is thrust into a new world; one with Superheroes and evil Villains that make Voldemort look like a kitten. Struggling to survive in this new world - and, meanwhile, gaining the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. - he attempts to live a NORMAL life. But, he is Harry Potter after all... what could possibly go wrong? Possible Slash!

#+begin_quote
  Loki's in for it now. Odin has had enough and has banished him to Earth to relearn some lessons. Too bad he hadn't paid attention to where Loki ended up. Now Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has to deal with memories that aren't his own while he gets his revenge on those who sought to use him as a weapon. Can Harry regain what he lost, or will his past self take control first?

#+begin_quote
  Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.

  After Tony Stark outs himself as Iron Man on live television, he acquires a magical stalker in the form of a bored (female) Harry Potter, who has emerged from the Veil of Death in a world without wizards. A cat-and-mouse game ensues when Stark's curiosity drives him to ever-increasing lengths to capture his invisible benefactor, who struggles with maintaining her distance.

  It was a good thing the new scientist, Dr. Harry Evans, was working out so well. Because nothing else was going Fury's way. And that was before Loki made off with the Tesseract and some of his people. Maybe AU to Mortem Cantor by Kyandua.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony.

** linkffn(Teeth by hathanhate) (still ongoing) is probably my favorite.

It doesn't start as a crossover right away- it starts after GoF, and doesn't reach the MCU until somewhere around chapter 30 I think. The MCU content so far has been more about Thor's universe than any of the other Avengers.

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.
