You see, I love reading Powerful! Harry, but most fanfictions tend to put him in Slytherin, as if he couldn't be powerful in other houses. And as if it weren't bad enough, all the other houses look stupid compared to sly. The Gryffindors speak loudly, have no manners and it seems that being a good person is suddenly a horrible defect. The other two houses are - I don't know, they are just there.

Besides, there seems to be a consensus that being sarcastic is a unique feature of Slytherin. I really don't think so??? I have seen phrases like '' you should be in Slytherin '' whenever a character from another house says something sarcastic. Come on, it's not fair, young people are extremely sarcastic. It is not a characteristic of any house. It's kind of universal.

Take canon Harry, he is very sassy AND HE IS A GRYFFINDOR.

Not to mention that every time a character does something minimally intelligent, a proud Slytherin always says '' The Sorting Hat was wrong to put you in Gryffindor ''...very offensive, huh.

And the whole thing about Slytherin kids understanding politics so well makes me tremble. Give me a break! They are children, wait until they are old enough to discuss politics. Writing about children acting and speaking very maturity is just weird.

​

all these fanfictions look like this to me

''Wait, do you want a strong and independent Hermione? Take all her fanfictions on slytherin, the house for all the characters who stopped being "stupid" and decided to stop caring about everyone.''

''Harry went back in time and is he wiser and more powerful? Okay, Sorting Hat, I think that means he /MUST/ be in Slytherin.''

''Hey! You made a very smart decision, you deserve the password for the Slytherin common room. TAKE IT.''

''Have you suddenly become a villain and want to take revenge on the old manipulator? Okay, come in, not all Slytherins are bad, but you know, the protocol insists that you belong among the snakes.''

​

I think I'm tired


** I personally feel like Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff both are just automatically dismissed by the fandom. Slytherin is the edgy choice, they use it to delve into the more stereotypical views of magic ie. Dark vs light vs. Grey and rituals and chasing power and the character not allowing themselves to be "controlled" by an authority figure. It's the same MO every time which is why I tend to use the exclude option for the Slytherin Harry tag on AO3 because there's nothing unique there.

*** I agree, it is basically the same premise, nothing original. But I think that all houses deal with stereotypes, Slytherin is just the worst in that because it is the "villain's house". And to tell you the truth, I'm not so interested in slytherin in general, so I stop reading whenever I see one of the defects I listed above :-)

** Putting harry in slytherin is a good way to create conflict in the story. This + the 'edgy' factor are the main reasons why authors do this

*** Yes, I understand although I don't like the aspects I mentioned above. And it's obvious that slytherin is the most used house in fanfictions (since Rowling didn't develop sly characters other than villains) and it's an interesting house to explore ... and more importantly, I think a lot of potterheads today are Slytherins, so it's easier to write about the characters in their house

** I'd love to read a well done Hufflepuff Harry some time. He really was an incredibly loyal kid, even as a very young kid. He has some powerful loyalty to parents he can't even remember, and to new friends even after he barely met them.

Dumbledore told him that only a true Gryffindor could have pulled the sword out of the sorting hat, but it was his unwavering loyalty to Dumbledore that summoned Fawkes in the first place. That's pretty impressive strength of character for a 12 year old kid.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

C'est La Vie by cywscross

The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** Well Gryffindors are biased too. Dumbledore says that they sort people to quickly when Snape says he won't return to Voldemort if he comes back.

In fact the houses of Hogwarts should be no more than the colleges from Oxford/Cambridge. Yeah... they value some qualities over others but it's just a priority list and not a definition of your personality. Pettigrew is always referred to as a coward and he was a Gryffindor, Crabbe and Goyle were of course the epitome of cunning intelligent Slytherin (/s for the Crabbes and Goyles of reddit), we meet few other people from the rest of the houses but Cho seems pretty dumb as a person (although she could have been smart academically) despite being a Ravenclaw.

*** In those cases I would say the house depends on what the character values or admires in others. Crabbe and Goyle value power, what little they have as thugs and what Malfoy enables them to do. Pettigrew was jealous of how brave and charismatic his friends were, as well as how they inspired loyalty to each other.

Snape had some bravery and loyalty, but at his sorting he wanted to accrue skills and connections that would help him escape his parents.

  You see, I love reading Powerful! Harry, but most fanfictions tend to put him in Slytherin, as if he couldn't be powerful in other houses. And as if it weren't bad enough, all the other houses look stupid compared to sly. The Gryffindors speak loudly, have no manners and it seems that being a good person is suddenly a horrible defect. The other two houses are - I don't know, they are just there.

But isn't that precisely one (not the) appeal? Your latter point is POV bias: In Canon, the two prototypes (Draco and Pansy) are cowards, backstabbers, cheats, liars and bigots. And, in accordance with Gryffindor morals, those traits are shown as bad, their actions as morally wrong, their characters as repulsive.

Conversely, if you invert this for a Slytherin!Harry, Draco and Pansy are self-preserving, sly, "use any means to win" and defend traditional order. And according to Slytherin morals, those traits are laudable, their actions commendable, their characters appealing. And in turn, now /Gryffindor/ is bad, wrong and repulsive: reckless (== bold), stupid (== brave), narrowminded (== having and standing up for strict ideas of what is "right") etc, you get the drift.

Precisely this is why I read Slytherin!Harry, or any other House takes, for that matter: Because the implicit moral framework is shifted, and the story can explore the resulting world view; the same world, seen through a radically different lens.

As for the former ... "power" is vast term. In the broadest sense, any House will produce powerful alumni. I guess the difference in Slytherin is that there, an inherent will to /use/ that power is assumed, because that is "ambition". And so, the more you want power in order to use it, the more of a Slytherin you are -- and in want of other traits being stronger than this one, I guess people in those cases just naturally end up in Slytherin.

As for the rest, YMMV. Hit and miss, but I'm not begrudging you your rant. Been there, done that. :)
