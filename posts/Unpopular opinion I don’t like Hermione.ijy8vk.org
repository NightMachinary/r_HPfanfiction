Her personality is just so oppressive for me and she is so in your face with her knowledge. I know she was trying really hard towards the end to work on that but still. I think the movies didn't help my view of her, but I didn't like her way before, when I read the books.

This isn't to say I'm a Hermione basher, I just don't like her. The same goes for Mrs Weasley, because she's so maternal. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with being a doting mother, my mum's also like that but not to the point where it's smothering, if you know what I mean, and both of their characters make me uncomfortable.

Anyway, yeah, unpopular opinion.... Tell me what you think!


** My big issue with her is that her whole character centered around her being a teacher's pet. She had character growth of course, but it was frustrating to me to see her as like the embodiment of every smart stereotype I've ever been labeled as. I mean for God's sake she bought her best friend a homework planner! And she sounds like she's memorized a textbook and is just very socially awkward.

It frustrates me when I see her held up as like the smart female character in literature. I'd rather see smart, but forgets to turn her homework in. Or smart but does the bare minimum on her homework because she stayed up all night finishing some fiction series. Or smart but bad at academics because of lack of motivation since she's so far ahead.

I mean beyond learning she doesn't even seem to have hobbies. She takes up knitting as part of her crusade, but everything else points to her spending all her time researching literally everything, without even a specific area of interest. Was she most interested in history? Or the sciences? Or magical creatures? Did she ever read any fiction?

To me her brains often seem like more of a plot device than anything else.

** Same. She is tolerable enough in the actual canon, though still someone I wouldn't consider befriending. Self-righteous, socially awkward, arrogant, selectively obsessive about rules and authority (which imo is even more annoying than being either a constant bootlicker or rebel). And in GoF she starts giving off the vibe of the rich, suburb kid that becomes an 'activist' just to sate their Messianic complex.

I knew people like that at various moments in my life. Canon Hermione, to me, was someone I was okay with me because thats just how the story is. She could have been way worse, and she is quite a realistic character, despite not being enjoyable for me personally.

​

And speaking of way worse, /fanon Hermione./ Fucking hell, just Fyiendifire me already! Perfect, beautiful, cute shy, Merlin 2.0, the girl that the entire country simps for. People rag on fics that make Harry OP, but Hermione is OP in pretty much every single fanfiction she features in. And that's another thing. She is in.ever.single.fic. Doesn't matter the genre, the story, the ship, the starting point.... she will be there. I've read so much fanfiction, but her's is the only character about which my perception actually changed because of it. And it changed for the worse.

And let's not even mention her alternate fanon take, the antagonist Hermione. She has more blind obedience towards her idols and stereotypes than the Hitler Youth had for Hitler.

*** I just finished reading a Neville/OC (Draco's twin sister) and Hermione was in it.

To be honest, she wasn't really praised, as she had done something unforgivable, and the story flowed really well, but I think that is the only story with Hermione that doesn't idolise her, nor bash her.

Most other fics I've read, Hermione was featured in all of them when she had no business being there!

** I often think I'm the only one with this opinion, so it's nice to see I'm not alone. In the books she is flawed, as any good character should be.

However, I find her really annoying most of the time. She pokes her nose in things she has nothing to do with (following Harry and Ron when they go out for the midnight duel in PS), and a self-righteousness and inability to see different perspectives of things (like thinking all house-elves want to be free, though I know she means well, or dismissing Luna because /Hermione/ hasn't heard of Blibbering Humdingers).

She strikes me as a self-righteous (and a bit arrogant) person considering her opinions to never consider other people's opinions. She doesn't trust Harry or Ron's opinions much. In her mind, she's always the one who's right (unless it's a teacher).

What's worse is how vicious she is. The contract she made that cursed Marietta is one thing (it's a war after all), but I can't forgive her for attacking Ron for no other reason that she was jealous(HBP) and couldn't manage her own anger (HBP and DH). If Ron had done the exact same thing when he was pissed off about Krum, he would never have forgiven. Funny, then, how Hermione's assault is brushed under a rug, or sometimes even justified.

She is controlling and argumentative and bossy. If there is an abusive Ron/Hermione fic, Ron's always the one who's abusing Hermione. He never raised a hand at her. I find it far more likely that she's the one being abusive in a Ron/Hermione relationship.

** My biggest issue is that while Hermione has flaws that are obvious and cause issues sometimes which is fine because what's a good character without flaws, she's never called out on it or suffered any real consequences from her actions. She's constantly justified in the things she does. I'm not saying I like bashing but when I find a fic, rare as that is, that calls her out without outright bashing, it's a glorious thing because without it, there's never going to be a whole lot of real character development.

I really enjoy fics where characters help Hermione get over her problems. She's friendless as a child in large part because of her own actions and behaviours. Sadly as you said, fics helping Hermione improve are all too rare, since I really like Hermione, but she's not perfect.

Truth be told, I am also not that fond of Hermione (though she does get better by the middle of the fourth book only to regress in the sixth and get slightly better during the seventh), at least partially because by this point I have already read so many fanfics in which she is either bashed or made to be the be-all end-all of intelligence (which somehow makes her /even more/ unlikeable then when she is outright bashed) that it clouds my opinion of her character a little.

Everyone paints her as this goddess who can do no wrong but its absolutely untrue. She attacked Ron with birds in HBP, because he had a girlfriend. She constantly thought she was better than other people. She always thought she was right. She never apologized about the Firebolt thing, or the Scabbers thing; I don't think I can remember her apologizing even once in the whole series! She's rude and even when she permanently scars Marietta does she not think she did anything wrong. She's a holier than thou person with violent capabilities that she has not been afraid of using, and she never apologizes. Also she's not as good at emotions as she thinks she is (emotional range of a teaspoon). I can't stand Hermione.

She's also more emotional than most fics paint her as. She's very much a "I can dish it out but can't take it" kind of person. "Cats eat rats" but the second Scabbers is supposedly eaten by the cat that's been chasing him for five-six months it becomes "He didn't do it!" 😕 Which is it ffs?

******** Now you're comparing Marietta to Umbridge. She was a scared kid who didn't know what to do. She was wrong. She was a traitor. She was especially wrong to all of us readers because of what we knew. We saw everything through Harry's eyes, so we knew what he knew and we knew Voldy was back. Marietta was skeptical and very very afraid of Umbridge. Fear can kill someone, it's true, but I do not think FACIAL scarring was the solution. Hand scarring and what Umbridge did to Harry was entirely unacceptable and I want to beat her sorry ass for it, but the fact that Hermione scarred Marietta's FACE, when she was /sixteen/, is so foreign and cruel to me, especially since Hermione knows the pain of being made fun of for looks. Beauty is socially seen in the face, and people stare if faces parent what they "should be". Marietta was young and made a mistake, a terrible mistake, and she deserved a punishment, maybe a permanent one but for sure not on her face.

** Hermione throughout most of the series is not a character but a plot device,kind of like Ron in GoF. In my view, she knows exactly as much as she is allowed to know for the sake of plot, and acts as she is allowed to act, as is the case in OotP, where she killed a teacher, but we can't have Hermione just stone cold murder someone so Umbridge somehow lives.

Oh look at her she is so smart she outsmarted Umbridge and now she KNOWS something is up and it's probably a trap but dropping Neville in their first year for something you believe in is just so much easier then dropping Harry in year five so bye go her convictions.

So here we are where, you as a reader get to experience how smart Hermione is but she will let bad things happen anyway, because the smartest witch of her age forgot to go to Snape, the last known order member on Hogwarts grounds. Even after dropping Umbridge at the mercy of centaurs, and even having their friends neutralize the inquisitorial squad. She also won't contact anyone else by floo like I dunno, Mr Weasly, the aurors, no it is now time to bow to capslock Harry and swallow all that common sense she supposedly have, but we still get to experience how smart she is because she just won't shut up about traps, bad ideas and so on, thus completely ruining the sense of adventure we got in the Harry Potter series thus far.

I also hated Hermione's approach in the second time loop of the PoA finale, as well as the utter bewildering sleep deprivation she subjected herself to because of reasons too smart for someone like me.

Top kek no it isn't. As with every important character in the series, Hermione has a shitload of detractors. Here in this sub, specifically, she's easily the most hated third of the golden trio (or at least the most vocally hated, what with Ron "defenders" being as aggressively hostile as canon shippers on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]).

** I like the idea of Hermione, but as it's been pointed out she has serious flaws, but so do the rest of the trio. Ron is blunt and doesn't always think before he speaks, Hermione is rigid and refuses to see others points of view, and Harry is..... Well kind of a pushover, he lets the other two pretty much dictate what he does and when he was in charge (DH) it was a disaster. All of the characters have flaws but I honestly don't know if they have enough redeeming qualities to make up for their flaws. I still love the story, the characters however are a different matter entirely.

*** Personally, I feel that if Hermione or Ron was in charge during the Horcrux hunt, they would have done much worse and probably would have failed. While I agree that Harry can be a pushover at times, he was the best possible option to lead in DH, and did better than the other 2 could have done.

** I love her, but you're totally entitled to your view too. She definitely is those things, but for me none of them are negative. I particularly like how JKR - perhaps unintentionally - made her lead female character, in a series where the characters are meant to be role models for kids, calculating, vicious, and somewhat sadistic! Talk about revealing aspects of yourself through your characters!

***** Did I say that it was ok? I merely pointed out that it was not enough for legal consequences.

To be honest, if Ron and Hermione never spoke a word after that incident, I'd consider it a good outcome since at least it would spare us one shoehorned romance from HBP/DH (I like the idea behind Harry/Ginny, but the execution was bad to say the least).

** Me neither. I despise that Rowling has to make her always right about everything even when she's wrong. Hermnone's pet trying to eat Ron's and her brushing it off like it doesn't matter? Well Ron's pet ended up being a death ester so Hermione's right in the end. Tattled to McGonagall before voicing any of her cencern to Harry/Ron? Sirius /was/ in fact the one to send the Firebolt so Hermione was right once again in the end.
