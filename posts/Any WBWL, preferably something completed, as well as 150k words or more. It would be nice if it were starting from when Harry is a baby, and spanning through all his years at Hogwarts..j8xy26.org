  When, after that fateful Halloween night, the wrong Potter twin is hailed the Boy Who Lived, how will Harry's life turn out? With a power he knows not, an ancient prophecy and one Severus Snape practically raising him, interesting at least is a given.

** It's not complete, but it's 350k or something and updates every week. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the ashes of chaos) And then obviously, there is linkffn(Harry Potter and the prince of slytherin) which is probably the best one out there in my option (I know that is controversial, don't flame me please, just an opinion). Granted, I think I'm going to like Ashes of Chaos better than PoS when there is more written.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived) is also outstanding, but it's abandoned and has been for years. Still worth a read though.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
