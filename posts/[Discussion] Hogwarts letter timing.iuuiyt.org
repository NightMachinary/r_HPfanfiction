Was it coincidence that Harry got his letter on his birthday? It would seem off if people got their letters on their birthdays, specially for people whose birthday is on Aug 31... No time for shopping.

I get the feeling that something late June or early July would make more sense. Something like a week or two after the end of previous term. Also, I think I remember the 1995 letters arriving like late August which doesn't make sense.


** They'd been trying to send Harry his letter for a while before he actually got it on his birthday. Pure coincidence in that manner.

What isn't a coincidence is in the letter itself:

#+begin_quote
  Dear Mr. Potter,

  We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.

  Term begins on September 1. *We await your owl by no later than July 31.*

  Yours sincerely,

  Minerva McGonagall,

  Deputy Headmistress

Harry's birthday happens to be the last day of school registration. They finally sent Hagrid instead of another wave of letters because this was literally the last day. First thing Hagrid does after giving Harry his letter, is to reach into his coat to pull out his own owl to accept the enrollment.

*** Actually the whole letter thing is a little bit strange. Because if July 31 is the last available date for registration Ginny shouldn't be able to attend Hogwarts the following year for her birthday is on August 11. And they arrive to different times every year: the letters arrive in the middle of August in year two because Harrys birthday had already passend and he was at the Weasleys. In year three the letter came exactly at his birthday. In year four we don't know, but in year five it only arrives a week before the term starts. In year six it's again in the middle of August.

**** i'm not sure I follow. To Hogwarts people go whose birthday is before September 1st. And those that, as such (and in general, if there were other requirements and not everyone could go), are eligible, have to reply by July 31st. There's no relation between the two dates?

As for the rest, either the July deadline is only a rule for new first years, or that is only the rule for 1991. Ultimately, it's just an administrative point; it's not as if there is a deeper significance.

.

Regarding the OP, the answer at the top of the thread is perfect and I agree entirely.

I totally agree with that. I just missunderstood the term "last day school registration" - I thought it meant the day were you have to be eleven - and in case of Ginny that would made the whole thing a plothole. Sorry - English is not my first language.

****** No need to apologise. Misunderstandings are always possible, that's why I asked :)

**** July 31st is only the enrollment acceptance date. The letters are sendt out during the summer no matter your birthday as long as it's before September 1st. It was just a coincidence Harry's birthday is the same date as enrollment acceptance.

** Harry gets his first letter at least a week before his birthday (July 31) and he keeps getting them until then, when Hagrid shows up.

I like the idea that the letters arrive on the summer solstice (some time around June 21) although this doesn't really fit with canon unless you really stretch how long Harry was getting his letters. Other than that, the first of July gives students two months to prepare, which should be plenty of time.

** In addition to what has been already said, you can probably even make a case that all letters don't go out at once (which makes sense, if the school doesn't have a few hundred owls):

In CoS, the letters for Harry and the Weasley arrive at the Burrow on the same day Ron gets a letter from Hermione -- in which she says that she will buy her books that day. The wording in the letter is such that it wasn't written on that very day, and also implies that she already has her book list, which means her school letter must have arrived before the Weasley's and Harry's.

.

As for OotP: Recall they had trouble finding a Defence teacher, and Umbridge got it eventually. They couldn't have sent out the letters if they didn't know the teacher and his curriculum incl. booklist, which sounds like a reasonable explanation for why they came quite late.

** I suspect that it was simply a coincidence for Harry. After all, letters had been delivered to his house on a number of occasions before Harry's birthday, he just wasn't able to read them because of the Dursleys.
