This is right up there with "Don't like Don't read" with the worst things to ever put inside of a description, your just trying to get people to click on your story and if you had a halfway decent description instead of MORE INFO INSIDE you'd actually get people to click goddammit.


** u/UndeadBBQ:
#+begin_quote
  Harry and Ron fuck each other, more info inside.

  #+begin_quote
    more info inside

    #+begin_quote
      inside
    #+end_quote
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

Honestly, I thought that particular one was kind of funny. But I'm a simple man with +simple+ stupid humor.

** When a summary says More Info Inside, it's fucking infuriating. It's like, if you can't be bothered to put effort into the summary of a story, why should I believe that you put effort into the actual story.

** I don't know about "more info inside", but I feel the first part is informative and straight to the point, certainly more so than an "artsy" summary would be. It helps people who are looking for this kind of thing find it, and people who are not to avoid it.

** Eh. I'd click it. Better than the shitty clickbait that most writers these days use.
