So while reviewing the plan of the final chapters of my current ongoing fic with a friend of mine we got onto the topic of epilogues, mostly because I decided to remove the epilogue tag from the plan of the final chapter, and just number it a chapter. We argued for a few minutes about the pedantic nature of this before I decided that I was right and that I'd be instead writing the final chapter of LdS as 'Chapter XX' rather than 'Epilogue'

Mostly this entire conversation with my friend made me curious as to what people expect from an Epilogue. To me, and this is probably evident by the epilogues I've written, the epilogue is only loosely related to the story that came before it. My epilogues are mostly pure fluff because I'd rather just write fluff. And by the epilogue I'm pretty much done with telling the 'story' as it were so I see it mostly as a chance to just write random fun things. My epilogue to Vitam Paramus was probably my favorite chapter of fanfiction I've ever written. And it's literally just fluff.

My friend finds my epilogues dumb because they don't really contribute to the 'plot or 'themes' or the stories. Which is probably a valid thing. But mostly I just wanted to ask what would people prefer to see in an epilogue? Is it a better as a continuation of the work before, a fluffy happily ever after, a tease of something to come?


** In my mind the best kind of epilogues sit (annoyingly) on the fence between those three - a combination of all, that wraps up the essential messages and themes of the story, that provides closure for the plot and the end of the main character arc, and yet leaving it in such a way that the reader can imagine new adventures following on from it with relative ease - but not thirsty for more, so nothing like a cliffhanger or something like that.

I've seen so many authors abuse the "All was well" line from the end of DH, which, whilst having its own little charm, is such a ham-fisted way of forcing closure on the plot of the story, when instead I think they could choose something which is more personal to their work, and more meaningful because of it.

That said, fluffy endings are often nice to read. I like getting that warm fuzzy feeling reading something that's just /nice./

*** In general I dislike epilogues. I don't want to hear what happened after the last chapter. It always makes me depressed, even when they're all "good" things. Typically epilogues go like so:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley-Potter grew up happily ever after and married and had a family big enough to make a Quidditch team! Albus Severus James Hagrid Xerxes Potter was the oldest, taking after his dad in looks except for his Ginny-colored (brown?) eyes. Rose Hermione Tonks Nymphadora Tondelaya Della Ventimiglia Rosette Potter-Weasley was the youngest, a cute blonde girl with the temper of her mother and emerald-forest-nymph-green eyes of his father.

  Ron and Hermione's kids [....] eventually grew up to marry all of Ginny's and Harry's [ignore the wincest!] or at least were BFF's forever in Hogwarts, and became prefects and head boys/girls and then Harry Potter was their DADA teacher btw and Ginny was either an Auror, or more likely a Healer, but possibly a player for the Hollyhead Harpies.
#+end_quote

Anyway, I did read /one/ fic where I thought the epilogue was fitting. I honestly don't remember which fic (it was H/G though), but the epilogue was basically like this--I will of course butcher it which is sad but it really is written well:

It's a short scene from like a hundred years later (I usually /hate/ epilogues like this) where Ginny is lying down sick, about to die, on the bed in their house, and Harry is right next to her holding her hand, and Harry is of course sad but also very accepting and incredibly happy with the life they've been able to live. The whole family is there too. He sends all of their family out (children, grandchildren, etc) and says he wants a moment alone to say goodbye to his wife. Then he enacts some magic (I would say suicide but it sounds so harsh) to peacefully join his wife in her death. In the meantime, as soon as the family is sent outside and mentions (that Harry just sent them out to say goodbye to Ginny) to someone, maybe it's Remus, he immediately understands what Harry was really doing.

Anyway, by and large I dislike epilogues. One has stuck out to me as good. Typically they're lame.

**** I'm 90% sure that epilogue is from one of kb0's fics. Maybe Harry Potter: Rogue?

** Nothing. I'd prefer the last chapter be a potential lead in to a sequel.

Epilogues are summations to me, usually a fluffy ending of the things hinted at in the story.

**** Something I've noticed is that JK Rowling writes extremely well-written, complex characters, yet she has a hard time connecting with them. Like, I'll read a certain passage and think, "Ron wouldn't do that." This is especially true for the epilogue and Cursed Child.

***** Can't agree with this more. There are certain characters who are characterized very distinctly and then all that gets thrown out the second Rowling needed to for plot purposes. (ie, Ginny accepting Harry's break-up so easily).

***** Of course JK didn't write Cursed Child though, she just signed off on it, and I wish she hadn't even done that much because now we are stuck with it being shoe-horned into canon and to hell with the ret-cons.

** I'll be the contrarian here, since I really like Epilogues.

Your story (without the epilogue) should tie up almost all of the loose ends. The A and B plots should be resolved. If there was no epilogue, no one would walk away thinking the conflict was unresolved.

The epilogue then is a scene from much later, showing the main characters back to normal life (like the 10th stage of a hero). You should use the epilogue to address questions not related to the main storyline.

Two good stories that do this well are Mistborn and Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood).

In Mistborn the main story ends right after the main conflict has just finished. You know that everything's going to be ok, and that the big bad has been defeated. The Epilogue follows a secondary character after the end of the story, and explains what the secondary characters do after the end. It leaves the reader with imagination, but not unfulfilled wants.

In FMA Brotherhood, the main storyline has ended and the villain defeated. The epilogue details the characters returning to normal life. The main characters decide what they want to do next, and we see flashes of their lives over the next 5 years.

If I had to redesign a new epilogue for the Harry Potter series (and not the original epilogue), I'd make it a series of documents (letters, Daily Prophet Articles, and auror reports, etc). I'd include mentions of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Draco, Hogwarts, the Ministry, Ginny, and Diagon Alley.

Maybe end with an article on Harry's wedding, or Lily being born.

*** Just want to say that your epilogue sounds like a nice thing to read. Nothings tied to absolute stone and everyone gets some feel goods. If there's something in it someone doesn't like, it's the prophet and is known to lie.

** If you wrap up the end of a series properly and spend enough time developing your characters you typically won't need an epilogue. Tie up the threads, have the main character walk off into the sunset holding hands with his love interest and the readers can fill in the blanks.

** For myself, a great story usually opens with a strong and memorable opening image - the hook - before it proceeds through a "beat" (key plot phase) called "set-up" where you see the world as it is now, the status quo before the events of the story unfold and change it (even if it is only changed for the characters).

So, with that in mind, an epilogue is not at all about tying up all the loose threads or showing us what happened to every character in the HEA it's purpose is to show us the world now, at the end of the tale, to reinforce how it has been changed by the story's events. The new normal. If possible it should also end on a strong image to linger in the minds of readers.

** Epilogues are basically a place for anything you want to add to your story without it being part of the story. And then pretty much anything goes. If you want it to be a warm and fluffy "See how well they did after everything got resolved", that's fine. If you want to set up a sequel, that's fine too.

The one thing I think would be wrong in an epilogue is to do anything that affects the plot of the main story. That would mean that you hadn't actually finished it yet so it's not time for an epilogue.

** An Epilogue to a story is like a full stop to a sentence. Sure the story could just as easily do without one, but an epilogue showing a peek of the future to come and detailing the aftermath of the story's events adds an element of conclusion to it.
