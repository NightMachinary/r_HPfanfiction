I'm really hoping there are some similar fics out there with the premise of Harry going back in time to ancient civilizations integrating within them.

linkffn(The Wizard from Earth)


** I've never read The Wizard from Earth, so I don't know exactly, but A Long Journey Home featured ancient civilization where Harry (Jasmine here) is intergrating in.

** I recommend watching the movie that inspired this fic, even if it has nothing to do with Harry Potter.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

** You got the two correct answers, and it'd really surprise me if you get a third fitting answer.

A Long Journey Home is the better story of those two, and I recommend it, even if you neither like fem!Harry nor the fact that it's unfinished.

Basilisk-Born is... okay, I guess. It has major flaws, but also lots of really cool stuff. The biggest flaw in my mind is that it never fully explores a setting, and feels too much centered on Harry. Don't get me wrong, being centered on Harry is cool - but it comes at the expense of the world.

*** There is a third called Voldemort's Last Spell. I don't think it is as good as the other two, but I liked it. linkfnn(2651376)
