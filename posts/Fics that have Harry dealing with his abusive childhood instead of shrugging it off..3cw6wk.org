Doesn't have to be explicit, or ramp up from cannon. I'm just looking for a fic that deals with the ramifications more than Harry going stiff when he gets hugged.


** Linkffn(The Cupboard Under the Stairs by Stargon1) - This is the first of a currently 4-part series, already at 300k words. The series is AMAZING, and particularly the first book is exactly what you're looking for: How Harry deals with his home life when thrust into the magical world.

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.
