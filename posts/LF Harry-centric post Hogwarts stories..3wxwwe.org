linkffn(Grow Young with me)

Read this last night and loved it. Romance is fine, not required. Not picky on pairings but I don't care much for slash, or bashing.

Thanks.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** linkffn(After the End by Sugar Quill)

It's canon pairings. Also, it isn't canon-compliant because the writers started it sometime when the series was still being written. It's still a really good After Hogwarts story though.

  Nearly eleven years have passed since Harry defeated Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts. Life for the youngest Head Auror ever appointed is busy and chaotic, but it's good. Not everyone in the wizarding world, however, is so content and there are stirrings of unrest. A new adventure starts with the theft of a mysterious artefact from the Ministry of Magic . . .
