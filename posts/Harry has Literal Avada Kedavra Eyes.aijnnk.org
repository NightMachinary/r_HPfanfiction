It's a commonly used adjective for Harry's Green eyes. So many connotations of "Eyes like a Killing Curse" "Avada Kedavra eyes" etc. What I want to see is Harry having literal Avada Kedavra eyes due to a leftover result of surviving Voldemort's Avada Kedavra.

Basically like Cyclops Optic Blasts, but firing the Killing Curse from his eyes instead. Harry having actually perfect vision, but wearing charmed glasses his entire life to stop his eyes from killing people.

Voldemort, or one of the Death Eaters removes his glasses during the Graveyard battle, and Death Eaters start dropping quickly to Harry's Killer Looks. (Killer Looks would be a great name for the fic)


** I find myself contemplating the possibility that his killing gaze is revealed in his third year or so, and people think it has something to do with surviving the bite/gaze of the basilisk.

** linkffn(Fate's Gamble)

by Lupine Horror, is not exactly the idea, but it's delightfully better: Harry Potter is rescued from the Dursleys by...Zelretch! Specifically, Z "throws out" his Kaleidoscope power, and Harry catches it. He winds up on Gorgon Island, and long story element short, gets blood adopted by Z, Waver and Medusa's other sisters (they're divine immortals, so can survive their sister eating them). He winds up sporting a similar blindfold to Medusa's, for the same reasons. I highly recommend it, if only for the massive amounts of trolling done by...well, everyone, really.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
