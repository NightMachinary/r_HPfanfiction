I was wondering if any one had a copy of Ashwinder's 'The Way Forward?' Is was an outtake from Tosca1390's Salvation. It appears to have been posted in CHeckmated, but I can't seem to find it anymore. Here's the link to Tosca1390's story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1736279/1/Salvation]]

Thanks


** [[http://www.checkmated.com/authors.php?name=Tosca&cat=stories][Here's Tosca's Checkmated page]], but you need an account to read /The Way Forward/. (If you don't already have one and decide to make one and happen to be under 17, lie about your age because they have mods granting access to NC-17 fics)

Alternately, it's on [[http://ash-fics.livejournal.com/30486.html][Livejournal]] (near bottom of the list) but again you'll need an LJ account and to join the ash-fics community, which also has moderated membership dependent on age.

*** Thank you for the reply. I had been able to find the Checkmated page, but never got the Bedchamber access. I was hoping some one had saved it somewhere or knew if it had been uploaded somewhere else?
