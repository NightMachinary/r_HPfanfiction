Really liked Sarcasm and Slytherin but it hasn't been updated in a while so I'm fearing that it's abandoned (like most of my favorites).

Please recommend complete fics but if there are ones that are still updating then I wouldn't say no.

** Ashes of Chaos and Prince of Slytherin are the two WBWL snarky Slytherin fics that are really popular right now. They're both currently updating.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** Rarely mentioned but linkao3(Certain Dark Things) is a Fem!Slytherin Harry fic with Neville as WBWL. Updating and in year 3. Nice prose with multiple perspectives and a Sirius' Daughter OC in Slytherin.

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

** The only complete WBWL fic in the fandom that I know of is linkffn(Saving Connor) and sequels of the Sacrifices Arc series. All seven years complete at 3 million words.

*** It's not very slytherin tho, one should say.

Harry is in the house, but he's basically a schmuck.

**** Effects of Lily's brainwashing I suppose. It slowly gets better but most readers drop it out of frustration at some point. Unless you pace yourself you will find yourself hating certain characters beyond what is healthy. Not everyone's cup of tea. It is however the longest fic in the fandom and that deserves some respect.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
