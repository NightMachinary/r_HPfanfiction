Hi, I'm Penwyn and I've been writing in the Drarry fandom since the book series started, pretty much. I've done it under a number of names that aren't important.

What is important is that I am in need of another pair of eyes for the HD Book Faire fest on Livejournal that's going on right now. I'm writing 5-10k words a day on this, and it's due August 1. I need a beta who is happy to read every day and give me characterization feedback, since I don't believe in the whole "They just started talking, they're so in love~" trope.

What to expect from this fic: A whole lot of Harry/Ginny in the beginning, Aurors, some gore and possibly a m/f rape scene later. Not to mention H/D smut as things get that far.

I'm expecting this fic to run between 40-70k words. It isn't chaptered, but a long one-shot. If I had to give it a genre, I'd put it in mystery/crime drama.

My beta needs to keep mum about which fic I write, since the reveal isn't until November 1. I'm using Microsoft Word for my word processor, and it'd be helpful if you had it, too, so you can use comments when betaing instead of erasing what I've done.

Thanks! Just shoot me a PM if you're interested.

*** As many eyes as possible are needed! If you'll shoot me your email in a PM, I'll send you what I have at the end of the night.

** Hi! I'm definitely happy to beta/edit for this, though I think I would have to take a look at the fic or chat with you about the plot before I agree, due to the gore/rape/sex bits which I've never written myself. I also don't have a livejournal, so hopefully most of it could be done through email.

Thanks! Reply if you're interested.
