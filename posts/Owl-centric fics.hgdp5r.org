My father, who's in the middle of reading CoS, and I were goofing around when he mentioned owls (owls are a family joke, long story ðŸ˜…) and how he'd like to see a fic about them, how they interact and all that. So here goes. Give me your best.


** Here goes a winning pitch:

Harry has died in the Triwizard Tournament, eaten by a mad dragon. Now, 5 years later and with the world under the firm grasp of Voldemort, Hedwig has to go on with her boring job delivering Amazon Packages. When on a hectic Prime Day, the Death Eaters attack the delivery center, effectively canceling Two-Day Shipping... Hedwig has to run for her life. What she doesn't expect is being caught by an ancient mystery curse that turns her into an Aniowl and lets her fix everything that was broken. Can she learn English in time to save the magical world? AU. Time Travel. Smut. Hedwig/Pigwidgeon. Hedwig/Crookshanks. Hedwig/Neville.

â€‹

This is a pitch which I have no plans on writing at the moment. Feel free to steal it.

*** Changed my mind. I already started writing this. Don't steal it. If you already started, I won't blame you though.

** I like the idea of Crookshanks and Pigwigeon secretly being the brains behind every key moment in the last couple of books

#+begin_quote
  Harry uses Hedwig to test the restrictions on the Goblet of Fire. Obviously, they're not good enough to stop the smartest owl in Britain!

  Some letters are mundane: generic form letters which arrive with monotonous regularity. Other letters are life changing.
