Regarding events that take place after the battle of Hogwarts, can we accept certain plots and events as likely canon even if Rowling never specifically said they occurred?

For example, in virtually every story that takes place in the immediate aftermath of the battle, Harry suffers tremendous guilt for all those who were lost and feels the need to apologize to everyone who lost someone. In my opinion, this is likely canon. In canon, Harry has felt guilty when others have died. So its logical to believe he would have dealt with similar issues after the war.

Thoughts?


** This is one of my least favorite things after post war fics. I don't think its really true either. Cedric wouldn't have died if it weren't for Harry, Sirius too. This can't really be said for everyone else.

He'd probably have survivors guilt, he'd certainly feel awful, but it wouldn't be the angsty mess of nearly every after DH fic.

*** I think if he blamed himself for Cedric and Sirius, which were not his fault, he'd probably blame himself for everyone else who died.

I'm ok with him being an angsty mess if either 1) he moves on from that early enough in the story or 2) it causes him to do something drastic that creates a compelling story like moving away for a couple of years and then coming back. I always like those stories.

They were a lot /more/ his fault than anyone else who dies in the series, though. When Cedric died, it was because Harry made an innocuous-seeming decision that got him killed. It wasn't really his fault, but direct guilt makes perfect sense. Sirius, outright, would not have died if Harry hadn't gone off half-cocked after falling for a trap. Both are deaths that he, though not intentionally, had a fairly direct hand in.

Feeling guilty for everyone else, beyond, say, Moody is just having more of a messiah complex than he ever does in the books. He doesn't hold himself personally responsible for people killed during Voldemort's campaign of assassinations in HPB.

While I agree with your main thought, there is a diference to these things. Remember that the people that died during the battle of Hogwarts were told they could live if Harry were to give up. Of course, nothing tells us if he would actually fulfill this promise, but still.

** I think you're missing something: that Harry often feels guilt, yes, but that it rarely affects his life much. For example, he felt bad for Sirius' death, but unlike so much fanfic, in canon Harry didn't sit around moping, crying, beating himself up about it. He just got on with his life.

So will Harry feel some survivor's guilt after DH? Likely. Will it stop him from celebrating Voldemort's death and being proactive in the clean-up of the Ministry? Extremely unlikely.

** I don't accept Harry apologizing to everyone like he does in fics. That drives me crazy. He'd feel guilty for not doing enough and confide that to Ron/Hermione/Ginny at most, but I don't think he'd go around apologizing to everyone. How often does he do that in canon? We never see him apologize to the Diggory's for Cedric death. The closest he comes to expressing his regret is when he tries to give them the Triwizard winnings. He doesn't want to talk about Sirius' death the end of OoTP. I don't even remember him apologizing for Mr. Weasley getting attacked even when he was so sure he did it while possessed. It's not in character for him.

I don't think there's anything that 'likely canon.' That's just headcanon that fits more to the spirit of canon. However, it's still unconfirmed and there can be a different sequence of events in everyone's head, and that is what makes it headcanon.

** Eh, not really. You can say your headcanon is likely, but you don't really get to give it a diferent designation just because of it. It's still headcanon.

** It is unlikely Harry would blame himself for the deaths of anyone he was not in direct contact with.

He didn't even blame himself for Dobby or Hedwig dying. I very much doubt he will blame himself for the death of Lavender or Colin.

What you are thinking of is Fanon. Because in Canon, Harry did not spend much time crying, whining, etc.

It's only in fanfiction written by teenage girls that Harry is a whinefest.

In Canon, after Sirius died, it didn't long for Harry to get over it.

** I agree with other commenters that too many fanfics made him a mopping mess after the Battle. Harry was a mentally very strong person (immune to Imperius at age 14), and he would honor the fallen with effective actions after the war. The worst that could happen was squandering that one golden opportunity to remake the British Wizarding Society to their ideals.

Harry was also not someone resting on his guilt. He didn't even apologize to Hermione for getting the Taboo triggered.

** It'd be a suitable consequence of expunging the taint of Voldemort and seeing what awaits the dead if Harry then came back and was completely fine with everything. Without a piece of Voldemort subconsciously dredging up his guilt, he could be a perfect model for functional coping abilities.
