I've just noticed that in fics when people decide to refute pureblood supremacists' dogma their main/only evidence is that Hermione does better than Draco in tests. I feel like it would be really interesting to have a character, most likely Hermione, actually do some kind of study, maybe compare test results over a number of years.

Obviously racism and eugenics are awful no matter the results but it would be interesting to see characters actually debate it seriously. Muggleborns bring fresh perspective and enthusiasm while purebloods have generations of accumulated knowledge and resources.


** Not exactly what you are asking for, but in Apple Tree by Philo Draco discovers that he is a healer and can feel and manipulate other people's magic.

It causes a change of heart for him, instead of following in daddy's footsteps he found something that he loves doing and is simply his. At first his father is opposed to the idea of his son becoming a healer, but then Draco gets marching orders from his father and the Death Eaters to figure out the difference in the magic between muggleborns and purebloods. He finds out that there isn't one, something the healers have been telling the pureblood supremacists for centuries. It is just that the supremacists insists that there must be a difference and that the healers are lying.

It is a very small subplot of the story.

*** Thanks for the recommendation. I've been meaning to try to find some healer fics so that kills two birds with one stone.

What? No, racism and eugenics are awful because the results show they are awful. It sounds like semantics, but it really is an important distinction. Racism is bad because it's just objectively inefficient and needlessly cruel, not hiring a worker to do a job because he's bad at the job is a perfectly legitimate and moral reason vs not hiring a worker to do a job because he's black is a racist and bad reason.

** there's the Trinkets series, which completely decimates in-universe prejudice by having a way to actually measure an individual's magic and proving that it's not related to genetics.

** I recently read a fanfic that dealt with that topic, in the fic Hermione investigates about magical genetics and discovers that everyone has magical genes, the difference is in how many of those genes are expressed ..... it is a very good fic called Silver trinkets by Aya Ravensong

  This story came from the thought that the Weasley introduction was a setup. This is NOT a time-travel story. The premise is that the Dursleys got him there very early and Hermione, being the perfectionist that she is, also arrived very early. Thus they meet and the glory of H/Hr begins. AU For now not a T rating, will probably change in later chapters.
