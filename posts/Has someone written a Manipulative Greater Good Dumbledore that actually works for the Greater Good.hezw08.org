Like, so many of these supposedly 'greater good' focused Dumbledores, good or villainous, really just sorta work for the Greater Good of him or his. Has anyone written a Dumbledore that actually takes a 'needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few approach' and actually acts in a Utilitarian fashion?

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** The line between being manipulative and necessities of the war is really fine. Do you remember Churchill in the film Darkest Hour (2019), when he sacrificed the garrison of the fortress of Calais in order that the evacuation from Dunkirk may proceed? Was it badly manipulative or was it just necessary sacrifice of few soldiers to save many (and perhaps whole war)?

*** Sure, but that's not what I'm questioning - the dispute I'm asking about would be if Churchill sacrificed that Garrison so he could save his art collection from a museum nearby vs Churchill sacrificing that Garrison so the evacuation could work out. The first is the 'Greater Good of Albus Dumbledore' that so many people write, the latter is the 'Utilitarian Dumbledore' that I'm looking for. :)

Personally, I don't really mind what interpretation of a character exists, so whether Dumbledore is seen as manipulative and machiavellian or well-meaning doesn't really matter to me - I have no particular skin in the game for any of it. I just want it to make sense with the story that person is trying to tell. Verisimilitude and all that. :)

And some other people apparently do. Each to their own, and all that. People gonna people.

I think I'm garbling something somewhere, judging by your emphasis on that Dumbledore being evil (and thank you for the link, btw).

I'm not looking for Evil Dumbledore, necessarily. Just a Manipulative Dumbledore that works for the betterment of society as a whole (ie. the Greater Good of Society), rather than to improve his own position or fare (ie. the Greater Good of Albus Dumbledore). A Dumbledore who'd sacrifice a garrison of soldiers to save more elsewhere, rather than a Dumbledore who'd sacrifice a garrison to fill his own pockets.

Too many manipulative Dumbledores make him a villain out to set himself up as the tyrant of the world, but I'm looking for a manipulative Dumbledore that's genuinely trying to save and improve British Magical Society. A Utilitarian, 'needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few' type.

****** I am not putting emphasis on the word “Evil” for the evilness sake. Just that I really dislike the term “manipulative” for all its ambiguities it contains (as our discussion proves) and all difficult problems it actually hides. Do we agree that self-sacrificing of Harry (even without the plotcruch with his blood bringing him back) would be the only moral solution in case there was no other way how to defeat Voldemort? (of course, it would be necessary to let him know about the horcrux in his head in advance and let him make the sacrifice, instead of manipulating him into it).

Also, I really personally dislike the Jeremy Bentham's philosophy, because I grew up in the Communist Czechoslovakia and the needs of many outweighing my own needs was pushed down my throat for too long. Why should I fucking care about the needs of others? (well, sometime I do, but it is more complicated than that; also about the Greater Good is the book “[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eugenics_and_other_Evils][Eugenics and other evils]]” by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton][Gilbert K. Chesterton]]).

Also, are you aware that canonically Dumbledore used the term “Greater Good” only once when he was fifteen and he regretted it ever since? Although, certainly many of his decisions in the war had to be based on the similar ideas, because they had to be.

******* Fair enough - I can see your point regarding 'manipulative'. Though I will say, I personally don't attach any particular moral value to the term manipulative myself. It just means exhibiting dishonest or unfair control over a person. If you give a dishonest, but well-meaning compliment to boost a friend's self-esteem, that's technically manipulative, but I'd say that being nice to your friend is a moral action. When I say 'manipulative Dumbledore', that just means a Dumbledore that exhibits control over the people and societal systems around him - whether that's to do good things or bad things is a secondary property.

And for the record, I don't actually hold to a Utilitarian Philosophy, Benthamite or otherwise. It's kinda hard to do that, when you're in such an individually-focused field as psychology. Plus, in this role, it's really common sense to look after yourself first - in the vein of the old 'put your own air mask on first, before you help others on the aeroplane' advice - as you really can't help others break water if you're drowning yourself.

Also, I studied Philosophy at A-Level and realised quickly that most formalised moral frameworks have some seriously glaring flaws, Utilitarianism included. Haven't been able to bring myself to accept any textbook morality since. :D

But yeah. I'm just looking for it because it makes for an interesting story that deviates from the Evil, Selfish Dumbledore norm of the Manipulative!Dumbledore cliche, not because I agree with the underlying philosophy behind my request or because I believe it to be Rowling's canon (intended, original, ret-conned, or otherwise). I imagine it'd be a lot harder to read those stories if I'd lived through that darker side of that philosophy like you have though and I apologise if I've given the indication I condone actions or philosophies like that of the KSC. Privilege of the Ivory Tower, I'm afraid. :)

******** Yes, for me “manipulative” is something deeply negative, but I understand your point of view.

And I am a practising Christian and from the study of our history, it is kind of obvious to me that whenever we want to formalise ethics much more precisely than Two Commands of Love very bad things happen (and sorry our Jewish cousins, it hasn't really worked for you either).

Concerning better understanding of Dumbledore, I really like him in linkffn(12155794) ... Harry in the story is horrible super!Harry (and the Haphne Syndrom of dropping all his old friends, because they are suddenly not good enough for him), but there are many things on the fringes of the story which are really good (portrayal of the Grindelwald's War is other one, and was this the story with improved rules of Quidditch?).

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

Pretty much. It's fascinating how an ethical system can work perfectly well as it's originally put into practice, but falter when it's codified in textbooks for others to draw from elsewhere. Though problematic or not, I gotta admit that Theological Ethics makes for some fascinating reading - and even more fascinating conversations with my Catholic relatives (I'm of Irish-Italian descent, so that's... pretty much all of them. :D). It's really cool to see how patterns develop and how ideas were transmitted from group to group back in the days when plagiarism was regarded as just another method of citation - and an honoured one at that. :)

Heh. Yeah, that is a baffling cliche, isn't it? Like, people who literally follow you into life or death situations probably aren't too bad to keep on at least polite terms with, even if certain aspects of their personality suddenly grate on you.

Thanks for the rec. I do find it interesting when otherwise flawed fics have such interesting smaller pieces integrated into them. A glint of gold in a pile of dirt is always fun to uncover - for me, anyway. :)
