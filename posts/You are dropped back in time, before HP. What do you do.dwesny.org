Hey guys. As the title says. You are dropped back in time and naturally you are going to write the Harry Potter books to salvage the romance, and plot holes. If you are not much of a writer, you are friends with JK and can help her decide where the books go.

What are you going to change? What is the first thing you are going to change? What are some things that MUST stay the same?

For me...

Do Not Touch

· Friendship between the trio it is imperfectly perfect.

· Harry's backstory (orphaned, crappy ass relatives)

· Themes of family and friendship

· This is controversial but I loved Deathly Hallows

Need to be reworked

· Quidditch (scoring system is actually horrible. Catching the snitch should be like 50 points and ends the match.

· Dumbledore doesn't prepare Harry for Voldemort nearly as well as he could

· The power he knows not

· Harry and Ginny (either needs to be replaced entirely. Or no romance at all. I prefer Harry x Hermione.)

· Book three ending (time turners scratched entirely)

· No epilogue

· Snape. He is supposed to redeem himself but in my eyes he hasn't even come close.

· Hogwarts Houses. All Slytherin are evil is crazy and hardly any Deatheaters from other houses!

· Half Blood Prince entirely

· Nobody believing Harry about anything at all when he has a track record of being correct.

· Horcruxes (I still like the idea, but they need some reworking and clarification on creation and requirements) I.E “only an item of significant power can become one” cause if Voldemort was smart he would've used a pound note or something insignificant. He is theatrical, but also not an idiot.

Some big things I would change

· Ron dies in Order of the Phoenix and not Sirius. I think this could have been done fantastically and signaled and end of the world Harry was currently living in. Part of his young childhood dying. He would go out a hero, THIS IS NOT A HATE KILLING! I just think it could have been done great.

· Harry needs some sort of powerful magic exclusive to him for him to feasibly defeat a dark lord who has decades of experience.

· Dumbledore needs to be a character with his own goals and motivation rather than to move the plot and explain things.

· Give us more reasons about why people side with DE rather than just blood.

· Magic system has no rules and changes as needed.

· Voldemort failing constantly isn't realistic

· Final battle is epic

​

Let me know what you would do!


** What year are we talking about- '96? Or the late '80s/ early '90s as general? First and foremost I would go to concerts of bands that have since split up or have had members die. Of the top of my head Queen, Dio and Motorhead among others. Secondly, I'd bet on Manchester United winning the Champions League in the '98- '99 season to win some money. (And invest in some companies I suppose.) Also watching Beckham in his prime would be pretty cool.

​

As far as Harry Potter goes I actually like most of it. First and foremost I would not allow David Yates to come within a mile of anything HP related. The rest is really not as important, this is the main point. But just for the fun of it:

- Quidditch- I actually like it. I would just change that school-level games are allowed to have substitutions and have a three-hour time limit.
- Dumbledore doesn't prepare Harry- For the sake of argument- how would you have him prepare Harry? Voldemort has tons more experience than Harry does. And uses dark magic. The only way I could see it Harry needs to fight dirty. And somehow I don't see Dumbledore teaching Harry cheapshots. Some shields maybe, but not groin kicks. And even then it could take years to train Harry in magical combat.
- The power he knows not- My take is there is no such thing as destiny and prophecies. The prophecy is only real because Voldemort believed in it- i.e. he can win just as easily.
- Harry and Ginny (either needs to be replaced entirely. Or no romance at all. I prefer Harry/ Hermione.)- Agreed, but only because Hermione has the most screen (or is it page?) time and is the best developed female character. Ginny kind of disappears in the background for books 3 and 4. And I claim that Harry can't tell the difference between love and lust in book 6. (Spoiler alert- it's just lust)
- Book three ending (time turners scratched entirely) - And you just killed Buckbeak and Sirius- gg.
- No epilogue- I definitely agree on this one. I am not a fan of epilogues as a whole. It's better to leave the reader to choose their own "happily ever after".
- Snape. He is supposed to redeem himself but in my eyes, he hasn't even come close- Have one of his memories in DH be of his first year as a teacher helping an abused Slytherin. He decides then and there to be a decent teacher. (He should still be a dick to Harry, but not all students.)

And I got bored and hungry. But the most important bit is- Do NOT let David Yates anywhere near Harry Potter material.

*** Great responses! As far as Dumbledore goes I know he couldn't have prepared him completely. Or even reasonably so he could defeat him. But I think anything would have helped him fight Voldemort or his minions. I meant reworking POA not just erasing the time turner and calling it good.

Some of the other things we disagree with. But that's alright! It's interesting to see everyone's different takes on it.

As far as the bands go I completely agree!!

I'm in class writing this answer. Otherwise I would go more in depth.

*** Agree with most, especially not letting David Yates touch HP, including but not limited to his evil influence on post-GoF books (I way prefer as a literary person not as a character) pre-OoP Snape, he is just evil and bitter. Even if there was planned redemption I would prefer him as a start, not the confused mess of HBP and whatever-is-happening in DH.

What does that add to the story? Like, sure, it might feel more 'realistic', but the HP universe is a fantastical and weird one at its core.

It would only serve lower the stakes, for example in the second year Qudditch match when Harry gets attacked. The Bludgers are chasing him? Oh well, let's just switch him out.

Absolutely nothing, I'm afraid. I just remembered reading somewhere about a Quidditch match that went on for several days and was curious about what would happen at a school? Say the game starts on Saturday morning and goes on and on- what happens when classes start on Monday? Also, most sports have substitutes and are not nearly as dangerous (or long) as quidditch. It seems silly not to have them. Especially if a game can last days- what do they do- eat and sleep while on the brooms? Overdose on coffee and potions?

** Ok, the movies are simple.

- Hit Alfonso Cuaron over the head with a copy of the books. And then let him direct all the films.

- Fire Steve Kloves.

As for the books... I honestly wouldn't change much, only smooth out a few character arcs. JKR's plotting, world-building and story-telling are all superb. She just needs an editor with a grasp of maths.

- Start Malfoy's 'redemption' earlier --- what we saw in DH was too little, too late. He should start to doubt after Lucius is captured in Book 5. By HBP he's basically early Prince Zuko. And in Book 7 he does /something/ substantive to help the trio and earn his redemption (preferably in defiance of his father).

  - Give the minor Slytherins /some/ characterisation, after book 4. Some Slytherins aren't dumb and ugly. (Theo, Blaise, Daphne, Tracey?) Show that Crabbe is a real bad apple.
  - (Snape's perfect as he is. I would leave his arc exactly the same.)

- Have Hermione ...be wrong. At any point after Book 1. The poor girl needs character growth.

- Have the wider war feature more prominently in HBP and DH. But only as a vehicle for setting/character development --- keep the plot focused on the school drama/horcruxes/hallows.

  - Have Dumbledore actually try to teach him things. Not duelling --- he'll never surpass Voldemort --- but secrets and tricks. Things that be useful and help him survive.
  - (I do agree with criticisms that, after the wider scope of OotP, HBP and DH were too focused on school/Horcrux hunting. But I don't think a heavy war-focus would have played to the series' strengths.)

- Scrap time-turners completely. (Even JKR admits this.) As an added bonus, Cursed Child would never exist. :)

- Pair Ron with Hermione again. But leave Harry unpaired at the end of book 7. (I don't have a problem with Harry/Ginny, but as presented in the books it feels rushed and contrived.)

Alternatively, when you spend so much energy on building up your at least second most important heroine in CoS just DON'T DROP HER in the following two books only to discover her in the middle of the fifth book!

** u/Ash_Lestrange:

  “only an item of significant power can become one”
#+end_quote

Huh?

Anyway...keep the same:

- most pre Hogwarts stuff
- Gryffindor Harry
- Quidditch
- most of HBP and DH major plot points.
- Dumbledore's preparation. Those "home movies" prepared him better than any dueling montage would have.

Change:

- Harry ends up with Fleur
- Harry learns of magic a least 6 months before his birthday. If McGonagall got hers for her birthday, that means everyone else got there's then, too. He was behind his peers from the start.
- keep Hagrid away from Harry. Ron didn't say much about Slytherin or keep Harry from learning "advanced" magic, but Hagrid did.
- charms prodigy Harry
- expand Harry's circle of friends earlier and have him date a little more. I dislike how so many characters are undeveloped simply to keep the trio intact.
- more aurors and Ministry involvement as whole.
- the Crouches and Amelia Bones would live a little longer.
- proper character ddevelopment and consistent characterization. The fandom largely ignores what was done to Harry, Dumbledore, and Sirius in OOTP
- Harry expresses his grievances to Dumbledore. Indy Harry writers have the right idea they just can't write it well.

I'd also do my best to keep Steve Kloves far away from everything. "Bombarda!" Ugh!

Edit: I mostly like the major plot points. I just hate the plot over character, idiot ball way it got there.

** In the books, I would absolutely change nothing. Rowling's got it figured out, and while there are some parts of the work that I'm minimally unsatisfied with, that's just art.

In the movies, I wish I could get them to move away from "wands as guns" and make magical combat feel more magical, the rest is pretty much fine as well.

I may seem overly content, but I actually enjoyed the material. Even for the movies, they made the decisions for a reason, to make the story fit the medium. So, yeah, not changing much.

** No, if I can time travel to my past without causing a paradox, I'm going to do the following:

- Remember some important lottery numbers before the time travel
- Invest the winning proceeds in stock like AOL, Cisco, Dell, Qualcomm, and Yahoo until year 2000.
- Use some of the money to support JKR during her difficult times and buy the exclusive right of the Harry Potter Series.
- When it comes to its Movie production, Steve Kloves would NEVER be hired, and any script that attempted to bash certain main characters would be immediately thrown out and its writer fired.
- I would go over every final script and cut personally, and make sure that all plot important scenes were included. There would be no Confetti Voldemort or Shoelace scene under my watch, and Hermione would never steal half of Ron's best lines. Draco would be that “my father will hear about this” arrogant, sniveling coward.
- I would try to steer JKR to move the last two Books into a different direction. Given that I helped out her tremendously during her most difficult times, I should have a reasonable influence here. If I had my way, Dumbledore would never become that criminally negligent dickhead in HBP, Harry would not be that passive dork, and DH would have very little Deus Ex Machina, author fiats, plot armors, and lucky hero trope. Oh yes, they would put many of those sadistic genocidal magical Nazis permanently out of business too. There would be more scenes after their victory, but no sudden time skip to 20 years later.
- The Cursed Child would have a totally different plot. Jack Thorne can have his play, but the plot will be mine! And whoever is the most qualified will play Hermione!

** Well well well.

Personally I would end OOTP with only Harry and Hermione surviving and them escaping.

The next book would take years later. There is a regime and a half blood would have his wife raped and murdered by DE.

He would be approached by an older more rebellious Harry. Kind of like Butcher from the Boys TV show.

There they both go on a journey to kill Voldemort. Harry helps him as he is Dudleys bastard son.

Hermione establishes a private militia and the current climate is that she owns half of Europe while Voldemort has the other, full scale war of Harry and OC don't stop it.

Harry's major power is that he can talk to dead people, not as Ghosts but through his mind and he can harness the power of the dead.

He talks to Ron regularly, Harry sacrifices himself in the end to save the world.....

EDIT: yes they do hunt for hocruxes like in DH, but they use more Guerrilla war tactics.

Or I would get rid of Voldemort in OOTP and last two years do something like Rouges Bet.

*** /Sigh./ Really? Anyone who directly challenges Voldemort loses in canon except Dumbledore because he's a skilled badass with a super wand and Harry because he's got the brother wand, mother's protection, and all that jazz.

Hermione would have been murdered had she been directly going against Voldemort. This doesn't even fit the genre.
