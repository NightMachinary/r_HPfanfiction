Note that it doesn't necessarily have to be your favorite fic, just the most well written. Subject matter can be anything.

For me, its Newcomb's What you Leave Behind.

** Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is amazingly written, and is extremely witty and funny.

Linkao3(A Marauder's Plan) has to be one of the most well-written (serious) fics I've read in terms of objective quality. The characters were well-written, with consistent characterization and good arcs, the plot itself is consistent and well-paced, and makes sense. The magic system is a bit out there but it works for the story and makes sense within the story and is consistent. The characters act rationally and actually have to plan and work together to solve problems instead of just being stronk or Mary-Suing the issues away. It's really solid, although it's also really long. It's 800k+ words and is only set during 4th Year. Though I think that's one of the reasons why it's so well-written, because it takes the time to actually put in the work for the details of the characters and plot, and gives plenty of time for characters to develop. If you shortened it down to the actual length of Goblet of Fire then it just wouldn't work, you'd miss out on a ton of detail and development.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...
