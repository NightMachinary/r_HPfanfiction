Grindlewald's time was a few decades before Voldemort's, so a lot of people would still remember him. Grindelwald led a global war for six years, nevermind what he got up to before that. How did Voldemort become so feared that people all over Europe knew Harry defeated him? What did Voldemort do outside of the UK?


** Nothing really. JKR needed to increase the threat, but Voldemort was pretty UK localized.

*** That's probably the real answer. HP is very UK-centric.

** Voldemort was a scary bogeyman, while Grindelwald was just a magical Hitler. In the first war, nobody knew who to trust (since the Death Eaters Imperiused a lot of people, and others could be secret Death Eaters), and anyone who said Voldemort's name turned up dead. British wizards lived in constant fear that they would be killed for saying one wrong word around friends or family, or that they would be Imperiused to be Voldemort's follower. The fact that Voldemort looked like a monster added to the fear.

Grindelwald, on the other hand, was more of a political threat. Fear of him didn't rule people's lives. They were free to say whatever they wanted, and to support who they wanted to support. There were several attacks on villages across Europe (and possibly America), sure, but they seemed to be random (since it was only meant to draw attention to him), and it was extremely unlikely to happen to anyone, unlike with Voldemort, who targeted anyone who bad-mouthed him. Grindelwald didn't try to rule people with fear like Voldemort did. He swayed them to his side with his charisma and silver tongue.

I think it's less about fearing Voldemort and more about Harry surviving the Killing Curse.

I don't know much about Grindelwald as I refuse to watch the 2nd movie and barely watched the 1st, but I think Voldemort did something unique: he coaxed dark and/or shunned creatures to his side.

** Grindelwalds war had a different purpose behind it and while he was a threat it wasn't as terrifying on a personal lvl whereas Voldemort was attempting to kill muggleborns and 'blood traitors' left, right and center and was willing to kill a baby so he was prob more immediately harmful to noncombatants than grindelwald was.

** My headcanon:

Grindelwald - a ruthless revolutionary that pretty much brought the whole of Europe (the magical side directly and the Muggle side through his Nazi proxies) under his command.

Voldemort - a cult leader that doesn't care about anything (including his own cause), has no grand plan or love for the Magical world, and doesnt even want to rule it directly. He just want's to become a sort of divine figure.

*** That's what I was thinking. Voldemort was a charismatic mass murderer who had infiltrated pretty much every industry in his world. Grindelwald was on the opposing side of a global war,

** Didn't he assassinate powerful wizards around Europe during the time people referred to him as 'You-know-who' because they didn't know his name? That would have scared a bunch of people once he made his reveal in the '70s.
