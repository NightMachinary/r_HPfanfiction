I know this is strange, but it's worth a try? Looking for a Brian Jacques-esque appreciation of food. Or fics that otherwise feature food/drink and the assorted shops. It seems to be like there's a huge area for the intersection of food and magic (think Honeydukes or WWW) but fanfiction doesn't seem to feature it.


** I haven't come across any HP fics like what you're asking for but in case you read Hunger Games fic linkffn(When the Moon Fell in Love With the Sun) fits perfectly.

  "It's something out of an old tale: a golden young man in a white bearskin, striking strange bargains with desperate souls on the cruelest night of winter." AU fic, based on the fairy tale "East of the Sun & West of the Moon." Peeta Mellark, winner of the 74th Hunger Games, returns from his Victory Tour to make the starving Everdeens an offer they can't refuse.

*** Ooh, it's an intersection of a Norwegian fairy tale and Hunger Games? Interesting! I'll have to read all three of them. Thanks for the rec!

**** You're welcome! It's a really great read and while it's still in progress the author has some other in-universe fics as well.

** You know, I'm in training to be a pastry chef at the moment, so my interest is piqued. I have an OC that would definitely fit for running a magical dessert shop.

Hello, new friend! More seriously, if you do write something along the lines, I'd love to read it

**** I'll take a crack at it, but I can't promise anything will come of it - most of the stuff I write, I get frustrated with very early on.

** [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=3090][Apple Pie and Other Amends by ToEatAPeach]] (DM/HG, Mature?) "Sometimes you're sad. Sometimes you need dessert. And sometimes, it's a little of both."

Maybe not exactly what you are looking for, but the first 2/3 or so focuses on the desserts and who they are for and why. The descriptions are quite lovely.

"Lee Jordan gets a platter of Turkish Delight, Ernie Macmillan a tray of fudge, and Cho Chang a rich custard with freshly macerated blueberries. Hermione presents Dennis Creevey (who is still wan and listless when he opens the door of his parents' house) with a warm, gooey banoffee pie that smells so rich, even in its container, the boy actually giggles. [...] Cormac McLaggen, however, gets a relatively bland mincemeat pie, and she pretends to "accidentally" dodge his thank-you hug."
