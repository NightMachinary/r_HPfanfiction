:END:
Someone very, very close to me was just taken to the hospital and I'm stuck far away, useless and unable to do anything. I need to occupy my mind with something else, please, or else I'll scream.

The endings can be bittersweet, but I /need/ the main characters to overcome their obstacles. A spot of happiness in the darkness.

Abused Harry raised by someone who isn't the fucking soul-crushing Dursleys; Harry beating the pulp out of Voldemort after enduring a horrible war; some random OC getting on with life after the surviving its starkest horrors; anything, I don't care what it is or who is in it as long as it goes from dark to light -- but no dealing with terminal illnesses, for the love of god, please.

Thank you in advance because I don't know if I'll be up for responding right now.

*Edit:* My Dad's stable right now, god knows if that'll stick, but thanks for the kind words and helping me not rattle around alone with just my thoughts.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Gently tracing the crease between his brows, the young witch wondered just how much she didn't know about the old wizard lying in the hospital bed before her. Slowly he opened his eyes and looked at her sadly for one last time. "Hermione," He whispered, "come back to me..." - A story involves an unusual form of time traveling and a timeless love.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  Complete. Starting with a letter found in his bedside table when he assumes the role of Headmaster in 1997, Severus Snape and Hermione Granger begin a strange correspondence. The new Headmaster is glad for the comfort of a confidant, but Hermione has just one problem: it's the end of 1998, and Professor Severus Snape has been dead for months. A story of time and second chances.

  "People change, you know, and then you find you have less in common with old friends and more in common with the strangest people." Percy had built a tall wall around himself - a stronghold - and the only way it was going to come down was by crashing into someone else's soaring fortress. Perhaps, a collision was exactly what they both needed. Percy/Audrey.

  "Perhaps a man who wants to redeem himself in the memory of the mother would, in turn, give comfort to a child." Dumbledore grinned at the other man's unbidden expression of shock. "But when said like that, it hardly encompasses the depth of emotion when I see you have cradled Harry Potter to sleep after a nightmare." Severus scowled. "I was not cradling him."

** Linkffn(accountable by Dyce) is a 8th year fic where Hermione is pregnant. There's a sort of melancholy feel about the fic and it turns out okay at the end. Draco-who is neither the father nor Hermione's pairing-is my favorite part of this fic.

The other one I have is called linkffn(what it comes down to by greycie) and it's. . .brutal. rather than their hours long stay in the basement of malfoy manor, harry is tortured and raped and brutalized for a week. This is about the - mostly sexual - healing after that. There's loads of very squicky lemons in there, especially in the beginning, and it later moves onto harry/Ron/Hermione as they recover. On a scale of 1-10 for maturity, this is my 10. But I love it.
