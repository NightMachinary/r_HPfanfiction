I have a story idea a-brewing...

Can anyone name either instances in canon of (adult) witches and wizards performing magic without wands, or examples of it done well in fics?

Cheers


** According to what I just read on the wiki,

Wands are considered a vaguely modern (ish) addition to the Wizarding World & are mostly found in the West with most of the Eastern & African Countries using various other Foci or simply going without entirely

** Students at Uagadou use gestures for most magic, with wands being limited to certain applications. I'm guessing transmutation or healing, but never specified that I can find.

Fics:

linkao3(Accidental Animagus) Has a big thing about Harry and Hermione figuring out how to do it, along with year four elective lessons.

Linkffn(Core Threads)

Linkffn(Filfy Teacher) HS DXD crossover. Since he moves to Japan, there's a lot about how their magic works and using a bracelet as a foci instead of a wand.

linkao3(Prince of Slytherin) has a bit about it, but I don't remember which specific book.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** In Philosophers stone Quirrell conjures ropes and Dumbledore transfigures the decoration of the Great hall to show Gryffindor instead of Slytherin.

In Prisoner of Azkaban Tom the owner of the Leaky Cauldron lights a fire and Remus Lupin creates fire with his hand to use a light source.

There are several other instances, but those are the most obvious ones that come to mind.

** Magic without wands is probably possible, but less powerful and more difficult to learn without too many advantages (aside from not being easily disarmed). I'd expect wizards to know a few easy spells that they use all the time, like stirring tea (mostly to show off) and fighters might know a few attack spells and Accio wand. But it doesn't make much sense to learn more than that wandlessly when you could learn three times more spells wanded in the same amount of time.

** There is, for example, a few second long clip in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban, where someone who works in the leaky cauldron uses wandless magic in order to clean the table and put up the chairs, as another stirs his tea/coffee/hot beverage with a teaspoon without touching it.
