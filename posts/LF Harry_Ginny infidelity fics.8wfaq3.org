So Harry has an affair with another woman because sexual frustration (whether He wants to have sex with Ginny but she rejects him or both of them have good sex but the affair is "new" and has promising offer for the Beddings) or other reasons. Doesnt matter if he regrets it (but his new affair always pushs the right buttons on him and get him into the Bed) or doesnt and continues the act. there are a lot of smut fics out there, some of them leading faster to the infidelity than others. I would also like to know, if there fics that contain a rather slow but intense seduction, probably unresolved sexual tension stuff.

But im open for anything.

I'm reading this a chapter a night as I settle down, and it's a solid fic. It's rated Teen so there's no smut, and the setup is believable.

Harry/Daphne.

  Daphne woke up to the smell of coffee, which was unusual, all things considered. Mostly because she didn't drink coffee.
