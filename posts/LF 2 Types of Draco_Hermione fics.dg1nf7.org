The First one be Fics with an apocalyptic/end-of-the-world or isolated state. So maybe the War is lost and D/Hr are hiding....ok, this would suggest that both have something going on together already. So lets say they get somehow isolated and there are either no other People to talk to or they wont risk of getting caught in case they are betrayed. Their Canon aversion would remain, but overtime it would soften, since they are the only ones who can talk with each other. The Tension between rises and at some point both sleep with each other. However, i imagine that while Draco would see Hermione as attractive, she just wants to sleep with him for distraction purpose.

The other Fic would be some that have Hermione being the dominant one and Draco the sub. OoC for Hermione would be ok. She likes to tease him and he gets turned on to be dominated by her, athlough he might never admit it.
