i would like to know Fics, that have the Maincharacter investigates in some Cases, whether their contain crimes doesnt matter. I dont know if Harry or Ron would fit into this, as they are Aurors. But i dont know, how far the field of Work for an Auror reach.

Well, thats for the basic or core element of the Fic, to get it more detailed i will continue with the sexual content:

Fics that involve the MC has sex with a Female (that is not his Partner/wife) would be good. What position she has in doesnt matter. She can be the or A Victim or be the unfaithful Wife of a Politician (but he wouldnt care, if she cheats on him, since he is....atleast at the point of the Fic....not anymore attracted to her and only be married, because both of them gain advantages of it. If this limits the chances of getting a Fic by you, then i would accept an enraged Husband aswell).

​

Im fine with whoever the character is. I would even be fine with a Female MC (but here i would prefer a femslash affair, but would still accept an unfaithful Husband....maybe they are both unfaithful, because the mentioned reason above).

​

As in the title, i accept Fics with and without sexual content. With sexual content, i mean mostly "affair" things (even if it isnt a cheating, but a more political affair). But if the MC is with a Partner and they have a sexual relationship, i would take it too. So im curious, if there are investigation fics that would fit my request.


** linkffn(Murder Most Horrid) is an interesting AU where Voldemort never existed and Bellatrix Black is a hardboiled, but non-evil, detective at the Auror Office as a result. Flawed but fun.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

  SOUND THE ALARM! CHRISTMAS FIC 2018! It's nearly Christmas, but crime doesn't sleep. Instead, it leaves a swathe of destruction and dead bodies in its wake across Wizarding and Muggle London. Festive! The Aurors are stumped, the Met are mystified, and consulting detective Harry Potter is on the case.

** I had fun with Auror Harry in an SVU crossover with Ice T's character from the show. It's just a one-shot, but there's definitely investigating.

  Sergeant Fin Tutuola has a problem - three people are dead, overdosed on some new mystery drug that shouldn't exist. With no leads, little evidence, and no ideas, his only hope for solving the case comes in the form of a British Detective Inspector named Harry Potter. Rated T for Drugs, Canon-typical Crime Scenes, and Language. One-Shot.
