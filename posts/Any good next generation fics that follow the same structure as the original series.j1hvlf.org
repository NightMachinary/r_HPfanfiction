Other than: NoahPhantom's Albus Potter, Vekin87's Albus Potter or Lippert's James Potter series.


** Those are definitely the best multi-book traditional next-gen series I've found, and I've spent a /lot/ of time looking for others.

Alexandra Quick is probably the first thing that comes to mind, five/seven complete and sixth in progress. It's not traditional next-gen obviously but it's set in the 2010s.

Slide's Stygian Trilogy has three big books, it starts in 6th year though. But definitely the best-quality next-gen series set at Hogwarts.

Maverick.Heart's Fabula Post Bellum series is getting very good, maybe a notch below the three you listed. Fourth book just started. Probably closest to Vekin in tone.

There's an author, "Colin Creevey", with a complete seven-book next gen series. I didn't think it was on the same level as those three. But I still got through five books and will probably try to finish it at some point.

Alissie has the currently updating Rose Weasley series which is on third year. Also a little lower-stakes and a little less polished than the three you mentioned.

I believe the Gray series now has the largest word count for a Harry Potter fanfiction, but it's bloated beyond belief. I haven't been able to get past twelve chapters or so, but you might like it.

SGTwhiskeyjack has a James Potter series. I read about half the first book, can't remember why I quit. I don't think it was that bad, maybe I'll go back and try it again.

Lysander's Pen has an Albus series. I think I read some of the first book. Like the above series, I can't remember why I quit. I think this was pretty readable.

That's about all on FFN. I don't hang around AO3 much so maybe someone more experienced there could give you more recs.

*** Thank you so much. These all seem really great. For some reason, despite of Alexandra Quick gaining positive reactions, I was never really interested in that story. Maybe because when I am on FFN I'm looking to read stuff about familiar characters and not new ones.

I'm actually aware of the Colin Creevey ones. The first few books are not that well written but you can see the author improving both in terms of storytelling and character development, which makes me really happy for him or her. Maybe not as obvious and in such a steep manner, but it kind of reminds me of how JK evolved as a writer throughout the books. If the first book shows you unidimensional characters with a single defining trait engaged in a battle of good vs evil, as you read more the characters and the plotlines become more complex.

**** No problem, the Colin Creevey ones definitely develop a better plot in the last couple books I read (4 and 5). The first three books in the series seemed to mostly be Hogwarts life rehash with maybe a little mystery at the end (somewhat similarly to canon but lower stakes) so seeing a nice overarching story arc start to emerge was nice. I'll definitely get back to that series.

As for AQ, it's definitely not for everyone. I'd still encourage you to give it a try if you haven't, though; it reads pretty similarly to Vekin, Noah, and Lippert, although personally I find it a good deal better.

**** I definitely recommend the Stygian series by Slide that was mentioned! I'm almost done the last one now and holy it's been a hell of a ride and a lot of tears ðŸ˜…

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  COMPLETE - The Potter siblings return to a Hogwarts changed for the worse: Order in the school hangs by a frayed thread over the abyss of chaos. One of its best leaders is indisposed, another feeling the effects of age. The students find themselves in a powder keg. And, worst of all - the fuse to trigger the explosion into conflict may well be inside the castle's own walls.
