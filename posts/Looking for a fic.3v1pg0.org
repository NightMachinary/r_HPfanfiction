I read a fic a while back that had Harry learning to be an anamagus. He took a potion and had the dream and his former was a dragon. I know you have read a thousand of these but this was different. This dragon was Toothless from How To Train You Dragon. It wasn't finished at the time so I wanted to check back on it. Thanks ahead of time.


** The only one I remember with him being a Night Fury was towards the very end of Harry Potter & the Curse's Cure: linkffn(6193196), but I think it may have been abandoned, since it's been years without an update.
