** For me, a dark!Harry is a Harry with a darker, more self-serving character who is willing to cross moral lines to reach his goals (e.g. kill someone, lie, cheat etc.). If he uses dark magic or "light" magic to reach his goals is irrelevant for me. If he'd never cast the killing curse or uses other dark magic, but kills people employing "light" magic (Wingardium Leviosa or whatever), he'd still be dark in my opinion. I don't think him using dark magic alone would make him "dark", after all, canon!Harry used it too, and he certainly wasn't dark.

** Way back when, dark!Harry was used to indicate a middle ground between evil!Harry and regular good Harry. Dark!Harry wasn't evil, but he used dark magic to achieve good goals.

Basically:

Harry: hero

Dark!Harry: anti-hero

Evil!Harry: villain

However, these days evil!Harry seems to have dropped out of the equation, and dark!Harry occupies everything other than good guy Harry.

*** I think Gray!Harry has taken over the anti-hero label.

** At the most basic level, Dark!Harry for me is when Harry either enjoys or is indifferent about killing people, no matter what kind of magic he uses.

** Harry's defining virtues are his integrity and his courage. His defining flaws are his temper and his impulsivity. The flip side of his admirable selflessness is his tendency to go it alone, and to mistrust others, or retreat into his own thoughts. So if you're keeping to at least plausibly canon fanfic, as opposed to total personality re-writes, Dark!Harry would be a Harry whose flaws are magnified and whose virtues are minimized, or twisted.

Dark!Harry, not by accident, starts to sound a lot like Tom Riddle. The ideological trappings or personal motivations might be different, but the patterns of thought would be similar.

** Dark Harry is a Harry who uses evil, be it dark magic or immoral methods, to achieve a good aim.

Evil Harry is a Harry who uses any methods to achieve an evil aim.

** Well its about perspective innit? e.g. Dark Lord is a superfluous title because voldemort holds no station. Only his followers or former followers call him that (Snape). So they believe he lords over dark magic. Now dark magic seems to be any magic that is oppressive and malicious in intent. So in theory the dark lord could use his magic to still achieve moral goals. Leading us to dark harry. Which means harry using magic that is oppressive and malicious. Whether harry intends it to be used for morally right or wrong end results, doesn't matter because he is still dark harry.\\
However if you want to argue the ethos of the magical world is a different story.

** What I think it should be is a Harry who is willing to use harsher and more extreme methods for the greater good when the situation calls for it.

Though for a lot of fics Dark!Harry really translates out to Edgelord!Harry in which his go to response for all situations is to break out all kinds of dark magic even when it's not actually necessary.

** Dark Harry, for me is when Harry is willing to step over bodies to kill Tom. Or Dark Harry is a Harry that is against the common morals of the world, but still wants to defeat the bad guy for what ever reason. Grey Harry is a Harry who would kill villians, but only because that is the only way he can ensure the safety of the others. Light Harry in my mind would have been killed by voldemort in the first couple of months of open warfare if it wasnt for dumbledore
