*** Just finished On the Way to Greatness yesterday, was so good but it isn't finished.

Any of these complete stories?

**** Hmmm. Not really. Control is definitely abandoned, HBS and /Death Before Dishonor/ are WIPs. /Not Slytherin Enough/ is a one-shot. The Grey Maiden Series is as such incomplete, but the first four books in the series are complete and the fifth one is /almost/ complete. But really, if you insist on reading only complete stories in fanfiction, then you're going to miss out on a lot of good stuff.

***** Only when I finish every complete story that's recommended to me will I delve into my bookmarks of abandoned stories. Will I miss good stories? Yes. Am I willing to miss out on those specifically because there is no closure? Yes I am. And that's okay.

****** I don't straight up dislike uncompleted stories, but I prefer an ending.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2560219/Dethryl][They Shook Hands]]. A lot of it feels like a canon rehash, but it does get better in this regard later on.

** I quite like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8666085/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slytherin-Selection][Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection]] and the rest of that series.

It's a WIP, a bit of a canon rehash, but I'm enjoying it/
