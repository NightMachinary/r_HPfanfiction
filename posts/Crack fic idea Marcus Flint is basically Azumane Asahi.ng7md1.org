If you don't watch Haikyuu Asahi is an anime character in his last year of high school. He looks really intimidating and looks more like a man. He has a goatee and his hair is in a man bun. This leads to some interesting rumours. Some people say that Asahi is secretly a thug and he was held back in school for 5 years. They also believe he sold drugs.

Except Asahi is a wimp. The captain literally calls him a “Wimp in a big body” or something similar. He has low self esteem and gets scared easily. He is also very easily intimidated.


** Would he have a mean bun too? That be lit

*** Same here! And the fact that he is in Slytherin makes it all the better since little first year Harry thought that the Slytherins looked like a mean sort when he first saw them.
