As I remember, Harry and Draco are supposed to be her Protectors. Voldemort is after Harry because if he controls the Protectors, then he can control Morgana's heir. The Big Bad is the shadow realm for which Morgana needs to train Ginny. IIRC, at some point Voldemort dies/murdered (?), and Lucius takes over Voldemort's quest, and I think it drives him insane.


** Youre looking for The Rebirth, and the unfinished sequel Galatea, both by Irina and on ff.net

***** Thanks! Yeah, I remember the sequel was unfinished which is a shame. I don't remember much the text of the stories though, but it was one of the first fanfics I read that was so unique so I really hope it's as good as I remember it :)
