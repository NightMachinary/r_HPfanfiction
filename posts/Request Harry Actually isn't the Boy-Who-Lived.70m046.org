Looking for stories where someone other then Harry is the Boy-Who-Lived

Note (Very Important) if it is Harry's Brother or Sister then I want that person to truly be the Boy/Girl Who Lived. I don't want it to be them thinking it's them when really it's Harry all along; I don't tend to like those plots.

Now if it's an AU like say it's Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Draco, Severus or whatever that could be really interesting.

Would rather NOT have Weasley Bashing, I grew out of that a long time ago, I don't need it. I also would rather not have Dumbledore bashing, but if the story is good enough I will allow it. (Won't say the same for Weasley Bashing, can't stand it).

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if it has more chapters I'm fine with it.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash


** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]) - Gets rec'ed a lot. A nice fic that fits your request, though sometimes too much on the telling side rather than the showing. Enjoyable and worth a read, IMO.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5136938/1/Innocence-and-Roses]]) - A really funny, not so well known fic with an intricate plot. Wierd and interesting fic. An excellent, though short, read.

That's all I can think of for the moment.

Edit: The second link pointed to the 3rd chapter. Fixed.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

** dirgewithoutmusic's series on AO3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][boy with a scar]] Has everything from Neville being the BWL, to Ron and Hermione getting shots at it. (The Last Son is rather interesting, since Ron is the BWL, and Harry is raised by Lily, Sirius, and Remus, since Pettigrew's betrayal led to James' death, and he's caught in third year.)
