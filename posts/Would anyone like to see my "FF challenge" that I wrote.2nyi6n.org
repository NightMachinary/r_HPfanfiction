** I'd much rather read the challenge than read someone asking if I want to read the challenge.

**** One of these days reddiquette is going to be updated with "Asking if anyone wants to see your content, instead of just posting your content, is not allowed." You see it in askreddit all the time: "If anyone's interested in X it I can post X" followed by dozens of "yes please", or worse, replies. It's stupid. Nobody is going to say no, we don't want to see your content. The entire fucking site is made up of users' content! Just post your shit, goddamn.

** Wait what's the FF challenge?

I'm always down to read more fanfiction regardless.
