#+begin_quote
  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

**** Possible, I have no clue. I'm reasonably sure it was Harry/Ron eventually, which would narrow the search considerably. And "Harry is missing" was pretty much in the first paragraph. Ron was the only one who hadn't given up on him being found alive, everyone else was in mourning.

****** Ah, got it. Talk about the most useless summary ever for actually recognizing the fic - I only realized because it was a visited link in my fairly short search results. It's linkffn(The Mage and The Potions Master by shedoc)

And oops. I was totally wrong about "Harry is missing" being the very first thing in the fic. You probably never would have recognized it on your own with that info.
