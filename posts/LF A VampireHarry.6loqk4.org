  (Bashing! Lunar Harmony Poss Harem! Crackfic!) Based on, but not a full response to, DZ2's "Eyeballs to Entrails" challenge. Abducted after his Fourth Year, Harry finds his abductor to be a most unusual person indeed: rising Queen of Magical Britain's Vampires and Pudding Club leader, Luna Lovegood. And she intends to make him her consort, an offer he is surprisingly amenable to...

  A sequel to 'All things considered'. After the Second Wizarding War, Harry is at a loose end. When a certain High School explodes, that changes, and the Wizarding World and the Slayer collide. Start of a long and likely slow updating series. Buffy/Harry pairing. Possible Xander/Ginny.

  become a half vampire
#+end_quote

One does not simply become a Dhampyr (half-vampire). You are /born/ one, because they are the children of a vampire and a mortal, living person. And if you aren't a Dhampyr, you are either a human or a full vampire.

The only canonical half-vampire (if you count JKRowling's official site as canon) is [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Lorcan_d%27Eath][Lorcan d'Eath]], who has vampire ancestry.
