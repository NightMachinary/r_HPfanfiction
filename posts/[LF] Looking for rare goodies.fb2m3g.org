So I'm looking for fics that you don't find on the semi-immediate surface when searching fics that are also good.

Also no slash (no offence against it, not my cup of tea)

And I feel like 100k words is around where my need-to-read-more problem gets solved with the plot soooo link it anyways I wanna get loads and loads of fics, but I prefer above a 100k words

Thank you!


** So, I've just posted about this, but

Is Amazing. It's not complete yet, but the author still updates occasionally. It's on a different site, Royal Road, which is a site normally centered around original stories. the summary from the site:

"What would you do if you were reborn inside the Harry Potter Universe? Follow Alexander Fawley's adventures as he is reborn in the Harry Potter world. In this tale, he will have new unique adventure to call his own, And he will discover that the Harry Potter Universe is much greater than he had imagined."

It follows an original plot having to do with the broomstick industry, rather than following canon like a lost puppy. The MC starts out in our world, having read up to OOTP. He doesn't know Dumbledore dies, or what the horcruxes are. The story is mainly just MC living in the world, living his best life. It's good. Read it.

** Looked for some fics with a fav count of under 300, as well as some things I don't see mentioned very often, since that probably results in rarer fics? These aren't necessarily all my favourites, mind, but are reasonably decent fics that have /far/ lower favourites counts than I'd expect.

*Fics with under or around 200-300 favs:*

linkffn(505654), The Broken Victory; a very AU retelling of Tom Riddle's descent at Hogwarts, 181k & complete. Fairly old fic and was completed before some of the books, so that's why it's so AU. Also, the formatting is occasionally very dodgy (lots of paragraphs accidentally bolded) for some reason, but I think it's worth the read; I'd recommend a useful browser plugin (like Decreased Productivity for Chrome) that wipes formatting to make the reading easier on the eyes if it bothers you.

linkffn(8179755) Blank Canvas. bit shorter, 21k. The same author also has multiple fics that are related/fics that have sequels for more words, eg. Before the Dawn & One by One (its sequel) add up to just under 100k.

The Dark Lord Exposed, 180k, complete. linkffn(11015768). Voldemort's life.

linkffn(4508571), Für Das Größere Wohl, 87k. An interesting premise with a pro-Grindelwald, bigoted German muggleborn.

linkffn(2970716), Into the Fold. ~172k, complete. Severus Snape & his descent.

linkffn(7217938) Etc Etc - And Life Goes On. ~104k, complete. Albus Potter, some OCs, and humour.

linkffn(11487602), Resurrexit, ~75k, complete. Mystery.

*Fics that've been officially taken down, but you can probably find somewhere:*

Eldritch by Eldritcher is very excellent, if you can find a copy, and has ~100k words (for 20 chapters). Time-travelling Albus adopts Tom.

Little Differences by Theta Serpentis if you can find it. 246k words & complete. Somehow had under 200 favs. Tom Riddle, from birth til age 11.

Finding the Future by loveadubdub. 262k, complete. Lessons Learned by the same. 212k, complete. Both about Rose/Scorpius.

** Linkffn(2242606) is one of my favorites. I haven't reread it in years (always find something else to read), but the plot is very good and the author actually has a few tricks up her sleeves with it. Also, it's Hinny, but their relationship is not the main focus of the story, unlike...

Linkffn(4175909). This story is a more angst-ier take on the concept of soul mates and soul bonds. I won't say how that is so (to say it would ruin the story), but yeah. It's Hinny and it's angst-y.

And, since everyone needs a good gen story every once in while, I also recommend linkffn(10382653). Basically, it's yet another story where James and Lily are resurrected, but I think it does an excellent job of remaining true to the characters and has a pretty good plot.

Also, all of these are complete, because I know a lot of people don't like uncompleted fics. If you're not one of those people, though, I have several more fics that I can recommend on top of these.

  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, but bears it out, even to the edge of doom.

  The blood magic used in Little Hangleton Graveyard does more than grant Lord Voldemort bodily form; it also brings Lily and James Potter back from the dead. OoTP AU but follows OoTP closely. Lily/James, Jily
