Hi everyone!

I literally made a reddit account just to ask for help. I've always loved stories where Astoria Greengrass (or other last name) was the daughter of Sirius Black.

I use AO3 now, but occasionally go back to ff.net, where I first started reading fanfiction ages ago.

My issue now is, there was a fanfiction (on fanfiction.net) I read years ago, where Astoria was Sirius' daughter, and her and Harry ended up becoming close, almost like siblings. I remember in one scene, Sirius was outside Hogwarts in a cave he was staying in during hiding, and Astoria met him there and they spoke of her mum, who Astoria didn't know much about. They also would talk using Floo powder, etc.

At some point later on, I believe that Astoria started working for the Order, along with Blaise as casual double agents.

It had to have been a long story, as I remember it covering quite a lot of their journey. I've searched for absolute ages to find this, and any help would be greatly appreciated!!!

Thanks in advance <3
