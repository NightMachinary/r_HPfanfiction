He had tried everything; again. /Everything/. Just as he was about to throw a nourishment spell, Aberforth barged in.

"ALBUS! You must try these wonderful candies! Simply Delicious!" Aberforth exclaimed.

Aberforth saw him with his wand pointed at Arianna and sighed. This was a regular occurrence, Arianna would have bad days, where she would eat nothing. She would spend the day staring the wall. No matter what they did, she would not move, not eat, not drink. It would soon be a problem, she was nine already, she would start to loose vital nutrients to her growth.

The only way for her to stay in health, was to cast nourishment spells, and hope they lasted long enough until her next good day.

Aberforth came up behind him with a small bag of sweets, and Arianna's head whipped over to them. Albus startled, she never moved on these days. Aberforth carefully held up the small bag; her eyes followed. He took a lemon drop out, and handed it to her.

She inspected it, holding it closely to her eye. Unexpectedly, she shoved it into her mouth. Both Albus and Aberforth stared. Slowly she got up, reaching her hand out to the bag, reached in and took another one. Albus looked at the bag, and reached in, taking one as well.

"Lemon Drops," He paused, savoring the flavor. "A wise choice Aberforth, may you endeavor to buy more of these in the future."

Aberforth nodded, still shocked that she actually ate something.

...

And from then on, Lemon Drops would be the only thing that Arianna would eat on her bad days.


** I remember that story where Harry in highly agitated state completely mindlessly accepts offered Lemon Drops and Dumbledore breaks down crying, that he was the first person to actually accept them. Do you remember which story it was, please?

** "I can't believe you don't like Lemons, Harry," the old man said looking at the boy over his spectacles. There was twinkle in his eyes.

** In fanfiction it could be true, but not in canon.

In canon, on the night Dumbledore and McGonagall leave Harry on the doorstep, Dumbledore offers one to McG for what is clearly the first time, as he describes them to her. He has already been her colleague for years. If he'd been eating them all along, she would already know about them. Clearly he had recently discovered them.

** Dumbledore has been described as having an unusual obsession with muggle candy; Lemon drops were hardly the only candy he was described as having.

*** Not even specifically muggle, there's at least one magical one used as his office password.\\
The man just has a sweet tooth, and given that magic probably makes cavities and tooth decay a non-issue, who wouldn't.
