So I really love the series, but I want to see some fan fiction of the trio's years at Hogwarts through either Ron or Hermione's point of view. I would really appreciate your help, thanks!


** Here is an amazing one, it is Philosopher's Stone in its entirety from Hermione's point of view. [[http://www.mediafire.com/?1e0ros5yb3x12uo]] Probably the best fanfic I have come across.

** There is one called "Resistance" by worth12ofmalfoy. It's quite good, canon, and told from the POV if Neville during book 7. It's what happens in and around Hogwarts after Fleur and Bills wedding.

*** One of my favs:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3290886/]]

I've read it more than once. Involves a Time-Turner, in case that matters.

**** I really love time-turner stories. I guess I just I love the concept of a do-over.
