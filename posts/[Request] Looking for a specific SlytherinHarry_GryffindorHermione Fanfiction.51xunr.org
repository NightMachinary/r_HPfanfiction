** Are Harry and Hermione in a relationship or just friends?

I'm going out on a huge limb here bc Harry is the nicest and most adorable ever in this fic but it's the only one I know where Slytherin!Harry is friends with both Hermione and Draco so is it linkffn(magical relations)?

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

*** I think it was a relationship. A lot of sexual tension when they disliked each other and they were definitely only friendly when they began liking each other in a romantic sense.

But thanks for the reco, I'll definitely check it out!

** Sound interesting. I don't usually read Harry/Hermione anymore but this, if found actually sounds like something I will try reading.

*** It's driving me crazy! Though honestly speaking, I probably thought it was amazing then and not so much anymore. Still, I'd like to give it a reread.
