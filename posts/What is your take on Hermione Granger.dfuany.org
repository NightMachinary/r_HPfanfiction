A General discussion regarding the canon given and fanon extended Characterisation of our /cute, sweet, bushy haired, lovable genius/

/To the LIBRARY!!!/


** I liked her in canon. She was bossy, yes. A little bit of a mother hen. BUT she always had the boys' best interest at heart.

In fics though...I can't stand her at all. It's especially bad with dark fics because she ALWAYS worms her way into those. You have a Slytherin MC being buddy-buddy with the school's biggest bigots AND with Hermione and then Hermione makes all those Slytherins see the light, makes them understand that muggles are cool. Or even better: muggles still suck but Hermione is cool, so being friends with that one muggle-born, even though we are all racist, is cool because it's Hermione.

So, no. In (dark) fics I avoid Hermione like the plague.

To play devil's advocate - this happens IRL a fair bit. Your friends and/or allies are always the "exception" to your otherwise bigoted views of their race, sexuality, religion or what have you.

That said, few fanfic authors are able to grasp that nuance effectively.

**** IRL you also get a lot of "All X suck, I am X so I ought to know."

That doesn't make it a compelling theme in fiction. Or makes you want to read more about it.

*** I feel like out of all canon characters, Hermione has the most potential to become dark. She has quite a few moments where she puts the end above the means or is vindictive. Having her snap and get payback on Malfoy, Umbridge and the like wouldn't be very OOC.

She wouldn't join in with Voldemort, but she doesn't need to be a Death Eater to carry out acts of terrorism.

That's not my problem though. Almost every time I read about a Slytherin-Harry/fem!Harry, who gets nurtured by Malfoy and the like, suddenly Hermione too ends up in that group. I don't mind OOC behaviour but it has to have some kind of a good reason behind it. Even OOC-Hermione would not end up friends with people who see her as inferior. I don't know which fic it was I read, but this was exactly my problem there: for no reason whatsoever, Slytherin-fem!Harry, who is the Slytherin queen bee and has the likes of Malfoy, Zabini and Parkinson in her clique, also includes Hermione and everyone is just like "ok cool". There's no conflict at all happening, despite the obvious early bigotry showcased by the aforementioned Slytherins.

THAT is my problem with Hermione in most Slytherin-MC fics/ dark fics. Hermione snapping because of bigotry she faces, though...I'd read that.

***** I guess it depends on the circumstances, you write, but generally I see Harry move more hesitantly while Hermione attacks the task with her usual zeal. Harry may make the initial decision, but I see Hermione become the "heads, spikes, walls" enforcer/planner/organiser rather quickly as long as you can come up with a rational justification.

If you are looking for "burn down that orphanage", Harry might be the better bet as he lived through some really nasty shit. But "let's firebomb the Ministry" or "teach Lucius Malfoy a lesson with Draco's head" feels more like something Hermione would do if the war becomes long enough.

** - Hermione likes reading and research. She likes freshly mown grass and fresh parchment and spearmint toothpaste. And Ron.

But with the freshly mown grass, we can infer she likes order. She likes a job being done and being able to appreciate what comes with the job being done.

Spearmint? Presumably, it's the kind her mother and father, the dentists, use. Make of that what you will.

- Insecurities

She's not very pretty. She has big teeth. She has trouble making friends.

- Hermione does not like...well, anything that goes against what she thinks, if we must be honest.

Although she enjoys watching games, she looks down on Quidditch culture. She dislikes the competition that sprouts up between the Houses (though given her bazillion House points, she can't exactly call herself sinless in that regard).

Of course, given that Hermione sucks at flying and never tries to get better, there may be an element of being just being bitter about her dislike of Quidditch.

- Hermione's strength is, to paraphrase my father, having a mind like a steel trap. She reads and reads and reads and more importantly she /remembers./ Though her memorization is far from perfect--she couldn't remember what the Legend of the Chamber of Secrets was, despite it being in /Hogwarts, A History./

She's also quick-witted. Despite a tendency to miss the obvious /magical/ solution, Hermione can also figure out how to solve problems quickly. She immediately realizes Snape is doing /something/ to Harry and sets out to stop him--notably without hurting Snape.

Hermione has a strong sense of right and wrong. She is /outraged/ over the way wizards treat other sapient beings and despite her tendency to be a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie][Soapbox Sadie]], the fact of the matter is, she's /right./

She's also a fast learner--she is able to do many spells in class and the DA lessons that others struggle with, the Patronus Charm being an exception.

- Her weaknesses?

She's as stubborn as a mule, and often very self-righteous. Even her good intentions can fall flat, due to her zeal. She can be prone to panicking. And while being a Muggleborn means zilch in terms of impeding her skill, it does make her culturally unaware of things Ron takes for granted: She didn't know what the word "mudblood" meant, just that it was clearly very rude.

Hermione also doesn't particularly like aggressive confrontation--she trembles whenever Harry snaps at her. She likes to /argue/ but she doesn't like to /fight./

Hermione has a temper, with an occasional violent streak. She sent her conjured birds on Ron with a look of vindictive fury. When studying for O.W.L.s with Harry, she lost her temper and hit him in the nose with her textbook, hard enough to make his eyes water (though given the size of the books, this may not have been terribly hard).

For all her complaints of the Ministry interfering at Hogwarts, Hermione doesn't tolerate /any/ dissent from what she thinks is right, until proven otherwise. She dismisses the abilities of Fred and George as flashy tricks, not proper magic--until she sees the Day-dreaming Charms at their joke shop, which are apparently quite impressive.

See also, the way Hermione treats Luna. Whatever you feel about Luna, Hermione starts every single argument they have by rudely shooting Luna down--and that was after giving a half-arsed apology the first time Luna stood up for /The Quibbler./

It takes Luna participating in the Battle of Department of Mysteries before Hermione comes to a point that would be /agree to disagree./

It takes until Hermione learns Luna was with Ginny and Neville trying to steal the Sword of Gryffindor before she actually /defends/ her from Phineas Nigellus's insults.

- What does Hermione value?

She values friendship and bravery--citing them as virtues far above books and cleverness. Effectively, she calls herself "good" but she calls Harry "great" (Interestingly, it's an inverse of Ollivander, who was quick to condemn Voldemort's actions as "terrible" but still "great"). Make of that what you will.

Hermione values the pursuit of knowledge--she reads far ahead in the textbook. /Goblet of Fire/ has her study the Summoning Charm on the ride to Hogwarts, something Harry struggles with when they study it in class */In November./*

- What does Hermione fear?

Failure is one thing, but consider what that means--Hermione prides herself on being the best.

She fears Voldemort and what hatred and bigotry mean.

On a more mundane level, Hermione's probably afraid of heights, given that she "lacks confidence on a broomstick" right before the Battle of the Seven Potters.

Probably important to note that she knows exactly how to make herself more attractive, but doesn't think it's worth the effort... but /does/ go out of her way to have her teeth shrunken, actually misleading or lying to Madam Pomfrey while she does so. Maybe that aspect of her appearance was viewed as a failure where her otherwise plain appearance was accepted in stride because her parents were dentists?

** I like her and find her the most relatable of the trio, at least in the early books. I like her ruthless streak and wish that more fics would explore it rather than forgetting that she got over the "or worse, expelled" two months into her stay at Hogwarts.

I dislike that many fics either make her flawless, make her arm candy and/or make her look like a model or a porn star. That's not who Hermione is and such characterisations are the reason why she has such a bad reputation in parts of the fandom.

*** To expand on the "or worse, expelled" line that a lot of authors use to ridicule her... in context it actually makes a lot of sense. As a muggleborn, she's only just found out that she /has magic/. To be kicked out of this whole new world that she's only just discovered would indeed seem catastrophic to a ten-year-old... especially one that probably feels like she has to prove to her parents that, yes, sending her away for most of the year is a good idea. Add to that a child's underdeveloped sense of mortality and it's more understandable.

** When I most appreciate Hermione characterisations is when she's displaying her absolutely /bull-headed/ desire to /help,/ and /be useful/... even when her tactics aren't exactly very helpful or are even counter-productive; especially coupled with her lack of awareness of other people's mental processes, and her compensation for that via rote learning. See: her reverence for "rules" and her absolute disdain for those using the rules for their /own/ gain.

An example of this kind of thing that comes to mind is her reaction to Harry's transformation in /To Reach Without/ - she's immediately desperate to get Harry's pronouns right, even when Harry is still unsure of them. And she makes sure everyone else is getting it right too. Because that's how you help people in Harry's position, right? That's what the books say.

Going a bit deeper, I love it when authors explore this "must be useful" motivation and what kind of childhood may have brought this about - often coming down to particular self-esteem issues brought on by distant parents.

That's my take anyway.

** Fanfic is malleable, so I don't really have one standard take of her in mind. I can tell you what characterizations I like and what ones I think have a bases in canon.

 

First, the fanon things I like personally. I like smart Hermione, genius Hermione and so on. I do really like when she is portrayed as some sort of child prodigy before hogwarts, but I don't know how well that fits into canon... I like when she is creating stuff (but that is just because I like creating stuff.)

I like when she is the nerdy bushy haired bookworm who only cares for her own appearance on rare special occasions.

I love when she is portrayed as loving to learn information and wanting to share what she has learned to the world. (for example walking through some historic district, in my mind she would be sharing facts about half the buildings that she had read somewhere.)

I like when she is portrayed as a bit excitable, Hermione the bushy haired missile taking a running leap into harry.

I like the idea that her horrible hair is caused by her magic.

 

Then the fanon things I dislike. I don't like when she is a supermodel that just needs to have her hair cut/grow out/settle with age. (in fact, I don't like when her hair is messed with at all in fanfic...)

I find it wrong when she is portrayed as this... well Percy. Thinks that authority figures can do no wrong, and follows literally every rule.

I can't see Hermione "free the elfs" Granger being ok with anyone being forcibly married to anybody. Hermione has these HUGE justice buttons in canon, so probably wouldn't be okay with any law that would take liberty away from someone.

 

As for canon...

I feel she carries a torch for both of her best friends, Ron is evident by her ending up with him. Harry has a few moments where it definitely seems that she feels something for him.

#+begin_quote
  "Bye, Harry!" said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek.

  “Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you! You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable.”
#+end_quote

I feel she has demanding parents, and was probably isolated from her peers by her smarts and arrogance. She is quite bosy and always sees herself as right, though this is tempered by the fact that she is usually right.

(One interesting portrayal I have seen for her was that maybe she went through a bullying phase, being basically a year older than her peers she would have gone through a growth spurt first in her class. If she was bullied in the past, she might have started pushing back, and started ruling the school with her smarts and (relative) strength. No teacher (nor her parents) would believe teachers pet Hermione Granger would do anything of the sort, and so she would have had free rein. The fic had her have an epiphery soon before hogwarts, but when she first got there she was still kinda used to everyone following her every command.)

She wants to help whenever she can (even when people don't want to be helped), and I think wants to be seen as useful. She sees her smarts as one way to be useful.

She is not afraid at all to hurt other people if it makes the people she loves happier and safer.

** Not a genius! Not by a long shot! The Marauders and Snape are closer to being a genius and they still don't quite fit the bill! Hermione is not stupid, but her knowledge comes from hard work (and her classroom performance from reading ahead and probably even trying those spells she reads about, so maybe her doing it "the first time" isn't actually true and she practises the spell before class already!) and isn't effortless like with the Marauders (they spend most of their time thinking about pranks and sneaking around, but they are still brilliant students!)!

The only true geniuses in HP-Canon are:

- Dumbledore who was a prodigy even during his school years (he surprised his examiners for OWLs and NEWTs and did things with his wand they didn't think possible)

- Grindelwald

- Voldemort

- Nicholas Flamel

and maybe: Newt Scammander (animal handling genius!)

OK: And Merlin of course (and probably Morgan le Fey!)

As for my personal take on her? If I were to write a fanfiction then she'd still be a good student and all that (I wouldn't go out of my way to bash her), but she would certainly not be lauded as "the smartest witch of her age"...seriously, Lily is smarter than her (figuring out a self-sacrificial-ritual to save Harry? Yeah, that is damn smart!)
