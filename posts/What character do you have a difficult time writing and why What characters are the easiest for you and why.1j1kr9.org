For me, Ginny and Hermione are pretty easy to write. In general, I find girls much easier to write than guys. I have a relatively easy time tapping into Hermione's insecurities, even though we're not particularly alike. I think that the key to Hermione is that she's always honest. She's not content with letting something she sees as morally or intellectually wrong be. She doesn't hide her intelligence, even when it's not winning her any friends. At the age of thirteen, she tells McGonagall about the Firebolt and threatens to tell about Hogsmeade- because she honestly believes that these things will keep Harry safe, even if it means losing his friendship in the process. She's honest with herself and unwilling to pretend that problems don't exist.

I've written a couple different things with pre-Azkaban Sirius, but I can't manage to write him in anything set after he escapes. He's such a tornado of emotions-happy, mad, depressed, angry, restless-and I can't do him justice.

I have a dry sense of humor, so Fred, George, and any other character that's very jokey is difficult for me.


** Luna. You have to have a certain balance for her. Too faerie like and she becomes a bloody seer dropping not-so-subtle hints on plots, and too little faerie-ness and you either have her saying "nargles" after every two words or just an average girl who pretends to be weird for whatever reason.

Ron's the easiest in his own way, but many people fall into the whole "Ron the Death Eater" trope and make him as annoying as possible. I always felt bad for Ron to be honest. Everyone had their super powers in the Harry Potter universe: Hermione was the super brains, Harry was the hero, Fred and George were the genius pranksters, Luna the weird but secretly smart lady, but Ron was just the average kid who was thrown into the melting pot of supers and hated when he couldn't keep up.

I swear I'm going to make a story featuring the awesomeness that is Ron.

*** I also have problems with Luna. Hermione is a bit tough at times, though not nearly as much. (She reminds me enough of my sister that I can get away with patterning.)

I find Harry is easy, as he's everyone's everyman. I also find Dumbledore to be fairly easy to write. Moody as well. Actually, most of the male characters are straightforward; JKR's male characters tend to be simpler than her female ones.

** Snape is one of the easiest characters to write in a mediocre fashion, and very hard to write perfectly in character. Novice writers either /immediately/ redeem him and handwave away all his faults so as to make him better shipping material, or they go the other direction and make him a petty and ultimately fairly stupid antagonist. Getting the right level of flawed is a tough balance.

** I love writing Hermione because she and I share many characteristics. I also love writing Draco, especially a good yet almost unbearably annoying version that falls for Hermione. I love thinking of what they would say and do in arguments and how each would get their own little bit of revenge.

I also adore writing Luna. When I write her, I think of cotton candy. Light, airy, sweet. But at the same time, there is a woodland elf earthiness to her. You need to develop a balance of fairy-like aloofness and down to earth realism that keeps her grounded and makes her a vital character. She also has this fun whimsical bit about her that seems like naivete, but there are these underlying currents of maturity and experience that break through every now and then.

I hate writing Ginny because I'm so terrified of making her one dimensional. I'm also never quite sure how to tackle Pansy for the same reasons, mainly because I loathe her. Imo, Voldemort, Lucius Malfoy, and Dumbledore can be incredibly difficult becausw they're simple yet complex. Especially Dumbledore and Voldemort.

******* I mean sometimes it's okay to base an OC on yourself so long as it's not too noticeable - for example, I once started an HP fic about a California art student who got a Hogwarts letter. (I never actually posted it.) It's a far-fetched idea, and the character was definitely based on me, but she differed from me in a few ways. And rather than just blatantly letting readers know she's a Sue ("Hi, my name is Tara Gilles- oops, I mean Enoby") I inserted parts of my personality (such as my passion for art) into her character and used my own interests as fuel for hers. Which I'm sure everyone does with original characters to an extent.

** Easiest for me is Bellatrix. There's something in her nature - she's manic and dangerous, yet childlike and giddy, almost gleeful - that just draws me in and fascinates me to no end.

Hardest? Hmm.

I've never actually tried writing Luna but I can imagine how that would be quite difficult. I've seen people butcher her character so much it makes me gag.

** I'd say the hardest for me is Tonks. She's a hair away from super Mary Stu on her own (clumsiness, general physical features, etc), so it's easy to drop the ball and phone it in. But I love her character so much that it's hard to have a plot without at least a guest role. I'm the hardest on myself when she's involved, for sure. Especially when Remus makes an appearance.

Easiest for me? Harry. I know it's kind of a cop-out answer, but I feel like he's been my "friend" for so long that I could answer questions for him at this point. Is that weird as for 22 year old female? Haha.

** I'm a guy. I can write almost any female character very well, even get compliments on their believability from female readers.

But Harry and possibly Dumbledore are the only male characters that I "get". Every other male character is a struggle for me.

Draco and Voldemort are the hardest to write, I can do a pretty good Lucious Malfoy though.

In crossovers, I can write a good Xander, and all the female characters from Buffy. Spike, Angel and other males...not so much.

**** Honestly? I've always had more female friends than male, and I'm very in touch with my "feminine side", meaning I know my emotions and understand why I feel the way I do at certain events. I do not do self-denial...unless I do it actively; things like forcing myself to "not sweat the small stuff" and not let stress get to me because things will either work out if I can help it, or if I can't help it then worrying doesn't help.

So when I write a female character I completely visualize her in my mind, including her deepest thoughts, and the entire history of the character which leads to her personality quirks or psychiatric problems (bipolar, borderline personality disorder, etc).

I understand women in a weird way that has nothing to do with "understanding women". I can relate, I can't "understand", but it helps me write them more "real".

Men though...it is too hard for me to A) not write a Gary Stu character since I'm a guy, and B) not feminize them beyond gender-normative standards.

So when I write Neville I tend to emasculate him too much, or turn him into some sort of big burly hero. When I write Ron I tend to concentrate on his known character flaws rather than make him a "real" person. Draco and Voldemort are hard to write because I just don't like them, and have no interest in making them interesting. So I end up with Evil and Quasi-Evil, with no character depth.

It also helps that I have such a large and varied pool of sexual experience. I was a swinger for nearly 8 years with my ex-wife; and I have been with and known so many different types of women that I can nail their sexual quirks, reactions, different ways they like to be stimulated...and I can relate those things, a lot of times, to their mental state or their flaws / quirks.

I guess...I am just able to picture "the total package" easier for a woman than for a man.

Men are simple creatures really, it may be that if I really tried I could do great male characters; but I just have no interest...

***** That's really interesting. I think you're right about experiences with the other sex making a difference. Aside from SOs, I've never had a really really close guy friend. And I don't feel like I am capable of patching bits their personalities into a realistic/well-rounded male character. Makes perfect sense.

** I have a hard time talking for any of them. The way that their written is very apposed to how I think or would react in a situation, but the worst has to be Harry. I just cant gauge his level, in the books when he's clever he's really clever, and when he's not he really isn't. For me you have to know when and where Harry's going to be /just/ Harry and when he's going to be 'the chosen one', otherwise you end up with a superharry or a dud.

The easiest is Hermione, shes so clear to me as a person I could almost swear I've met her.
