** Long version on DLP [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021&page=1][Harry Potter and the boy who lived]]

Short version linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi)

The short version I read when I first got into fanfiction, and then I re read it twice until I was informed on this subreddit that there existed more on DLP, so of course i read it all again and the long version, then a few months later I read only the thing that made the longer version longer. I read it all once more this newyear when he updated, I think the newest chapter could have been better but still much better than other enire fanfics. And since I've returned twice and read my favorite chapters.

** There was 2 fics that spring to mind. Unfortunately I can no longer remember the titles of either.

One was a Harry/Tonks story, set from the end of 4th year through to the eventual defeat of Voldemort. It was following canon but in a way as if Harry and Tonks bonded a lot more during their time at Grimmauld Place together. Her initial rejection by Remus leads her to turn to Harry and they get closer and eventually (it's a slow build romance) they date.

The other story was a story set in I think it was Harry's 5th or 6th year and was an alternate to HBP.

EDIT: Found the latter one. It was called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1420986/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Phoenix-s-Flight][Harry Potter and the Phoenix's Flight.]]

I choose these over others because they were among the first fanfictions on Harry Potter I ever read and I still think they're quite good.

**** You'd be missing out on a lot of the back story as far as the description of the crew, ship, and local politics go, but I think you'd be okay. There are a few jokes that play directly off of "haha he was that way in the show lol" but not many. Hmm... Over all, I think you'd like it more if you'd seen at least one whole episode, but you'd probably still enjoy it without that. Plus I'm sure you've seen most of the Firefly/Serenity spoilers so you should be fine.

If you read it and really don't like it, you probably wouldn't like it anyway. If you read it, and kinda like it but are confused, watching the show and then reading it again would be best.
