Kinda inspired by a post the other day; I'm interested in reading a story where Harry enters the wizard omg world and discovers that since his defeat of The Enemy a world wide cult/religion has sprung up. He has worshippers, and temples, and followers of the religious code, and a coven priestess witches. The works. They could end up believing he will be the next dark lord.

Does anyone know of any stories like this?

If you follow canon, but make all of Harry's exploits public I can imagine this happening too. “Our great leader is the youngest seeker in a century!” “He has slain the 60 foot, thousand year old basilisk of Hogwarts!” “A patronus at 13! And he repelled a hundred dementors by himself!” “The goblet of fire picked him to be the fourth triwizard champion!” Etc.


** Well if it isn't a story we need to build a solid prompt for someone with talent to right. I think we meed to be more creative than just Harry being magic incarnation for people to worship. I say we make Harry the new god of life and death, the ultimate decider in who shall live and die, who shall be honoured in the feasts if Albion and who shall rot in the deepest pits of (Insert a negative afterlife relating to magic). Harry coming into being worshipped all over the world and even recieving offerings in the form of food and valuables would be ammusing.

You could also make a serious crack fic similar to Make A Wish where Harry tries to disprove the Potarus religion and just keeps digging his own hole deeper. He tries to show his history is perfectly normal and not godly but actually he is the last Peverell. He constantly finds himself in dangerous situatio s where peoples lives are in danger and his hero complex compels him ti do something. He saves the stone and its destroyed, of course the stone threatens who he is as the decider and the Flamels cannot live for ever. He saves Ginny and survives the basilisks bite because he is an immortal god and it was not her time yet. Every life he saves is explained as not there time yet.

Edit:

Certain death eaters recruoted over sees are deep in the religion and when Harry comes for them they accept death gladly saying "It is my time." Even better if Delphi Riddle does so.

*** Haha! This would be amazing. I wished more fanfic authors were on reddit. We have such great ideas that just kinda go nowhere. :/
