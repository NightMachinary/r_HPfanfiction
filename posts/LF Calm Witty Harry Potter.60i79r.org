Looking for a Harry Potter that's in control of his emotions, he doesn't just scream out in anger when either Draco or Snape say something to him he comes back with some witty remark.


** So, canon Harry? Canon Harry and Ron were both snarky as hell, it's a trait the films scrapped for Ron (shame) and almost nobody gets right in fanfiction for either of them.

*** Harry has a few witty remarks in canon, but he's not calm / collected when people challenge him; like with Umbridge giving him detentions.

** Most Ravenclaw or Slytherin versions of Harry are more controlled, if not calm, and I believe that Knowledge is Power linkffn(5142565) has quite a calm, witty Potter.

*** Is the first chapter an indication for the rest of the fic?

Because right now Harry is just an insufferable little prick in this, with some rather heavy tendency for massive Gary-Stuing in the following chapters.

**** That's exactly what this fic is all the way through. I don't know what the author intended but it kinda reads like a 11 year old preeteen's idea of a 'cool' Harry.

I don't quite remember but i'm pretty sure there's actually a part where Harry plays Wonderwall on his acoustic guitar and that's really all you need to know about this fic.

***** Alright, let me come to it's defense here. The first few chapters aren't that good of a representation of the rest of the fic, and as someone who likes the fic even I'm not a fan of the beginning. However, as the fic goes on it will start to grow on you, especially with the introduction of a couple of OC's who I assure you are plenty developed and quite interesting characters. Please don't just look at the first few chapters of the fic and turn away possible readers, as your comment about Womderwall covers the tiniest of tiny parts of the fic, that isn't relevant to the fic whatsoever and is only useful to misrepresent what it's really like. Sure, I'll admit it's Gary Stu-ish, but it's not done in away that's totally nonsensical where all he does is show off his greatness and leave everybody in awe, repeatedly. However, OP asked for a calm, witty Harry and personally this is probably one of the top-tier fics in this regard. So please, before scaring off potential readers, read a little more in then the first few chapters. It's not what you think it is, and is quite a good fic if your willing to ignore some of the somewhat cringe-worthy chapters at the beginning.

****** I actually did read the whole thing. It was a guilty pleasure kind of read for me. I was fully aware that it was shit but that didn't really stop me from enjoying it.

I should have mentioned that in my original post and i probably would have but i was in a bit of a bad mood when i wrote it and I guess I just felt like bashing it some.

I think you're right. It's not as horrible as I made it out to be but it's also not really any good. I stand by what I wrote, i think Harry is thoroughly unlikable and he just doesn't seem like a real character to me and more like a parody of a stereotypical 'cool teenager'.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
