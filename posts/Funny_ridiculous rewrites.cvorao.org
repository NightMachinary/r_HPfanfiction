Hi, I'm looking for some fics to just chill out with while I'm on the bus or something.

I quite like reliving a decent portion of the school years, but nonrewrite stuff is also fine.

My favourites have been Oh God Not Again, where Harry accidentally goes back in time and decides to have fun while saving the world and When in Doubt, Obliviate, where Harry is adopted by none other than Gilderoy Lockhart.

Does anyone have recommendations in this vein?


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is a rewrite of first year with supersmart Harry, crazy Dumbledore, competent Quirrel and confused Draco. The first chapters have some ridiculous scenes like the omnipotent Comed-Tea that always causes something funny or unexpected to happen. Or the game that can only be played once.

*** This is the one fic that I couldn't get through. I'm one of the rare ones who thought it was boring/terrible. And yet it's literally the topped ranked story lol.

**** It's got some things it does well and it's got some things it completely fails at.

***** agreed. Didn't like the romance, and felt like it kinda overtook the story at some points. Also, it was odd that they decided to allow romance to occur so early within the story. But yeah, that wasn't the only gripe, but one of the major ones. The so called Romance-tumor.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

*** Just finished it and must say, it was one of the mosr interesting fics I've read as of yet. Granted, it could definitely be tedious at times, but overall really enjoyable
