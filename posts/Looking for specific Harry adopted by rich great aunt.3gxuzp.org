I read this on ff.net a few years ago. It's a completed story and an incomplete sequel.

Harry's magical great aunt found him, or the Dursleys were killed or something, and Harry had to go live with her at her manor. Dumbledore was against this, but she had a blood claim. Harry got visions of a sort, memories, where the rest of the family were killed, I think there was a fire. There was a crypt that he was led into by these vision/memories.

It was discovered that Harry had some voice or song magic, and he could control people by singing. This had to be trained, and he took voice lessons.

Professor Slughorn came to the school and was the gryffindor head of house for some reason, and had same-sex year meetings. Hermione was very upset that these were segregated.

Harry became friends with his cousin and his friends, who were all rich and posh. Harry tried to get them together with the Hogwarts crew and it didn't go so well.

I can't remember any specific names or phrases to google, so I'm hoping that someone has this saved somewhere. I'm kind of thinking that it was deleted, because I think I had it in my follows. Please help!

Edit: I was actually looking for this so that I could find similar- I'd love recs for high society, lots of culture, rich, ect.

*** Are there any phrases you remember? Harry was made to write lines out of a special book, if I could remember the name of the book I'm sure I could find it.
