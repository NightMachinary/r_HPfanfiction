** Voldemort finds out the prophecy, finds out the location of the Potters from Peter, but doesn't quite act on it, instead faking his death by "attacking" Peter in Godrics Hollow, in front of the house that he supposedly can't see but actually can and having Peter seemingly kill him. Then lies low for the next decade and a bit, but Peter is under orders from the Dark Lord to ensure Harry is raised to be the best soldier for the light he can be because Lord Voldemort is a proper dark lord damnit, and no self respecting Dark Lord has a nemesis who is a baby or untrained child, he has standards afterall, he wants a proper hero to face him, a proper villain.

*** If you just mean subverting the prophecy, there's a popular fic that had Pettigrew babysit for the potters, because they think he still their friend. Then he takes Harry to Voldemort, who pretty much turns him into his heir.

***** I did not know I wanted to read this. The fic I was talking about was more babysitter wormtail kidnaps Harry, and then just cuts off all contact with the potters, so Harry is raised by death eaters full time.

****** I mean, yeah, Harry raised by Death Eaters and one over protective snake who really just needs a clutch of her own, is fun. But consider the joy of adult the Marauders and Voldemort co-parenting against each other.

Harry's gonna be a sneaky mf kid with codeswitching problems.
