The prime, and really only, suspect is Harry Potter, who was observed earlier that day on the receiving end of a rather humiliating series of confrontations with the young Malfoy. While Harry protests his innocence, the only one that believes him unconditionally and wholeheartedly is Albus Dumbledore; for all the good that does him considering that the pair of them are virtual pariahs among the people of Wizarding Britain.


** Sounds like a lead-in to one of those fics that used to pop up all the about Harry being framed for a crime, everybody instantly believing he's guilty, sent to Azkaban, and turns into the Count of Monte Cristo.

** Why would Hermione and Ron believe him guilty? Harry and Draco getting into a fight and one dying I can believe, but Harry poisoning anyone is so far fetched that only people who don't know him would believe he'd do that.

*** It's a trope. Hermione and Ron leaving Harry solo, suspecting him, ect. Leaving him alone with possibly someone swooping in to be his new bff.

It shouldn't make sence - It's the Wizarding world - but it would be fun if at the end you (the reader) find out he did do it because who would think poor Harry would do such a thing? Plot twist I'd read.

*** I feel like they might suspect him but they'd be 100% behind him anyway. And Hermione would know all the muggle stats like “poison is a woman's weapon” and use it to publicly defend him.

***** It's not what you can do for misogyny, it's what misogyny can do for you. Taking advantage of other people's sexist beliefs would be a very clever thing to do in the circumstances.

****** Maybe, but for someone who rails against an injustice, and then follows it up with a half-baked idea (seriously, did she really think just leaving a bunch of knitted beanies and socks around the Gryffindor Common Room would free even one House Elf?) it just feels like it'd be too clever for her to try it.

*** They don't, or rather they want to believe he didn't do it. But it's not helped that after the verbal dunking he recieved, Harry stalked off muttering about wishing Malfoy had choked on his own words instead of himself; and then at dinner Malfoy dies choking and spluttering...
