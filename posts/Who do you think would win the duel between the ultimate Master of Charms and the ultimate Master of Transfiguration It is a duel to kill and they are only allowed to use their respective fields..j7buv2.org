** I've held off on providing a definite answer. Upon further reflection, I really do think the edge goes to the charms master, though it's a very slight edge.

Firstly, the charms master has a huge advantage in that they can shield, block, or deflect the spells the transfiguration master is casting directly.

Second of all, the charms master has a greater variety of options because they can take advantage of the transfigurations while the transfiguration master cannot. The charm master has many options to transfiguration master does not.

For example, a very common suggestion has been conjuring something over the charms master's head. What options does the charms master have to deal with this? They can block the transfiguration master from casting it. They can cast an imperturbable charm. They can cast a shield charm. They can blast it. They can redirect it towards the transfiguration master. What can the transfiguration do to defend himself against his own conjuration? They can vanish the object, or transfigure something to block it. A lot less options.

What if the transfiguration master transfigures a poisonous gas? The charms master can't transfigure it into something safe. Well the charms master can use a bubble-head charm, banish the gas, or create wind.

There's a constant theme of the charms master being able to use transfigurations against the transfiguration master through charms. And that's why I think the edge goes to the charms master. Because he can use the transfiguration and use curses, hexes, and jinxes.

It's Flitwick who's the duelling champion, not McGonagall.

*** I think there's a few edge cases of transfiguration you're not fully considering.

We are familiar, for example, with what might be termed "transfiguration fields" - a barrier which causes an object which crosses the barrier to be transfigured. See the age line creating beards in GoF. In the hands of a master, this technique could be used to make something shield-like, I feel.

Another edge case is what we might call "dark transfiguration" - if we are allowing the Charms Master dark charms, then the Transfiguration Master should be allowed dark transfigurations - jinxes, hexes and curses with a transformative effect. That really opens up a lot more options for the Transfiguration Master in terms of direct assaults.

**** I definitely should have considered these in my original comment. I focused too much on the purely physical because that's what the other answers focused on.

Ultimately, I ruled these out along with magical powers via transfiguration because I think the charms master still has an edge when it comes to defense and offense. Transfiguration fields would be a quite potent defense because I do believe you can transfigure spells directly. But I think the charms master retains the same advantages. They could block the casting of the spell. They could confund the field. They could dispel the field with a charm.

The jinxes, hexes, and curses, though they may have transformative effects, they are still nominally charms according to old pottermore. But even moving forward with the assumption that they're transfigurations, the charms master still has more options. Blocking, deflecting, shielding, etc. The charms master might even be able to deflect the spells back to the transfiguration master. The counterpart to these, such as a stunning spell, cannot be defended against using these methods. I'd say that blocking and shielding are superior to transfiguration, especially because no unforgivables can be cast by the transfiguration master. Defending against spells via transfiguration only leads to another avenue of attack for the charms master (except maybe vanishment).

Another advantage that the charms master has is the ability to cast the unforgivables.

I think all of these are advantages that add up to give an edge to the charms master in this purely hypothetical situation. A fight between a charms master and a transfiguration master with no limitations on spell casting would be a different matter.

**** The age line isn't a transfiguration spell, it's a spell to detect and repel persons under a certain age. That sounds very much like a charm. The beards are likely an unexpected reaction between the line and the /ageing potions/ that the twins drank to cross it.

** I'd call it a stalemate - I doubt either side will be able to penetrate the other's defences. With access to only physical attacks, likely the Transfiguration Master cannot penetrate a Shield Charm. And without access to Transfiguration (including Untransfiguration), the Charms Master likely cannot dispel the Transfiguration Master's defences or turn them against him.

*** Though I agree with the final result, I'm not sure it's entirely accurate to say that either side won't be able to penetrate the other's defences. I think they can, though their lack of variety will limit their ability to finish the duel, but it's that it simply won't be enough to strike a blow that will secure a victory.

For example, the transfiguration master might attempt an attack from a direction that's not covered by a shield charm. Most shield charms aren't omnidirectional, after all. I'd also wager that a physical attack brought about through magic can also break a shield charm in the same way a jinx or hex might. The centaurs' arrows, for example.

I also think a charms master can penetrate a transfiguration master's defences. They might attack the defense directly, for example, with spells or they might redirect the defense. They might banish a transfiguration or even redirect the other's transfiguration with a charm like oppugno for example.

  He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall *around himself* that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counterjinx.

The same quote says that the shield charm deflects minor curses, yet we see the same shield charm to protect against non-minor curses later on in the books.

​

#+begin_quote
  ‘Protego!' she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backwards a few steps by the strength of the spell and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred towards Ron: something had broken between them.

  ‘Protego!' roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last.

The charm seems to have taken the form of a wall. I think the out of universe argument regarding the shield charm has been that JKR changed her mind about the charm after GoF.

Regardless, my preferred explanation has been that the shield charm is not always omnidirectional, especially when used as a higher level shield charm.

****** I think it's clear that spells have a "default" behaviour but also can be used in many different ways, provided the caster has the skill and knowledge to alter how they work (which seems to be a standard part of what you learn at Hogwarts).

The "default" behaviour of the Shield Charm is as described in GoF: an omni-directional shield which blocks minor jinxes and hexes. However, that's just the basic use of the charm. Advanced users can use it to block much more powerful spells (Harry in HBP and DH), to block physical objects (Harry and Hermione in DH), to reflect spells rather than block them (Harry in HBP), to form different shapes like walls (Harry in DH), to cast a shield charm which moves around (Hermione in DH), to form a permanent protection over a location (Hermione and Harry in DH), and even to cast an aggressive shield charm that attacks those who try to bypass it (Grindelwald in FB2).

******* Meanwhile, my theory is that J.K.R created a low level shield charm for Students as part of a logical progression when learning to defend themselves, but then later in the story decided to make it an all purpose shield charm that would do whatever she wanted at a given time. And spinoffs such as FB continued that method. There are a lot of reasons it child have happened. Maybe the action of the story outpaced the learning and she needed to scale up the effectiveness of what Harry and Co. already knew. Maybe as the story progressed she got tired of actually developing the magic system and took an easy way out. I kind of think it's the later of my two suggestions, mainly because most of the developments we see later in the story are things that are directly necessitated by the plot. Otherwise, random spells would be talked about but never explained in detail, people started doing things previously unseen with the unsaid justification for how they did it simply being 'magic', etc... It just wasn't a major part of the story by that point and it seems she was more than happy to let the actual magic fall to the side. And there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. But with that in mind, it seems kind of silly to go out of your way to justify the discrepancies when J.K.R never did, and in all likelihood didn't really care about it.

******** Disagree on two levels.

Firstly, I disagree that we're even having the same conversation. Doylist observations in a Watsonian discussion aren't really relevant.

Secondly, I disagree with your Doylist observation. JKR's pretty consistent about the way she depicts magic - not through any great planning or thought, but just because there's a certain way she thinks. And that way is abstract/conceptual.

See the freezing charm being used to both freeze things in place physically and also stop a burglar alarm from going off. See objects being summoned both through the air and via apparition. See the Jelly-Legs Jinx, the Leg-Locking Jinx and the Locomotion Charm being variations of the same piece of magic ("Locomotor-"). The way JKR uses magic consistently has a single spell being able to be used in many different ways; the Shield Charm is entirely consistent with the way she uses magic elsewhere.

********* For one, you're going out of you way to define the conversation to your way of thinking. I have my own points in making, sure, but I'm not saying your argument is invalid because of which direction you came at it from.

For two, the watsonian thought process falls apart when definitions and standards previously given don't hold true later in the story. When the magic system used so heavily in a story is so loosely defined, as you have acknowledged, the author's intent for that system becomes an integral part of understanding how it works. Otherwise it eventually becomes people grasping at straws to hold it all together. I'm sure she knows how she envisions the magic system, and we can try to emulate that as best we can, but at the end of the day we're not her. If she doesn't actually define the magic and it's use, the magic then becomes, for the purpose of argument, whatever anyone wants it to be within reason. We can use examples of how she uses it to narrow the scope of what's acceptable, but that's it. So ultimately, unless it's explained by her, there is no truely right answer. And again, given that she went against some previous definitions starting around GOF or OotP, even that can't be entirely trusted. So, if there can't be an agreed upon answer within the context of the story, we have reason to look outside of it for clarification, which in itself, I think, justifies a Doylist observation.

For three, concistency in abstract use of the magic doesn't translate to consistency in how it works. In many cases, we honestly have no idea how the magic works because she never explained it, she just showed different applications of previously unseen magic and that's why she gets away with it. It's the illusion of development without any substance behind it, though maybe a better way to decribe it would be that she only developed one half of it. But in some cases, like the shield charm, we get a deeper understanding of it because it was introduced while she was still describing both parts of it. And in this particular instance she then went against the definition she gave without explaining away the change somehow. It's an inconsistency that doesn't just go away because she started to present the magic differently later in the story.

But in the end, if you're set in your thought process, we can agree to disagree, because I'm very much the same.

*********** I get that, but my point was that Rowling stopped fully developing the magic system part way through the series. Having a discussion with what we know is all well and good, but ignoring the inconsistencies for the purpose of putting a nice bow on it isn't. So if we're going to talk about it in a way that's bound by what she gave us, then we have to acknowledge the entirety of the work, including the flaws. And those flaws can only be fully justified when you look outside of the work to the author.

Lets use your example with the eagles. People have made arguments to justify it in the context of the work. That's great and all, but the reality is that it's just a plot hole that Tolkien didn't think about and the time because he wanted the story to go a certain way. And I'm fairly certain he said as much at one point when he was questioned about it. Maybe that's not what some might want to hear when having the discussion, but oh well. It's the same here. The Harry Potter magic system, as presented by Rowling, is flawed in places; sad, but true as I see it, and I would hope that I'm seeing it objectively for the most part. I'm not going to waste time going out of my way to try and argue those flaws out of existence, and I'm not going to be shy about voicing that opinion just because others don't like it. They don't have to agree with me after all. Anyways, the only reason I gave my opinion on this in the first place is because i don't like the idea of selectively ignoring pieces of cannon to justify an argument that's being presented as connon compliant.

*** I'm not sure who has the edge overall but I don't think the transfiguration expert would necessarily win. A charms master can shield, block (as in dispel), deflect (as in Lucius's deflection), do some conjurations and animations (both charms and transfiguration have conjuration and animation spells), and directly charm transfigurations to defend themselves. A transfiguration master has a much more limited defensive repertoire. They can conjure, transfigure, and animate.

It's probably not easy to simply transfigure something close to somebody or McGonagall wouldn't needed to have banished objects at Snape in their duel in DH. Indeed, it's Flitwick, the charms professor, who's the duelling champion at Hogwarts.

** I think transfiguration. How many charms can one person cast and control at the same time? Transfigure the floor directly below charms master into an ocean, charms guy levitates himself. Then transform the chandelier above him into a grand piano to fall on top of him. While he's working on dealing with that and keeping himself above the water, transfigure the rest of the floor (other than where transfiguration master is standing) into a steep hill with all sides pointing at charm dude. Then conjure 30 super heavy cannonballs at the tops, because how much can one shield charm really withstand. This forces him to abandon ship and cast a bubble head charm and swim away.

Transfigure the ocean back into stone. Say the bubble head charm holds up, what now? He'll still starve/thirst to death.

Any charms the charms guy sends at transfiguration, just conjure a quick wall.

Edit: changed semi trucks into cannon balls, because i realized you'd have to charm the trucks to move... or you could conjure a weight onto the gas pedal.

Edit 2: When writing this I was only considering charms to be what one would learn in a charms course, and same thing for transfiguration. So in other words, I didn't consider charms or transfiguration spells that you would learn in DADA. So, only spells that can be used passively too.

A lot given that Voldemort had been holding Imperius curses on people up and down the country. There are a lot of assumptions about the limits of charms and transfigurations respectively that are a grey issue at best.

The charms master could simply cast an imperturbable charm to repel the cannonballs. It repels magical objects perfectly fine so you don't have any issues with the magical nature of the objects like you might have with a shield charm. Alternatively, the charms master could simply redirect all the conjured objects at the transfiguration master. All that work, turned on himself and the transfiguration master doesn't get to use an imperturbable charm or protego. They'll probably going to cut a few bruises and cuts from the resulting collisions and shrapnel.

The charms master could simply block/deflect/shield the transfiguration of the floor (or ocean).

The wall can be blasted with a blasting curse or banished at the wizard. It might be animated to attack the transfiguration master. The transfiguration master might simply cut through the wall.

In short, there are a lot of options for the charms master and transfiguration master.

*** To my eyes, charms win because of the far more vast array of effects that can be brought to bear, including charms that can mimic transfiguration without using that talent itself. In a nutshell, Transfiguration allows you to alter the physical environment, but Charms allow you to alter reality, even if only temporarily. Transfiguration may be the harder discipline, but Charms gives you a much larger arsenal for combat, medical, mundane usage and so forth.

They're both excellent fields and Masters/Mistresses in either can drop a world of hurt if necessary (remember how, in the film, EVERYBODY got out of the way when McGonnaggal drew her wand against Snape?) - but still, gotta give the upper hand to Charms.

** I think, while they might be pretty even, the charms master has the upper hand if they were to use the Dark Arts, especially fiendfyre and the killing curse, which I think both count as charms, even if they are fueled by malicious intention, seeing as fiendfyre destroys everything it touches while the killing curse literally kills a person with even a graze, assuming the caster was powerful enough. All the transfiguration and conjuration in the world isn't going to save you if you are hit by a killing curse, and fiendfyre is pretty damn powerful against anything physical. Still, if the transfiguration master were able to do something like Hashirama from Naruto could, then they could turn the table, but then again, I'm sure that could be negated if the charms master could pull a Madara or Tatsumaki by summoning a huge ass meteor out of the sky. Honestly it could go either way, depending on what you mean by mastery of charms or transfiguration, as each field, while conceptually simple, has a vast array of uses, especially in combat, from creating a tornado to conjuring an army of metal basilisks and on and on.

TLDR: Probably charms, assuming they can use the dark arts spells that could technically be classified as charms, otherwise fifty-fifty odds as the upper ceiling of ‘mastery' is largely undefined.

** Well it depends on who the experts in question are,if it was APWBD he would probably defeat almost any master of charms regardless of who it is as transfiguration allows him to alert the terrain of the battlefield to suit his own needs along with a ton of offensive spells,he is not called the greatest wizard since Merlin for no reason at all.He also was at his OWLS and NEWTS able to perform things in transfiguration that people over 5 times his age could not.And he only got better. However more genrically, a charms master would win due to versatility as charms includes the commonly studied charms but also enchantments,illusions,animation and a large amount of spells.hence in a case of combat of identical wizards who have similar thought process charms will win. But that is seldom the case,so it depends on the duellist's innovativeness and magical power,dexterity, regeneration rate among others. There is also several cases of lines blurring between the two fields and what one man may classify as transfiguration others would believe it is a charm. Hope my reasoning is valid.
