Then I saw that there was some kind of drama with the author and they said they are considering deleting all of their fanfics (deadwoodpecker). All I can say, is please don't.. like whatever happened, it doesn't matter. You're literally creating happiness by keeping your stories up, like I had taken a break from fanfic and then suddenly was addicted to your work.

Then I went to read yellow submarine this morning, and I saw it was gone. I would ask that you consider putting it back up!

On that note, did anyone happen to download it prior to it being taken down? I'm hoping someone on here can send it my way!

Thanks!!


** I took down most of my fic because when I started thinking about writing BWP, I decided that someone fairly cold, fairly humorless, unmarried (and don't care to be; I am only missing out on a double income), uninterested in sex except as curiosity, and riddled with anxiety couldn't do the story justice. So I did what I've done periodically throughout my life, and created a persona who could do it. Yes, it got out of hand, yes, it went too far, yes, I have talked about all of this with a therapist. Yes, I realize this was an awful thing to do. I can only say that there are only two or three people who actually get to claim legitimate grievances in all of this.

The problem is is that since I wasn't writing “as myself” it left me free to put some deep longings and personal things into my fanfic that if certain people read it, I'd be exposed in such a way that would literally drive crazy. So those had to be taken down. Bedroom scenes had to be taken down.

I am not going to name names, because I don't need to add further black marks, but this is no one's fault but mine, and the person who found all this stuff out did what she had to do. I just think I am a little less neurotypical than the regular cat fisher --- like, I wasn't trying to spy on someone I knew, or have sex with people, or anything. There was just an energy to crafting an entirely different persona, and writing as her, building an entire memory palace so that I could write stuff like the bedroom scenes and the falling in love bits.

Sorry this explanation is sort of all over the place.

*** Thanks for the reply - I know that a lot of people would agree that in the end, you have brought us all joy though your work. I hope that you consider continuing to write in the future - as yourself :) Because there is definitely talent there.

You ever need anything, just know that there is a community that will always be there to support.

***** Not a bad idea - I mean as long as you don't overcommit to it. Like others have said, people use pennames all the time to protect their identity. Just want you to stay healthy and like just make sure that if you do it, you are only doing it as a penname :) Like still be yourself, just use a different name if you want that identity protection.

And I wouldn't refer to it as a persona - just say penname. It's still you, don't forget that.

For the record, I thought you were one of the best HP erotica writers - "A Christmas Gift for Ginny" is one of my all-time favorites - but I can totally understand why the fact that you wrote those types of stories might not have been something you wanted the general public to know about if people were starting to learn your real-life identity. Best of luck out there.

*** Honestly, I'm quite confused why anybody would be bothered by something being posted under a different identity in the first place. People use pennames etc. all the time. It's not like there are actual people in the world called FluffyBunny57 or whatever. If using a different name makes you feel more comfortable, I don't see why it's anybody else's busniess. Hell, /J.K.Rowling/ did the same thing.
