In chapter three of Prince of the dark Kingdom, Harry speculates on what the Dursleys reaction would be if Dudley exhibited magical abilities and it got me thinking. I never read a fic where this happens, do any of y'all know of one?

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year.

** Whydoyouneedtoknow's Dangerverse has Dudley exhibit magical powers in the first book, and he's at Hogwarts in later books. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger]]
