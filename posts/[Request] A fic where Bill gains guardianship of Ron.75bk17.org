Hear me out: I love Ron Weasley. When I was younger I admit I read all sorts of bashing fics involving him but now I'm older and I look at his character and I feel there's so much that isn't explored with fanfic writers. I've read several Ron centric fics I could find and a favorite one made me think of this idea.

1. Ginny. We all know Molly wanted a girl desperately, and then she got one not long after having Ron. Mrs. Weasley loves all her children no doubt-but is it not logical to think about what Ron's childhood must've been like? All his brothers several years older than him, two who mercilessly pranked him, one who was distant and always in a book, and the other two way too old and busy. And his mother finally getting the girl she always wanted.

Ron was likely neglected. A lot. Not like Harry and the abusive Dursleys, but he was probably pushed aside a lot in favor of the others. And Molly well, she loves him but it's so many children and she finally gets the girl her priority isn't going to be him. And Arthur? A sweet man who takes his wife's side and tries to bond worth his sons but does have a hard time connecting.

1. Self esteem. Ron has shit self esteem. It comes out in his temper and jealousy but he thinks so little of himself. What 11 year old thinks I'll sacrifice myself in a chess game so the others who are with me can go ahead?? He's smart. I have no doubt Ron could've found a way to move ahead without hurting himself, but his own lack of self esteem and care about his own being stopped him.

2. Harry. Ron gets a best friend and suddenly all his family seems like they're more interested than him than their own blood. No wonder he gets so jealous! Youngest son who has to fight for attention amongst so many and his best friend gets it easily?

Which sorry for the rambling but-

Bill. The oldest. I want to see a fic where Bill pays attention to his baby brother because no one else will. Where he takes it upon himself to be the parental figure he needs and comforts him and sees all the issues in their family. And hogwarts happens and no one seems to freaking out over the fact Ron could've DIED. And I want him too freak out and explode and have Ron live with him.

I think a great time would be after 3rd year-but this is just my own idea and probably odd request so have it ealier or later.

I wouldn't want any Bashing at all, merely a strong look exploring Ron as a character who's a young boy and his relationship with his family and the effects it can have on a child.

-Molly and Arthur realizing they've made mistakes and taking the steps to correct them-bonding more with Ron, with Percy, not putting down the Twins' ideas etc.

-Bill being that overprotective big brother who considers locking Ron away in a tower with his two best friends because how the hell do these kids keep finding so much trouble???

There's a lot of angst and comedic potential that could be explored, and I hope whether or not this is ever filled someone can take inspiration.


** I can see Ron's mentality being, "why bother trying? Bill was Head Boy, Charlie was quidditch Captain, Percy's "Mr Perfect" and I don't want to be like him anyway, and the twins are the most notorious troublemakers ever. I can never stand out against any of that. Why bother?"

** I really like this idea! Another point: Ron is often perceived as lazy, but maybe nobody really cares enough to encourage him to do better? I think Ron has the potential of being smart, but he doesn't care because his brothers 'already did it before'. If Bill took him under his wing, I feel like Ron could thrive more academically.

*** This is a Really good point!! Percy has the best grades, and Bill and Charlie had to not have been slouches just look at their careers- And we see in the books Ron's cleverness and it takes brains to play chess and always win like he does. He has so much potential he simply doesn't believe-having someone focus only on him would be a big help.

** Push his birthday back just a couple of years, and Bill could be a father-so-young-let-my-parents-raise-him-as-my-brother to Ron. The fact of which is revealed at the start of the year due to some record keeping.

Ron figures out his new place in the family. His ambition is kindled by the fact that he is now an eldest son, but the harassment from his now uncles may be more than he can bear.

  On the train platform, Harry suffered a hug from Remus, a hair ruffle from Sirius, and a "don't do anything I wouldn't do" from his mother, and then he ran for the brick wall, cart rattling before him. The snowy owl they'd gotten him hooted softly in protest. Harry had named her Ororo after the Muggle comic books his mother had introduced him to. Lily took Harry to the comic store every time he sat through a whole visit with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and didn't kick anybody unless they kicked him first. Bill tried to wipe some dirt off a dodging Ron's nose. Ginny complained loudly about being left behind. Fred and George ran off to see Lee Jordan's spider. People watched the Weasleys from all directions--they were hard to miss--and Ron's shoulders slowly rose up and up to his reddening ears. He missed the big empty orchards behind the Burrow already. Ron was one of the last people on the train. He slid past staring eyes and finally stepped himself into an almost unoccupied compartment-- there was just one small boy tucked in there. He had messy dark hair, slightly askew round glasses, and a comic book held up in front of his nose. "Is it okay if I sit here?" said Ron. "Everywhere else is full."

** I would kill to read a story like that! I swear every 2nd story features Ron-bashing at this point.

I kinda wonder where the entire Ron! bashing thing even came from, or where it got popular. hell, I wonder how the whole weasly bashing cliche even came about. you know the one, where Molly is a "manipulative love potion drugging fiend", Percy is a slime ball, Ron is a "jealous twat", Ginny is a "gold digging slut" and Arthur is some meek man whos' balls are permanently kept in Molly's purse. and ofc the twins, Charlie and Bill can do no wrong in these fics.

It gets all very old very quickly If im honest, and it would be nice to have something different for a change.

**** I think Ron bashing came about from the films mostly. The writers dumbed him down a lot in the films and gave almost all his good qualities / parts to Hermione.

As for Ginny bashing. Im pretty sure that came about once Harry started showing an interest in her and some of the Harry/Hermione shippers started freaking out and trying to find ways to discredit Harry/Ginny in fanfiction.

I think the rest of the Weasley bashing just came naturally as an extension of that on Ron and Ginny, except for Molly who might have been a result of how she treated Sirius in OotP and how she tried to keep Harry out of Order business which pissed some people off.

** I'd absolutely love to read a fic like that. Ron is such an undervalued and under appreciated character and I've never really understood why. Especially since I've always found him to be a very relatable character since he's not the "hero" or the "smart one"; instead, in his mind, he's glory-adjacent and that's a tough spot to be in as no one likes to be seen as "average" or lacking in some respect.

I've always wondered too if the neglect that Ron received, while nowhere near the level of neglect and abuse Harry received, was one of the reasons why they became such fast and close friends. Maybe he saw a kindred spirit in Harry after a while and that's why, when Harry received attention (good or bad), it was so hard for him to handle as that meant that a.) they weren't in the same boat anymore and b.) he was so starved for attention that he couldn't immediately recognize that not all attention was good attention...if that makes sense?

Also, re: Bill; I think he'd be a perfect character to potentially help Ron (and the whole family). Not only would he be familiar with the family dynamics (obviously), he'd also probably be the best person to have some perspective on the situation as a whole since he's been away from the day-to-day grind of the household and would likely be able to see where things were starting to go/had already gone sideways. Also, as the eldest, I could see where he might feel it's his responsibility/duty to try to do something about it.

Charlie, too, could potentially be a good candidate but I see Bill having more freedom with his job as it seems like Charlie is tied to the dragon preserve he's working at almost exclusively.
