Essentially it's as the title says. Whether Harry truly isn't the BWL, or just isn't believed to be the in favor of a sibling, most fics I've found in this direction end with him entering Slytherin and becoming friends with Draco and/or the rest of his Slytherin year-mates.

That's all and well, but I do want to see other variations on the 'wrong-BWL' trope than Harry just seeing the Snake Den. Whether dealing with the turmoil that'll be Griffindor, or the often-overlooked Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, does anyone have a fic where Harry isn't (believed to be) the BWL, but doesn't end up in Slytherin or best mates with the Snake Group?

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

*** Huh; haven't heard of this one before.

And yea, fem!Harry works; it just doesn't tend to overlap with the 'wrong Chosen One' trope enough - as far as I've encountered it - for me to have remembered to say so.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
