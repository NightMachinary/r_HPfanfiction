So I was recommended this story on this subreddit, have just finished, and enjoyed it so much I thought I'd leave a review of it here.

​

*The Writing*

It's difficult to overstate the quality of the writing of this story. Annerb is not J.K Rowling - None of the mystery and foreshadowing and surprise reveals that we see in canon, but a highly intelligent, well-considered build up of plot that tackles much more complicated concepts than the original series. Despite its darkness, I suspect it leaves out anything to do with sex for the rating largely, but it otherwise does not balk from the adult implications of the things that happen to the kids whilst a war carries on outside. It was a brilliant, brilliant execution of an excellent idea. Keeping the bulk of canon the same whilst putting Ginny in Slytherin kind of brings the Deathly Hallows full circle in the way it should have done canonically.

For all that J.K wrote about how house unity was vital in keeping external threats out of Hogwarts, it really turned into "unity for everyone except the people we don't like". A clear line between Slytherin and everyone else, as Ginny so succinctly put it in the text. There /should/ have been four sets of banners in the Room of Requirement, not three. There /should/ have been Slytherin students who stayed to fight, not all of them being dismissed from the school like a contaminated group because of one girl's dissent. There /should/ have been a point at which Harry realised the value of the skills possessed by members of Slytherin house, and not had his entire life defined by demonising the few students in it who made his life harder. By making Ginny Weasley a Slytherin, it tied these missing elements into the story seamlessly.

​

I feel like this fic was seeded by the idea of rewriting the Deathly Hallows book, but needed 6 years of prefacing to give context and development to the force of nature that Ginny becomes by the time we get to the Battle of Hogwarts. And she does it extremely well. I was starting to think that Ginny had become a bit OP towards the end, but the care put into her development was so well executed that it fit really well. This story does technically tell Ginny's entire time at Hogwarts, but Deathly Hallows takes up fully half of the total text by itself.

​

*The Parlour & Ginny's Slytherin friends*

The Parlour was a great idea - this secret place where girls of ambition could take refuge and build each other up. It's a very positive concept which could only ever have really popped up in Slytherin, and it was a good addition. Annerb should have written more about it. Especially in Ginny's earlier years, it felt like this was written in as a side idea, this sisterhood that touched Ginny but not in any truly significant way. What did feel significant were the characters Theodora and Antonia, and I fully understood the intense draw Ginny felt towards these girls; these deadly, powerful women who honed Ginny into a more complex, careful, and less judgmental person. But there was little that made me feel Ginny's connection to the concept of the Parlour itself, or the other girls in it. I wanted it to feel like something precious, worth protecting, but in the end I only really felt this way about the books contained in the secret library.

This might be the overall biggest weakness of the story, is Ginny's lack of connection with anyone at all. Throughout the story, no one ever becomes close to Ginny. There are people who touch her, but she relies on no one at all, confides in no one. I didn't feel the loss of Smita from the story, or even Ginny's sadness at their drifting apart, because it felt like the friendship between them was always so guarded that there was little to lose by the fallout. The same is true of the friends Ginny loses in the battle. These characters are vaguely likable, but we are not deeply connected to them because Ginny isn't, and where the character deaths Harry experiences in canon were often gut wrenching, I felt little to no sadness about the deaths in Changeling.

​

*Harry/Ginny & sexuality*

Harry's relationship with Ginny makes more sense in this fic than it did to me in canon. I will happily read H/G but am not a shipper of this couple. I'm fairly sure the author is though, if her other HP fics are any indication, but she made an interesting criticism within the fic of the H/G dynamic in canon, when Ginny speculates that if she had been sorted into Gryffindor then she might never have stopped looking at Harry as The Boy Who Lived, but continually idolised him and kept him on a pedestal. Personally I agree with this notion, and prefer this version of Ginny who can take a critical step back and looks at him as a person.

To make this version work though, I feel like the author had to give Harry a little more patience and perspective than canon Harry had in order to make him even attempt to see eye to eye with a Slytherin Ginny. This was still an aspect to the story I appreciated - canon Harry frustrates me with his single-mindedness at times, and it's more believable that he would make an effort to understand a Slytherin because it was Ginny Weasley, and not someone he didn't have that family connection to. However, there also seemed to be little reason on Ginny's end to fall in love with Harry. As with everyone else, Ginny never depended on Harry for anything significant, let alone emotional support. He opened up to her, but not she to him.

Generally, Ginny's sexuality was a long, long way in the background. Getting into her teens, she doesn't once seem to get a crush on anyone, her relationship with Thompson was literally a case of "he's here and why not?", but it's quite apparent that she doesn't seem to have any romantic feelings about him. Which is fine in itself, this happens often in teenage relationships, but Ginny doesn't really show any indication of any kind of feelings like that for anyone else either. Her feelings for Harry start popping up late in the game, and even then they only seem to be in response to Harry's growing interest in her. I do understand though, that this fic was highly plot-centered and less relationship centered, so although I would have liked to have seen more of Ginny's developing sexuality, I can sort of understand why it took an innocuous back seat.

​

*Occlumency/Legillimency*

I personally really, really liked the 'Snape teaches Ginny legillimency' subplot. I liked the mechanics of how legillimency and occlumency worked - the difficulty of allowing someone access to your mind whilst leading them to false conclusions, rather than throwing up barriers which showed the game was up. I liked the moral murkiness of Ginny practicing on unwilling and unsuspecting students. I liked her desperation and dedication to learning this skill that Harry always dismissed.

I do wish that this subplot had more payoff than it did. Whilst I liked how she subverted Justine infiltrating the DA, this seems like an isolated incident and we don't really see any other examples of Ginny ever putting it into practice when it matters. I also wished we'd understood better what it is that Ginny does when she takes coaching from Nymue about keeping her mind separate from the person whose mind she is invading. It sounds as though Snape's advice is simply a heartbreaking culmination of all he is - brutal detachment, self-denial and a lack of any kind of empathy, and that this is the only way he knows. The conversation with Nymue indicates that this isn't the only way to successfully perform legillimency, but the alternative that helps Ginny is only vaguely described later, and sort of seems to bleed back into pretty much the same thing Snape was describing anyway.

​

*Snape and Ginny*

Now Snape. I like the time the author took to allow us to see another side of Snape, still canonically believable but not the same Snape that Harry sees. The blatant favouritism and the callousness is still there, but so is the evidence of how brilliantly he rides the line of Voldemort's enforcer at Hogwarts whilst subverting the Carrows and doing what he can to protect the students. So too is the deep intelligence of the man who learned to control mind magic so well that Voldemort never once suspected him.

What was a little bit unexpected was the sexual tension between Ginny and Snape, even if it was one-sided. It's interesting, because people who strongly ship Harry/Ginny will usually vehemently deny that Ginny has any resemblance to Harry's mother, but this is not the first H/G fic I've read which incorporates this idea of Snape looking at Ginny and seeing Lily. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]] is another highly recommended, well-written, canon compliant fanfiction which mentions it. Personally I think adding this element takes away from the argument for Harry/Ginny, but objectively I like it as a creative tidbit to add depth and complexity to the character relationships. I am not a Snape shipper, but these scenes occasionally made me curious about what would happen if the author had made it go further, which I am kind of impressed by.

​

*Characterisation*

Whilst I think Annerb's writing of original characters was a little weak (contextually, they're actually very good compared to most fanfiction), I cannot fault her characterisation of existing canon characters. There were no moments at all when I looked at an interaction between Ginny and another canon character and was taken out of the moment, or realised that this was an author's rendition of that character rather than the character themselves. Snape, McGonagall, Dumbledore, Neville, Luna and Draco were all spot on. Luna is hard to get right and I was really impressed at how organically she wrote not just Luna but the development of Ginny's friendship with her. There were also canon characters she fleshed out extremely well - particularly Terry Boot and Hannah Abbott. I am a Ravenclaw myself and could see 100% that Terry is a wonderful Ravenclaw weirdo.

What I think was by far my favourite aspect of this fic was the deep psychological dive we took into Slytherin morality and thinking, and how well it draws us in to see through the eyes of Slytherin characters without needing to drag the other houses down - much. The Slytherin view of Gryffindor's recklessness is pretty well substantiated by the canon text, and whilst I don't think it undermines the heroism displayed by the Gryffindors (as many pro-Slytherin fics are wont to do), it does go a long way towards validating how this is not the only way to make a difference and be brave.

​

*Overall*

I don't have an official ranking system for fics, but if I did this would likely make the top 5. It hooked me in so well that I lost sleep trying to get it finished. Once it gained steam it was one of those unputdownable stories, and I would highly recommend it to pretty much anyone, whether you enjoyed canon or no. I do think that whilst the events of the story are not much darker than canon and rating-wise this would be suitable for young readers, I believe it would be better enjoyed by mature readers. Ginny's internal struggles are rarely laid out plain the way Harry's are - Annerb expects the reader to figure some things out for themselves, and is more complicated and subtle than most published YA literature out there.

Thanks for the recommendation reddit, this was a great experience!


** That's an excellent, detailed review. And I don't disagree with any of it.

I didn't find it as compelling as you did mainly because of the point you described as possibly the overall biggest weakness of the story: "Ginny's lack of connection with anyone at all." For me it led to a story that, while enjoyable, didn't have me champing at the bit to find out what happened next.

Definitely one of the better stories out there though.

** I actually love Annerb's work, but The Changeling just annoys me. I think because it's so close to cannon that it's like a tease of what a powerful/Independent! Ginny would look like. But it's not cannon Ginny, not at all.

That, and the sequels have too much contrived angst in them.

*** The general feedback I've been getting from the comments is that I'll probably have a more satisfying experience if I just leave it at Changeling and don't read the sequels. I didn't actually know it had sequels until I posted my review here, but I think I might move on to other fics rather than stay in this universe. Thanks for your comments :)
