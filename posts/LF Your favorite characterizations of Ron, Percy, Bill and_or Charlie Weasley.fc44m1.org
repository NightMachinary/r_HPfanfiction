It can be one, two or all four characters. They can be major or minor characters. One of them can be the main character or not.

Not exactly looking for shipping, but am fine with het/slash/femslash. No incest.

No Lord, Harem Harry.

Characters stronger or more powerful than in canon is fine but make it believable.

Can be on any site, would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

It can be drabbles, oneshots or longer.


** I really like 'Dear Mum' which is a story made up of letters written to Molly Weasley from various members of her family. Set in Ron's first year at Hogwarts. The style of each letter really seems to reflect the character of each person, and it's amusing to read.

** linkao3(Percy Take the Wheel).

This has my favorite characterization of Percy Weasley, and I think it's cool to see Ron from the perspective of an older brother, which makes him seem so much younger than he seems from Harry's perspective.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.
