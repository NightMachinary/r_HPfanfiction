In many ways, the story of Merope Gaunt begins just as you would remember it. The only daughter of the destitute Gaunt family and one of the last living descendants of Salazar Slytherin. She was abused by her father and brother, fell for a dashing Muggle nobleman, bewitched him with a love potion, fell pregnant with his child and was left alone and penniless when the time came for her to give birth.

The matrons of Wool's Orphanage were reluctant to take in the tramp girl going into labour, and even less enthused to bring her child into the world. She could feel this but she was slipping away, falling into deaths embrace. But the image of their faces twisting in such an odd and malicious way as they cast her baby aside, and the sound of her newborn's cries abruptly falling silent was enough to relight the fire that she had long since cast away. Her magic returned, burning to life and allowing her to return in time to find the broken mess that was her newborn. The matrons standing over it drenched in red.

They died, the orphanage burnt and Merope was left to sob over the body of her baby. That is how Gellert Grindelwald "found" her.

He took her in, whisked her away to Nuremgard castle. He trained her, taught her and moulded her bitterness into an unending hatred of muggles. She was a fast study, monumentally powerful and more than willing (at first) to follow his orders and see his dreams come to fruition.

But only after she'd claim hers...

Some years had passed when she returned to Knockturn Alley. Burke was still in possession of her locket, dying the day she came to retrieve it.

She moved on to Azkaban. Waltzing unhindered into the tower, simply to ensure the slow and painful death of her father. Leaving with just as much ease as prior, no one to ever know she had been. Her final stop? Little Hangleton.

She slew her brother and (as she had done with her victims prior) using his death as a sacrifice in a ritual to grant her beauty and greater magical power, all that she had graved as the downtrodden skank within their dingy cottage. It no longer stood after the deed, a fitting grave for the last of the Gaunts...

Then, at last, she turned her attention to them. The Riddle's.

She captured them all during an event, a gala of sorts. Celebrating some Muggle holiday with the proceeds whisked away to some irrelevant charity. 'How noble!' 'How generous!' The Lord and Ladies of the manor gushing over the sons perfectly planned event as hundreds milled about the elegant halls of their stately home. A home Merope infiltrated with the right dress and the fluttering of eyelashes.

She held Tom Riddle Snr aloft after ensnaring the guests. Aloof outwardly but filled with a Dark giddiness as she delivered a soft, "Imperio." And turned the guests on his pitiful wife, parents and child...

Of course she made him watch, witness in shrieking horror at the unspeakable things laid down upon his family by the esteemed, yet glassy eyed, guests he'd invited. Shrieking and cursing in anguish as his loved ones own were snuffed out. One. By. One.

He daren't look at her, but absently knew her eyes never left him. The tramp girl he had belittled and abandoned. A girl he had only vaguelly recognised after he'd been tricked into her embrace once again, this time with the same snares he had for her. Dashing good looks and smooth words...

Only when there was nothing of them left to recognise did she come for him. Far too gone to offer even a vocal challenge to her. The senior Tom Riddle gone in a flash of green...

His death trapping a half of her soul into the reclaimed locket; she burnt the Riddle Mansion to the ground. By the time the Auror's responded and were able to stop the blaze of Fiendfyre, Little Hangleton was gone. As gone as the peasant girl Merope Gaunt.

She answered only to Voldemort now...

** Voldemort is bad and stupid French.

If Merope wants a better name, she might as well call herself Lady Slytherin.

But otherwise, interesting premise.
