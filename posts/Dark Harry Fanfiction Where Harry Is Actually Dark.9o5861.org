What I've seen of a 'dark' Harry in fanfiction so far would be either an intelligent Harry, Harry with a connection to Voldemort, or Harry using Avada Kedavra once. What I want is a Harry that uses Dark spells and rituals, necromancy, sacrifice, mind control, that kind of thing. The closest thing I've seen was a FSN fanfiction's sequel, Limitless Eternity, where the MC sacrificed thousands for a magic boost. Once.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]] - James puts a charm on Harry to try and push him toward good choices, but what magic considers good and what a human considers good are very different. Harry is supremely pragmatic and willing to hurt people and use dark magic in order to get what he wants. Sensible, sane dark!Harry.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

*** Antithesis is AMAZING! I think it is one of the best fanfictions around. It is still updating, but only has like 4 more chapters to go and the author is very consistent. In the story abuse affects a person, Harry also isn't just an angsty ball of attempted badassery. It does have a lot of angst, but it is well written.

It doesn't help that Death seems to be a bit of a prick... and what's this about me being sent back in time? OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the End of War) Its part of a 6-piece series from year 1, that shows the descent from abused, but "good" to as bad as Voldemort. Its really, really reallyyyy fucking good, and its the only mentor!Voldy with a darkHarry that I've enjoyed. Don't think this has a good Harry underneath, he's really fucked up and does soooo much fucked up things, the worst for me was the Diggle family scene.

It's a crossover between Harry Potter and The Addams family and if you know anything about them, they are gleefully dark. It still manages to be heartwarming too, much like The Addams Family itself.

The setting is HP with Harry adopted by TAF, going to Hogwarts as usual.

** I recommend the Black Queen series by Silently Watches. While Harry is substituted for the main character of Jen Black, it ticks all the other boxes. Especially Necromancy and mind control. She worships the literal incarnation of Death, Baron Samedi and uses a mind control curse later on in the series.
