Hi. I have 2 ideas for fan fiction stories that I need to get out of my head. I've written and published the ideas at fanfiction.net but I would like for real fan fiction writers to write full stories for both of them. I lack both the time and the ability (english is not my first language) to write them myself, and I figured someone else might like the ideas and write about them. The ideas are:

*1)* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12280510/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Grand-Tour][Harry Potter and the Grand Tour]] - 1 year has passed since the Battle of Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, Ginny and Hermione are getting ready for the traditional wizard 1 year long trip around the world, the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Grand_Tour][Grand Tour]].

*2)* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12280638/1/Alex-Malfoy-and-the-Staff-of-Avalon][Alex Malfoy and the Staff of Avalon]] - It is the year 2050 on a dystopian UK and 14 years have passed since a devastating war between muggles and wizards. Muggles have won and magic is now forbidden in the UK. But everything will change when the orphaned Alexander Malfoy is found by Harry Potter, now a 70 y.o. wizard with a long black beard, who trains him and introduces him to a resistance that will forever change the fate of magic.

Anyway, please chek them out if you can and tell me what you think. I'd be happy to hear advice. Thanks!

EDIT: Check the links for the posts at fanfiction.net!


** I like the Grand Tour idea.

Though one thing: It is very bad Karma to misspell names of core characters and places.

Hermione *NOT* Hermionie

The Burrow *NOT* The Barrow

*** Oh well fuck. I can't believe I made that mistake. I have to edit both articles. Hope everyone reads that that english is not my first language. I do not understand why are names traduced. Thanks for the heads up!

** These both sound really good! I rarely see any Harry as an old man stories. And the gap year idea is cool too!

*** Thanks man. I thought that Harry and Alex might draw a nice parallel with Merlin and Arthur, Gandalf and Bilbo, Dumbldore and Harry, Obi-wan and Luke, etc. Espacially the story would have strong Star Wars vibes.
