Hey guys,

I just made this [[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/]]

A website which has a record of over 70k+ fanfic recommendations done in this subreddit.

As of now, it has the following categories:

- Latest (1000 recommendations)
- Stories

  - This Week (TOP 100)
  - This Month (TOP 100 )
  - This Year (TOP 100 )
  - All Time (TOP 100 )

- Authors

  - This Week (TOP 100)
  - This Month (TOP 100 )
  - This Year (TOP 100 )
  - All Time (TOP 100 )

​

Metadata such as fic length, genre, status etc isn't available right now, but I am planning on adding them soon. (I am still deciding on the best way to get that)

​

I am hoping to get a script running on a server within a few days that will update this site once a day.

​

I know it's missing a lot of desirable stuff but you should suggest more anyways.

​

Is there any other subreddit that I should cross-post this to?

*Edit 10/7/2019* I have added metadata for most of the stories. It will get refreshed on every site update. The data is from [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]] comments, so a story will only get refreshed if it's linked. The front-end needs some work on design, especially on mobile, but it should work

I am planning on adding some sort of filter mechanism next.

*Edit 11/7/2019* I have added some basic filters (words, genre, rating and status). Also, to accommodate the reduced number of stories due to filtering and requests by some users, I have also increased the number of stories from 100 to 1000. Also, there is a new update section which will list all new stuff (a formalish version of my edits on this post)

P.S: Should I make a new post to inform everyone of the new stuff? Can I do that? MODS??

Keep supporting and sharing, thanks

** This is pretty cool. It's interesting to scroll through some of the top 100 listings and realize: "hey I haven't seen that one recommended in awhile." or "WTF is this?! I've never even heard of it!" because it used to be popular to rec but not anymore.

Thanks [[/u/dJones176][u/dJones176]] :) !
