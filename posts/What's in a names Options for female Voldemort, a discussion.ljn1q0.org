** Amy Marvolto Riddle. Perfect anagram for "I am Lady Voldemort". Amy is a common name, which is important for Voldemort's backstory and Marvolto sounds like the kinda name the Gaunts would give their daughter.

Not mine.

** Voldemort was named after his Muggle father, hence the common name Tom. But if he was born a girl, I don't think his mother would named him something as common or even modern as Emily or even Margaret, even if I find both very pretty. We can't forget that his mother is a Gaunt, a young woman descendent from a long line of purebloods and even Salazar himself, and even though they are very poor and inbred themself until they were crazy and probably more squib than wizards/witches, I don't think they are very aware of the Muggles and names they give each other. If you look at the typical pureblood names they are often very old fashioned and unique, just look at the Gaunts themselves: Merope, Marvolo, Morfin --- the names are not exactly what we think are „normal“. Merope named Voldemort after his very muggle father and her own father, who wasn't exactly the nicest of chaps. I think if she had a girl, she would have named her after a wizarding relative of hers, maybe even her own mother, who we know nothing about. (But given what we know about the Gaunt and their inbreeding I could guess it was a sister/cousin of Marvolos and has a similar „proper“ wizarding name.)

** Since Merope is one of the Seven Sisters in the Pleiades, the female Voldemort could very well have a Greek name too.

So Hermione?

This Voldemort would hate Hermione Granger, or love her?

** The name Emily mean ‘rival', among other meanings. That is probably one of the reasons it is popular in fem!Voldemort fics.

‘Thomas' means ‘twin'.

***** Must be why fanfic often shows the family named Weasley are untrustworthy, the one named Harry (a nickname for Henry) is kingly, the one named Draco is as feared as dragon, the family named Granger are farmers, and the Longbottoms grow pipe-weed but have trouble finding pants that fit.

****** Harry is literally the one who ends up with the power that no one else has. He's the Arthurian-type figure in the story. He gathers people to him and leads them through trials. So yeah, pretty kingly really.

Ronald means ‘advisor'.

Hermione means ‘messenger, bringer of wisdom'.

Do you really think these names were chosen by coincidence, by the same woman who names things far less subtly ‘Privet Drive' and ‘Grimauld Place'?

******* *Remus Lupin* the werewolf - Remus (and Romulus) were the supposed founders of roam, raised by wolves (Lupine means wolfish).

*Sirius Black* the dog animagus (Sirius is Canis Major or the Dog Star).

*Alastor Moody* - Alastor is greek for 'Defender of Men'.

etc.

Yeah, loads of referential names sprinkled throughout the series. I like the idea of a tradition in Wizard society of using Divination to help name your children, which is why we end up with so many names that reflect peoples' personality and fate.

** I read a fic that had a fem!Voldemort named Tamsin, and that has automatically become my favourite choice.

I mean, it stands because Merope would still try to name her child after her father, and Tamsin is (correct me if I'm wrong) the female version of Tom, and a name that is native to the UK.

** I feel like most, if not all, fem!Voldemort fanfics redeem her in some way. So, you have to keep in mind that the name must reflect her "good" side I guess and thats why I like Emily.

It isn't a name you would give to an evil mastermind, but to a misunderstood girl perhaps.

The fitting nature of the name Emily, to me, comes exactly from its perceived innocence.
