Another underutilized character that deserves a badass moment!

It's fun to charter an accountant,

And sail the wide accountan-cy.

To find, explore the funds offshore,

And skirt the shoals of bankruptcy.


** Linkffn(molly weasley and the second cousin by zebjeb) is the most badass second cousin I've seen, explains why molly never introduced him to the rest of her family and has been my headcanon since I discovered it

  Molly's children do not know much about her second cousin, besides him being an accountant or something. She has a good reason to keep her family in the dark.

** It can be manly in insurance

We'll up your premium semi-annually,

It's all tax deductible,

We're fairly incorruptible

Sailing on the wide accountan-cy!
