** A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles linkffn(7937889)

Note that it's Snape centric and, while from his actions it's still quite clear Snape is a shitty person, since it's written from his perspective all his shitty actions are justified one way or another.

In any case the story has several chapters describing Snape's time as a Death Eater/a spy for the Order. He interacts with several Death Eaters and they all have their own personalities. For e.g. he develops a genuine friendship with Yaxley, he hates Mulciber and Evan Rosier to the point he sets them up to be killed by Moody, the Lestranges bully him into joining the Death Eaters and he has little if any control over the Carrows during the events in DH.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
