Like, think about it. you couldn't duel anyone, for fear that some random person has a wand with a hair from the same unicorn, or a heartstring from the same dragon! Phoenixes are rare, which should only make this even more common with wands containing their feathers! Fawkes may have only given two feathers, but there must be more domestic phoenixes out there for all those ollivander wands, and many of these must be brother ones.

And unicorns! have you seen how many hairs horses have in their mane or tail? there must be like a hundred wands all brothers to eachother.


** I doubt Olivander uses hundreds of hairs from the same animal - he wands different wands which fit their owners and if he makes several wands using the exact same material he'll get less unique wands which will fit fewer people I'd assume

*** There's also the fact that the likelyhood of your wand-brother/sister being an enemy AND you duelling them is very small.

**** I agree. But I also think that when using/searching for wand cores, in order for a "brother/sister" wand to be created, they have to be extracted/retrieved at the same time. From what I understand - or at least HC - is that when making a wand, you only retrieve what is needed for that wand.

Basically, no wholesale orders of cores are available.

But cores are also used for Potions ingredients in which case, we can only assume the ingredients will spoil or, at least have a different effect after they've been purchased. We don't technically know the shelf life for these things so it's fun to HC that, just like food, magical cores and ingredients will spoil and or, have negative effects when used after a certain amount of time...(Though, due to the school list, we can assume most ingredients last a whole school year.

****** Nah, just wondering. Really, I think the question of how common Priori Incantatem can be answered by how many cores does a typical animal get harvested for (which, of course, is a detail neglected by canon).

I personally think that Ollivander has procurement contracts with a bunch of different suppliers and only makes a few wands out of each animal to better diversify his wand inventory, with the rest of the heart strings, feathers, hairs, etc taken from an animal are sold to potions manufacturers.

** A mitigating factor of /Priori Incantatem/ is it appears that the actual spell effects need to hit each other in order to trigger the effect. So you not only need to have two wizards dueling each other. They need to have wands of the same core type, from the same animal. They need to be using a targeted spell effect at the exact same time and they must be skilled enough to both bullseye.

If it was a common effect you'd expect Voldemort to know what was happening, and he appeared to be as confused as Harry in the graveyard.

That said the spell, rather than the effect, doesn't appear to be all that rare. If I'm not mistaken it was Amos Diggory that used the spell on Harry's wand at the World Cup. Amos, if I remember right, worked with creature regulations and most creatures don't use wands so it wouldn't be something he would be expected to use all the time, unlike Aurors.

I'd expect a better analogy would be sequential serial numbers.

My head canon is that Brother Wands would probably be not just same core, but adjacent wood from the same billet, same batch of glue, with those components also similarly blended, completed by the same maker, sequentially, etc.

** There's a fanon interpretation where the effect doesn't occur with Unicorn tail hair/dragon heartstrings because those cores could require being woven together from the raw materials from multiple animals. I'm also a fan of the fanon interpretation where brother wand cores require not just coming from the same magical beast, but at the same time/aren't guaranteed in the harvesting process.

But I think the points about the general lack of circumstances where you'd be hitting someone else's spell with your own, and it being common enough to be recognized, are fair points. Ollivander supposedly only uses three types of cores.

** One possible explanation is that the behavior is different if neither of the wands has preformed the killing curse. Like maybe without that you do get some effect but not the exact same one?

Either because it isn't noticable (you get different light show when the spells clash but nothing to stop the duel) or it is noticable but different enough Voldemort didn't recognize it. (Maybe the effect causes the ten previously used spells to shoot out in random directions but no light cage or wand connection)

Since the killing curse is (supposedly) rarely used, it would make sense this combination is not well known.

Edit: It has been a while since I read the scene, I don't recall if Voldemort's surprise was at the wand connection or the phantoms. It could be he recognized the connection (and thus ordered his death eaters to not interfere) but didn't expect the killing curse ghosts.

** It's time for MATH!

Okay, so, estimates of wizarding population vary wildly and I'm not getting into that. The number I'm going to be using is 20,000 wizards in Magical Britatin (1000 hogwarts students representing 1/20 of the gen pop). This means that, on average, Olivander is selling (and thus presumably making) at least 143 wands a year. If he makes something more like one wand a day and keeps normal work days then he'd be making more, about 250, but that would be a big surplus, so call it an even 200 (this makes sense since he has to collect supplies too, as well as man the counter for a few weeks each year).

I'm not sure how many heart strings a dragon has, but it's probably at least 10. Unicorn's have lots of tail hair and Phoenixes have lots of feathers (although, thinking about it for a second, holy shit how many phoenixes are their in the UK that something like 1/3 of all the wands there, 66 per year, can be made with them? Fawkes only donated 2!) so this matters less. If we assume Ollivander uses all three wand core types equally then about 66 wands of each core type are produced. Call it ten wands with the same dragon core, and god only knows how many for the others. I would guess Ollivander takes something like an equal amount of tail hairs and feathers usually, so wands are being made in sets of ~10 wands with the same animal for a core each year.

BUT

Ollivander doesn't sell them all at the same time! It makes sense that he crafts them all more or less together, he doesn't just leave the dragon heartstrings sitting for years before using them, but then that wand might sit for years in his shop until someone matches it! By a similar measure however, tail hair and phoenix feathers don't kill their hosts to produce. Horses live ~30 years, unicorns are presumably similarish, which means Ollivander could potentially have as many as 300 wands made with the same unicorn's tail hairs. This seems a little unlikely imo, because wands seem to be very bespoke, Ollivander seems like the kind of guy that tries to collect from a very wide number of animals to get a wide variety of wands and ensure a good fit. Not just unicorn and beech wood, but a specific unicorn and a specific beech tree.

In summary: it might actually be pretty common in the worst case scenario; but it is also possible the person using the same wand core as you died a century ago, or that you were simply never in a pitched death battle with them.

*** What is this connected to?

Fawkes is one phoenix, but he only gave two feathers in recent memory.

Therefore, for the other phoenix feather wands (ollivander would not say "we use phoenix feathers" if he only had one such wand in his entire shop), other phoenixes are needed. they are rare creatures, rarer than dragons and unicorns, meaning any wands made of their feathers would have a much greater chance of being brother ones.

Think of it like this:

Let's say there are three phoenixes, seven dragons and thirteen unicorns, alongside twelve witches and eleven wizards. nontheless, ollivander makes twenty-three wands with an equal ratio of all three cores - meaning that all the phoenix cores, dragon cores and unicorn cores came from those twenty-three animals. one unicorn may have not given any hair, and one may have given two, but the phoenixes would either all have to give multiple feathers or one of them many, many more, meaning there's a much greater chance of phoenix wands being brothers than the other types.

Well, to be fair, we don't /exactly/ know the makeup of his shop's inventory - the majority of the wand cores that we're told in canon are dragon or unicorn based. A check online indicates 10 dragon heartstrings, 9 unicorn hairs, and 4 Phoenix feather ones - 2 of those being Harry and Voldemort, and the other 2 from extended sources (whereas all 19 dragon/unicorn ones seem to be from the main series).

From that at least, I would imagine that Phoenix feathers, though used, are rather rare in wands - so feasibly, Ollivander /could/ have 1-2 wands from a half dozen different Phoenixes. Or at least there's the /potential/ for that to be the case ;)
