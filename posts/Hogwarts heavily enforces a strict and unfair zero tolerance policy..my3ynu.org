** So either Draco gets sent home within a week or anyone caught trying to stand up to his bullying is tossed out on their ass because of bullshit.

If the latter, Harry is wondering why he even bothered getting his hopes up as Hogwarts seems to be more of the same as the Dursleys, only with magic.

** Zero tolerance on what?

The Harry is out after the first Flying class or the first hogwarts game when he uses his own flying broom. After all the rules says no first year allowed to bring their own brooms.
