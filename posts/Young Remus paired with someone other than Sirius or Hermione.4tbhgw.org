I'm looking for Marauder-era fics where Remus is in a relationship, but I'm already tired of all sirius/remus stories, aswell as the time-travelling hermione/remus stories.

It can be anything really, be it remus/lily, remus/james, remus/time-travelling harry, hell, even remus/older remus would be okay if written decently. Just give me something I haven't read a thousand times yet, please?

  12 steps. 12 steps, and you can cure alcoholism, sex addiction, a love of coke, an uncontrollable rage or that hatred within yourself. 12 steps and you can dance in reverse, fall apart and watch the carefully constructed fabric of your life unravel.
