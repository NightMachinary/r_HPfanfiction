** Lyrics:

Out of the darkness we will rise,

into the light we will dwell,

we came to rule the world with muse in arms

we are the clouds in the sky,

we are the storm and the tides

we are the wind and the rain,

the sun and the moon and the end of all time

We are the gods of the new world order,

we are the soldiers, the legion of light!

We are the center, the death of the sun,

fire and flame, we are one!

We are the gods of the new world order,

we are the soldiers, the legion of light!

We are the center, the death of the sun,

fire and flame, we are one!

Out of the darkness we will rise,

into the light we will dwell,

we came to burn the earth with muse in arms

we are the source of all sin,

we are the stars in the sky,

death and rebirth in the line,

the sun and the moon and the end of of all time!

We are the gods of the new world order,

we are the soldiers, the legion of light!

We are the center, the death of the sun,

fire and flame, we are one!

We are the gods of the new world order,

we are the soldiers, the legion of light!

We are the center, the death of the sun,

fire and flame, we are one!
