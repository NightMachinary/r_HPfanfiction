Harry tried his very best to get free from the manipulations of Dumbledore. Unfortunately it was just impossible - maybe it would be easier if the guy wasn't dead (Harry didn't even know how Dumbledore kept manipulating him after death).

He had mastered the best and worst of magics, joined the Wizengamot gaining the Potter and Black Seats and even learned Occlumency which should have impossible for him.

He had researched even more into Horcruxes, the Dark Magic even Dark Lords feared. He had found out ways to extract Horcruxes from living vessels without killing them, found out ways to create Horcruxes with minimal sacrifice, found ways that even Riddle hadn't dared to tread into.

He had cleansed the Ministry and Wizengamot of Death Eater sympathizers and made it impossible for Death Eaters to rise again - yet it felt as if it was Dumbledore's will.

He had implemented ways to make the Muggleborn integration into Hogwarts smoother and removed the monopoly of the Purebloods in the Wizarding World. Yet it seemed like Dumbledore's will.

Still no matter how much he learned, no matter how much good he did - it always felt that he was Dumbledore's puppet.

He had learned the deepest of Dark Arts to spite Dumbledore, yet he found out that Voldemort was mistaken on the nature of Horcruxes. Dumbledore was probably smiling wherever he was.

No matter what he did, the vision of the white bearded bastard puppeting him never disappeared. Ginny's affection, Ron and Hermione's friendship, Susan Bones's likemindedness, nothing helped.

And so, he decided to use a ritual to go away. A world where Dumbledore wouldn't haunt him anymore. A world where Harry would never have these nightmares.

After making a will and entrusting his assets, Harry Potter went to a Saint Mungos and used forbidden magical arts to grant health to the patients at the cost of his own.

A art fragmenting the soul for immortality, a art requiring sacrifice. Harry imagined Riddle's face if he knew the true method of creating Horcruxes.

And as his life disappeared, the his pure soul with his consciousness bound by the ritual disappeared to awaken again in a similar yet different world.

Awakening in the new world, he found himself facing familiar sights. His mother and father. There was also the twin of his, Ryan. Cute kid. If there was to be only one Boy-Who-Lived, Harry would prefer it to be his brother rather than himself.

Childhood went on as usual. He couldn't even speak, only gargles coming out of his mouth. Uncontrollable accidental magics only made his parents smile. He felt melancholic knowing that his parents would die soon and he could do nothing to help.

The countdown until Voldemort came began ticking. On that fated day of Halloween though, his parents disappeared and left Sirius to mind him and Ryan. That day when Voldemort came, Harry realized that there probably wouldn't be any Boy-Who-Liveds. He didn't really mind.

Harry felt the ward of Fidelius shatter first. After that, a battle of Dark Magic began. Sirius gave as good as he got, but his Godfather was no match. And so he died, years before he should have.

Looking at Ryan sleeping peacefully, Harry smiled as well, preparing himself for death. The magical chandelier on the ceiling sparkled with multicolored lights. Standing up on the crib, he awaited his would-be killer. There was no mother to sacrifice herself now.

Voldemort walked in. Tom Riddle looked more charismatic than ever... actually he looked more effeminate than ever. Long hair, slender hands, even the bob on his neck was invisible. If not for the flat chest, Harry would have doubted his gender.

The wand was pointed and the curse was whispered. "Avada Kedavra." There was nothing more to be said.

Accidental magic was somewhat slower than wanded magic. That's why, the chandelier fell from the ceiling a moment after Harry was struck by the green light of Death. Harry didn't know about his success in protecting his brother as he lost consciousness the moment he was struck.

When he woke up, he found himself outside a certain house in a baby basket. Motherfucking Dumbledore cast a few protective spells on him before ringing the bell and leaving.

Ryan wasn't there - Harry knew that his twin still lived. Harry knew his parents were alive as well. So why the fuck was he here? It was all that motherfucking Dumbledore's fault!

"Dumbledore. Fucking Dumbledore. Bastard Dumbledore. Piece of shit Dumbledore." Harry cursed like a prayer.

He didn't have any reason to curse, yet he still did so. In some weird, inexplicable way, it gave him strength to keep on living.

In his past life, he had everything yet he still essentially committed suicide. That was because he couldn't bear with the feeling that Dumbledore was manipulating him from beyond the grave.

Harry hadn't come back to have a reunion with his parents, attain money and power, fall in love or even rewrite a tragedy. He had come back to fight Dumbledore.

In this life, the conclusion would be different. He would battle against Dumbledore and he would win. After that, he could be happy, living a life without his manipulations.

"H-Harry? It's time for breakfast." Dudley's scared voice broke him out of his thoughts.

Years had passed and he was 10 years of age now. The date of his Hogwarts Acceptance Letter was nearing. His wandless magical abilities had recently stabilized as well, enough to help in a few little things.

Petunia made breakfast. It was mediocre but at least Harry hadn't been forced to make it. Advanced Legilimency essentially allowed one to throw out a wandless Confundus. He had made good use of it to avoid pointless wastes of time.

After going to school with Dudley as a ordinary little child, he pretended to play around with his acquaintances. Due to taking early action, he hadn't suffered bullying - hell, Vernon didn't mind it when he smacked around Dudley in the house.

"Petunia, I'll be busy tonight. Don't make dinner for me." After arriving to the house, Harry said to his caretaker. She curtly nodded.

There was a bright and full moon in the sky. The moon was even blue, a rare phenomenon that was vital to some rituals. Especially one powerful ritual that Harry had been preparing for.

In a abandoned playground a Judas Tree bloomed, its pink blossoms resplendent and somewhat bloody. Harry had used his blood to feed the tree day after day for this one ritual.

With a white chalk, he made a rough circle on the ground underneath tree, carefully marking its roots. After that he made a triangle within the circle.

On the three points of the triangle, he left a Diary (stolen a week ago), Slytherin's locket (taken from his dear and deceased Godfather's abandoned house) and a bloody handkerchief with striking black points (stabbing out the part of Voldemort's soul lodging in his forehead was a excruciating endeavor).

Three Horcruxes were laid out in a magical triangle. Harry finally cut his fingertip with a sharpened fingernail and a drop of blood fell on the Judas Tree, the final sacrifice.

"Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out." A verse from the Bible was uttered as the spell for this rite.

As it turned out, Herpo the Foul hadn't succeeded in completely removing the original Lich Phylactery's weaknesses in his derived Horcrux Ritual. This would be to his advantage.

Bolts of silver lightning crashed down upon the Judas Tree, and the magic from the three Horcruxes was drawn out. Gradually, the teenage form of the Dark Lord appeared in the middle of the tree, as if being painted by a invisible hand from the skies.

The form that the Dark Lord had taken was still of a teenager. Unfortunately, the form was of a long-haired girl while his ritual was based upon the sins of a man.

A dozen lightning bolts came down to smite the form.

'Drat, the ritual failed due to this world's Voldemort being of a different gender. Well whatever, Voldemort getting killed off meant that he would have to modify his plans a little.' Just when Harry was going through contingencies in his mind, the ritual was completed and a female 7th year with bloody red eyes wearing the Hogwarts female student robes appeared underneath the Judas Tree.

"For thy sin and thy father's sin, I demand recompense. Spell thy True Name!" Harry spoke the spellwords granting him command over his second-greatest enemy's will.

"Yes... Master. True Name Thomas Marvolo Riddle, Alias Lord Voldemort." The voice seemed subservient though the person definitely wasn't. Whatever.

It didn't make sense that the woman before him was still named Thomas while being a girl. The girl wasn't lying though. Whatever, he didn't really care.

"You still need food, sleep and housing?"

"Master, food and sleep is unneeded. This corporeal form requires housing since transformation into aether is blocked." Oh, it turns out that there were consequences for the gender mistake in the ritual.

"That's fine. I won't be able to sleep with you in the room, so you'll have to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs." It was more of a statement rather than a question.

"Yes, master." The subservient tone didn't change, though the blood red eyes shined with bloodthirst. He'd have to tell the Dursleys to stay away from the cupboard though, he didn't want them dead.

"Tomorrow, I'll start preparations for my battle against Dumbledore! This time, I definitely won't lose! For now though, time to get home." With a teen that looked like a horror movie villain beside him, nobody dared to get nearby him. Harry didn't really mind.

A mashup with my favorite tropes. Wrong Boy Who Lived, Female Voldemort, Manipulative Dumbledore and Time Travel. If continued, the main focus would be Harry manipulating Riddle as a puppet against Dumbledore.

Unfortunately, writing a good Manipulative Dumbledore is hard for me so here it ends. Dumbledore needs to be a good manipulative bastard BTW, since the point is that Harry found it impossible to break out of the web of manipulations even after Dumbledore's dead.
