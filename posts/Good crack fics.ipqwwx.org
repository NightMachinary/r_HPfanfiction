  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS

** A lot of fics by Corvus Draconis are crack fics. Most are SS/HG though, so avoid if you don't like that pairing.

** I enjoyed the "Where in the World is Harry Potter?" series by nonjon linkffn(2354771). My favorite of the series is the 3rd one, but you can't skip to it.

The ones from the top of DariusA92's list are great though, I only mention this because it wasn't on the list. Seventh Horcrux and A Black Comedy are some of my favorites, and Oh God Not Again! is good as well.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  It seems like fanfics have had baby Harry raised by every character in fiction except for one: Godzilla, King of the Monsters! Watch as I descend into madness trying to take this story semi-seriously, by which I mean that it will have a plot that tries to make it work logically.For G-fans, this takes place in the Sh≈çwa continuity (for non G-fans, that means the goofy 60s and 70s Godzilla). For fans of both, or just Harry Potter, sit back and enjoy the lunacy!
