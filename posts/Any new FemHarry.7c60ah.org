I'm looking for any new, good, Fem!Harry. Crossovers with anything but anime are fine. Harry starting male and turning female somehow are also acceptable.

Edit: I guess I should specify that by new I mean within the last 12-18 months or so.

  Harry discovers Parseltongue a little earlier. As magic goes, it's not very useful. It's enough to make a few friends though. And isn't that enough? (Fem!Harry)

  She's sarcastic, reckless, quick-witted, sassy, and much more, but when faced with future tasks, not just from the Triwizard Tournament, there's one trait Iris Potter is willing to throw out --- laziness. Five mostly unique tasks, Animagi, humor, numerous magical creatures, and the beginning to a morally ambiguous and powerful but not overpowered fem!Harry. No bashing. Fourth year.

  At the end of 5th year, Remus whisks Rose Potter away to America to rest and decompress, far from the demands of wizarding Britain. In Las Vegas, she meets someone else dealing with serious personal problems: Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman. The two get drunk together, and the next morning they find that they made bad decisions while inebriated. Or maybe not so bad after all?

**** Why Iris? Surely fem!Harry's name should reflect the same naming attitude on Lily and James' part as "Harry", which is a common name, relatively middle class, and with royal associations. "Iris" is none of those. Elizabeth, Victoria, Anne, Alexandra, Isabelle, Catherine, Mary... these would all be more in line with that naming convention.

Iris peaked in 1934 as the 30th most popular name for girls born that year. By 1954 it had dropped out of the top 100 most popular names. Unfortunately there is no data for 1980 because at that time they only kept track of the top 100 names, but as of 1996, the earliest data available, Iris had fallen to the joint 1914th most popular name, with just 8 girls named "Iris" in 1996. It shared that distinction with names such as "AUGUSTA", "ENIOLA", "GWENNO" "JADESOLA", "TOLULOPE" and "ZAIRA".

Maybe in the US it's more popular?

***** This always makes me wonder whether there's a fic out there with a fem!Harry named Henrietta. With Harry being the spoken form of Henry, and Harriet being the spoken form of Henrietta, it's actually astounding that I've never seen a character named Henry or Henrietta. And Hadrian isn't even the formal version of Harry! It's related to the Emperor Hadrian, and the name Adrian, of which the feminine form is Adrianne or Adrianna, the most popular choice for Blaise's mother.
