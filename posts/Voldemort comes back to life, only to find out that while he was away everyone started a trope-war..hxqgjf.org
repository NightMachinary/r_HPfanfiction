So Voldemort is the only (relatively) sane person watching in disbelief as the other characters run around alternating between their usual tropes.

So Monday to Thursday manipulative!Dumbledore is trying to control Harry's life with ridiculous plots, a misunderstanding of psychology that is obviously flawed by everyone's perspective, and a shit-ton of spells and potions that shouldn't exist and passing the remaining days as an ineffective stoned out of his mind pacifist that thinks the best thing to do is letting everyone do whatever they want and hope they will eventually redeem themselves.

While this is happening Harry is alternating between being an Edge-Lord asshole, the Antichrist on steroids, a saint with endless patience that wouldn't hurt a fly, the king of all Marry Sues, a oblivious kid with the devil's lucky and a ridiculous amount of power, the eternal underdog that must find hardship in everything he does including but in no way limited to learning magic, talking to people, sitting in a table...

Besides it Ron and Hermione are also alternating between who is Harry's best friend, his love-interest, who is betraying him for Dumbledore, who is slipping him potions/stealing from him, who is keeping him away from other people's...

In the end Voldemort gives up on making any sense of it, throws up his hands in frustration and stomps his away out of Britain in frustration having gave up on ever ruling that madhouse.


** Voldemort: Barty, let's go somewhere else and start anew. There's no sense ruling over these incompetent fools. But first, I need to find a ritual that gives me a more presentable form, and a new look for you.

Barty Jr: Yes, my master. But what place do you have in mind?

Voldemort: The East, where there is vast land and infinite opportunities for us!

Barty Jr: Karkaroff. Shall we hunt him down and make him pay for his betrayals?

Voldemort: No. This coward will come around, and he will atone for his betrayals by being useful at Durmstrang. Now, let's break off, or as you are so fond of saying, "Allons-y"!

** *Thirty Death Eaters explode behind Harry to a mess of limbs and blood lying behind him*

He points his wand at Dolohov

/I can't kill him can I? Then I'll be no better than Voldemort!/, he thought with trepidation. He ran his hand through his raven-black‚Ñ¢ hair and his firey green killing curse orbs stared into Dolohovs.

Just from behind Harry, Dobby could be made out doing the Gangnam Style dance.

"I hate house-elves," Dolohov says for no reason at all.

"HOW DARE YOU!!!" Harry screamed cooly and totally in control of his emotions, levelling his wand with Dolohov's head and popping it like a balloon.

Hermione appeared from thin-air and gripped his shoulder, "You had to do it, Harry, it was for the greater good. He was actually planning an attack on the House Elf welfare kitchen. I knew this because I'm Hermione and know everything."

Ron was waddling around the battlefield.

"I shit mi self," he whispered as he hobbled to the nearest bathroom.

Voldemort wished the connection had never existed.

** linkffn(The Many Harry Potter's of Little Hangleton) has a bit of this. Every chapter is a different Harry trope in the graveyard.

Though I'm already very interested in this prompt.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.
