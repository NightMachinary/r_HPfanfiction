The new Fantastic Beasts trailer made me appreciate just how great it is when Dumbledore doesn't give a fuck even if he's completely surrounded.

I want to see Harry like this. Where he could be surrounded by Aurors and just be pleasantly casual about it.

The Casebook of Harry Potter by chris400ad [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12373224/1/The-Casebook-of-Harry-Potter]]

This is by far the best calm and cool collected you'll ever find in any fanfiction regarding Harry Potter. He's basically BBC Sherlock-esque, Daphne is his Watson, and they complete cases together as detective consultants. The Aurors don't like him much, but he gets results. Contractual Invalidation's got nothing on this. Or Make a Wish.
