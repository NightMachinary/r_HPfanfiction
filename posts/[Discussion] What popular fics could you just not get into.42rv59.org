Which it was - it's one of my favorites now, even if sometimes I just want to wring Alexandra's neck, haha. The world-building's awesome, and I love how magical america is also a melting-pot of cultures.

**** Everyone says this, but my utter hatred of that story had nothing to do with the writing style and long period between plot points and everything to do with the fact that every single adult in the book is an utter fuckwad. There's one competent teacher and even with her she gives the impression, every time we're speaking with her, that we're waiting her time. Even the Hagrid-esque game keeper isn't nice so much as "not actively trying to make us miserable". Do all the teachers die in a plague? (Preferably painfully)? I can think of little else that would incite me to finish that book.

*Harry Potter and the Wasteland of Time*: I don't hate it, but I can't enjoy it.

A popular fic I absolutely despise is *Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness*. It claims to be canon, but its characters couldn't be more OOC, and its plots couldn't be more implausible. [[/spoiler][Demelza almost strangled Neville to death because Ginny went to discuss DA with him in the middle of the night?! Snape tried to feed Neville/Ginny/Luna to werewolves in the Forbidden Forest?! Hagrid abandoned the three to die there because Snape ordered him to?!

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness gets recommended to me a lot, and I've tried, I really honestly have, but it's just so ridiculous and awkwardly sexist. Northumbrian also gets recommended to me a lot and although I full accept he's a very talented writer there's something about his characterisations that rub me up the wrong way. His fics are good though.

Other than that I actually don't tend to read many popular fics. I think a large part of it is that I really love canon stuff. I have an appreciation for the creativity that comes from AU/unusual pairings and such, but they never really hold my attention that well.

It reminded me of another story from the same author: Crack'd Mirror. I somehow powered through it despite not enjoying it much either. I guess it was the smut.

** The works of Shezza are too, I don't know, Hollywoodish? shallow? I'm not sure why exactly I dislike them, but they bore me and I don't get what people find in them. Probably for the same reason I dislike Anime and video games.

A Black Comedy and Make A Wish are both highly-rated comedies that failed to draw one chuckle out of me. They only drew cringing and eye rolling. Same for the rest of the authors' works.

HPMOR and robst stuff are a given.

"The Sacrifices Arc" or whatever those Saving Connor stories are called are awful in my opinion.

"Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness" absolutely disgusts me, both because the story is terrible, and because the author did some fucked up shit and is a complete fraud.

"What Would Slytherin Harry Do?" annoys me because Harry is so not cunning or clever there, yet the author paints him as this ultimate crafty Slytherin and makes his retarded plans unrealistically work. His attempts at humor are also pretty weak.

** I'm having a hard time continuing to read Denarian Renegade. It's well recommended, and for good reason. It's very well written, plus it has some great fight scenes. It's just... I really can't stand Harry. Spoilers incoming, I guess. I know he's had a demon attached to him throughout his childhood, and it would be unrealistic if he was normal, but it doesn't change the fact that he's a very unfun character to read about. It was good while he was alone or interacting with paranormal creatures, but now that he's at Hogwarts and interacting with real people it's been excruciating. He's just a nihilistic dick with no purpose or real personality. And then we have that Amanda girl taking his abuse with a smile. It was fine when they only interacted a little, but it's just cringe-inducing now every time it happens. Finally I just read Meciel casually suggest either killing Hermione's parents, torturing her, or engineering a plan for her to get raped. I know she's a demon, but it's almost the end of the first book and NOW we get the information that she's a sadist that has no problem hurting a complete innocent? I think I was totally justified in thinking she had at least some code, but I guess not. It would have been better to learn this sooner.

Anyway, long rant. I'll try to finish the book at least, see if anything changes.
