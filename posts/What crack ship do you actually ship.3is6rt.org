A crack ship is a ship that is *usually* only shipped/written in crack/humor fics.


** Cho Chang and Dudley Dursley.

--------------

J.K. Rowling said that Cho ended up marrying a Muggle (Dudley fits that), and that she considered giving Dudley wizarding children. Also, Ron's favourite Quidditch team is called the Ch((o)(D))udley Cannons. As we know, canon is official lore. Was Rowling trying to tell us something?

Well, maybe not, but that's not going to stop me from holding onto this ship!

** Noone has actually written any story with this particular crossover-pairing yet, but if they did, I'd totally read it:

My Mass Effect/Harry Potter crackship:

Tali'Zorah nar Rayya + Hermione Granger - the hyperintelligent dreamteam in a wonderful coming-of-age lovestory about a (for them) absolutely stunning new world to explore. Suffering from discrimination because of their background both eagerly try to show the world what they are made of, turning over conventions and proving to the world that both Quarians and Muggleborns are definitely NOT inferior to ANYONE.

True, at first they don't question the authoritive figures of Admirality board and professors much, but as they slowly realize that the world is not all sunshine and happiness, they start to question the behaviour of council and ministry, the unfair treatment of Geth and house-elves and the view society has about them only because of their background as a whole.

Soon they realize their united passion for learning and perfectionism, they share the pride they have in their work with each other, and soon start to develop feelings other than friendship for each other. But of course nothing can ever be easy.

Hermione is still shy and a bit insecure, she has improved significantly after the Yule-ball, but she isn't blind: There are thousands of other goodlooking women out there, goodlooking men and those of other genders and races. The wizarding world is still backwards, and a relationship between women, leave alone between those of different species, is still looked down upon. And that doesn't even take in consideration whether Tali might be interested in her the same way or not!

Tali of course has similar problems: Confined to her suit she can only dream about being intimate with another person, the preparations if she ever chose to be are tedious, the Quarian race is considered nothing more than 'suit rats' by most members of the galaxy, and the human race (as youngest member of the council space) might not be ready to accept relationships as easily as other species have learned to do over the centuries.

Dramatic developments (Keelah salai, we could buy a house on Rannoch and... unm, I mean, not we, well not that I would mind or, uh, isnit getting hot in here,...), sexual tension (it's wingardium leviosaaaaaaaaaaaahhh) and more!

**** IRC the issues with the Quarian immune system stem from a lack of viruses on their home planet and their symbiotic relationship with the planet's fauna. As such when they initially went out into space and were subjected to the viruses of other species many became very sick as their immune systems weren't capable of handling them lacking a T-cell archetype cell. As a result the Quarians developed the suits they wear to prevent further illnesses. When the Geth revolted and the Quarians fled to space aboard the flotilla in their suits. The flotiila ships are kept immaculate to help salvaged parts run as long as possible. So even then their environment is doing nothing to help their immune system deal with viruses and the like.

The Quarians are generally shunned by the council species because of the Geth and as a result probably haven't had much help in developing cybernetics to deal with the immune issues; further, most of the Quarian scientists and engineers are focused on maintaining the flotilla and trying to locate a world compatible with their biology for them to settle on. As a result the Quarians are pretty much stuck in the suits from the Geth revolt to ME3.

Magic would definitely speed up the process though.

** I ship Tomione, or Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger.

This is for several reasons. One, when one gets down to details, they both share some similar character traits. Both are logical and driven to succeed academically, to be "the best" when it comes down to who achieves the most in classes each year. Hermione can also be quite ruthless, cunning, and cold at different parts of the series, especially in OOTP - her face-disfiguring hex and having Umbridge be kidnapped by centaurs - and DH. If it wasn't for Hermione, Harry and Ron would also be in a world of trouble in DH. In a way, Hermione - even in PS/SS, helping Harry with the Potions room - helps to foil Tom Riddle's attempts to capture and kill Harry.

However, even from the start, Hermione proves herself to be a very intelligent, bright, capable, and ambitious witch. To me, she also has some very Slytherin traits - trapping Rita Skeeter in a jar for /weeks/ as a beetle was one among several - and almost reminds me of a young, albeit Gryffindor-esque, version of Bellatrix. (...and we all know how Bellatrix views Tom Riddle, or Lord Voldemort.) Hermione is even able to /lie/ convincingly to Bellatrix, and fool the Dark Lord's right-hand woman into believing a falsehood. That, in itself, is incredibly impressive.

In COS, Hermione is also the first one to "figure it all out". I'll c/p the portion I wrote for the HP Wiki, all of which is canon.

#+begin_quote
  ...Hermione, after fully recovering from her Polyjuice mishap, was shown T. M. Riddle's Diary by Harry. At first enthusiastic that the book might have "magical powers", Hermione first came up with the theory that it was Tom Riddle who originally "caught" the "Heir of Slytherin" when the Chamber of Secrets had been opened fifty years prior. She also correctly guessed that the Diary contained the answers to the Chamber's location, how to open it, and the true identity of Slytherin's monster. Thinking that the Diary was written in invisible ink, she attempted to use the spell /Aparecium/, and then a Revealer, on the object, but to no effect. Later on, when Harry went to the trophy room to try to learn more about Tom Riddle, he was accompanied by an "interested" Hermione.

  When Ron compared Riddle to Percy "in disgust", mentioning the former as being "Prefect, Head Boy...probably at the top of every class", Hermione responded in a "slightly hurt" voice, "You say that like it's a bad thing."

  Later on, she also correctly deduced that Riddle had "caught the wrong person", and that "it was some other monster [not Hagrid's Acromantula, Aragog] that was killing people". Later on, after Harry mentioned "hearing the voice" again before the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, Hermione ran immediately to the Library to research, where realised that Slytherin's monster was a basilisk. Tearing the page out of the book, and putting it in her right hand, she left the Library, where she warned the first person she met, Penelope Clearwater, to look around corners with her mirror. However, both Hermione and Penelope were petrified by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk, which was controlled by Tom Riddle's memory.
#+end_quote

I definitely feel that, to an extent, Hermione was the Irene Adler to Tom Riddle's Sherlock, in the sense that it was Hermione who outwitted Riddle, particularly in DH.

From the books, Riddle and Harry are also directly paralleled, especially in COS. While Harry and Hermione do not end up together romantically at the end of the series, they are, however, best (and good) friends. If Harry is paralleled with Tom Riddle, and Harry is good friends with Hermione and views her "like a sister", chances are, Tom Riddle also would have at least felt some sort of kinship with Hermione as well. Riddle and Hermione also share, again, several similarities: Hermione has some Slytherin traits; she can be cold and ruthless at times; she's clever, cunning, conniving, and intelligent; and, like Riddle, she became a Prefect, and likely in her 7th year, Head [Girl].

In COS, Hermione also shows "interest" [as per canon] in Tom Riddle, if purely for the fact that Riddle was a Prefect and Head Boy. Later on, in GOF, Hermione displays the /same/ admiration for Cedric Diggory (also a Prefect), to which she has this interesting conversation with Ron:

#+begin_quote
  "That idiot, Hogwarts champion?" said Ron, as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd towards the staircase.

  "He's not an idiot. You just don't like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch," said Hermione. "I've heard he's a really good student --- and he's a Prefect."

  She spoke as though this settled the matter.

  "You only like him because he's /handsome/," said Ron scathingly.

  "Excuse me, I don't like people just because they're handsome!" said Hermione indignantly.

  Ron gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like 'Lockhart!'.
#+end_quote

Speaking of Lockhart, we all know that Hermione had a rather /large/ crush on him, also in COS. Combined with the Cedric Diggory interaction with Ron, it's clear that Hermione is apparently attracted to intelligent, seemingly accomplished, handsome men - and Tom Riddle is not only those things, but highly charismatic. I think it's pretty obvious that if Hermione had met a teenaged Tom Riddle - /without/ being aware of his identity as Lord Voldemort - she would definitely be attracted to him.

As for Tom Riddle? I think that he would be attracted to Hermione for the same reason he has Bellatrix as a Death Eater: he would see Hermione as both a potentially dangerous threat, as well as a possible, powerful ally. In COS, as soon as Hermione discovers the true identity of Slytherin's monster, what does Tom Riddle do? He orders the basilisk to petrify (or kill) her. Much like Slughorn, I think Riddle likes to "collect" people - as seen with his Death Eaters - and he would want to lure Hermione to his side as well.

Hermione's a Muggle-born, yes. However, Rowling has also confirmed that Voldemort tried to get Lily Evans - a Muggle-born - to join him as well. That provides clear evidence that blood status does not matter to Voldemort, and his "blood purism" is a facade to keep the Purebloods in his inner circle pacified.

*** It's an interesting argument, though my sense is that, with Voldemort being a power-hungry psychopath incapable of love, pretty much the only way I can see the 'ship not being horribly unequal is if it's an AU where Hermione is a Dumbledore-grade prodigy herself, as in linkffn(Secretly, Yours by Brutality).

And, I don't buy Hermione taking Bellatrix's place:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think that this does a discredit to Hermione's character. The Bellatrix that we see is most defined by her being Voldemort's most fanatical follower.

Hermione isn't a follower. She has her own goals and her own agenda, and in her Harry-related adventures, she calls the shots in the trio as often as Harry does.

#+begin_quote

Does he see her that way, though? Bellatrix shows little independence; she is a minion, not an ally, and certainly not a threat. To reduce Hermione to Bellatrix's role degrades her character, IMO.

As such, I decline to discuss further. We both seem to have different opinions of Riddle and Hermione's characters. I don't see how my response would change, or persuade you to change, your established opinion.

Also, Voldemort isn't a psychopath, he is a sociopath. Rowling stated in an interview that if his mother had survived to raise and love him, Riddle would have turned out very different than he did. The orphanage environment also heavily contributed to his sociopathic tendencies.

****** Oh. When you said "argument", I assumed that you meant to debate. Which, I don't really see the point in debating shipping, as it's an issue of personal preference. It would be like arguing whether chocolate ice cream or vanilla ice cream is "a better flavor".

By "argument", I'm assuming you mean "viewpoint" instead, but I'll check out your suggestion. I don't think I've read that one, yet.

#+begin_quote
  Regarding Riddle's character, psychopaths and sociopaths are technically the same personality disorder
#+end_quote

I disagree. The major distinction is that psychopaths are born, whereas sociopaths are made. Many studies done of orphanage children also showed clear connections between emotional and physical neglect, to sociopathic or "antisocial" tendencies. Tom Riddle is hardly the first orphanage child to display those symptoms.

As the tendencies are tied into the environment specifically, that reinforces [to me] that Riddle was, indeed, a sociopath.

I also don't agree with the "scientist who discovered he was a psychopath" article. "Psychopath" also has very heavy connotations relating to mental illness. Tom Riddle was not shown as mentally ill. He did not regularly torture or kill animals as a child, as serial killer psychopaths were shown to do; indeed, his method of killing is relatively "quick, painless, and bloodless" in comparison. Riddle is not attracted to killing, blood, or show other signs of mental incapacitation; rather, he is merely revealed to be a incredibly intelligent and cunning child who uses magic to manipulate others into obeying his whims. Real-life bullies do that [manipulating others tactic] as well.

Psychopaths and sociopaths fit under "antisocial personality disorder", and Riddle is certainly not "antisocial". This is very clear in the books from his time at Hogwarts, surrounding himself with a group of followers going to Slug Club events, etc.

******* If we take your working definition, my sense is that he still fits the "born psychopath" better than "raised sociopath".

As far as we know, he was treated no worse than the other children, and vast majority of children raised in that orphanage did not become mass-murderers despite being raised in a loveless environment.

To the extent that there is a difference, psychopaths aren't necessarily antisocial in the colloquial sense. In fact, according to the linked articles, they are often very charming and manipulative, rather than crude and impulsive like the proverbial "raised sociopath". This fits Tom Riddle very well indeed. While not as fond of the Cruciatus as Bellatrix (who probably fits the "raised sociopath" better), he does not hesitate to use it, and while he isn't explicitly said to torture animals, he does confess to experimenting on them.

Funnily enough, one can make a pretty good argument (though with some holes) that Hermione is actually a prosocial psychopath.

  If we take your working definition, my sense is that he still fits the "born psychopath" better than "raised sociopath".
#+end_quote

Then it is still a difference of opinion. If neither of us are to be swayed, I do not see the merit in debating or discussing it. It is simply a matter of opinion.

I do not see Tom Riddle as a "psychopath", the term of which has been stereotyped and misconstrued to such ends that it is no longer reliable. "Sociopath" is less so, because, in my experience, it tends to be less often used.

As to being a "born psychopath", there is little evidence that Riddle's genes would have caused such. His Gaunt relatives may have been heavily conservative, but I would not define them as "psychopathic". His mother, Merope, was not psychopathic, either; she clearly showed love and emotion. Tom Riddle, Sr. was not psychopathic, either. Therefore, Tom Marvolo Riddle would not have an existing "psychopathic gene basis" for being born one, and the "well his relatives seemed kind of mentally ill" argument is a weak one at best. Additionally, from a contextual and subtextual standpoint, everything we are shown and told about Tom Riddle is his similarity to his Muggle father, not his Gaunt relatives.

#+begin_quote
  As far as we know, he was treated no worse than the other children, and vast majority of children raised in that orphanage did not become mass-murderers despite being raised in a loveless environment.
#+end_quote

/Argumentum ad populum/. It is logically fallacious because the mere fact that the belief that the other Muggle orphans were not "mass murders" is widely held is not necessarily a guarantee that the belief is correct; if the belief of any individual can be wrong, then the belief held by multiple persons can also be wrong. Likewise, Tom Riddle becoming a "mass murderer", while the other children did not, is based on unsound reasoning and logic, and cannot be scientifically backed or supported. (Just as case studies must be regarded similarly.)

Additionally, there is no evidence for the claim that "none of the other Muggle children became mass murderers". We do not see or hear of the other children, so there is no knowledge there as to how any of them ended up later in life. We see Tom Riddle only because he is relevant to the plot; the other Muggle orphans are not.

As for your third paragraph, there is another option, and one that I think fits far better: narcissism. There is also ample evidence of this in the books, with the Horcruxes being the most major piece of that evidence. A narcissist would also fit all of the criteria you mentioned.

#+end_quote

I do not agree in the slightest. Hermione was based off of J.K. Rowling herself, by Rowling's own admission, and Rowling does not have any psychopathic tendencies. Additionally, Hermione completely and utterly lacks the charming and manipulative traits that Riddle developed while he was at Hogwarts. While Hermione is manipulative to some extent, she does not willfully and consciously manipulate people to the extent that Riddle does.

********* You're the one who insists on drawing distinctions between "psychopaths" and "sociopaths", but when I go to look up the specific differences between the two --- as used by professionals, not in popular culture --- you dismiss the term that applies as tainted. Narcissism --- which is not what you originally suggested, which was "sociopathy" --- sure, that may be what he has, though it's supposed to be one of the symptoms of psychopathy/socopathy as well, and Riddle has their other symptoms in spades.

And, when you try to use "logic" to deconstruct what I am writing, can you at least keep your logical and informal fallacies straight? I am not basing my argument on the notion that a belief is widely held. I am basing it on lack of evidence to the contrary. In particular, look at what I actually wrote: do you have knowledge (strongly justified belief) that Tom was treated worse than the other children or that a significant number of other children from that orphanage became mass murderers? If so, give me your justification. (In case you are wondering what mine are, Tom Riddle was described by friends and foes alike as handsome and charismatic and indicated that he could control people, so he likely engendered better treatment than other children; and only a tiny fraction of children going through orphanages --- even loveless ones --- become mass murderers, and we get no hints that I can recall that Tom's orphanage was anything special in that sense.) If you don't have such a justification, then the statement is true.

Hermione being a prosocial psychopath is a more of a joke argument, but, in the interest of accuracy, Rowling based early Hermione's obnoxious attitude on herself at that age, and that's all we have, at least as far as I know. Just because Hermione's a psychopath, doesn't mean she has to be good at it. :P

She also uses a lot of foul language, and 'fuck' every other word, which is off-putting for me. I also heavily dislike how Tom deliberately gets Hermione pregnant in it, and how clueless Hermione is as to birth control. Seriously, Hermione? What else did you think that unprotected sex would lead to?

Then again, I /hate/ pregnancy plots in general. Hate, hate, /hate/ them.

Hermione is the conscience and moral compass of Gryffindor house. She is the only one able to call out the horror of wizards employing a /slave race/. She'd never, ever, trust someone that is willing to kill and torture to get what they want. She'd /never/, in a million years, find someone who thinks world domination is a goal worth killing for anything other than horrible. Someone willing to spout racist propaganda to advance his ends, even if he doesn't mean it, would be absolutely loathsome to her.

A cute butt and cutting wit just aren't enough for Hermione. The bad boy thing does absolutely nothing for her. She ended up with Ron because whatever his many glaring faults, deep down he's /a good guy/. As opposed to Harry, do you really think he could muster up the necessary emotions and will to use unforgivables? Never. That's why she dated Krum as well. Those two have nothing in common other than being good people and liking Quidditch. And that's the one thing that Tom Marvolo Riddle would never, ever be.

Yes, it is. I wouldn't really expect otherwise from Rowling, to be honest. After all, she paired Ron and Hermione, not Hermione and...well, anyone else. Ron is Rowling's "wish fulfillment", not Tom Riddle.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is the conscience and moral compass of Gryffindor house.
#+end_quote

I would disagree with this. I don't think she represents the entire house. For Harry and Ron? Certainly. However, Hermione is usually seen as "overbearing", "bossy", and "annoying" to anyone beyond Harry or Ron, and not without reason. She tends to be this very intense, "brilliant...but scary", stubborn, and forceful person who is very domineering. Much like Tom Riddle, when she wants something, oh boy, does she /push/ for it. Tom Riddle had his own ambition; Hermione had S.P.E.W. and the D.A., the latter of which she originally suggested. Hermione even takes out a page of Riddle's book [with the Dark Mark] by use of the Protean Charm in OOTP, and she admits as such. It shows that she has at least /studied/ Lord Voldemort (and Tom Riddle) and his tactics to some extent, and sometimes copies them. She is using Riddle's own tactics against him, for Harry instead, as well as against Umbridge.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

For this, I would point to how reluctant Hermione is to place blame on Malfoy in HBP, even despite Harry's accusations. Hermione loathes Malfoy, yes, but even she is willing to give Malfoy some benefit and leeway of the doubt. She actually /doubts/ what Harry says about Malfoy, because she deems it as 'illogical'. Likewise, Hermione is shown to "gloss over" certain facts about individuals that Harry and Ron don't like, but /she/ likes, as seen in COS with Lockhart.

Hermione very much has a lawyer (public defender) mentality: that is, "innocent until proven guilty". Unless Riddle did something to outright demonize her, like Snape did, Hermione has shown that she wouldn't be nearly as quick to place blame on him [judging by her view of Malfoy in HBP]. Additionally, even despite Malfoy's bullying of her, Hermione stands up to him in POA, punching him in the face. She can stand up for herself accordingly, and she'd do the same to Tom Riddle, if the same situation presented itself.

#+begin_quote
  She'd never, ever, trust someone that is willing to kill and torture to get what they want.
#+end_quote

That's why I said in my original post, "if Hermione didn't know Tom Riddle was Lord Voldemort". Of course she'd loathe him with that knowledge. Yet if Hermione had gotten the Diary instead of Ginny? She would have never have known that Tom Riddle was Voldemort. Hell, /Harry/ didn't even know until the end of COS, when Riddle chose to reveal his alter-ego. Both Harry and Ginny even thought of Riddle as a "friend" prior to this. Hermione wouldn't fare any differently if she had been placed in Harry or Ginny's shoes.

Point is: appearances can be deceiving. Riddle is well-documented to have been a disarming, charismatic individual who gained the trust of almost everyone (save Dumbledore) who knew him as Tom Riddle. Few questioned his motives or actions, and he proved a masterful actor. Even Harry and Ginny fell for the facade.

Tomione, most of the time, doesn't fail to deal with Riddle's uglier side as well.

#+begin_quote
  A cute butt and cutting wit just aren't enough for Hermione.
#+end_quote

I found this a really odd thing to say...my reasons didn't focus on these two factors alone. I also think you are oversimplifying the 'ship as a whole, as I listed a ton of other reasons why people ship the pairing.

#+begin_quote
  She ended up with Ron because whatever his many glaring faults, deep down he's a good guy.
#+end_quote

Again, as I've said before, shipping is a personal preference. If you like Romione, then go for it. There is lots of Romione fanfiction out there you can read. However, people who ship Tomione like Tomione because they simply prefer it. There isn't anything else to be said about it. Telling Tomione shippers, "well, Ron is a good guy and Tom Riddle isn't, and Hermione only ends up with good guys" isn't going to do much.

#+begin_quote
  As opposed to Harry, do you really think he could muster up the necessary emotions and will to use unforgivables? Never.

Oh don't get all condescending here. JKR's word is canon, and more than that, Hermione was the character she based off of her own personality. It's the one case where her wish fulfillment is as close to a character's one ever. I don't particularly like this pairing, but the reasoning behind it - and the assumption that /it would work/ is part of what defines Hermione's personality.

Not arguing with the facts here - I'll take on the interpretation. A person who makes a strong moral stand cannot possibly be a reflection of everyone. You think Gandhi's ideals were those of all Indians? MLK Jr. was most famously a "softy" moderate in his own community that completely disregarded the rage the people he represented felt - and yes, he did represent those as well. And these are guys that as representatives are very well accepted. Neither of these people were perfect, and had their own personality flaws (that were not shared by everyone they represented).

You are missing the point of what I said - deep down, Hermione always had a very clear sense of right and wrong, and the fact that she was willing to give people a chance until they proved her wrong only goes to show how much "annoying", "bossy", and "overbearing" are minor things about her in comparison to that. On the other hand, Tom Riddle has absolutely no concept of right or wrong... and never had. He is of the "might is right" school of thought - for him "innocent until proven guilty" isn't just silly, it is completely irrelevant.

While both can be "forceful", for TMR it is because he covets something for himself yet for Hermione it is because she believes it would help others. The difference is so fundamental that it is at the core of their characters. Hermione studied Lord Voldemort, but hell, I've studied Ghengis Khan yet think that to plundering and pillaging villages, and raping all the women there is wrong... even if I do appreciate the military tactics. Hermione took a clever piece of magic and used it to communicate (in a very benign way), whereas to Voldemort it was a tool to control and enslave (and some would say to /brand/ his /property/).

#+begin_quote

there's also that he's a deformed snake man, and isn't going to put his immortality obsession on hold

hermione 'standing up for herself' is kind of irrelevant. riddle would employ gaslighting, manipulation, or outright magical force. she's unmatched.

what would he recruit her for that isn't outright dark? his crew would be orbiting him, they know his lineage and secrets, she can form an idea

Rowling has shown to be contradictory in her interviews as well multiple times before, and not everything she says /should/ be taken as canon. (The number of students actually at Hogwarts is one major example, and Rowling really sucks at math. Science and biology is another area she isn't exactly perfect at.)

You're not reading or acknowledging the context and subtext within the actual scenes in the books. You're taking what Rowling's saying literally at face value, and an interview at that, while neglecting any opposing or contradictory evidence from the books. It's cherry picking.

*tl;dnr:* J.K. Rowling interviews aren't always a reliable source, and should not be treated as "the be all end all" of canon.

******* she called him a racist, so it's pretty clear what she meant. and i agree about death of the author. though, the point is, voldemort in the books acts and behaves like a wizzy supremacist. there isn't anything to suggest otherwise, so you'd have to support that. him asking lily to join doesn't disprove that. that's also something jkr said in an interview. and this in itself is cherry picking and decontextualising. she does slip, but there's a difference between technicalities and general characterisations, i think. it's clear the general idea of voldemort is someone who's sincerely bigoted. also for the source, you can find it on accioquote about voldemort

  Hermione is killed by Voldemort, and is now dead. Well, sort of. Turns out that death is a little more complex than she knew... Ignores epilogue and last 50ish pages of DH.

Though linkffn(Have a Nice Day! by Speechwriter) also destroys my emotions as well. The author is just truly brilliant.

  Tom Riddle: secret, brilliant heir to the biggest company in the world, VoldeMart. Hermione Granger: sent to his prestigious school on full scholarship because VoldeMart outsourced her parents' jobs to China. Bridges burn. Sparks fly. M for language.

** Snape/Lockhart. Ever since someone on here suggested that they'd make a great couple in a detective style of story. With Snape as the sneery, stiff upper lipped detective and Lockhart as the fanboy who follows him around and tries to be just like him.

I'd read a humour fic of that theme ^

**** It is. But its kind of cracky, don't you think? They've been trying to kill each other for Harry's entire life. I know enemies can be lovers, but still. Not to mention the age difference, and to actually make this pairing work, one or even both would be OOC, either by making DarkEvil!Harry or HorcruxesMadeHimInsaneButNowHesOkay!Voldemort.
