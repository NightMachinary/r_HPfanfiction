Instead Arthur adores Dudley because of his knowledge of Muggle gadgets. Molly is happy someone appreciates her cooking so much that they wouldn't stop eating. Bill and Charlie are impressed about Dudley's experience in their job based on videogames and TV shows. The twins love the pranks he plays on Harry. Ron likes Dudley more because he never outshines him and Ginny only has eyes for him. Now Harry has to sleep in the attic with the ghoul and spend his days listening to Percy talking about "Prefects who gained power".

**** Lol, in 10 years some poor kid would have to get Percy sloshed in order to wheedle a strategically important memory out of him:

#+begin_quote
  “He just seemed really interested in cauldron bottoms!” Percy sobbed, covering his face in shame.

  BWL 2.0 rolled his eyes. “You told him the password to the Minister's office because he let you talk about cauldron bottoms?!”

***** That wouldn't be a stretch from canon (depending on whether you want to consider Pottermore canon though). JK said that the Malfoys accumulated a significant part of their wealth from deals with Muggles prior to the Statute of Secrecy entering into effect.

** Or hear me out: Dudley resenting all kind of 'freaky stuff' and straight up blaming Harry for the death of his parents, saying he did something freakish. Dudley was wounded in the accident, so he eventually starts to believe the story himself (Idk, maybe trauma can do that?) Anyway, Dudley convinces the Weasleys Harry is evil (the very fact they heard him speaking with the snakes in the neighborhood didn't help Harry's case much) and Molly is as loyal to Dumbledore as ever, so she obviously tells him Harry is evil, which leads to Dumbledore worrying about how poor Harry must have gotten influenced by Voldemort and can never be trusted. This leads to Harry getting blocks on his magic and his mind wiped of magic. Dudley also appears to have magic and guess who will become the new 'chosen one'? Meanwhile, Harry somehow remembers everything because of the Horcrux and he only wants one thing... Revenge

Do you think this could be a good idea? And would you mind me using your idea as an inspiration?

*** By all means please do. That's why I posted it as a 'Prompt'. Happy to give away ideas since I have so many but I'm struggling with a massive writer's block.

Edit: also feel free to combine it with my other prompt about Dudley being the WBWL because people think that he lost the magic together with Voldemort during the attack so now the Hogwarts staff is struggling to get him ready to confront Voldemort without any magical powers.

*** Depending when exactly it happens maybe the dursleys had only reached the 'we don't like him stage' and not 'we don't like him bevause he's magical ' stage. This would be before hogwarts too. So before 11. Could even be a wrong boy who lives story where they think dudley is Harry bevause they can't fathom anyone not treating Harry like that..

I think the Weasley clan of all people would welcome both with open arms. But I suppose any..unfairness would be the kind of gradual not noticeable thing that becomes habit after a while.

Or Dumbledore tells them its for Harry's own good since death eaters are after him.

Lots of ways you could spin it I suppose.
