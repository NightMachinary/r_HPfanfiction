Hello

Why do you all think the Sorting hat wanted Harry in Slytherin


** JKR has retconned it so that it was due to the Horcrux and that fits in nicely with Trelawney feeling it that one time. However, canon Slytherins weren't all that cunning and only a few were ambitious.

As for Harry, he practiced deception almost every time he used his invisibility cloak and for the majority of HBP. In CoS, he lies to the Dursleys about underage magic, makes a deal with Vernon to sign his Hogsmeade form in PoA, and uses Sirius to bully the Dursleys in GoF. In OotP he's keeping DEs distracted while simultaneously coming up with a plan. In DH he promises the sword to Griphook in order to break into Gringotts, but plans on giving it to him when he wants to.

And one of my favorite moments in the whole series is Harry correcting Ron's arm swinging after taking polyjuice. "Crabbe holds them sort of stiff..."

Harry isn't not cunning. It's like what Dumbledore says in CoS: he has the tools to be a good Slytherin, but he's just a lot more brave (and impulsive) and those moments are more impactful.

** I think the Hat's exact words were “Slytherin could help you on the way to greatness”. They're eleven. The hat's main job seems to be both putting a student where they have the house qualities but also in a house where they can thrive, because at eleven you don't necessarily exemplify the personality you will have later in life.

If you look at Neville, he didn't seem brave at all. If the hat put him with the qualities he exemplified right then, he would probably be a Hufflepuff. Same with Hermione, she probably would've been a Ravenclaw. But the two of them /needed/ Gryffindor to fully realize their potential as people. It's likely that a Hufflepuff Neville would have faded into the background or a Ravenclaw Hermione would have jumped into her books and never came out.

Harry could have been in Slytherin. It would have encouraged the more cunning parts of him that he shows on occasion, like his biting sarcasm. Slytherin would have made him colder, crueler maybe. Or it could have encouraged his ambition.

We see in canon that Harry isn't that ambitious. He just wants to be normal. But if he went to Slytherin, perhaps being surrounded by people always reaching farther and testing their limits, he could have become “great”. But I think the Sorting Hat recognized that tris wasn't what Harry needed. Harry needed companionship and a safe place, not a place where he would be alone and always be on his guard. Slytherin could have made him great. Gryffindor made him happy.

*** Hufflepuff Neville would forever be known to Harry as 'that round faced boy'

*** The question there is: which is more important? Happiness is important of course, but (just a thought) what if exploring his cunning side would have guided him to a quicker end to the war? Harry is a natural leader, who is to say he wouldn't have created a new faction in the house? It would be interesting to see if his happiness in Gryffindor was worth the greatness he could have achieved.

Also I think being free of his Gryffindor expectations may have broadened his horizons for future fulfillment. Who knows?

**** I agree, a Slytherin Harry might have actually ended the war sooner. But I think that, despite all the Hat's foresight, its knowledge comes from experience rather than divination. So when the Hat saw the mind of this neglected child who had so little happiness in his life so far, the Hat chose to put him in a house that would encourage that rather than picking sides in a (as of yet) hypothetical war. But that doesn't mean Slytherin Harry fics aren't a guilty pleasure of mine :p

** Harry was an ickle little first year. He's a huge deal to the wizarding world. The hat dangles greatness in front of him. Its fair that Harry Potter considered what it would take to be 'THE Harry Potter.'

To be everything the wizarding world expected of him, that level would be rather ambitions for an eleven year old who only discovered magic a month ago.

** Couple of things:

- Rowling (aka 'Word of God' on this issue) retroactively stated that the Slytherin connection the Hat detected was due to the Horcrux. While of course this diminishes much of the thematic and moral messages set in the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th books, its not the first of such instances where she has done so.
- You don't seem to understand what the Sorting Hat does. It doesn't measure the future or absolute personality of a person. It measures /potential/ to succeed or fit in with one house or the other. When the Sorting Hat puts someone in Ravenclaw for instance, its because the kid has the potential to fit in and succeed most in the house of the brainy and knowledgeable. Some are not so clear cut, unlike Lily or Draco, and its choosing the best place. The hat cannot know their future in one house or the other, merely guess where the student's personality and traits will best fit. The only exception is examples like Harry who adamantly wanted to be in one House or the other.
- Leadership is not a trait of any of the houses. How can it be? Leadership is a measure of many different qualities, and is a multiplicity of numerous factors such as organization, reputation, interpersonal and social skills, charisma, and so on. Slytherin is primarily about ambition and power, those students who are more likely to see life and society as a ladder (possibly something shared by Ravenclaws). I don't know why you would think this is a Slytherin trait, as its not really stated in the books. Indeed all of the Founders would likely praise those with leadership capabilities.
- With regards to Harry not fitting /your definition of Slytherin/, you are completely ignoring environmental factors and assuming everything is cognitive. The simple truth is that most of the Hogwarts students are very malleable as 1st years, and are overall not that different from one another. But when they get put in a house? For seven years? Humans both consciously and unconsciously imitate their peers habits, behaviors and traits, especially when in childhood and close-proximity. When you put kids in a house where everyone knows what virtues it extolls, won't they try to live up to that? And when they see your peers around them in each house, they will reinforce this behavior and automatically orient themselves to such behaviors. Harry is just acting like the rest of his House for the most part, or at least the ones he interacts with regularly.

TLDR: your assessment of what is and is not Slytherin (or any house most likely) is lacking both context and nuance, and you should reconsider that before you decide this or that person belongs in one house or the other.

** Well I am afraid that Rowling and me we will have to agree to disagree.

- Slytherin House drew a certain type of child: ambitious, sly,cunning, usually with the smarts to back it up with. The circumstances that fostered that need to rise above oftentimes came from an abusive environment ( The Dursleys )

- Hermione was sorted in Gryffindor because while she is a walking encyclopedia , she is not bright nor smart as Rowena would have liked totally, socialy inept and Gryffindor forceful ( Yes Sit down Miss Granger 20 points from Gryffindor each time you exhibit your knowledge in a way that disturb your classmates from learning ) She lacks very much of a critical mind to fully be Rowena smart. She does consider the knowleadge of the book as absolut.
- There is a fanfiction with a Slytherin Harry "On the way to Greatness" by mira mirth, that explain for me, the potential that Harry would have if he gone to Slytherin. In Gryffindor he is too much Dumbledore Golden Boy without much thinking himself and without motivation to do something different. Well harry (Stupefix + Expeliarmus ) VS Harry ( There is no Good and Evil but Intent )
