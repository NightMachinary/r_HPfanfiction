[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] and it's sequels are probably some of my absolute favourite fics of all time.

After just reading them again I really want to read some similar stuff. So you could you guys give me some recommendations?

If you somehow haven't read this go read it. This is an example of how overpowered Harry can be done without him breezing through the canon situations, rather he faces much varied challenges and his opponents are considerably more powerful than in canon.


** linkffn(Deal with a Devil by Silently Watches) is similar to The Denarian Renegade in that it has Harry being taught magic pre-Hogwarts by a fallen angel. The last pre-canon chapter was uploading just the other day but I am unaware of what direction it is going from there.

  She was an agent of Evil who regretted her choices. He was a child with a destiny too heavy for his shoulders. Is the Wizarding World ready for a Boy-Who-Lived influenced by a reforming Fallen Angel? ...Probably not. NOT Harry/Lash

** Start with (Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian). After that, the linkffn(Wastelands of Time; Sword of the Hero) are two trilogies by Joe that are extremely epic. They contain the same type of Harry you're going for.

  The Hero Trilogy, Part One. After the tragedy of his fifth-year, Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts and to a war that will shake the Wizarding and Muggle worlds to their very core. Peace rests on the edge of a sword, and on the courage of Harry alone.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

*** I've read Wastelands many times. Definitely a very good one.

I'm gonna try Circular Reasoning. Thanks!

*** Wastelands isn't a trilogy? It is a story and a sequel (Heartlands), but has Joe ever said he is going to write a third once Heartlands is finished?

** Have you checked out Ikarus Solotov's Fallen Renegade? It is a spinoff based on Shezza's trilogy. It does have some cliches and grammar issues, but if you turn a blind eye on them it is a genuinely fun read, especially past chapter ten or so. ( The Hogwarts arc.)

Downside: it is abandoned.
