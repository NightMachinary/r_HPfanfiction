Looking for a harry war and/or adventure fic, in which harry has a comrade/friend/mentor kind of relationship with tom riddle/voldemort. I have no problem with the setting or if its time travel or anything. Prefer long and finished if possible and please no slash harry.


** Limpieza de Sangre kind of matches your request: there is a mentor-esque relationship between Harry and Fem-Voldermort. It is complete and there is a sequel: linkffn(11752324).

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is probably the best Harry/Voldemort mentor relationship I can think of, and war does become central to the plot starting in 1995.

Linkffn(Stranger in an Unholy Land) is a bit dated and a universe jumper, but Voldemort and Harry are like king and right-hand man in this fic.

Linkffn(Altered Destinies) has perhaps the reverse of fortunes with Harry mentoring a young Tom Riddle in the past.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

** I've read quite a few fics in which Harry and Voldemort end up as friends/allies. Here are several completed ones that I love:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/1/The-Unwinding-Golden-Thread][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] - Time travel to Tom Riddle's school years. An uneasy friendship eventually forms between Tom and Harry.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] - Voldemort and Harry are pushed into working together as allies a century after they ended their war with an oath.

I'm not sure this one is completed, but it is very long, and last time I checked the author said it was close to the end. (Edit: Unlike the two I listed above, this one isn't focused on a war, so it doesn't fit the OP as much.)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]] - Voldemort regains his sanity after his resurrection in the graveyard and seeks a non-violent path to revitalize the wizarding world.

  Part 1 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. Harry and Voldemort took oaths to end their long and bloody war. Over a century later, a convoluted plot forces the two (slightly out of practice) immortals into an adventure together.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
