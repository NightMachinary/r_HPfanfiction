I read it once a long time ago. It starts with a fight between Harry and Ron in Hogwarts where he is kept captive by Dumbledore. The fanfic was a Harry/Ginny one and the description was in Ginny's POV and was something like 'he was the enemy, she must not love him ' or something like that. I would like to read it again, can anyone help me?


** Was it the darkness within? Its been a while since i read that but i could be confused.
