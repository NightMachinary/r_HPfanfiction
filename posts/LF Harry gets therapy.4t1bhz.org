Hi. Looking for novel-length, well-written stories in which Harry gets counseling or therapy either post-war or during Hogwarts. I mean, shoot! If anyone needs help, that kid does, ESPECIALLY post-DH! I mean, he just walked willingly to his death, saw his dead parents, died, came back from death, fought, lost loved ones, AND has to deal with fame. So unreasonable to think that he didn't need any help! And speaking of needing help, if there are fics that feature ALL of the characters having to get counseling, or at least some of the ones who'd need it most, like Ginny or Mrs. Weasley, or George...that would be great, too!

So...any fics where he and/or they get(s) help...realistically, so not just like 2 sessions and boom! Healed! Any pairing, het, slash, multi, or none is fine by me, though I do prefer Harry-centric fics. Thanks!

Harry has a bit of a breakdown and lets put on leave from the Aurors. The therapy isn't a huge part of the story but it was very well used in the beginning. The last few chapters have fallen off quite a bit though.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
