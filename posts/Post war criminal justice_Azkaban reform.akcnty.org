This came up in a comment on another thread, but now the question has been mulling around in my head for a while so I've been asking Potterheads I know. Now, I'd like to see if anyone on here wants to explore the idea too.

The second wizarding world is recently over. After the Dementors proved ineffective, inhumane, and disloyal, it's clear that the wizarding world NEEDS prison reform. You're in an elevator with the head of the Department of Justice. She says, "Say, what do you think the New Azkaban should look like?" What do you tell her?

I've been thinking, “psychiatric healers.” Not just the healers that keep Lockhart and the Longbottoms comfortable---I mean the magical equivalent of psychiatrists, therapists, and social workers. Some Death Eaters would be beyond reform, but not all convicts in Azkaban are Bellatrix-Lestrange-level evil. Anyone else got an idea?


** I commented on the other thread. Depends on how much torture and weird wizarding world shite you want to chuck in, but their are more than a few options.

Option 1: close to azakaban. Stick a boggart in a cell with every person and make them face their worst nightmares

Option 2: Lockhart em. Memory charm the evil away. But definite opportunity to have a Darth Revan situation or for a criminal to make a copy of their memories

Option 3: minority report. Dreamless sleep em and put them in containment units till they die of old age

Option 4: Rehab. Whether it be a room of requirement, pensive playbacks, mind healing, or some unknown method there's got to be a way to make criminals more self aware and repentant.

Option 5: kill them. Abra kadabra your out of here. We're a dictatorship and now and won't tolerate your nonsense

Option 6: avatar it. Strip their magic and let them live out their lives in some type of community in the middle of nowhere.

Option 7: Grindelwald solution. Exile in the middle of nowhere with probably only a house elf to care for you

Personally I think option 4 and 6 combined would be my ideal solution. 4 for minor crimes, 6 for heavy criminals.

** Problem is most of the inner-circle Death Eaters shouldn't be given tons of help. Doesn't matter if they aren't as "evil" as Bellatrix, they willing not only joined the magic nazis but became the equivalent of high ranking SS officers.

While I think the Dementors are unfair and a better, more humane Azkaban could be constructed, I'm not down with Death Eaters getting social workers and getting off free. For example, Lucius should have rotted in prison for life. Draco was kid, but he should have served some time in jail nevertheless.

Ideally, I think all inner-circle, marked death eaters should be put in prison for life, but a prison where there are no dementors and it is a humane place to live. Lower level Death Eaters should serve some time in prison ranging from 5-15 years. Ones who can prove they were "forced" by threats to their families have to deal with psychiatrists, social workers, and are heavily monitored for a few years. Those underage, unless they committed violent rape or particularly violent murder, will serve time in a juvenile facility and then be rehabilitated. Those who were complicit in crimes, a la Narcissa, would need to serve some jail time (a year or so) and then be on house arrest for a while.

By letting Draco, Narcissa, and Lucius off with a slap on the wrist, the current ministry is just building a well of resentment among muggleborns who had to deal with racist shit day in, and day out, and then don't even see justice delivered. Draco nearly killed Katie, I can't imagine she's thrilled, if she knows the full story, that he never received any sort of punishment. And why should Narcissa get off free just for lying about Harry when she housed, associated, etc. with Death Eaters and LV for years and only objected once her son was in danger? If there wasn't plot armor and J.K.'s world was a bit more realistic, the "punishments" dealt out to Death Eaters are just setting up the stage for another rebellion: either angry muggleborns pissed that justice was never dealt, or Death Eaters who got off the hook and regrouped.

*** Wow, I really appreciate how much thought you put in to this reply. So of course I have to probe for more lol. What about non-Death Eater convicts? Hagrid spent some time in Azkaban on suspicion of being associated with attacks on students. Fletcher shows us the wizarding world has petty crooks, Umbridge shows us the Ministry had war criminals, and hey, Charlie Weasley had friends willing to engage in illegal dragon smuggling.

**** Fines, magical bail, criminal rehabilitation programs, and minimum and maximum security prisons. A dragon smuggler should get a fine the first few times, if they do it more than say, five or six times, they should serve a brief amount of jail time in a minimum security prison.

I'm not against amnesty programs, I just think in J.K's world it goes way too far. My parents were refugees from a country were some truly terrible shit went down: torture, mass murder, etc. My parents basically got lucky, tbh, as they were well educated and had a way to escape, while many weren't so lucky.

Anyway, amnesty was proposed, because they couldn't prosecute everyone in my parent's home country. So the worst of the worst mostly went away, but a lot of the "medium" level monsters went free. Guess what? One of those medium level monsters got a place in the government, and later got in trouble for torturing prisoners---and this of course pissed off large parts of the public who thought the amnesty program went too far and not enough people were dealt with in the justice system. And so the country was briefly thrown into turmoil, once again.

There are tons of examples where letting everyone off the hook, or most off the hook, when it comes to war crimes leads to just more crimes down the future.

*** I'm not sure this would work. Lockhart still liked signing things even after he lost all his memories, and generally retained the same temperament. So it seems likely that wizarding criminals would retain their proclivities even if obliviated. Though certainly obliviation would reduce how dangerous they were.

As for why this happens, one imagines that in the HP world, a person's fundamental character is determined by their soul rather than their mind.

However, this is sort of giving them a blank slate - doesn't punish criminals for their crimes or anything. It works rather well with reintegration, but it feels empty as far as the feeling of justice is concerned.

Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. Human rights is nonsense that the powers that be tend to overlook the moment it becomes inconvenient to them - they are empty words half the time, and they are used as excuses to create conflict the remainder of the time.

Justice is not just punishment either - and it's an especially weak punishment when the punished have no idea they were ever punished for wrong-doing in the first place.

************** So...considering the first guy. You do realize that it is super disrepectful to make jokes about gassing jews, right. I agree that it shouldnt be a crime but considering how most civil people probably feel the exact same need about joking about the mass murder of six million people for no reason at all as drinking from the toilet i dont feel opressed.

Tommy Robinson had conflicts with the law before because of violent assaults. He also initiated a hate campaign towards a 15 year old boy who was the victim of a brutal attack by falsely accusing him of attacking girls prior. Furthermore he falsely claimed to have been put in a muslimic majority prison which is objectively wrong considering how the details about prison population can be seen online. The reason he was arrested in the first place was because he published details from an ongoing case which almost jeopardized it.

Let me add that I am definitely not a fan of Islam, considering how they treat apostates and women.

Do you think its really fair that a vote from Montana somehow counts more than a vote from a New Yorker? Clinton definitely has flaws too but at least we could be reasonably sure that she wouldnt trigger a nuclear war by accident by insulting Kim on twitter.

Guns. Its probably right that its too late now to strictly limit guns since seemingly everybody already has one. I dont see a reason why somebody should own semiautomatic guns though. I like how the police is way less likely to shoot me because they dont have to assume that i have a gun. There are also virtually no school schootings in my country because kids with issues arent able to just buy them at the next supermarket.

I haven't finished reading it but it's very well written, focusing on the post-war realities of a still racist society. Hermione does a lot of research of things that happened during the war in order to ensure proper justice is handed out.

***** Oh, good question. I'm asexual so the sex scenes make zero sense to me, that brings my rating down, and I don't like how it's written in present tense, but that's a style choice; it alternates between Hermione 3rd person limited present tense and Hermione's diary, first person past tense. It can be a little bit purple-prosy at times. Hermione's characterization is - I don't know. It's not exactly canon, but it's believably PTSDed. There's some Ron bashing to start with but, again, in character with PTSD and not overt. He gets over himself. I'd say the characterization overall is pretty spot on. Plot moves slowly, because of time turner usage. It's more a character study, or a study of that society, than a plot-driven story.

I'd give it a 8/10 at least. I need to keep reading it and see how the ending stacks up. I'm on Ch 51 out of 69.

Now that you have removed the magical Nazis, raze Azkaban to the ground, alternatively herd the dementors there and unleash Fiendfyre. Should they prove immune to Horcrux removing hellfire, try stabbing them with Gryffindor's sword.

With that out of the way, hold a constitutional assembly, figure out what works for the magical world, hold a vote on that and swear the entire MoM to that constitution. Should the general population desire a democracy, hold a general election, otherwise set up some form of checks and balances. Forcing an unwilling population into democracy does not work.
