I've already read The Art of Self Fashioning and A Cadmean Victory. But I'd like to see fics that explore it, even if it's minor. Charms is often explored more but Transfiguration isn't explored as much. Charms is also a light subject, as Rowling says and yet its treated like the greatest subject to ever exist. Since it's the most difficult branch of magic, I'd expect it to be much more than 'conveso verto' and just transfiguring stuff. If like to see more sub-branches that aren't elaborated on in canon. Like, is there dark transfiguration?

** Linkffn(Hallowed) has a Triwizard Challenge based around Transfiguration. It doesn't delve too deeply into the mechanics of Transfiguration, but it's an interesting look at what type of mindset might be required to perform Transfiguration.

It's not a major part (nor is the fic long), but linkffn(What Lies Beneath) has a great little section of Battle Transfiguration when Remus is trying to explain to Harry different types of dueling. Still one of the first things I think of when considering transfiguration used in battle.

Edit: What You Leave Behind isn't a great example, actually. Most of what I was remembering Dumbledore do in that battle is Animation, which straddles the line between Transfiguration and Charms I think.

**** For me I didn't like it because of how pretentious its trying to be. It is far from the perfect fic yet it pretends it is. Firstly there are problems with the pacing - for example, I remember there being a lot of 'reactions' like when Harry does something impressive, it is often followed with a couple of lines of reactions from the characters around him, and in this fic, that happens a number of times (omake chapters aside). Moreover, for how much the story and it's fans have claimed it to be 'rational', several users have repeatedly pointed out that some of the theories mentioned in the story were used incorrectly or straight up inaccurate.. Which ironically fits with the Harry portrayed.

Harry in this fic is a very flawed character (something that fans and the author don't seem to acknowledge). He suffers from the "smartest person in the room" syndrome - an inability to see a problem with his own line of thought, and has a difficulty accepting other people's POV on a matter because it doesn't align with his own, and it seems like Harry doesn't believe he can do wrong either. So, as you can expect, the Harry in MOR is often times condescending and frequently looks down on others that do not understand what comes out of his mouth even when what he says could possibly be wrong.

He makes a lot of assumptions throughout the fic. There were times where the story shows a lot of potential and smart writing that I liked but it's ruined by stuff like how Harry came up with his theory on dementors. If I recall correctly, Harry /guessed/ the nature of a dementor and applied a corresponding theory, and only succeeded not because of a series of rational deductions but by a lucky guess. What happened to the rational process? I know for a fact this fic had some good ideas and even had a chapter on how Harry and Draco narrowed down their hypothesis to conclude on a theory, and it sure did not rely on luck yet here we are.

I felt like this not only contradicts the whole rational thinking theme of the story, it was also a wasted opportunity. I think I would have enjoyed the fic a lot better if Harry wasn't portrayed as this arrogant infallible genius, had it been written as him making the wrong assumptions and failing as a result and having to face the consequences instead of the author bullshitting his way out of problems, I think it could have been a great way to knock Harry off his high horse and begin his development as an actual character over the course of the story. As it is, can you even call Harry a person? He's written as such a one dimensional character here.

Another redditor wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3096lk/spoilers_all_a_critical_review_of_hpmor/][a critical review]] about it that really resonated with what I was feeling reading HPMOR. To summarise:

#+begin_quote
  The story wants to teach us lessons, but wants to teach them through a flawed character, and a flawed teacher. Harry's condescension and jargon-dense explanations are perfectly in character, but they make it difficult for a reader who isn't already familiar with the subject matter to understand what he's saying. This is compounded by the author's decision not to look things up, a decision that was made in the name of realism but which undercuts the story's ability to teach.
#+end_quote

So I don't recommend hpmor, but if you're interested in "rational" characters that actually feel real and experience growth instead of a parody of one, I recommend Worm and Mother of Learning. There's no such thing as the perfectly rational character, that only exists in imaginations and fantasies, a character can only be rational with the information he/she has and even then there's limits due to the fallings of a character but I do believe it's the flaws and the character's ability to work through those imperfections that make a character so great and relatable.

E: finally had time to reorganise my thoughts about it.

**** It was the first fanfiction I ever read so I'll always have a little nostalgic affection for it. Unlike most fanfiction the author is pretty polished in terms of spelling, grammar, and punctuation.

The story has been criticized for featuring inaccurate science even though it claims factuality. The protagonist also comes across as a bit of a smug smarmy knowitall.

For my money it's too long for me to be willing to reread. I enjoyed it at first read but I'm looking for different things in stories nowadays.

**** Unpopular opinion, but overall I really enjoyed the fic. Yes, it has problems and is basically the way for the author to wank about their worldview, especially as it relates to immortality and AI and basically lifting arguments on existence directly from their previous writings. Yes, Harry solves quite a lot of his problems/makes realizations just through theorizing about stuff. However, Harry is a flawed character in a fun way, and most of it is on purpose and allows him to grow drastically during the story. The action scenes are fun, even though a common complaint is that they're unnecessary/gratuitous after a certain point. At a base level, the writing is actually well-edited, which already puts it in the top 1% of fics, but it also proposes some interesting aspects of the worldbuilding and magic. Its also very good at being self-aware about being a fanfic, especially as it plays with canon plot threads, directly addresses them, or depends on your knowledge of them to shape your perception of certain characters.

Note that mechanically transfiguration is different in this fic than in canon, but it's definitely delved into.

It's not the greatest fic I've ever read, certainly, but it's the third most favorited Harry Potter fic on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] for a reason and is much better than some of the other fics in the top 10 (Harry Crow). Unlike Harry Crow, though, it's something that I recommend everyone give a read. Even though it only covers Harry's first year, all major plot threads from canon are resolved or addressed at some point.

It's main fault, other than Harry being an insufferable munchkin before his character development, is that every arc has a few major actions followed by several chapters of characters essentially reacting to and discussing the revelations. Also if you have knowledge about the science, a lot of it is treated as fact, even though it's a lot of pop psych stuff, i.e. it's written by someone who's read a couple wikipedia articles about psychology and physics without actually understanding them much.

Don't be intimidated by the number of chapters, since many of them are short (there's one chapter that's literally just one sentence), and the arcs are clearly delineated if you choose to take a break.

**** It's that bad, but only 1% of the time (the redacted Ghost Busters chapter being the main example). At many other times, it's got excellent ideas. So, if you're capable of ignoring the occasional part of the story that's awful and pushing onwards, I'd recommend it. If you're especially sensitive to characters who come across as arrogant, then you probably want to skip it. I personally never found the main character to be nearly as obnoxious as other people have, but there are enough people out there who say they did that I believe them.
