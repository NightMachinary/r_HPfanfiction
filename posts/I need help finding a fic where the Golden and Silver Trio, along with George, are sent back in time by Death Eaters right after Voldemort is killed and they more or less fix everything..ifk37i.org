:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
At the start, it's only the two trios because they were caught in the attack first (in first year), and then it's George later (around second or third year) and he shares his memories with Fred because Fred had died and they weren't on the same page anymore. They all become Animagi and I'm pretty sure that they out Pettigrew at the beginning or something and Harry ends up with living with Sirius (this, I am unsure about, but I know he does end up with Sirius as his guardian). All of them mess around with glamours/transfiguration and make themselves a collective vault or whatever and they make themselves a little group. They end up sending "howlers" to Dumbledore and Lucius for somethings, I believe, and Luna and Hermione pretend to be twins via twin speak so they won't suspect Fred and George as being them. The fic ends with Harry and the group killing Voldemort at the end of the Goblet of Fire. Also, Harry and Ginny and Hermione and Ron are together, and I think Luna and Neville may have gotten together, too. I'm pretty sure this was on AO3 but I can't find it so it may be on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]].

Also, Luna gets into Gryffindor with them and I think they're referred to as the "Gryffindor Six" or something. I think Luna ends up going with one of the twins to Hogsmeade or something (I forget) and Neville might actually have gone to the Yule ball with Hannah Abbot.

Thanks for the help!

  How do you heal them faster? Get sent back in time and correct things. Some chars are OOC.
