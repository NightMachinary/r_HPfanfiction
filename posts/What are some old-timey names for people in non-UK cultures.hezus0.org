For those of you who don't know, a significant portion of the Magical names in Harry Potter are not commonly used in the UK in modern times. Names like Muriel, Albus, Euphemia, or Horace do exist in older generations though.

This got me thinking, and since I know we have some relatively involved non-UK folks in the subreddit here, I thought I'd ask - what are the equivalent 'older generation' old-timey names that Rowling-Magical Humans in other cultures might use? Are there equivalents in your culture? eg. What might the century-old Magical people in Japan be called? What kind of names would fit for Fleur's grandparents?

This isn't research for a story or anything, I'm just curious.


** Jean, Louis, Pierre, Eugène Jeannette, Louise, Germaine

For france

Johannes, Ludwig, Peter, Alexander, Ulrich Margitta, Helene, Kriemhilde, Elfriede

** Germany has fewer distinctly old-timey names than Britain, and many of those don't exactly have a magical vibe. Walter and Elke don't exactly sound like a wizard and a witch.

Bad example 1: Siegfried von Richthofen. Stereotypical über-Germanic first name and the surname inspired by the Red Baron. Sounds more like a cartoon villain. Unless you're writing a cross-over with Iron Sky, stay away from names like that.

Bad example 2: Elke Meier. Sounds like a generic elderly woman who yells at people crossing a red traffic light.

Good example 1: Wilhelmine Schubert. Old timey name, surname is fairly common, but could be a reference to the 19th century composer.

Good example 2: Aloisius Wolpertinger. This is a slightly more whimsical example, similar to the names of those textbook authors in the original books. Aloisius is a very old-timey choice, and a Wolpertinger is a fictional creature from Bavaria.

*** I think I've seen Aloisius used in a fic, actually. The name sounds familiar, at any rate. And yeah, your first example definitely sounds Full British Pulp Novel Villain. Can imagine Indiana Jones punching him in the face. :D

Thank you for covering both criteria, incidentally. I'm personally not asking the question for any writing-research reason - I'm just curious and culturally nerdy, so I wanted to know if that English name-age perception existed in other cultures. It's an interesting point that, while the name-age thing exists, some of those names don't entirely work in a Rowling-Magical context.

Though if I ever need an old Germanic Woman to yell at youths who keep doing broomstick-flyovers of her house, I'll keep Elke Meier in mind. :D

**** Completely, JK's Wizarding World seems to be anachronistic and have a sort of "reverence towards the past", so any of these names that were fairely used in the XVIII/XIX centuries should work. Other names I really see fitting on a local Magical Society are: Aurea (f, "Golden") and Hipólito (m, "freer of Horses"), those were pretty common a generation ago.

** If you want something really dated then a doublename like Anna-Greta, Claes-Göran, Eva-Lotta or Per-Åke. Popular between the 1930s and 60s.

​

Quite a few of the older names have either stayed popular or risen to popularity once more. So an Astrid or Anton could be ninety seven just as well as seven. Some that didn't stick around would be Ulla, Bengt, Kjell, Eva to name a few.

**** Depends a little on the name combination but generally speaking yes, a person with a doublename is most likely in their 60s or older. If it is made up of more modern names like Freja-Lis or Carl-Adrian, then it is more likely to be a young child.

Also, though I might also very well be wrong here, some names that the older generations from the side of my family that comes from the middle east are Salim, Johanna, Genevieve, Elie, Youssuf, George (the french pronounciation), and Joshua.

**** Hmm. Depends on quite a lot of things actually. The last name for example is always very important to give a character a certain "feel". Though Id say that Hermann in particular might not be the most magical name out there. For me the names Id connect with a (badass) old mage teaching at a school known for its rather dark curriculum would be sth along the likes of "Werner von Hagenburg", "Ludwig Maximilian Rotstein", "Richard Falkenberg" or "Willhelm, Freiherr (an old noble title) zu Münzburg"

*** A good suggestion, but I'm looking for names that are viewed as 'older generation' ones culturally, not necessarily historical ones. There's a semi-prevalent cultural perception of certain names here in the UK that they're 'old people names' - Enid, Muriel, Albert, Archie, Horace, etc - and they bring to mind older people when you hear them. I'm looking for names with that sort of cultural view attached, not necessarily names that were used in history.
