:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember much but Harry was raised by someone else (black maybe), and when he goes to Hogwarts he goes under a different name. He has a younger sister (Rose, i think) and I think she was the girl who loved. I remember he is really protective over her, even if he can't tell her he is her brother. I remember a scene during the tournament, where the dragon almost kills her and he jumps in the and protects her and i think thats how he gets outed.


** I hate to say it, but it's way too general. That actually describes most 'Harry has a sister' fics.
