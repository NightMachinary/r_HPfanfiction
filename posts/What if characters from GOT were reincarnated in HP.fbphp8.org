I am mostly curious about the type of wands (wood, flexibility,core) would be most compatible with people like Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, Sansa Stark and Bran Stark, what you guys think?


** Daenerys: Dragon Heartstring core, (for obvious reasons) long wand (symbolizes her strength of character), volatile wood (a nod to her family's history of madness and her eventual loss against it)

Sansa: Very sturdy wood, (doesn't break in the face of adversity) Phoenix Feather Core (personality was reborn after her innocence was burned out of her), long wand (symbolizes her strength of character)

Arya: flexible wood (symbolizes her adaptability and is a nod to her face-changing ability), thestral tail hair core (a nod to her connection and familiarity with death), long wand (symbolizes strength of character)---basically Arya has the elder wand lmao, and it's kind of funny I give it to her since she's not even my fave character, but it just fits well

Jon: Phoenix feather core (a nod to his rebirth after death), sturdy wood (signifies his unwavering loyalty), average length (he does not have a strong a character as the prior three, but he does not have a weak character either)

Bran: unicorn tail hair core (symbolizes his purity), average wand length (for the same reason as jon), sturdy wood (despite his disabilities he persevered, so this is a nod to his strength)
