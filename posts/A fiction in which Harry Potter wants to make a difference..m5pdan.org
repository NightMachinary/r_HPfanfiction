I think it would be interesting to see how Harry, after entering the Wizarding World and meeting Draco Malfoy in Madam Malkin, would like to know about "wizarding families" and the situation in the Wizarding World in general.If I were him, I wouldn't be satisfied with the answer "Everyone in Slytherin ended badly", I'd be determined why that happened. And I'd love to see the fanfiction where Harry decides to improve Slytherin's reputation.


** Slytherin's reputation in canon is very well deserved, and the best way to improve it is to destroy Voldemort, bring his sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazi minions to justice, thoroughly 'de-Nazify' this house (and the Ministry), and ask the Sorting Hat to NOT dump every blood purist there.

Harry as an 11 years old can do very little, especially considering top Wizard Nazi Lucius Malfoy also sits on the school board and has an inside track to the government. IMHO, the best opportunity to finally fix the Slytherin house is after the War, after Voldemort has been destroyed, after the Malfoys have surrendered, and after a significant part of the Ministry has been purged.

*** My fic has a lot going on, but one of the things Harry wants to do, is create an equal and just society. And he believes the first important step might be to abolish the house system, and simply sort kids based on gender and age.

It's a logical thing to do, I think. Most of the bigots, and blood supremacists come from families who have been sorted into Slytherin for generations.

They are raised in the "life", go to Hogwarts, and are almost always sorted into a house, packed with people who share those same ideals.

It makes sense to me, to mix everyone together, to broaden the kid's perspective.

** Evitative by Vichan and its sequel do this a bit? Iinkao3(Evitative) .

There's some good magic theory/lore about knight and dark magic and how being a dark wizard and following Voldemort can be mutually exclusive. It just so happens that many old magical families who lean dark go into Slytherin but Harry intends to show that dark magic is not all bad and by extension, Slytherin. Hope that's what you're looking for!

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

** linkffn(7374621)

It's a post-war fic and following the events fresh in everybody's minds, people jump on the Slytherin-hate bandwagon. The thing is that even people who fought on the right side, such as Andromeda, receive that hate. Harry tries to defend them but ends up getting some hate in turn. The conflict is represented by Harry's attempt to prove not all Slytherins are bad.

  In the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry felt tired. In the morning after the morning after, he was downright exhausted. The war may be over, but there are still battles to be fought.
