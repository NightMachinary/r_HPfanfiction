** I agree with you, Hermione is the most overated character.

I think that it's mostly due to the movies, but people don't understand that she isn't pretty or smart. She is intelligent, yes, but that only mean that she can read a book, learn it perfectly and repeat it if needed. However she is not smart (and Snape's riddle during first book doesn't count, a kid in elementary school could have solved it) and she is absolutely not wise.

I hate her so much that I can't read any fic where she is Harry's friend even if the fic is "good". But I can't stand free bashing too.
