  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** There are very few. The best one, where Harry is truly a Hufflepuff, is:

The Best Revenge - linkffn(4912291)

There are others, but they aren't as great:

A Badger's Champion - linkffn(10965962)

EDIT:

Forgot to link this, since it's TECHNICALLY what you asked for but not really, it is super funny though, wouldn't mind something longer with the premise: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12786039/1/A-Nasty-Common-Name][A Nasty Common Name]]

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

It's an AU where Harry is raised by a clan of werewolves.

And thanks to this we get to see an extremely loyal Harry that goes to Hufflepuff.

** The story [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter The Dragon]] is set in a notably darker version of the HP universe (and worryingly, Wizarding Britain is one of the more progressive nations). Harry is almost unaffected by this as due to a magical accident as a child, he's now a Dragon (by the time he enrolls in Hogwarts, he's learned how to take on a human form... and a Centaur form, and a pigeon form...). He even has his own Damsel (a Centaur named Suze) and is friends to her whole clan (although he did have to slap down Bane once).

Yep, he's a totally angst-free Harry who lives in a world that he totally fails to be angsty at.

And the Sorting Hat almost swears in shock when it's time to Sort him.

Also, he and Hedwig can both talk to young dragons. Dumbledore, Sirius, and the Potters are all rather nasty people in this, so don't read if that's going to infuriate you.
