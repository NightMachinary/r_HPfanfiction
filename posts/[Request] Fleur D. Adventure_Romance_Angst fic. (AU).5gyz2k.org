I'm looking for a long series covering multiple school years with Fleur D. being the main protagonist, preferably starting her Year 1. having a reasonably good character progression and going through all the phases of a teenager/young adult and the difficulties that may bring. Smut is okay, aslong as it's not a "smut fic". F/F (femmeslash) pairings are prefered, but not after some major character building. Strong!Fleur.

This is a repost due to no responses in the one earlier.
