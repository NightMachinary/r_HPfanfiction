******* No it just underlines the urgency/importance of their current task. It really only works when people /aren't/ looking for you, as they can be actively distracted from the fact that they saw you. It's really a subtle thing; for example, you can't use it to get past a guard who has orders to not let anyone in. But if, say, a scientist is allowed through the door, the guard might be too preoccupied by his own concerns to actually look at you closely if you walk past wearing a lab coat and a clipboard.

*** That last one would explain why there's so few students at Hogwarts. I'm not sure that wizarding society would be sustainable without more people. I also can't imagine everyone in say Spain going to Beauxbatons. Maybe there's a Spanish school that doesn't have as high of a reputation. Also, what about the Australians and New Zealanders? Would they go to a school in Japan? (Pretty sure that would be the nearest one according to Pottermore) The idea of there being just 10 or so wizarding schools leaves a lot of weird situations like that. Homeschooling and apprenticeships would make sense too.

Edit: Building on that, I have to wonder about the overall abundance of muggleborns. I doubt that they would/could get apprenticeships, so I'm guessing that most of them would go to schools, which may make it seem like there's proportionally more muggleborns than there actually are.

Lupin was a good teacher, but I'm not sure how relevant a lot of the stuff he taught was to fighting death eaters. Crouch Jr. might have been one of the better teachers in some ways. Umbridge is Umbridge. Snape suffered too much from his personal issues to be a good teacher despite his great knowledge (that goes for Potions as well).

****** *Lord Howe Island*

Lord Howe Island (; formerly Lord Howe's Island) is an irregularly crescent-shaped volcanic remnant in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, 600 km (370 mi) directly east of mainland Port Macquarie, and about 900 km (560 mi) southwest of Norfolk Island. It is about 10 km (6.2 mi) long and between 0.3 and 2.0 km (0.19 and 1.24 mi) wide with an area of 14.55 km2 (5.62 sq mi), though just 3.98 km2 (1.54 sq mi) of that comprises the low-lying developed part of the island. Along the west coast there is a sandy semi-enclosed sheltered coral reef lagoon. Most of the population lives in the north, while the south is dominated by forested hills rising to the highest point on the island, Mount Gower (875 m, 2,871 ft).

**** Is it? There's never any discussion of tuition in canon, but there may be one that's never mentioned to Harry and there's the cost of supplies - we see multiple times that the Weasley family is struggling to provide the necessary school supplies for their kids.

Think about the Gaunt family, living on practically nothing except their magic; there may be a ton of agrarian-ish wizards living in what would be awful poverty in the muggle world, except their magic makes it sustainable.

Actually, it kinda fits into a medieval peasant vs aristocracy vibe, which roughly matches the mindset of much of the wizarding world.

The Weasleys, who are surprisingly poor, do indeed struggle to /muster up the money for the supplies/. If they truly had such problems just for the supplies, you'd think the tuition would be mentioned at some point. Also, destitute orphan Tom Riddle could afford Hogwarts? Really?

While I totally agree with you on the assessment that there are probably quite a few Gaunt-style wizard paupers around, I don't think the "peasant vs. aristocracy vibe" really exists in canon. Only a few of the purebloods are rich and noble-like (there's only the Malfoys, the Blacks, and arguably the Longbottoms, that we know of), and of those only the Blacks ever called themselves nobility (mark that the Blacks were notoriously nuts). There's no actual gentilry in the wizarding world, much as people like Lucius Malfoy may occasionally /act/ like it, and not even a big purebloods Vs. everyone else divide (at least nothing instutionalized).

You're right on the peasant vs aristocracy note as well. In retrospect, that was a bad metaphor to use, because the peasants and aristocracy were closely entwined with each other.

A better example would have been the lives of someone living in Boston (or some other east coast city) and on the Western Frontier in late 1800s/early 1900s America. Two vastly different lives, nominally under the same nation, but with very little influence upon each other. One lives in a "modern" society, with a currency-based economy, a functioning government, and academia/leisure. The other might not live within site of any non-family members, grow/make/produce everything they need themselves, and never do a lick of formal education. Both of these lifestyles coexisted at the same time within the same nation; I think it'd be possible for the same situation to occur in Wizarding Britain, if the population were low enough and the rural wizards took advantage of all the non-muggle-city space in the country.

I think this trope is just a case of running into Rowling's trouble with numbers concerning the population.

It's not like the wizarding world is an independant economy --- it doesn't need wizard farmers, because they buy their supplies from muggles most of the time --- so what we see seems reasonable. Presumably a half or so of the population work for the Ministry, a quarter of them own Diagon Alley shops and the like, and the last quarter are miscellania (Hogwarts academia, magical researchers, Quidditch players, artists...).

Like, why would they be on every wizarding home? That's like if in Star Wars every house had a personal deflector shield.

Though admittedly that would only refer to defence wards; I've seen wards in fanfic used for simply identifying people coming to the house, and I have this idea that Hogwarts has luck wards so that students don't fall off the moving stairs or see a basilisk eye-to-eye or et-cetera.

And instead of just wards on buildings, why not wards on people too? There's a slight leaning towards that in book 6, when Fred & George mention the support staff of the Ministry getting 500 Shield Hats from them...

** Magicals thrive in large, sparsely populated countries. Therefore, there are more magicals in Norway, Sweden and Finland (combined, of course) than in the UK, and Russia has a magical population in the thirty thousands. Belgia and Netherlands, on the other hand, has so few that they even share most Ministry of Magic departments. (And one of those Chinese ghost towns is definitely a magical city with loads of muggle repellants.)

Castelobruxo, Mahoutokoro and all those other /Google Translated Academy of Magic/ schools don't exist (or at least do under another name). Full stop. Most magicals are educated at home, under apprentices or in unofficial hedge schools.

Occlumency is rare, and legilimency is even rarer. In 1996, the only master legilimens in the UK were Voldemort, Snape, Dumbledore and two "mind healers" (a weird psychotherapist/brain surgeon mix) at St Mungo. Bellatrix Lestrange was merely a dilettante compared to those.

EDIT: Also, whenever Rowlings numbers (in the books or anywhere else) clash with the world, it's the numbers that lose. No, Hogwarts anno 1991 didn't have 1000 students, there weren't 700 wizards working on the World Cup stadium and they didn't have 100,000 guests during said event.

Therefore, there are more magicals in Norway, Sweden and Finland (combined, of course) than in the UK, and Russia has a magical population in the thirty thousands. Belgia and Netherlands, on the other hand, has so few that they even share most Ministry of Magic departments. (And one of those Chinese ghost towns is definitely a magical city with loads of muggle repellants.)

** Bellatrix used to be the "rebel" while Andromeda was the "good" daughter who couldn't help whom she fell in love with. All Black sisters were/are close to each other and ideology wise were closer to Grindelwald than to Voldemort (why kill muggles if you can rule them/make them work for you).

Overall makes for a more interesting narrative than simply "Andromeda always knew that blood purity was wrong, that's why she married Edward, Bellatrix liked to eat Kitten hearts, so she joined the Death Eaters". I've included variations of this in all of my stories because I like that idea.

**** Then again, what we mainly see is her post-Azkaban state. Before that we have mostly just the statements of people on the exact opposite side talking about her. I'd think that there is plenty of creative space there to characterize Bellatrix in a lot of ways.

I regret not having saved the fic in which she was the one getting Sirius hooked on muggle stuff. I remembr that it was loosely based on the story of an european ISIS fighter, who was a well educated, open-minded and kind man struck by cruel fate, who gradually got into a downward spiral of fanaticism and hate after the wrong people "helped" him grief. In the story Bellatrix' breaking point was Andromeda's treason against her, opening her up for the stories of the all corrupting mudblood, born from filth and stealing sisters.

**** In my personal headcanon she wasn't even a blood purist during her childhood but saw muggles as second grade people because they had no magic but wasn't above using their products (like beer and cigarettes). She was forced into the Lestrange marriage after Andromeda eloped and was then conditioned to follow Voldemort's ideology (torture those muggleborns or get tortured yourself). She wasn't born a monster, she was made one (and Andromeda blames herself for it since she involuntarily set that chain of events in motion). Bellatrix was always quick to resort to violence (you made my sister cry so now I'm going to break every bone in your hand) but only became unhinged after the marriage. That's what I use in my stories at least.

** I like the idea of some sort of family curse of the Black Madness a lot. It's a fun concept, if it goes beyond the boring psychotic killer stereotype. As OP said, the "fun" kind of madness is often left out when writing the Blacks, but its a great little niche to explore.

I'm also fond of the fanon concept that Hermione's parents were rather distant with her, and grew even more distant with each year, until eventually when Hermione finds them in Australia, all that remains is aquaintances with a phantom of familiar relation in the background. I like to think with this concept - about how the muggle and wizarding world try, but ultimately fail to work together. Imagining the Grangers and their relation with their daughter holds a lot of potential for creativity. Some write them as fascinated by magic - even researching it themselves. But I tend to like the idea that this highly educated couple has problems dealing with the fact that their daughter is like out of a fairytale. Growing up Hermione must've had some bouts of magic happening. Then the Hogwarts letter, and it was all explained. "Our daughter is a witch". And the more and more Hermione talked about potions and charms and transfiguration, probably using the appropriate, completely alien terminology to describe it, the more the Grangers felt a rift between them and their child. And then I sometimes saw these breaking points built in. E.g. Hermione's grandfather is in his deathbed. "Can't you heal him? DO SOMETHING! YOU'RE A WITCH!". And you have both her parents and Hermione herself realizing that they're drifting apart and there really is nothing they can do about it.

Except for the wand and the twins' shop, everything else make more sense with a £5/galleon conversion. And even then, you can assume there's a subsidy on the wands and that wizards value property differently (or the ~1000 might have been an advance payment on a loan or sometihng...). Also, there has been some massive inflation in the muggle world over the last 100 years, and the richest wizards didn't seem like the type to do business with muggles.

I have had textbooks that cost about $200, or about £140, but that's a high point and still lower than £450. £5,000 seems a bit low for a tournament that promises fame and glory though. Of course, there is always that old stand-by that Rowling is bad with numbers.

Wizards valuing property differently is a very good point. I'd imagine that it would be relatively easy to build a house. Muggle household goods like pans, pans, towels, furniture, etc. would be easy enough for a moderately skilled witch or wizard to make from a twig or something.

Inflation is definitely an interesting point. Britain has had worse inflation than the US given that it used to be something like $5 per £1 about a century ago.

The goblins probably control the influx of muggle money tightly, so there's no muggleborn taking over the economy.

Also, according to [[https://www.sunlife.co.uk/blogs-and-features/the-price-of-a-home-in-britain---then-and-now][this article]] and [[https://www.nationwide.co.uk/-/media/MainSite/documents/about/house-price-index/downloads/uk-house-price-since-1952.xls][this spreadsheet]], the 1000 galleon price could have bought a house in the muggle world some twenty five years earlier.

Also, 60p (2 sickles, what Aberforth charges for a bottle of butterbeer) got you a pint in the 80's.

In my headcanon, the British magical economy has been at a standstill for quite some time, and hasn't exactly thrived during the wizarding wars.

** - Sentient Hogwarts. I don't always use it in my stories but I like the idea.

- Most ancient mythologies were actually about shut-off-from-muggleborns communities of pureblood wizards who used their power and knowledge to be worshipped by the muggles. Zeus, Ra & Co. were all just powerful wizards. The Olympians had access to a Philosopher's Stone (Ambrosia and Nectar = Philosopher's Stone and Elixir).

- Related to the above, all the humanoid sapient species are the result of prehistoric tribes of wizards whose accidental magic mutated them based on what they valued. House-Elves became small, discreet and fleet-footed to escape large predators; Goblins were a tribe of cave-dwellers whose magic evolved to fit their crafting of rock-based weapons ;Dementors were a tribe of specialized Legilimenses whose existence came to rely more on more on stealing the thoughts of others; etc.

- Aragog never sought to eat humans and weakly objected to his children doing so, he was just growing too old to prevent them and their mother Mosage was a /very/ bad influence.

- Cornelius Fudge was a Slytherin; that's why he keeps listening to people like Lucius Malfoy and Umbridge --- as little as they have in common, they were essentially at school together.

- Goblin culture highly values briskness and efficiency. Goblins at Gringotts are always annoyed because the wizards are always fussing things over and taking away valuable time and saying things that don't need to be said (like these pointless "hello" things).

- Arithmancy is /supposedly/ rooted in Divination, but really has more to do with Charms Theory; only, all that complicated stuff only comes up in high years, and the first years of Arithmancy are just plain maths, which the wizards sorely need. It's kept a secret from the Ministry, of course.

  You gotta admit that canon Harry is quite an inaccurate portrayal of a neglected child
#+end_quote

I... I don't know. Abused children manifest in many different ways, and I do see some of the patterns Harry exhibits in myself or my brothers. Quidditch being something he does to ignore his problems, behaving recklessly with disregard for his own safety, thinking he's gotta solve every problem himself, ...

Like he isn't one of the typical steretypes, but some of the stuff might be quite fitting.

**** That's important. It manifests differently. I said this below already, but as an abused child myself, I don't see anything of me or my experiences in Harry. I'm too anxious and cautious to the point of being an actual shut-in, hardly leaving my apartment more than once a week. Sometimes less than that. Whenever I do, I'm not good around people, especially other women. I jump at loud laughter, doors closing, or when someone just brushes up against me. My head is always on a swivel. When I go to take out the trash or get the mail, sometimes I run because my mother was a very impatient person when I was a kid, and she'd punish me for being too slow with anything. Of course, most times she'd punish me for no reason, or made up reasons. But that's besides the point.

My point is, that all of this doesn't mean anyone else's experiences aren't...correct? Valid? The right way to be? I'm sorry, I don't know how to say it, how to word it.

*** As an abused child myself, yes, I've always found him to be inaccurate. But I do understand that JK Rowling was writing a children's series, and she wrote it way back in the 90's, when laws and studies about those things weren't as good as they are now.

** Mind arts like in "HP and the Prince of Slytherin" or "The Legacy"

Magical Maturation (not necessarily super powerful) because it reminds me of a condition from another book series written by Marion Zimmer Bradley, called "Darkover", where after you hit 12~13 years, you get extremely sick for a few days, sometimes even dies, but it awakens your ESP powers, called "Laran".

Black heritage, I love when they use either Arcturus or Dorea as a role model or something like that, even Cassiopeia.

Time and Dimension Travel.

** Anything that explores how magic works. Is it like a muscle, where the more it's used the better it gets? Or is it more like the core of your being, the very most truth of who you are? Anything that delves in to that is cool.

I have grown increasingly more interested in AUs, mainly cause I've read every single variation of the Hogwarts years as presently constructed. Wrong BWL, Harry in Slytherin, GirlHarry, etc. Give me more things like the Unspeakables taking Harry and training him as a child to fight, or Harry being taken in by a sect of wizarding society who raise him. Change the whole format. I'm toying with an idea where Voldemort doesn't die trying to kill Harry (or he does but is quickly resurrected) and the wizarding world becomes a warzone. No Hogwarts, it's more like a Mad Max society.

** I have never actually seen this used before in a fic, but I absolutely love the idea of Fred Weasley II and Louis Weasley Sorted into Slytherin. And they insist the Weasley Twins and the Mauranders' are not real pranksters as you have to be a Slytherin to be a true prankster.

...it could totally happen as Louis and Fred the second's Houses are never confirmed as far as I'm aware.

** I like it when Magic becomes a bit more tangible. They all go to a school, so it seems like Magic can be taught and follows some kinds of rules and logic, yet Magic remains extremely vague and is used to solve all kinds of problems without explaining how that works.

I like it when there's some kind of "Mana" system too (though not when Magical Cores are involved, they are just an excuse to make Harry have a really large "Magical Core" and be super powerful). There should be a downside to shouting 20 "Bombarda!"-s down a hallway and there should be an advantage to dodge a spell instead of casting a Protego. Lazily casting Protegos and conjuring objects in the path of Killing Curses should be a sign of either Arrogance or incredible amounts of power.
