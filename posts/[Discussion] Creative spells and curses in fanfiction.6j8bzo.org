I just had a random thought during my time perusing YouTube, specifically watching an acapella version of the Lavender Town theme. My thought was, 'Has anyone written a fic where Harry or some other person creates a curse that causes people to hear the Lavender Town theme just out of earshot? If not, then should I?' I was thinking that it could be a Dark!MuggleBorn/Dark!MuggleRaised!Harry that knows of the song and its reputation and turns it into a curse that would drive the victim insane with the constant, inescapable music before compelling them to commit suicide, but it is all very, very subtle, unable to be picked up by the basics of anti-curse magics.

Moving on, it brought me to the subject of creative spells and curses you've seen in the realm of fanfiction. From spells that make people vomit their entrails, to causing their genitalia to grow teeth, to what have you. If you could, could you mention the spell name (Incantation and common name) as well as its effect and which fic it came from.


** linkffn(Wind Shear) has some pretty cool spell ideas, particularly animations/transfigurations. Harry's fighting style is certainly more interesting than the typical magical slugfest that fanon fights tend to favor.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** I don't remember the fic, but it had Harry using a coloring spell to turn the surface of peoples' eyes black, thus effectively blinding them without using any dangerous curses.

  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron...and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry. A look at a Hermione who developed the instincts she evidenced with Marietta and Umbridge. AU, but canon-compliant.

** There are a lot of new spells in White Squirrel's /Arithmancer/ and /Lady Archimedes/, since Arithmancer Hermione keeps inventing them. Three examples: She weaponizes /Commotio Cordis/ with a spell of the same name, which makes the Death Eaters think she's managed to re-create the Killing Curse for a while. There's also a special Locking Charm that is actually transfiguration (welding the lock and padlock) rather than holding the lock in place like usual locking charms, which means no regular Unlocking Spell can cancel it. The latest chapter also had a Night-Vision Spell that increases the receptivity of the retina, allowing one to see all the stars in the night sky.
