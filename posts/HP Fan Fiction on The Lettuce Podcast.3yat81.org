The Lettuce Podcast is a garden of entertainment from books to television and everything in between. Hosts Charlotte, Laura, and Tori sit down every 2 weeks to have discussions, pose theories, make predictions, and gush about their favorite (and unfavorite!) things. Each episode also features topic themed games and quizzes. The girls also pair each theme to a special snack and drink. Join in to immerse yourself in fandom and geek out about entertainment!

Our newest episode is a Christmas Bonus Episode about fan-made Harry Potter Projects. One portion of the show deals specifically with fanfiction. We each read parts of /My Immortal/, the fiction famed for being the worst HP fan fiction ever written. Is it real or is it fake? We also each read a short fan fiction and summarized the story. Finally, all three hosts take a stab at creating subjects for a Harry Potter fan fiction in our Fun & Games segment. Other HP fan art discussed in this episode includes: Starkid's /A Very Potter Musical/ and /Potter Puppet Pals/.

*Note: This podcast CONTAINS SPOILERS. It also contains coarse language and may be NSFW depending on your work environment.*

*** Seriously. Any time my friends ask what I'm doing and I say I'm reading HPFF they all assume I'm either reading slash smut or just badly written drivel. When in reality there are so many good ones out there.

**** I was just discussing this with my brother the other day and it dawned on me that the reason I enjoy it so much is that each story (in theory) has it's own plot, but you don't have to invest any time learning the worldbuilding. If you think about any other really long series, such as say LotR, GoT, and Dune, with fanfiction you get those same plots but in half or fewer words because you're not spending any time on back story. It's all here and now. You don't have to redesign Hogwarts, it just is.

moshpitstories puts it very well in the summary of Natural Order:

  If you've got a chance to do it over again, why putz around? You know the game, you know the players, and you know the goal. It's time for Double Jeopardy, where the scores can really change.
#+end_quote

Or at least the objective is something like that. There is obviously huge piles of shit and a huge section of the fandom dedicated to porn (and a lot of overlap there) but finding and following the gems makes up for it.
