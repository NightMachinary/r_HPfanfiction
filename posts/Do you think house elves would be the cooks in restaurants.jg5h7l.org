They already cook in a commercial sense at hogwarts, why not in restaurants as well?


** If the house elves we see in canon are any indication, innovation and leadership may not be their strong suits.

So I think there will be a human executive chef that leads dish planning and directs a restaurant from day to day. However, I think the actual beings doing the cooking will be the house elves. The human chef would oversee it, make sure the dish is up to standards, and run the kitchen, but the house elves would be like line chefs (note: not cook so I could be wrong with the usage of this term).

*** Along those lines, I once read a fic that explained that house-elves will always cook a dish exactly the same way. That's really great for consistency, and for a restaurant, that would be great. But like you said, having a human around as a head chef would help a lot for anything that needs more creativity.

I also remember one fic where, due to the differences between human and house-elf palates, the house-elves underseason food, leaving it all rather bland. Of course, that was really just a way to justify Harry being able to impress people with his cooking.

So they're just making regular British food, then. :P

just picturing Gordan Ramsey surrounded in the kitchen by an army of House Elves is just making me crack up

** I'd imagine it would depend on the restaurant

Some would have humans,some elves and others a mix of both

*** I wonder what the distinction would be, like the wizard doesn't trust the elf or maybe it's cheaper
