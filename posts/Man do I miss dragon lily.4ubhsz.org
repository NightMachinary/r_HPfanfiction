From Werewolf Warrior, had a story called Dragon Lily that was just getting to the Fleur/Harry stuff when it when completely dark.

Too bad too, I really enjoyed it.


** not a fan of dark fics? I'm with you on that.

** Well... Fanfiction.io has only just started accepting submissions (even though it doesn't officially launch until Aug) and WW has begun posting it there... perhaps they are just switching platform?

*** I doubt it. Werewolf Warror took a lot of their stuff down and then it's been reposted as is the style of the internet. I vaguely remember WW having some issue where a friend or family member discovered their fanfiction and caused them to remove everything and vacate the fandom.

I bet the one on fanfiction.io is just someone else reposting again.

**** Well its author is listed as WW. And there is a gift for authors posting prior to the official launch so it might be a repost but by the actual author

***** No, it's being uploaded by vexuq, who has been the uploader on fanfiction.net (see [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11516452/1/A-Big-Happy-Weasley-Family]]), so I very much doubt it's being uploaded again.

****** I really don't care. :)

I saw OP mention a story I knew I had seen posted on FFIO in the last couple of weeks so I said as much.

I haven't read it and don't plan to.

** I just quite enjoyed how it was about the characters more than the big overly ridiculous fantasy action.

It was small and personal, really dig character development

** I just reread it the other day, still so disappointed that we missed out on all the good Harry/Fleur stuff right as it was starting
