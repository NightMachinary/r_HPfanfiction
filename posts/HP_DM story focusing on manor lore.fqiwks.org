*** On further thought, the story I'm remembering is the same as you describe, but it's Harry that's more in danger and Draco that knows what he's doing with all the manor lore. Still looking though. I think I read it on ao3 not ff.

This is the one I'm thinking of, does it look familiar to you? I swear I thought it was longer, but /shrug/
