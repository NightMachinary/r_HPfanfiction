Harry-Centric fics where magic comes easily to him, and he is actually interested in all the subjects. Kind of like Dumbledore when he first started Hogwarts.


** linkffn(What You Leave Behind) is /the/ fic of this sort.

linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) is another where Harry becomes very good at magic, though he doesn't really do so until 4th year.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
