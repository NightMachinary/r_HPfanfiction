I mean wizarding world was centuries ahead in many areas and have some alternatives to many muggle devices. But why again and again many authors trying to portray wizarding world as some poor country living in rock ages?

Magicals were already advanced in many areas than muggles. They don't need fancy vehicles to travel, they can teleport instantaneously to anywhere in the world. They have floo call equivalent to phone call. They can heal many diseases and wounds that non magical world can only dream of. They can repair anything with just a wave of their wand. They have better security systems in the form of magical protections.

Wizards don't need basic things like fridge, washing machine, oven, vacuum cleaner, dish washer and air conditioners. They have charms for that.

Magicals mastered space and time. They can travel through time for fucks sake and they can also expand space. It may take centuries for muggle world to achieve that.

Omnioculars are wizarding version of video camera and player.

They have truth serum, three drops and you will spill your every dirty little secret.

Wizards have awedome quills. From plain quill to auto answering quill(I think it can do fairly good calculations as well), dicta to quick-quotes, auto-spell correcting to anti-cheating quills abd self-inking to blood quills (not awesome but...).

Women enjoys better positions in wizarding world than muggle world. Helga and Rowena were able built a school and teach in 990 BC.

And importantly Wizards are not polluting the earth with their factories, vehicles and plastic bags.

Only things muggle world can boast was internet and mobile phones and TVs. But canon was happened in 90s so there must be some development in those areas. They have radio so TV was possible. May be they can use two-way mirrors and protein charms to make basic phone capable of video calling as we know mirrors only work in pairs.

Yes, we know muggles have great weapons of destruction. But power of military never equals to development and superiority. Plus how much time will it take for a fairly knowledgeable wizard to infiltrate military base and takeover all your weapons? Death Eaters put muggle junior minister under imperius(it was supposedly badly performed means it was most likely performed by someone lower in the DE ranks) and Kingsley was able to inftrate PM's office and gain PM's appreciation.

Wizards can create hurricanes(makes it impossible for air-force and navy) and destroy roads and bridges. And they can turn invisible, teleport anywhere they want, kill anyone and run away without any trace.

I don't think muggle world can easily win the war against the wizards like some authors trying to convey.


** I think they're two separate worlds and each has its advantages. I do think that Muggles have a leg up when it comes to science in all forms - Muggles have a greater understanding of the human body and how the world functions. (The bit about wizards being able to cure all sorts of diseases is somewhat fanon based; cancer was never mentioned in the books so we don't know how/if they would diagnose and cure something like that.) Wizards have the advantages you mentioned.

That said, if a war were to break out Muggles have a really big advantage: numbers. Unless the books seriously misled us, Muggles greatly outnumber wizards.

Knowing how deadly the first world war was and how shell-shocked the entire planet was at the casualty numbers coming out of that war does make me think that Muggles would eventually win. In WWI the allied forces had 42 MILLION forces compared to the central forces 22 million. Allied forces won. In WWII the numbers get sticky just because of how much of the world was involved, but the most common estimate for how many people died in WWII is 72 million - more than the allied and central forces of WWI combined.

72 MILLION - or around 3% of the human population at the time, which was around 2.3 billion. These days the human population is 7.5 billion. I don't think the total wizarding population even matches the number of people killed in WWII.

A second advantage is military strategy. How many freaking countries have been perpetually at war for decades and have the knowledge and knowhow to run huge armies? How often have wizards been at war, and are they still at war even when there isn't a wizarding war? Even then... aside from the Battle of Hogwarts, most of their war seems like tiny skirmishes - how often are armies actually pitted against one another? Muggles, on the other hand, don't seem to go a week without a battle.

In other words, I think Muggles would win because there's billions and billions of them and they continuously fight in wars because we're pieces of shit.

Or send cursed flames through London and let it burn. Millions dead, economy in shambles. Do this to the 25 largest cities and muggles would be in serious shit.

Imperio isn't 100% successful, as shown multiple times in the books.

Once Muggles figure out that they take out the wand and the wizard is mostly useless (which wouldn't take long), it becomes a much different story.

Wizard apparates in to assassinate someone with an AK, the wizard could be dead in the amount of time it takes to pull a trigger (why oh why is Avada Kedavra so many syllables?).

And if the wizards have relocated to islands, the Muggles just need to get one bomb in to vaporize them in an instant. It doesn't even need to hit the ground. Near surface would cause the most damage, but still: it just takes ONE.

And how is a muggle going to disarm a wizard before they are stunned/killed? Like... a stupify can be done before the muggle could even move.

Also, if the PM was asleep in bed, with a guard outside the room, it would be too late. Hell, you just can't protect the PM for every moment. Just follow around invisible till the right moment.

If wizards moved to an island to hide from a nuclear war... muggles have a lot worse things to deal with. Hell, we don't even know if a powerful wizard can transfigure a nuclear device into something else. Or a massive shield charm, Who knows?

****** Imperio was also shown to have different levels of effectiveness. That's what I'm referring to. And Harry can resist it because he has a strong will, not because it's a secret power of his.

Again, Muggles massively outnumber wizards. They can't stun all of them at once, and I don't think the wizards can wait to catch all 7.5 billion of them alone. And yes, you can protect a PM every minute. They'd never get a moment alone, but it is absolutely possible.

Invisibility probably won't be invisible to radar, Infrared, etc.

All of your "who knows" brings up a good point, though. To be completely honest, too much of this is based in hypotheticals since what we saw in the books is what we got. Based off of what we saw in the books and what we know of reality, Muggles have far more destructive power.

Like most wars, the majority of the population aren't fighters. Wizards, on the other hand, are trained to use their weapon from a young age.

But yeah, in the end there are too many hypotheticals because magic in HP is so unpredictable. We have no idea what's allowed or not.

Fidelius has only been shown as being used on dwellings/houses, not entire islands. Anti-Muggle spells were used on Hogwarts and the World Cup, but as the World Cup proved, it was far from perfect.

"Wards" are 100% fanon and are never a part of canon.

Most importantly, this whole thing is completely wild speculation considering we never saw Muggle weapons vs Wizard wands. Based off of the very real destruction bombs have caused makes anything we saw in the books look pale, I think humans are deadly AF. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

** So if the fight is strictly wizards vs muggles, ie no wizards helping muggles, then in my opinion wizards win every single time. I can almost guarantee pretty confidently the Dark Lord could take on every single muggle in the world. Nuclear Bomb? Transfigure it into a cat, Rain of deadly bullets? Turn to mist, Even if the Dark Lord was mortally wounded, he just has to possess the leader of whatever country and force that country to kill other muggles.

Now, why do authors use it? Most authors I know that use it, use it as a literary tool to help boost the argument for the "Dark Side's" goals which are fine it's a good tool and it's a believable argument when done right. Like the everyday witch or wizard may not be able to take on all the muggles, and so the Dark Lord is actually worried about the everyday witch/wizard because he knows deep down how cruel they can be. That would be an example of why saying, There's way more muggles out there, and we should actually be concerned about them.

*** The problem with using magic against modern weapons is that in the books, magic seems to be heavily limited based off of how fast the person can think or say the spell, and if they can see what they're casting it on.

You don't see bullets. You hear the bang, and then you're shot pretty much AS you're hearing the bang. You'd have to have cast the spell before you're hit. Same deal with bombs and other weapons. Sure, you can transfigured and/or vanish a meddlesome weapon, but it needs to be done before it kills you.

Another thing to consider is how ignorant wizards are of muggles. Do they even know what weapons we're capable of using, or if they do know, how prepared are they for them? Muggle studies is repeatedly referred to s a joke, and outdated. If they entered a war with us, then they may not even know we have the capability of nuclear weapons until we've wiped out one of their strongholds.

Personally, I think it would be a pretty even match. While wizards have magic, and guerrilla tactics on their side, muggles have the numbers game won EASILY. Wizarding Britain is supposed to be like 10,000. Great Britain alone has a population of 66 44 MILLION. to put that in perspective, that's 6,640 muggles to 1 wizard. Of course, that's not taking into account how many muggles are trained for combat, let alone combat with a wizard, but the same could be said for wizards.

**** That's certainly true it's highly dependent on how quickly you could nonverbally cast that's why I think in the books only Dumbles or the Dark Lord could take basically everyone because they both think incredibly quick. No regular wizard would be able to, but all it takes is for Dumbles and Voldy to survive one bullet, use a time-turner and not make the same mistake.

You make a lot of good points. The bomb argument is somewhat weak in my opinion because a lot of prominent wizarding places are in the middle of muggle places, and I can't really expect muggles to not only bomb their own cities but suddenly learn about every hidden wizard place.

You're right it wouldn't be as easy as I make it seem, they are vastly outnumbered but I imagine most muggles wouldn't fight these godlike creatures. A single wizard could apparate into a city and kill millions with a well-placed fiendfyre. Destroy their infrastructure, their buildings, their electricity. Not just transfigure weapons but transfigure people as well. Muggle combat is well provided you can even get close to the wizard, otherwise it's meaningless.

** Under certain circumstances (Muggles holding a position wizards want AND wards which stop apparation), Muggles win easily. If you remove those factors, they lose badly.

If you are talking about all-out war, Muggles cannot win. The imperius curse alone makes sure of that. They can, at the very most, make it a Pyrrhic victory by launching ICBMs, which wipe out all higher life on earth and devastate the ecosystem. But that is an "I'm taking you down with me" situation, not a victory.

This is also a tall order since it assumes that wizards haven't taken contingencies after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Honestly, the ICW could've formed a task force to ensure that every nuke is tracked and accounted for, and they are never launched, with wizards secretly keeping an eye on all of them.

**** There are no possible contingencies. Even if, for some reason, wizards would be immune, they are unable to save the eco system. Remember, the average wizard cannot even cast a proper shield spell. So you trade nearly instant death for starvation.

Even if you mind control high command, all you need to end the world is one SSBN or hidden base with standing orders to launch if their government falls. And the arsenal of even just one of these subs is enough to make Hiroshima look like a child throwing a fit. Also, if one launches, there will be retaliation strikes. Mutually assured destruction prevented a nuclear war exactly due to that.

All you need is one base/submarine slipping through, or even just two "patriotic" officers taking the initiative, and the magical victory turns into a pyrrhic one.

Also, the vast majority of wizards and witches is simply incompetent, and quite a few of those who are proficient are insane (Voldemort, Bellatrix).

And just clearing some of your points.

They've portkeys for kids and I'm sure you can take more luggage than car. Or floo travel. Harry and co traveled across the country with tent and lots of other things in a single bag.

I said many diseases and wounds not all. They were dak curses for a reason. And I'm sure muggle medicine can't over grow bones in overnight or heals wounds in seconds.

My point being was that it was stupid to think that wizards are not some savages just because they don't own some electronics.

Magicals can charm their houses invisible to muggles. So it was near impossible to attack something you can't see.

Again those awesome quills are equivalent to many muggle products and wizards don't need voice recorders, dicta phones and word processors.

India, Pakistan and N.Korea are better than many countries in military power but they are way behind in Poverty and development.

Kingsley infiltrated PM's office (only point of contact) and I don't think Military compund was secure than PM's office.

Magicals can kill military and political leaders and can get every secret using veritaserum. No war survives without leaders. And not all people fight in the war.
