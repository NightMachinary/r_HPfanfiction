Looking for a story within which Harry is either A: Some sort of eldritch horror a la Cthulhu, B: Makes a deal with an eldritch horror/elder god/other name for horrifying unfathomable entity. Preferably complete and with no slash, but if there aren't any complete fics of this nature I'll take incomplete.

  An assortment of Harry Potter one shots. Though listed as "Humor/General," the collection also contains Drama, Horror, Family, and Tragedy, as well as a few experimental fiction stories as I work out my stylist chops. Contain crossovers with several fictional worlds, including the Cthulhu Mythos, Starship Troopers, Star Wars, and James Bond.

** Possibly not quite what you were looking for, but IIRC linkffn(9097983) has some fitting elements. It's the first part of a series, but the sequel seems to be abandoned.

Also I seem to remember linkao3(7795306) as an entertaining oneshot.

#+begin_quote
  The first time Petunia looked at the monster, she thought it was her Daddy. He had the same wild black hair, and a very similar face -- but his eyes were bright green, just like Petunia's Mummy's. Petunia blinked, and looked again, and this time, it was as though she was seeing what was really there. Petunia could still see the man who looked like her Daddy, but overlaid was something terrible, with manifold tentacles and toothy mouths and great, sinister eyes that hurt even to look at. It became apparent in an instant that Petunia was not looking at a man, but a monster. Terrified, she began to scream.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

** This exact thing is actually what I'm about to write about. A Harry Potter/Dresden Files Crossover.

I had the idea of Lily and James making a deal that would kick in if they died. Knowledge for their souls. But it didn't hit Harry until the horcruxes in him was destroyed (At the end of GOF for this). This in turn gets him in trouble with the Archive and thrown in to the Oblivion War which in turn introduces the Dresden Files world at large.

I should probably read some of these stories to get an idea on how to proceed.

Thinking of adding some slight Elder Scrolls to it. Hermeaes Mora being the dark god they sacrificed themselves too. Would also allow for Dragons to play a big part because of the similarities between TES and the Dresden Files.

*** If you do to through with this I'd recommend hitting up the Dresden files sub. They know a lot of backstory there and would be able to help.

With that said, at your current divergence point the biggest issue you would have is that Ivy as the Archive wouldn't even be born at that point. While it's not confirmed, the best timeline have DF starting around 2000 or so, which is 6 years after GOF. Ivy doesn't show up until book 6 I believe, which is around 2005 or so.

So either you fudge the timeline, or you make Ivy's grandma the Archive in question as when she dies, Ivy's mom commits suicide to avoid being the Archive.

I like the idea, and you can ignore everything I just wrote, but figured I'd give you some unasked for input.

**** I've read the entire Dresden Files series multiple times. More than I've done Harry Potter in fact.

The answer is simple; change the HP timeline to modern day.

That way the Archive is already with Kincaid.
