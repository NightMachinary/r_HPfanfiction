Basically, my title, she dies like in canon, but revives after Voldemort is "Vanquished" almost kills Snape with the Killing Curse when he reaches the Cottage. She bails to Petunia, Manage to convince her to ditch Vernon, they live in the same house, she also was pregnant before the night of Halloween so Harry got a little sister called Rose? (not sure on her name).

From memory it's on Ao3.

It's a quite good one, if a bit bittersweet

*** Nice thank you! I'm suprised it was made by the same author of *Heart of Wire, Crown of Grass* (One of the only decent OC/Tom Riddle Jr fiction that exists on the internet) and I didn't even realize.
