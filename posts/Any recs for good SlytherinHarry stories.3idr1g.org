#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

*** This one is good but I do have some fears for where it is going. Drizzle is doing some Dresden level of dumping crap on the protagonist, and I'm not sure he can work it out as well as Butcher.

Ginny is okay in this fic, but it's still upsetting that it seems to be heading towards H/G. Katie was nice, even though it was clear it was nothing serious - oh well, will just have to wait and see.

***** Agreed.

As this fic proves, a good writer can take a walk into cliche-land, and still have a great story. A bad writer can be as novel as he wants, but the story will suffer from the same issues regardless.

It is all about how the author handles it. If we complain about cliches in our reviews, what we really mean is 'author, you are bad.'

By the way, this is a great recommendation.
