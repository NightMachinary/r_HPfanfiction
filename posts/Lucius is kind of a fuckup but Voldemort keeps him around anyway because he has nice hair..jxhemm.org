** Lucius' has a meticulous hair routine that absolutely includes a sleeping bonnet to protect it from breakage. This was unfortunately revealed when he was summoned late at night and apparated half asleep. Now Bellatrix passes him crude stick figure drawings of death eater masks with floral bonnets during the meetings when he can't respond because drawing attention to them would mean facing the Dark Lords /cruciatus/ for being distracted.

**** Jason Isaacs, the actor who played Lucius asked to have long hair to contrast with Tom Felton's look for Draco, which was sleeked back, platinum blond hair. And it worked üòä The look is so iconic üëå

** 'Lucius,' The Dark Lord Formerly Known As Tom said.

'Yes, my Lord?' Lucius looked up from were he had been counting and ordering his socks, grumbling that there was one missing, /again./ Honestly, how did they expect him to keep his dignity with two /different socks/? Must be those thieving House-Elves.

'I wanna change my name. Any suggestions?'

'Well m'lord, most purebloods just use their name and trust it'll be feared.'

The Dark Lord gestured in exasparation. 'yes, yes, but most are stupid enough to get caught within /weeks/. Plus, I can't call myself Dark Lord Tom! Can you imagine?'

'What about 'Riddle', m'lord? Or 'The Riddler?'

'No, that's a muggle supervillain and also way to obvious. I want something /grand,/ something that'll immortalise me through the ages, something that'll show how sophisticated I am!'

'Something French, m'lord?'

** This doesn't quite match but I really enjoy Letters of Lord Voldemort by Olivieblake/SallySparrow

They're ridiculous and I love it

Snippet:

"Lucius,

How are you feeling, dear Lucius? Are you well? Are you in good health? I hope you are not too terribly burdened with illness, as you seem to have come down with a case of such INCURABLE FUCKERY that even I, Lord Voldemort, who has CONQUERED DEATH, seem to be unable to vanquish it.

TROUBADOURS COULD WRITE SONGS ABOUT IT, LUCIUS. POETS WOULD NEVER SUFFER LACK OF INSPIRATION, LUCIUS, SO LONG AS THEY COULD DEVOTE ODES TO YOUR FUCKERY.

Breezing idly by the many ways in which you disappoint me, your failures as a man, your imbecilic twatting, etc, I would encourage you to take FIRM GRASP of the first decent idea you have had in MORE MOONS THAT I CAN COUNT and proceed to approach the goblins, who I imagine will be THRILLED TO SEE YOU, LUCIUS.

THINK OF THE HAIR TIPS YOU CAN SWAP, LUCIUS. THE NOTES YOU CAN SHARE ON HOW TO REMAIN INHUMANLY PALE.

I AM BREATHLESS AT THE THOUGHT.

LV"

*** Lucius,

What's that, Lucius? What did you say? I'm so sorry Lucius, truly, but you'll have to speak up, as I CANNOT HEAR YOU OVER THE VOLUME OF YOUR FUCKERY. I, Lord Voldemort -  EMPHASIS ON LORD, WHICH WE ALL AGREED WAS FITTING - am perfectly aware that out of all the twat waffles in this unending abominable twat parade, you are unquestionably the most qualified, so it is with STAGGERING DISPLEASURE that I continue to look to you as my second in command, though DO NOT TELL BELLA. I SWEAR TO FUCKING SALAZAR, DO NOT. We would all suffer that error, I ASSURE YOU, ME WORST OF ALL.

** ‚ÄúLucius!‚Äù The Dark lords call reaches him on the other side of the mansion where he was trying hard to regain his masculinity after the last session.

‚ÄúGo, you know he doesn't like to be kept waiting.‚Äù His wife Narcissa urges.

Squaring his shoulders he nods, ‚ÄúYes, appearances must be maintained.‚Äù

Burying his discomfort at what was to come, he walked to the chamber that his lord resided in.

‚ÄúSit, I have received distressing news and I need to relax.‚Äù, Voldemort indicated a cushion in front of him.

Dying a little more inside, he moved forward in supplication before turning around and sitting on the cushion as gracefully as he could.

Over the next hour he suffered the humiliation of having his hair stroked, brushed, and platted in front of a full meeting of the death eaters. He wasn't even given the dignity of a mask as it would ‚ÄòGet in the way of his hair'. He could see some of the women's relief in their body language, though Bella had an air of resignation. He'd need to avoid her for the next day or so just in case she decided to do something permanent to him.

By the time the meeting was over he had a complex braid woven into his hair along with multiple conjured flowers and ribbons. Most disconcertingly he'd had to suffer the shame of multiple shudders of pleasure that ran through his body when his hair was touched just right. It left him feeling violated, as only Narcissa was supposed to do that in the privacy of their bedroom.

‚ÄúLucius.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes my lord?‚Äù He responds carefully.

‚ÄúYou may go, though you may want to use an oil treatment as your hair was a little dry. If it's not silky next time I see you, you will be punished.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes my lord.‚Äù

He got up and slowly made his way back through his Manor to his wife's solarium.

** Well, to be fair, the books do a very bad job in showing why some characters (like Lucius) are considered powerful and/or dangerous. They, even, do a bad job showing us why Harry is considered talented and powerful. I mean, Hermione smokes him in absolutely everything related in magic except for sports, but in DADA she, suddenly, appears mediocre, because........ Because Harry is the main protagonist. Look at Dumbledore or Voldemort. They are the only wizards who perform magical acts, which solidify their reputation in the reader's eyes, then we have the marauders, who achieved great feats at a very young age, like creating the map or becoming animagi. Also, in the last book, we witness a great, imaginative, but brief duel between McGonagall and Snape, that shows us their prowess with a wand. But, what about Harry, who struggles levitating a feather, but masters the Patronus charm (??) Or Lucius and Bella who are very mean and very racist and very scary, but lose all the time against teenagers?
