I'm tidying up and using it as an excuse to collate my fanfic AU notes from the last year (I know I'm being super slow). The paper notes alone came up to a few inches in height all piled together XD just putting the actual meat of them into OneNote now.

Anyone else got a silly amount of notes on their fanfic dotted about? Or anything that makes you wonder if you might be a little *too* obsessed? ;p

In the upcoming chapter of one of my stories, the protagonists want to travel without magic to avoid tracking. Since plane travel would also be easy to track, it had to be something else than simply taking a British Airways flight from Heathrow. I spent hours looking up possible ferry connections, the state of roads in 1996/7, the weather around new year for the route covered (Hull -> Brugge -> Prague), what kind of rental car companies were around, the top speed of various upper middle-class cars available in 1996/7, where a good place for another overnight stay would be because driving for 10 hours is exhausting as hell...

Needless to say, I have little to show despite sinking at least 10 hours into the chapter. And yet I can't simply make things up because I am one of those readers who gets annoyed by authors getting that kind of information wrong.

*** But what about the airspeed of an African swallow carrying a coconut? Seems to me like you might have left something out ... :D

*** I am similar, but I think it's more that I have an obsessive streak which is very satisfying to indulge (if push came to shove I'd be happy to make it up but I like to /know/ ). Your dedication is inspiring ;)

** ...do people actually make notes for their fics? I've never, ever made any notes, whether paper or informatic. I just start writing drafts of chapters straight-on.

*** It differs from person to person - the National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) community refers to them as Planners and Pantsers (as in, writing by the seat of your pants). There's nothing wrong with either :)

*** I make notes and save a lot of maps and images. For example, I have a story set in Boston. I've never been to Boston and let me tell you, looking at Revolutionary War-era maps of Boston was shocking. The landmass looks nothing like it does now and I finally understand why the "Back Bay" neighborhood is called The Back Bay--because it used to literally be the back of the bay but has since been filled in with land.

In that same story, I have saved images of carved silver boxes, images of British Army soldiers, images of cufflinks and a ton of links to websites for things like the Sons of Liberty, the Floating Hospital, the signers of the Declaration of Independence and links to Google Maps of certain areas of modern-day Boston.

My current story has maps of Scotland, links to Fencing rules, the stages of labor and early child speech. Switching to Scrivener which has a convenient place to put all of that stuff has been very helpful.

I still don't do a lot of outlining, but I'm trying to get better at jotting down major beats as I think of them and I definitely don't feel bound to stick to the notes I have. I feel like this has really helped me solidify my stories, especially as I work on more intricately-plotted multi-chapters. I treated CAD as a series of one-shots and it kind of shows.

*** I have an outline, which has roughly a bulletpoint on every second chapter, sometimes detailing entire scenes, sometimes just "Yule Ball announced". And by the time I get to writing that part, I have ditched half of the original ideas for some reason or another.

*** I make notes Achille! :) I make a outline of what I want in each chapter or plot arc in general, and then I try to follow it. But that's it for me! :) The rest of it I just make up and change as I go along and try to keep it in the outline!

** I think I have somewhere between 100 and 150 pages of typed notes for the current AU I'm writing, which includes class schedules, family trees, and extremely minor OCs who I will probably never use. So, kind of a lot, lol.

*** Wow, I knew you'd have a lot considering how much effort you've put into your AU, but even so that's a lot :D Large chunks of mine are either on setting/history stuff like the Magical Government, or on Magical Theory. They cover at least a little bit of everything, though.

*** Thanks! The piles were a bit much, though - I only managed to transfer about a tenth (very rough guess) of the information into my digital notes today haha
