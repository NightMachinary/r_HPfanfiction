Hi there, I'm coming back to HPFF after almost a decade away. Which sites are active? Feels like the old sites, Sugarquill, Phoenixsong, etc are basically inactive.


** It pretty much boiled down to Ao3 and FFnet

You can thank MsScribe for at least a quarter of the casualties

***** That's hilarious. I guess at one point she must've realised that the lie had grown too big, but there was no way back, so she ploughed full steam ahead xD

*** Ehhh I wouldn't say so, I witnessed a noticeable decline the moment DH2 came out.

*** Isn't ao3 an aggregation site so to speak, collecting fics from around? Do people post directly there now?

**** Well, it's both. Any good fic has a copy of itself on Ao3 if written in fanfic.net, but many post directly to ao3.

** Just FFN and AO3 these days. AO3 is generally like the older parts of fandom, generally has more short stuff and shipping, FFN tends more towards long gen fics which are really popular on this sub. There are of course exceptions.
