:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From what I remember, it was all set during the Founders' time.

Gryffindor was the child of Ares, and was the Demigod of courage. Ravenclaw was the child of Athena and was the Demigod of learning. Hufflepuff was the child of Demeter and was the Demigod of patience. Slytherin was the son of Hades and is the Demigod of survival.

In the fic, the Sword of Gryffindor was Ares' sword passed down to Godric. Ares took on Slytherin as an apprentice and gifted him the Basilisk. Slytherin and Ravenclaw were in a relationship, but parted when he refused Muggle-borns.

Sound familiar to anyone?


** I'm still looking for this fic since I posted this request. Hopefully you'll have better luck getting it found than I did.

  What if there was a different reason the scar on the Girl-Who-Lived's forehead was a lightning bolt? What if it wasn't Lily's love that brought about Voldemort's temporary destruction?
