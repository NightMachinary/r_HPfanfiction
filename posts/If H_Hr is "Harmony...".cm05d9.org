...Ron/Hermione should probably be "Romany," rather than "Romione."


** ...would Ron/Hermione/Charlie be “Romania”?

** I am guessing H/Hr is Harmony because if you did the same as Romione with Harry, it becomes Harmione (which looks like you just misspelled Hermione) or Hamione (which is basically the same/similiar misspelling of Hermione). Harmony is different enough to be distinct in what you are talking about.

Plus, it wouldn't be Romany, but rather Romony. Which just looks wrong. Then again, I dislike the idea of Ron and Hermione together, so all names for that seem wrong to me. Lol

** I like to think that Harmony refers to how the pairing, being the classic "main guy gets main girl" cliché, is harmonious in it's /tropeness/---Or conversely, how JKR disrupted the perceived harmony of people who shipped H/Hr by pairing Hermione with Ron, and how fanfiction restores it. In all likelyhood I'm looking way too deep into it and it's only a little word play on "Harmione", and if that's the case then I don't think "Romany" would be justified, since it's not really a word play and more of a contrivance.

Can you believe I'm spending my sunday afternoon analyzing shipping names of a fantasy fandom. lord where did all go so wrong
