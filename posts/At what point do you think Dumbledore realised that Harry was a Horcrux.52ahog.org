I have seen some different theories on this.

- *Some say that Dumbledore knew it from the moment he saw Harry after his parents died.*

- *Others say he realised it during the time when Harry was with the Dursleys.*

- *Yet others say that it was his first year.*

- *And there are others who say that Dumbledore realised it the moment he came to know in Harry's second year that Harry could speak Parseltongue.*

- *Other theories also exist that he found out about the horcrux sometime after Harry's 2nd year. Possibly his 3rd or early 4rth year. I have not found anyone who believes that he found out about Harry's horcrux after his 4rth year.*

So here's my question. At what point do /you/ think Dumbledore realised that Harry was a Horcrux? And if you have some canonical evidence pertaining to it, feel free to share it.


** From OotP:

I guessed, fifteen years ago," said Dumbledore, "when I saw the scar upon your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort. . . . it became apparent, shortly after you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct . . . ."

Dumbledore suspected right from the very start.

**** Horcruxes might be an incredibly obscure bit of magic that not many people have even heard of, but Dumbledore knew all about them a long time before anything ever happened with the Potters - years and years before.

From Half-Blood Prince:

#+begin_quote
  "Of course," he muttered, "this is all hypothetical, what we're discussing, isn't it? All academic . . ."

  "Yes, sir, of course," said Riddle quickly.

  "But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I've told --- that's to say what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore's particularly fierce about it. ..."

***** I read that differently to you. To me that doesn't spell automatically that Dumbledore knows about this particular spell and it is banned it specifically but that is it part of a whole general subject range Dumbledore hates.

Not there is a rule of "don't inquire about horcruxes" in the Hogwarts rulebook but "all 'soul magic' is banned on pain of Binns-ing".

Not that Dumbledore would immediately know what is being talked about when he hears the word "horcrux" but that once he heard the word it is expected to be trivial /for him/ to research the rest.

And there still remains the fact that the Harry-horcrux differed significantly from what was known of horcruxes and thus might have been misidentified as some magic effect.

*** Not only that, but

#+begin_quote
  ‘Five years ago, then,' continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, ‘you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well-nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well.

Did Dumbledore also suspect that the Dursleys would treat Harry badly?

It's no wonder Dumbledore's so often portrayed as manipulative or outright evil in fanfiction.

** I would say he strongly suspected at the end of CoS. The Diary confirmed that Voldemort knew of and could make a horcrux, which thereby explained the strange properties of Harry's scar. Before that point I imagine Dumbledore speculating, but also considering other options as equally or more likely.

I would then say he received final confirmation just before Christmas of OotP, where he found out Nagini was a horcrux ("but in essence divided?") and thus confirmed that a) it is possible to make multiple horcruxes and Voldemort had done so and b) living beings could be horcruxes.

*** Scars were "useful", because Dumbledore had a scar above his knee that looked like the London underground map, or something like that.

Which is bullshit on so many levels.

What use is a lightning-shaped scar? For attracting fan-girls? For getting stupid and inconsiderate questions? /"Can I see it?"/ Fuck off, Ron, you berk.

/Very/ few wizards need to use the underground. Between apparition, floo, and portkeys, only Hagrid is handicapped enough to have to use the underground. And he did so without any access to Dumbledore's knee.

Dumbledore's scar was definitely magical. That means that Harry's scar was either just an ordinary ugly scar that should have been removed or healed, or magical in some unspecified way, benevolent or sinister. Why didn't Dumbledore find out exactly what Harry's scar was?

** We definitely know that Dumbledore knew before fourth year. There is a moment when Harry is telling Dumbledore what happened at the graveyard and Dumbledore looks happy when Harry gets to the part of his blood being used in the ritual. It means that Harry has a higher probability of not dying when Voldemort killed him cause his blood in Voldemorts veins is tying him to the mortal plane (or smth like that).

I think Dumbledore figured it out at the end of second year when he was testing the diary to see what it was.

*** I think you're right.

In HBP, didn't Dumbledore tell Harry that he only realized Voldemort had started making Horcruxes after he saw the diary? Dumbledore had seen that first Horcrux, and guessed that if Voldemort treated it so lightly then there must have been more.

Dumbledore then realized that if Voldemorts soul was so fragile, a part easily could have broken off onto Harry. Since this theory depended on already knowing how fragmented Voldermorts soul was, he could only have figured it out after he realized Voldemort had been making Horcruxes left right and centre.

That would mean the earliest he could have realized Harry was a Horcrux was the end of CoS.

He might have had a shadow of an idea when he found out Harry could speak Parseltongue, though.

*This*. I'd say "suspects" not "knows", but it was from the start.

He even comments about it, chapter one HP:SS (US edition):

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.

  “Is that where ---?” whispered Professor McGonagall.

  “Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He'll have that scar forever.”

  “Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?”

  “Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well --- give him here, Hagrid --- we'd better get this over with.”

  Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.

** I think Dumbledore is a little Gandalf-like - he had his /suspicions/, but he isn't all knowing, and it's far easier to sort of allay your fears with "don't be silly, that isn't possible", or at least, "something weird is in that scar, and Volde has disappeared, is possession possible" and gone off and started researching.

I think he knew that Volde had /some/ form of immortality, but he didn't know for sure until he actually saw the diary. Then, like Gandalf heating the One Ring, all his suspicions were verified.

Trouble was, JK tried to make him too all-powerful, and Harry also saw him as such, because adult, and powerful wizard. But in reality, he was just a very clever man, who was very powerful, and very old. Not infallible, and not all knowing.

** I think he knew defenetly that there's some link between Voldemort and Harry. But he wasn't sure 100% about Voldemort having Horcruxes or even what they are until later in Harry's school years. Pretty positive, it was around Harry's year 5 when Dumbledore done more research / started looking for clues, and also avoided Harry. He was like 85% sure, but didn't know what it means for Harry, for Voldemort and what to do at all.

I think people also understimate how rare is the info about Horcruxes. There were no indication, that anyone before Voldemort tried to create more than one, and if Horcrux in a living being is possible.

If you remember Slughorn's memory, Dumbledore wanted all information about horcruxes removed from the library, and was /adamantly/ against them being discussed.
