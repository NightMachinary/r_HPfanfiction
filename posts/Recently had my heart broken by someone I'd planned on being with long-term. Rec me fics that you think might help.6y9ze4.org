  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9708318/1/The-Adventures-Of-Harry-Potter-the-Video-Game-Exploited][The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited]], linkffn(9708318), has just been updated. For us who have played that type of RPGs, this fic is just bloody hilarious. The description of "Hufflepuff's Shovel" still gets me to chuckle:

#+begin_quote
  "Inventory," Harry called, getting ready to put away his new weapon, only to find a new tab in his inventory called "Weapons." Touching the tab, an expanded area of the chest opened up like closet or armory; though it was rather bare armory with only one Pointy Stick resting on a weapons rack.

  Still, the addition of the Weapons armory gave Harry some new information he hadn't had before as floating above the Pointy Stick on its rack was the weapons Statistics of: 1 melee attack/1 defense. As Harry set down the shovel in a weapon rack, its statistics floated above it: 3 melee attack/1 defense, Plus 2 to Herbology when wielding Hufflepuff Shovel and Plus 1 to attempts to Hide Bodies or turn them into fertilizer.

  Harry paled at the last two details, "I'm never going to look badly at Hufflepuffs again." Harry stated definitively.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

** The song [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm-NW1RwPY8]["No Children" by the Mountain Goats]] is the quintessential breakup song. Listen to this a few times before your fanfiction catharsis.

Then, I recommend some intense, quality, gen fanfiction. Voice of the Nephilim has a few good ones such as linkffn(7713063) and linkffn(6256154).

** Ginny gets turned into a vengeful psychopath toward the end of this story, which I don't care for much, but I think you should find the early chapters quite cathartic. Don't worry: now that you know they weren't the right one, you can seek out the person who /is/ the right one. I hope you find your Luna (or Hermione, or Ginny, or Harry, or Cedric, or whoever you're looking for).
