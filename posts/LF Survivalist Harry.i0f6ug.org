Looking for any fanfiction where Harry (or another HP character) gets stranded in wilderness or another planet, and have to use magic and mundane survival tactics to basically survive and flourish. Bonus points if he starts off in caveman conditions, but slowly builds up his knowledge of metallurgy, construction and hunting through trial and error

** Maybe not exactly what you're looking for, but Linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) is great.

edit: I think Linkffn(Out of the Dark and into the Green) also works, though it's unfortunately been abandoned.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** It's not quite that, but Esama's Island of Fire is about getting stranded and survival linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3236603/chapters/7050041]])

During the first task of the triwizard tournament a dragon gets loose and chaos ensues. During the chaos, someone makes a rope portkey to evacuate harry and a bunch of other students and while it's activating it gets broken and things go wrong. They land on a small island, little more than a glorified sand bar in the middle of the ocean, and have to figure out how to survive until they get rescued.

Only they're not in their home time, much less universe, so rescue doesn't happen (the story is fairly short and the spoilered bit is revealed pretty fast)

** I finally pushed past the first couple of chapters of linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter), and there's a survivalist test in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956/5/Harry-Potter-Squatter][Chapter 5]] that you don't really need any prior context for. There might be more later on (I'd be disappointed if there weren't, after all that buildup), but I'm on Chapter 10 now and it hasn't been a focus since.
