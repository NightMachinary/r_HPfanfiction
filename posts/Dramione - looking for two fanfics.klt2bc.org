:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The first fanfic I read a long time ago. It was Hermione/Draco pairing. I only remember the begining and the end. It starts with Hermione making dinner at Grimmlaud place for the Order, Draco was there in the shadows, he was a spy and he was at the meeting and proposed to Hermione. Voldemort was winning the war. At the end Draco and Hermione had three children (girls) and I think Hermione was headmistress of Hogwarts and Draco was to become Minister of Magic. That's all I remember, the fic has been on my mind a lot lately and I can't find it anywhere. The secon is also Hermione/Draco pairing. Hermione turns out to be a Prewett. She and the rest of the purebloods place stones with family crests together and then they draw from them one by one and Draco drew Hermiones', or the other way around I'm not sure, and that ment that they were soulmates or something and I think they get married. That's all I remember. I would appreciate it if someone can tell me where I can find them. Thanks!

** Idk about the first one, but I'm pretty sure the second one you're looking for is “This Too, Is Sacred” by HeartOfAspen [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17593790][“This Too, Is Sacred” by HeartOfAspen]]

** I remember that first story vividly and my first thought was it might be Turncoat or Hermione Malfoy from FFN but it appears I was incorrect. Can you update me if you run into it again?
