This seems to be a pretty common trope now to force "rare pairs" together, they can't think of anything the pair have in common or a scenario in which they'd meet (which should be a red flag anyhow) yet somehow they fall madly in love the moment one of them is pregnant.

I wouldn't mind the trope so much if it weren't for the fact the issue of having a child unplanned, what I'm sure is a very weighty subject in any scenario, is dealt with in usually no more than two paragraphs and that there's never any explanation as to how they even met to get to the point of having some casual sex relationship in the first place.

I want a compelling and interesting narrative that delves into the Wizarding world's issues, not just skims the surface. A lot of my issues with these unplanned pregnancy stories is that they seem to skirt around those serious issues. The stories are mainly focused on the "romance" aspect, not what makes the ship work romantically. I tend to find these stories just aren't as compelling or well written so I just skip them.

So, I could kind of see that in late/3rd term pregnancy, but would a fetus even have developed magic yet? For example, if magic is based on certain neurological pathways, wouldn't those pathways have to already be formed and established in order for the fetus to protect itself with any magic?

***** The way that I've analyzed Harry Potter's Magic System makes it so that Wizards and Witches are actually, physically, magic, if only infused with magic. This does explain a fair bit, like how Wizards have durability feats fairly above peak human even while unaware of danger, as well as why Wizards don't seem to have many stamina problems when using magic.

This also explains why an equivalent to Magic Circuits from Type Moon or a Magic Container from Fairy Tail isn't actually canon in Harry Potter, because of course Wizards and Witches are magic, that would only be mentioned in-depth in something like a Magic Theory class, which is literally never shown.

Anyways, under this system, it would be up in the air whether Magic Abortion is possible.

Of course, my preferred pairings (Harry/Hermione, Harry/Daphne, Ron/Luna) are not exactly... out there as rare pairs. The rarer ones I would like (like say, Harry/Katie) would be with him with someone around his year, not overly antagonistic... which is where I think you get a lot of these issues.

I don't ever want to be pregnant, I hate babies, and I don't know if I ever want to have kids in any way, so the idea of getting pregnant, unplanned, and not immediately getting an abortion seems nuts to me. I get that some people want kids eventually, just not right this moment, and might decide the timing/circumstances aren't THAT bad, and go through with it... but deciding to get together with the other parent and coparent still seems horribly selfish to me. Parents splitting up is hard on kids, parents who don't get along is hard on kids, and that sets your kid up for that being a very likely outcome.

So... ya. I generally skip them. They set off anxiety for me, and anyway, them make everyone look like shite people and often ridiculous and completely OOC.

**** As the author of the above, I got there by thinking:

​

- I think it would be interesting if Dudley had a magical child. We leave him in the books at a time when he's clearly figuring some things out and beginning to move away from the way his parents see the world: if he had a wizarding kid, it would really make him confront a lot of his own childhood and how the dynamics went on in his household and could be a really interesting story about breaking generational cycles.
- If he didn't just happen to have a magical kid, what character would he go well with?

  - Also, who do we know in canon marries a muggle? (Not that this would really be important to me anymore)

- Cho's actually a pretty great fit. She's similarly underserved by the narrative and would be interesting to explore, she has a different, complicated relationship with Harry. She's not close enough to Harry to feel weird about dating his cousin, but the romantic history makes it really funny. If you write them both a few years out of Hogwarts, you have enough leeway with both of them that you can make their characters be what you want them to be.

I started writing this in 2016 (and then discovered the first couple of chapters on my laptop this summer and decided I liked it and that I should keep writing) and at the time I started writing, I hadn't read too much fanfiction and seen that other people were doing the same thing - turns out I wasn't the first person to a) think of the pairing or b) use this specific way for them to meet.

​

Can't speak to why other people have written it, but that's what interested me about the combination!

  JK Rowling once said in an interview that she thought about having Dudley have a magical child on platform 9 3/4s at the end of book seven, but decided that no magical blood could survive contact with Vernon Dursley's DNA. In a long list of ideas she got wrong about what should happen to her characters post-canon, I've always thought that this was pretty near the top.Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he has an encounter that will uproot the course of his life, change his relationship with his cousin and his parents, and introduce him to some really fun new alcoholic beverages.Mostly non-ship focused, but there are plenty of relationships happening in the background. Despite my reservations, this mostly takes the Harry Potter epilogue as written, but makes a few significant changes the plot revolves around.

***** Oh interesting! I /could/ see that in theory, but I don't think it's where I'm taking him. I was going to say more, but if you're an active reader I probably shouldn't (although I don't see the story really revolving around Dudley's career choices, if it's important to you I'd rather you find out as it comes up organically!)

Uncle Vernon would doubtless have conniptions about him working for the government in many forms, but as long as he didn't have anything to do with speeding tickets, being a cop would probably just about be passable. But you know what's worse than a son who married a witch? A son who /didn't/ marry a witch, and just lives in sin with her... :P

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** I just don't read pregnancy-centered fics in general. They leave a bad taste in my mouth, tbh, I only really am okay with it if it's not the main focus and it's not mpreg (mpreg makes me so uncomfortable nowadays, I just want to read some good multichaptered m/m or f/m or gen with plot).

** I dislike this trope in general. I'm not even sure why. Maybe because it's a complicated situation and it just makes me uncomfortable.I remember reading a story where this happened. It wasn't a bad story, but the fact that the characters barely got to spend time together before this unplanned pregnancy happened really upset me. Then it almost looks like they've skipped a step on the relationship ladder. It wasn't a death eater and a good character, but I still felt a little unsatisfied.

But it wasn't, "a way to force rare pairs together." Lupin and Tonks were already in an established relationship.
