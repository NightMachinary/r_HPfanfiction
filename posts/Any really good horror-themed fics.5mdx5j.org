I'm looking for something scary/thrilling, like Evil Be Thou My Good. Preferably not campy either, but other genres thrown in are fine too, as long as try don't overshadow the horror. Happy endings also aren't a requirement.

Please no mpreg, pottercest or genderbending. Crossovers and bashing are fine. Thank you!


** I remember this being pretty good.

*** Good fic... right up to the reveal. I think it could've been more horrifying if the final perspective wasn't viewed from the revealed horror but instead from the POV of the death eaters slowly dying to a terrible force.

**** I enjoyed the final perspective, but your suggestion or maybe one of the other Hogwarts students would be interesting.
