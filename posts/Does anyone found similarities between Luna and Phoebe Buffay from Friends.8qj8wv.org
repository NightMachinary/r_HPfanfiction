** Edit: has anyone

Anyway, yes on a purely superficial level. They both are light blondes, can be frenetic in personality, and are prone to somewhat naive behavior while simultaneously displaying disproportionate emotional intelligence.

The difference is Phoebe was a poor kid from the street, which is why she is partly whacko. Luna is a byproduct of apparently eccentric parents and the psychological damage of her mother dying in a research accident...which was more than likely also her own fault and Luna knows it.

**** That Mrs Lovegood was experimenting with spells or something, and it went wrong for some reason. It sounds from Luna's description (which is admittedly questionable) that she liked to test boundaries and wasn't cautious enough. It sounds like something that was rather common.

While I'm not involved in “magic,” I do work heavily in research and experimental work. The description sounds like what I see/hear about often where researchers did not follow safety guidelines at all or ignored them. Eventually this leads to a problems, sometimes even graphically fatal ones.

****** Luna described that her mother was quite bright but loved to experiment with spells. Between 1990 and 1991, one of them went wrong in a “horrible” manner, which Luna may have witnessed in person. If that's true, she was experimenting in front of her pre-teen daughter, which is incredibly reckless.

Now that I think about it, I'm not sure about something. Does a person need to actually see someone die in person to “understand death” or simply understand what it means for a person that was alive is gone? That raises some questions.

******* As rare as Thestral sight is, I'd assume it has to be seeing the death occur.

Your average wizarding child may not have had a relative die before attending Hogwarts (due to magic extending lifespans), but I feel like 25% or more of Muggleborns would likely have at least one deceased relative

Luna has witnessed her mum's death, not necessarily the experimentation. Imagine some kind of explosion and little Luna comes running into the forbidden experimentation cellar to find her dying mom. Or no kind of explosion and Luna decides to check on mummy because it's past lunch.

Also I find your stance in regards to experimentation a little ignorant: Having less safety standards doesn't mean you're stupid. Lots of very smart people died in research simply because the dangers of certain things weren't known yet (I think of radiation or pathogens here). You have the advantage of standing on the shoulders of giants armed with all the knowledge from the past about what could go wrong, exactly because people died or received horrible injuries. "Don't touch the warm rock without safety equipment because you will get irradiated and get cancer" isn't exactly self-evident if you don't really know what alpha/beta/gamma radiations are and what they do.

I see no strong indication that Pandora was aware of the danger of what she was doing or that she was reckless.

** yes. its hard to remember how much of luna is canon and how much is fanon. But from what I remember, both of their humor is drawn from their more casual perspective on events that others would find more sensitive or taboo. Also, the arguments between phoebe and ross (such as on evolution), are similar to Luna and hermione arguments.
