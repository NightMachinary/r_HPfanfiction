I think I read some where traveling between alternative universes/timelines was involved, but what I primarily looking for is when the diary Riddle successfully materializes and then competes or joins forces with the Riddle resurrected in a more traditional way.

Examples would include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest by Larry Huss]] (linkffn(8127137)), and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8132578/chapters/18642415][The Anti-Heroine by cheshire_carroll]] (linkao3(8132578)).

Any more good stories with this theme?


** linkffn(Rectifier) has a "reformed" Defence Professor Riddle dimension-travel to the canon universe.

As for Horcruxes: linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is a comedic fic where the scar Horcrux took over Harry's mind from day one. The Diary Horcrux also interferes. linkffn(Tom Riddle and the Sorcerers' Stones) has the Scar Horcrux possess Harry's body after the Limbo King's Cross scene, rather than Harry coming back to life. The Diary Horcrux apparently features in linkffn(A Black Comedy), but I haven't read that one. linkffn(Souls Abound) has the rather interesting premise that Voldemort put a warning system on all of his Horcruxes so that if one is destroyed, all the other ones immediately do their best to possess someone and meet up with the main Voldemort in a safe location; however, it's not that well-written.

I read this a couple of days ago and haven't had a chance to gush yet as I got it from a dead thread. Fuck me is it good.

*Read this!* It is god-tier. The plot of this fic is a work of art that was written for no other reason than that a world without it would be one in which humanity has not yet reached its true potential. If you haven't read this fic yet I can promise you that whatever you are doing right now is less important than steamrolling your way through this fic.

Or, where Tom hates everything but tolerates his fellow horcruxes plus his arch-nemesis in order to take over the world... if things would only go his way.A drabble series told in snippets of 100, because nothing else properly conveys the absurdity of this situation.This work now has a guide with extra information and explanations.

Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas. Features Mahoutokoro, Durmstrang, and original magical school. Ongoing, with currently irregular updates.

It takes some time for it to get there as it goes from the first year.
