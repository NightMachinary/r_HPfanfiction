** "Hey Tom, look at this!" Harry said, peering intently at his macbook pro.

"What's up?" Tom replied as he walked over to take a look.

"Look at this CNN article on a rebellion against Dumbledore and Grindewald" Harry said.

"Looks interesting. Why don't you bookmark the page so I can read it later? I got to run to work. I'm already behind on my share of the rent." Tom questioned absentmindedly as he grabbed his car keys.

"Sure thing Tom"

And with that, Harry starred the rebellion against the dark lords Dumbledore and Grindewald.
