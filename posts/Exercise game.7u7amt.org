So I used to take a speech class in college, our old professor to break us into it would hand out little slips of papers to each of us and we had to make a five minute speech out of it. My first one was "You only have a can of sardines to break out of prison, how do you escape?" I was thinking we could make a game out of this. A silly prompt such as what I got is given and you have to make sense of it in 2-3 paragraphs.

So if I was taking the Sardines one I would write:

He was a proud man, strong and resilient. He would not break, his pride had already taken such a blow; captured by a group of fools and teenagers and thrown away in Azkaban where his master let him stew in his disgraceful failure. The knowledge that he had put a black spot forever on the Malfoy name was almost too much to bare. It couldn't end like this, no, he refused to let it. The name Malfoy would not go down in history as the foolish purebloods who were caught by fifth years and thrown into Azkaban for supporting a Dark Lord. He wouldn't let it; there was only one way that he could repair his families reputation and that was to simply escape and make sure he was on the winning side of this war. If the Dark Lord was to win, years down the line he'd be known as the man who bravely went to prison for standig up for what is considered right and protecting the good name of Wizardry against the threat of filthy Muggles.

The only problem was, how would he escape? He knew of only one person who ever escaped Azkaban without assistance, and that was Sirius Black, unfortunately he was dead and unlikely to assist him even if he was alive. He'd have to come up with something more clever. He looked around his cell, there was a can of sardines laying on the floor where the guards had left them. He had been hungry but not that hungry. He knew a fair bit of transfiguration, true he could feel the drain of the dementors already but he had only been in there a few days. All he had to do was use a bit of wandless magic. But what would he transfigure it into?

All he needed was to get out of the building than he could apparate away, but what could he possibly use to get him out of his cell? He knew his cell wall was facing directly to the sea and not another cell, he could blast a hole in it, but how? Suddenly he knew what he'd do. For years he had studied up on wars, both magical and muggle, it had always fascinated him. He was sure of one thing, the Ministry never thought to guard against Muggle destruction. After all the dark lord had nearly destroyed the place with magic. He didn't have enough strength to cast bombarda or another destructive spell. It would be weak if that. No he needed something that could blast a hole in it with one go. The Muggles had used Hand grenades, he sneered at the thought of using Muggles means but no one need ever know. And so he gained strength over days, practicing his magic when no one was around, until the day he finally did it, he transfigured the item and hid in a corner under his most powerful repeling shield. He was nearly defeaned and thrown against a wall merely from the noise and shockwaves, but he was otherwise unharmed. Wind blew in his face, he could taste the saltiness of the sea below him, the air damp and inviting. He looked back as dark figures approached but he merely jumped, apparating during his fall.

I thought it'd be fun what do you guys think? If you like the idea we could do it so the person with the most upvotes gets to decide the next prompt?
