*"Beautiful Loser"*

He wants to dream like a young man\\
With the wisdom of an old man\\
He wants his home and security\\
He wants to live like a sailor at sea

Beautiful loser\\
Where you gonna fall?\\
When you realize, you just can't have it all

He's your oldest and your best friend\\
If you need him, he'll be there again\\
He's always willing to be second-best\\
A perfect lodger, a perfect guest

Beautiful loser\\
Read it on the wall\\
And realize\\
You just can't have it all

You just can't have it all\\
You just can't have it all\\
Ohh, ohh, can't have it all

You can try, you can try, but you can't have it all\\
oh yeah

He'll never make any enemies, enemies, no\\
He won't complain if he's caught in a freeze\\
He'll always ask, he'll always say please

Beautiful loser\\
Never take it all\\
'Cause it's easier\\
And faster when you fall

You just don't need it all\\
You just don't need it all\\
You just don't need it all\\
Just don't need it all


** That is definetly an interesting prompt, though I think that Hufflepuffs being seen as "the useless" house mostly stemms from the fanbase not canon. (Additionally the song is brilliant)

Of course we see Draco complain in the first book but his predjudice obviously comes from his parents. Cedric, I think is one of the most fleshed-out Hufflepuffs we have and he was said to be very popular even before he became the Hogwarts champion. Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchly, Hannah Abbot and Susan Bones were all in the DA. Overall in Harry's environment, the people who stand out as "Losers" are Luna amd Neville, neither of which are Hufflepuff
