Recently became interested in this style. I don't mind NSFW or slash or xover etc. I would prefer it if it was complete.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

** I forget the name of this (I'm posting it here in case anyone has ever found it), but Harry is raised by Lupin and they open a bar in Knockturn alley?

Other things I remembered: (1) Harry isn't the BWL, Neville is. (2) Harry and Cedric (and one more person I forget) are best friends. (3) It's HarryxFleur. (4) It's abandoned. (5) Harry is some sort of Quiddich prodigy and plays for England's team.

It's not a lot to go on, but I thought it was a nice read if anyone knows what it is.

EDIT: found it! It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][Knowledge is Power]].

*** Pretty sure you're talking about linkffn(11241902)

The version I linked was most likely adopted from the one you remember (assuming that this is the fic you're talking about), as it's slow updating rather than outright abandoned (not to mention the a/n at the start of the first chapter). The one more person you forgot in (2) is an OC, so that's probably why you forgot him.

  Harry is 2 years older, Neville is BWL and things are way more interesting. Follow Harry as he rises to a prominent place in the wizarding world. Full of humor and of course a badass Harry this story is bound be thrilling. Disclaimer: Harry Potter belongs to JK Rowling and will never be mine. This is for the whole fanfiction.

After skimming through it I don't thk so :/

The one I remembered had Harry taking Fleur to a night club during one of the chapters lol.

Wait you did find it lol. Reading through both they're the same (or rather really similar)! And yours is updating!
