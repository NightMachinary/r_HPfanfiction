My story on FF.net has not updated view counts in days and I get an error message when I try to check but I know people are seeing it because I have reviews. Support has not answered me.

Anyone else experiencing this?


** I tended not to worry much about things like that, but when FFN began splitting up stories to insert ads (Why? they have vertical banner-space down each side!), I migrated all my stories across to AO3. The view count is far less (for now) but the ability to reply to individual reviews can be useful.

Much as I hate to say it, FFN does seem to be sliding downhill in terms of support.

** It's a bug - apparently it happens pretty much every year at this time. Their support isn't great but it will probably be resolved shortly.

This is system wide so it's happening to everyone.

** What others have said. It is common. Just posted a new story like 20 min ago and have 1 review and 0 views.
