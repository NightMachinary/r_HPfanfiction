Want fics where someone, preferably Harry, gives Teddy the Resurrection stone and and he meets his parents. Can be one shot or multi chapters. I've only two but didn't think they were quite substantial.


** Do we know for sure it was the REAL people brought back with the stone or just phantoms created from memories from the user's mind? That's what I always assumed it was; just a cruel illusion like the Mirror of Erised.

*** I think that it mentions in the book that the people Harry summons were much more than ghosts, but less than living humans. So I definitely think they're spirits & not just memories. Plus, the story about the Three Brothers where the brother with the resurrection stone ends up killing himself because the person he summons does not belong in the living world, so he becomes desperate to join her indicates that they probably do get called back from death - in a way.

**** I won't argue the book wording since I don't have it with me, but the three brothers story can be argued that it was the brother's desire to be with his love (and suicidal thoughts) and his inner guilt at trying to summon the dead.

** I think this would be OOC for Harry to give it to him. The stone is meant to lure you to death. The Hallows are in no way a "gift". Harry only uses the stone as he is walking to his death, then discards it. The stone is similar to the Ring in LOTR, it cannot be wielded or used. It's dangerous, and giving it to someone who would inevitably abuse it and succumb to its powers is not something he would do.

That's ambiguous. The Stone's power is a terrible temptation all on its own, but I don't think it has a separate, tangible aura of corruption like the One Ring --- overusing it in ways harmful to the dead is just what people who get the Stone's power tend to do, it's not something you have a supernatural compulsion to do once you have the Stone.

And as for Harry discarding the Stone, I always took it to have more to do with the fact that he /was walking to his death towards Voldemort/. In ideal circumstances, Harry wouldn't have thrown the Stone away --- rather, its power ought to be kept in official, impersonal hands and regulated, used only in grave cases (such as interrogating murder victims) or perhaps as a "right to farewell" for a loved one who died without saying goodbye, with the provision that it's strictly single use and you can't "call" them again.

However in this case, he believed Voldemort was going to kill him /dead/, and presumably would find the Stone if Harry still had it on him. Just consider the sheer horror of a Stone-wielding Voldemort who was aware of the Stone's true nature. He could get information from the dead, including people like Salazar Slytheirn himself; he could torture his enemies long after he'd killed them; perhaps most horrifyingly, he could /use the Stone as a food source to keep his Dementors happy/.

*** Hmm. Didn't think about it like that. I don't remember much in canon but did it actually say that in the books?

**** The 7th book. The tales of the beedle and bard detail this. The 2nd brother recalls his lost love who eventually tires of being called back to the mortal plane and convincing him to commit suicide to join her.

**** It doesn't quite say that. It does say the Stone's power was a great temptation for people to use it wrongly, keeping loved ones in the real world for too long out of selfish reasons even though they couldn't be really happy there in incorporeal ghostlike forms. However, whether the Stone has a Ring-style, /magical/ compulsion to overuse it is quite ambiguous.
