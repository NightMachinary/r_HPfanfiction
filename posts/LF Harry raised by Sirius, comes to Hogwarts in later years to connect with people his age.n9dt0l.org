Looking for a fic where Harry joins Hogwarts at a later date due to his being raised by Sirius, but should start connecting to other people his age. Shouldn't mean that he's got absolutely no social skills, just that he is happy to finally meet people his age

Don't really care about the pairing, as long as its not Slash. My favourites are HP/DG, HP/FD and HP/GW

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

**** I'm not sure. I'm half way through, and I didn't find any of it personally offensive so far. There wasn't any racism or anything. ðŸ¤· There's canon typical violence. Hmm.. Oh there are pranks, and one of them changes the clothes of one male character into lingerie, another prank vanished another character's clothes, both in public. Maybe that's it?

** What were fighting for is a really good harry hermione fic. He comes to hogwarts 5th year I think, as a fully trained hit wizard. He was raised by Sirius and lupin and his entire life consisted in warfare training. They sent him to hogwarts because harry had nothing for himself except being a soldier, not even friends, so they wanted him to make friends and grow into more than just a soldier

It's actually really good.

There is also the harry black series where harry was raised by Sirius in america and he comes back in 3rd year(?)I think. It's harry daphne and very very good. 3 completed books and 4th is WIP

(I too am a harry daphne fan. I fuckin love that pairing more than any other)
