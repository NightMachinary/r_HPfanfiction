** Are you looking for something you've read before? Or is it just a concept you'd like to see written? Either way, I'd be interested in reading it.

*** There was a fanfiction that I read a while ago where Harry Potter did use the imperious curse to send a message to Tom. But that's all he did with that. I thought it would be great if Harry would use some of their own tactics on them
