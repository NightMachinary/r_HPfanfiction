It can be after the GoF or DH fight, I'm not picky. No bashing please for either Ron or Hermione, I prefer the characters to be in character as much as possible.


** Not quite forgives, but in /Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/ Hermione is the target of Ron's ire and unlike Harry, she is less willing to forgive and forget than Harry was.

Harry, for his part, remains friends with both, although he acknowledges that Hermione has no reason to rebuild her friendship with Ron and that is ok, even if it means he is sometimes split between friends...

**** I'm not trying to be mean, it's just that Hermione-bashing fics are less popular than Ron-bashing ones (due to her Princess of the Fandom status), so you're less likely to find (or even hear about) anything good.

***** I love Hermione and would not touch fics bashing her with a 10-foot pole. I just want to read a more nuanced and different version of the story.
