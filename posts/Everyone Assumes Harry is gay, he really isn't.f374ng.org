Joking around about "There isn't anything wrong with that" from Seinfeld and the entire Gay Episode one thought flashed into head a hour later while scrolling through Fanfiction.

What would happen if Harry was a Thin, Goodlooking, Neat young man who everyone just assumes "Of course he's Gay". Every time he plucks up the courage to talk to a girl that isn't Hermione they think it's Gossip time or he's finally coming out. Every time he gets into a fight with Draco everyone is cooing and like "awww" and Harry is legit pissed at him. Harry's one confidant is a Gay Guy who approached him and was gently let down and now realizes that Harry is straight and how fucked up it is that their roles are reversed


** What if everyone assumes Harry is gay because he's not interested in any girls that try to date him but he's actually a time traveler who's not interested in kids?

*** Welcome to the past! Have you heard of Legally Blonde: The Musical? It just hit theatres! My favourite song from it is /Gay or European./

And if we're talking making fun of trying to figure out if a person's gay or not in theatre productions, there was this one song in Avenue Q (2003) titled /If You Were Gay/ is pretty good.

Oh, and there was this other guy from 2011 who showed me a music video from this new site called “Utoob,” called /If We Were Gay/ by Ninja Sex Party.

What about you? What's happening in 2020? Same sort of thing? Ah. I can't wait.

*** You mean the fact that people are presuming his Sexuality with outdated stereotypes?

I get it you are a "ally" but you are just reacting to words rather Than what they mean. Harry isn't a Homophobe, Hell I'm not even saying anyone else is a Homophobe.

They just want to be a Ally, unfortunately they project their own ideas as to what makes a homosexual man on to Harry.

soooooo what exactly is wrong about this? It breaks down stereotypes about what exactly a gayman is or "supposed to be"

Its 2020 AlmaArachnidFriend, time to stop continuing stereotyping people

Intention does not override results.

This entire concept treats homosexuality as a joke. It did when that Seinfeld episode aired and it does now.

If the idea was written without the joke in mind and maybe a concrete message - like how people shouldn't assume a person's sexuality - it might be interesting. As a bisexual who's sexuality is constantly assumed to be something it's not, that would be nice to read.

Otherwise, it's a tired, outdated concept.

****** This is silly. I'm not going to stop anyone from writing something. I literally can't.

But freedom of speech does not mean freedom from criticism.

Also, "freedom of speech" actually means "freedom of speech without retaliation from the government" and people really need to stop forgetting that.

******* People need to remember that freedom of speech isn't just protection from the government

If someone called me a racial slur to my face, and i hit them for it and they pressed charges, i couldn't say to the judge "he called me -blank- he had it coming" no judge will accept that as reason for you to hit the person.

Just like you can't get in trouble for going to a college and writing a paper on a hot button issue. If you wrote a paper saying something like "i believe only gay men should be allowed to vote" and the college kicked you out for it, you could sue for them impeding your freedom of speech.

Freedom of Speech is more than just protection from the government

******** Could you please address the other things I had to say? I'm interested in hearing why you think I'm impeding a person's freedom of speech for being critical of treating a marginalized group of people as a joke? I'm especially curious since you implied that I shouldn't say what I said, which in turn would impede on my own so-called 'freedom of speech.' Whoever talks first is the only one with the 'right,' then?

And what I mean is that 'freedom of speech' can only be applied in context by the government, but people tend to wave it around as a flag of "I CAN SAY WHATEVER I WANT AND YOU CAN'T SAY SHIT IN RESPONSE" without even knowing the history of where it came from or how it's put to use.

Private organizations can censor whatever they want to on their own platform because they have the right to do so. Private individuals can respond to a person's speech with their own 'freedom of speech.' (There are obviously exceptions to all this - libel, threats of violence, inducing panic, etc.)

As for your examples, a judge will not side with you because you assaulted a person. (I also don't understand why you tried to use this as an example.) And you can sue whoever you want, but in your example, you would have a chance of winning against a state university, but you could very well NOT win against a private college because - again - it's a private institution.

** Disclaimer :

I in no way support the things below, this is merely my more serious attempt at analyzing a prompt that was indeed maybe mildly funny at most, twenty years ago. I however could not deny the potential that laid within even if I have to claw it out of the shell of sexist, homophobic thought it is hiding within. Many of these interpretations are less than favorable, or even just quite fucked up. The first paragraph explores these. The second paragraph is less controversial and an analysis as to why this might be the case.

* PARAGRAPH I *

A few more serious interpretations of this could have a Harry that grows into being at least mildly homophobic from his bitterness at being completely unable to even hit first base with any girl because they think he is gay, no matter how vocal he is about this. A Marriage Law fic would have Harry as happy to bed a woman at last as any of the sickly old geezers the law was actually meant for. Or he joins Voldemort, and consistently demands as much as a reward for completing tasks as him using the Imperius curse, raping a woman or being ordered to bed Harry are the only ways he can get laid despite not being an ugly troll. Even Crabbe and Goyle get laid easier than Harry. These Harry Potters would not have a gay friend because to him they are what muggleborns are to Pureblood supremacists, the thing that is ruining his life. Obviously all of these are a darker Harry, born from frustration at really, being discriminated himself in a manner more befitting how one would chide a child for mischief.

* PARAGRAPH II *

More empirically, this might be the result of a younger gay Tom Riddle hexing himself (read, his soul) to appear this way to any woman so he was not as consistently harassed by them due to his dashing good looks, except the truly crazy. (like Bellatrix, who somehow completely ignores the curse, leaving Voldemort extremely frustrated and awed at the same time.) When Harry becomes an accidental Horcrux the hex transferred with him, causing the same result. This, however, is a saving grace as it makes it easier for Harry's soul to contain the Horcrux and prevent possession by letting the hex take full and utter effect.

*** I was going a little less dark and black and more Harry sitting there exasperated as Ginny and Susan Bones (who Harry had invited to the Library to ask out) whisper about setting Harry up with Anthony Goldstein who had recently come out. Ron who is in the Closet gritting his teeth because he's gay but every time they broach the subject with anyone they assume the conversation is about Harry.

Harry alone with Padma talking and joking, he tells himself 'alright time for your first kiss' he leans in and Padma puts a hand on his lips and tells him "It's OK Harry you don't have to hide with me".

But your ideas work too
