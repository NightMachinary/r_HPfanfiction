This is either Meta or Promotion. Either way, I'm not sure how divulged it is, but I suppose this is a good platform to promote the fan-fiction/fanon version of the Harry Potter Wiki - the Harry Potter Fanon Wiki.

A sort of unofficial sister wiki to the Harry Potter Wiki, the Fanon Wiki has essentially the same purpose as the main wiki, except it's for fan-fiction verses. It suffered a little revamp at my hands and at those of a retired sysop, so it may be a little different to anyone that was a participant of the wiki before 2017.

If you're into this sort of thing, feel free to check it out (and to participate in the project if you want).

*** I was a bit confused by your comment, but then I went to check it and yeah...

Everyone has their choice of images for characters... even if they don't quite match the aesthetic of the rest.
