***** Woah, now you want Lupin to shag Umbridge?! That's even more nasty!

I'd ask where her "spot" would even be and how Lupin would find it with all that fat, but frankly, I don't want to know.

********* Because caps are not banter. Caps are freaking out like a meteor is heading towards Earth, you're the only one who knows and you can't tell anyone who could prevent it from hitting without your speech turning into frantic squawks.

Also, MOKNY?. And there should be punctuation between POSITION and MY. :)

***** Sure, but Hogwarts isn't everywhere, so regardless of being unable to apparate in Hogwarts specifically, I feel like the expression would be "apparating" papers :P

I know a trebuchet can throw a 90kg projectile over a distance greater than 300 meters... I wonder how far a Snape would fly?

****** Well the greace in his hair and his robes alone should weigh about 50 kg if, we say that Snape is 5'8 and can only imagine him underweight so I guess he is about 60 kg, so in his normal attire he should weigh 110 kg. If my following calculation is right, mind you I failed math two years in a row so this might be complete bogus, we should get a satisfying answer: if 110/x=90 x=0.8181818181818181818181818... so 300/(90/110)=245.454545454545454545454545454545454545...or simply 245.45 meter the question however is who is more aerodynamic Snape or a 90 kg rock and if the fanon of Snape enchanting his coat to dramatically billow whenever he makes an entrance, does this have an impact on aerodynamics?
