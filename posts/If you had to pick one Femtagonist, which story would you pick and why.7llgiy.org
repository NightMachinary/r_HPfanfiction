Curious about what everyone's favorite fem!tagonist stories are. In other words, the main character is a woman (I.e. fHarry, Hermione, etc.).

Edit: alternatively, you can also provide the stories you would like to see with femtags.

  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and its sequels. Harriet/Rigel is essentially an OC compared to canon Harry, but she's an awesome protagonist. It's fascinating to read have a HP protagonist going through Hogwarts with an actual goal, instead of "let's goof off and play Quidditch, oh wait, let's also not die to Voldemort AGAIN"
