So what have your favorite adventure/worldbuilding fics over the past year been?

^{(By "past year", I mean that they have either been updated or completed in the past year.)}

Personally, my favorites have been linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6325846/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heartlands-of-Time][Heartlands of Time]]).

  Sequel to Wastelands! Time has all but run out for Harry Potter. There are no more second chances. No more desperate bids for salvaged redemption. The game has changed, and in the end Harry will learn that the cost of his defiance has never run so high.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** linkffn(Blood Crest) started updating again recently, to my delight. It has some strong OCs and the best portrayal of necromancy I've seen in fanfiction.

Also, there was a guy around here at the end of last year, promoting a fic he wrote for his kids, linkffn(Tamblin Demosthene and the Artiste's Alcove). It was actually pretty good -- a bit light on plot and conflict, but convincing characters and world-building.

And linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis) has been updating semi-regularly, but that gets recommended frequently around here already...

Overall, the rate of quality fics definitely seems to be declining, albeit no faster than the fandom as a whole...

  The blood wards hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.
