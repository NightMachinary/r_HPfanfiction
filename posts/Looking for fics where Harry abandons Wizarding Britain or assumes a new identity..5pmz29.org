  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

** My favorite Harry abandons Britain Wizarding World right now is "A Wizard, A Witch and a Mechanic" by RhysThornbery.

Another fanfic is "I remember" by datbenik513. Voldemort succeeded in wiping out the resistance except for Harry and Fleur. Both decided to leave Britain to start new lives elsewhere.

Does time travel count? I remember a story where the prologue was of Harry being memory wiped by the Ministry and has attended a normal College when Hermione barreled back into his life to take him back to the past (The memory wipe was permanent so they had to go back to the past to be able to live back in the Wizarding World). I remember they did a ritual in Stonehenge to be able to travel back to the past. I can't remember the title though.

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.

  This is my own cracktastic entry in the Potterverse genre known as 'For whatever reason, Harry throws a huge hissy fit and leaves the wizarding world.' Well, if you know a more concise description, tell me it in a review, and I'll use this. Rating is for language.

  Nothing but a blend of overused plots and an ending that I haven't seen before.
