:END:
It was a time travel fic. I think the name had death in it. But the only parts I really remember is harry and hermione move luna into a secret room in gryffindor tower because her dormmates locked her out of the dorms mostly naked. I also remember snape was way worse than in canon, killing students who write him after they graduate telling him what a shit teacher he is. He also apparently dug up lily's body and stole her heart as part of some plan to bring her back. It's also implied that he molested her corpse. Last thing I remember is harry getting his revenge on snape by stringing him up in a dungeon and using a mold that feeds on his body while keeping him alive to feel it.


** I'm pretty sure it's called Faery Heros
