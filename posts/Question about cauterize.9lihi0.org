In this passage:

He takes another one, of the round burn in his chest, that he likes so much more. At Harry's request, he labels it 'anonymous.'

What burn on Harry's chest is the author referring to? Is it in the cannon? Have been searching and racking my brain, I can't find anything on it.


** From Deathly Hallows, after Hermione and Harry escape Snake-Bathilda Bagshot (oh god, the Fantastic Beasts reveal makes that somehow even creepier, btw):

  "I couldn't get the Horcrux off you," Hermione said, and he knew she wanted to change the subject. "It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You've got a mark; I'm sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away. The snake bit you too, but I've cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it..."

  He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down. There was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him.

** I believe he has a scar on his chest from the locket Horcrux, but I don't know if that's what's being referred to here. I haven't read this particular story.

*** Yeah, this has to be it. There aren't any other details on the scar in this story.

**** Oh, that's good. I presumed it was a scar from the second killing curse he took in the forbidden forest.
