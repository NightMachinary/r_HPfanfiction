#+begin_quote
  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

- A Magical Childhood by Kendra James. Pre-Hogwarts. linkffn(5926057)
- Making Lemonade by Dayja. Pre-Hogwarts (ends at Sorting Feast). linkffn(11123626)
- The Switch by Bearbone. Unfinished, but the setup is complete and you can fill in the blanks. linkffn(11769956)

A fun read that is truly "hidden" because it's not on the usual sites: [[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=3006][The Owl Chronicles]] by mouse (gen)

And a truly unique time-travel story: The Young Adventurer's Club by Artemisgirl. Snape/Hermione but they're the same age. linkffn(9993319)

**** More so I just prefer broody and socially awkward. In this fandom, that's usually Snape. Sometimes Draco. There's some great Theo fics.

I read a really good fic once with Marcus Flint who was dyslexic instead of stupid.

My pairings in other fandoms should check out. Daryl Dixon, Sesshomaru, Mr. Gold, Tarrant Hightop/Madhatter.

Basically, any weirdo.

**** All the fictions over there are either Hermione/Draco or Hermione/Severus, I don't know about other, but hidden gems for me, are fictions that focus on original plot, or with interesting world building, good AU and etc., and have a few views because neither Ao3 or ffn.net have a Trending option search, not fictions that focus on relationship and really not on overused ship.

***** Fair enough. I appreciate your comment.

I think some of my favorites have many of those aspects but are immediately discounted because of the pairing.

Which, is again, totally fair. I don't think anyone should choke down a pairing they don't like, or even read shipping fics if that's not their bang.
