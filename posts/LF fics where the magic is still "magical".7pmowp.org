Im in the mood for fics where the magical world is exactly that, magical. Where Harry comes to Hogwarts and finds magic wonderful, amazing and exciting! Where he learns as much as he can because, Magic! Where the fic focuses on the magic itself, and all the wonderful things you can do with it.

(Anyone else also find it odd that muggleraised Harry arrives at hogwarts where there is MAGIC! Where he is away from the Dursleys, and he just doesn't seem to give a fuck? )


** Most of Taure's stuff (albeit unfinished) should qualify.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** [[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in a more magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year is complete, but it stands on its own and theoretically, there is a new version in the works, but it only started and with Taure being Taure who knows if it'll continue - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]]

Original Description:

#+begin_quote
  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. On hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still a very good read. And of course, it's dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL (at least it seems so) Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. In its second year, recently returned to weekly updates.

This fic actually fits really well with your criteria. I recommend it however keep in mind that it have quite the few NSFW scenes that (while well made) pop up without warning. The Author is a bit eccentric (if his other fics are anything to go by) by it is an enjoyable breath of fresh air. Also Harry is pretty much the definition of Grey.

*** I think you linked the wring fic if you find the NSFW scenes well made. And I wouldn't reccomend it if op doesn't like when the author try to shove his political and religious opinions in each chapters.

**** This story was one of the best (long) HP smut fics I've managed to find so far. Hell, even this author's Naruto story's first book is one of the best Naruto smut fics on my list so far.

If you find the porn scenes poorly done in it, can you please mention which other HP smut fics manage to do better than this one, in your opinion? I'm always happy to expend my quality smutfic collection and would be grateful to you for a nice rec or two.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
