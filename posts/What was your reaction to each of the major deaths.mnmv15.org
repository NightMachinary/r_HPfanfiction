** - Cedric -- Meh
- Sirius -- Wait, what? *re-reads that bit 4-5 times until it clicks* Oh he died... *cries for a few minutes*
- Dumbledore -- *as a kid* Snape you asshole!! *as an adult* Oh that's why he finally decided to share important info, he was dying...
- Hedwig -- 13-14 years later, I'm still in denial about this.
- Dobby -- *gives up on reading anymore for a few weeks* I cried for days.
- Fred -- Sorry Fred, but we all know at least one of you has to die.
- Snape -- Wish I could say I'm sorry, but by this point, I have Zro pity for you.
- Remus and Tonks -- Well that rounds out the set. I do feel bad Tonks had to die too though.
- Bellatrix -- Oh Good, Neville didn't kill her. Thank you Molly.
- Voldemort -- That was rather anticlimactic. I guess that's why the movie changed it.

** Tonks? "Pair the Spare" and "Orphan Redux". Shitty ending for a great character. Enough said.

** Dobby's and Dumbledore's were the saddest for me. In Sirius case I felt at loss, I didn't care much about Cedric, I had to reread Hedwig's death because it flew over my head. Fred, Remus and Tonks were sad but I mostly felt bad for everyone left behind. Snape was complicated and I felt a sense of satisfaction when Voldemort and Bellatrix died.

** The only one I'm going to comment on here is Sirius. I don't know if you remember but in the run-up to the release of OotP, someone (I think it was JKR's partner) leaked that she'd said "I've killed them" or something like that. And in the scene at the Ministry played on that.

Was Neville dead? Was Hermione dead? Oh it's Sirius. Well thanks for sorting it out. So a quite big death came over as a "Fuck you" to me.

** Cedric: Shocked

Sirius: Just as confused as Harry. I didn't understand the curtain thing. I felt more sad afterwards when Harry grieves and destroys the office.

Dumbledore: Slow painful process since it was obvious throughout the whole book he going to die at the end.

Hedwig: Ouch

Dobby: Trying to hold back tears, this one hit me the hardest because of how sad it was.

Fred: Sad for Ron and the rest of the Weasleys, but tbh I wasn't super attached to him. He seemed like a safer choice to sacrifice.

Snape: More sad for him than I expected to be, considering I didn't know he was a mole for Dumbledore yet.

Remus and Tonks: This stung. Rowling needlessly killed off the coolest characters without a scene to show them going out.

Bellatrix: That fight was awesome!

Voldemort: I didn't understand the wand spin thing.

Overall, Rowling killed off the cooler, fun, badass characters, like the marauders, aurors like Tonks and Moody, and Bellatrix, but left us with the more whitebread ones, like the Weasleys and McGonagall.

Not that I don't love those characters too, they're just more vanilla in comparison without the cool backstories.

** Cedric was bleh. I didn't feel especially attached to him in the book. I didn't even notice that he was the first death in the series. It really didn't have an impact on me.

Sirius was gut wrenching. The mystery of the veil, and the wonderful world of magic made me sure he was coming back in book 6 or 7. RIP.

I had Dumbledore's death spoiled by online trolls at the time. I read the spoiler in World of Warcraft and just stared at the screen. It was the same feeling as dying on a hardcore Diablo 2 character with rare gear. Unbelievable loss--both of the literary impact his death would have had, and of the character.

Hedwig and Dobby made me feel sad for Harry, a bit. It was obvious that we were ramping up the body count, and I didn't care much for the characters as characters.

Snape surprised me. I had hoped that his story would play out differently--either a gallant heroic sacrifice, or to fall as an evil lieutenant. To see him simply betrayed and dismissed by Voldemort was a literary letdown, which didn't make sense to me. Also, I wasn't convinced by Voldemort, who throws green light like he has a laser pointer, to use such a contrived means of executing Snape. (My confusion grew after learning more about the hallows--I certainly wouldn't want to risk the wand being loyal to my pet snake which is also a horcrux.)

The ones who died in the battle of Hogwarts I don't remember at all. There just weren't many pages left for them to be properly missed, and they died in unremarkable ways.

Voldemort was bleh. I knew it was coming sooner or later.

Nagini was my favorite, probably. The mental image of Neville chopping at the snake played in slow motion in my mind, and it was such a satisfying connection back to book 2, when Harry first defeated Voldemort's serpent.

** Hedwig was the one that upset me because she was just an innocent victim of human prejudices. The humans all had some degree of choice in what eventually happened to them. Hedwig had none. Dobby was the second saddest because it seemed like Harry was the only one who truly mourned him.

** - Cedric: Meh. Didn't really affect me that much. I knew he was going to die once he touched that cup.
- Sirius: Sad because if he had just stayed home he would have still been alive and that made me upset.
- Dumbledore: The first time I cried but now its whatever
- Hedwig: Didn't affect me much
- Dobby: I was sad
- Fred: I was shocked...I had to re-read that a couple times
- Snape: The first time, sadder than I thought I should be, seeing as I still thought he was a traitor. And now, still really sad.
- Remus and Tonks: I'm happy they died together instead of one living and the other dying. Obviously I'd prefer it if thye both lived but whatever
- Bellatrix: Satisfaction
- Voldemort: Very anticlamatic
