The Order somehow accidentally capture Bellatrix Lestrange. She's laughing because lol the order aren't going to torture her. They're too ‘good' to resort to such measures. But then they come in pushing this weird chair, and in walk...two...muggles?

They're incredibly bland, like the muggliest muggles she's ever seen. The man says, ‘Mrs Lestrange, tone for your appointment, we got a call about your teeth' (see Tom Hiddleston's brain dissection scene in High Rise for tone)

The muggle woman who came in with him , who's hair is strangely familiar, shows her the tray of tools she's carrying...Bellatrix screams...


** Hermione's parents? Played like Dr. Szell in Marathon Man.
