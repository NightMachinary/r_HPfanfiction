** I've got a list of ideas on my computer:

1. After Voldemort's return Dumbledore decides to embrace the ideology of the Greater Good. He beats Fudge into submission, takes all children of Death Eaters as hostages, executes all Death Eaters in Azkaban and generally begins very determined actions of war. Voldemort is obliterated very quickly.

2. Voldemort tries to steal the Philosopher's Stone, Diary-Tom opens the Chamber of Secrets and Sirius Black tries to kill Pettigrew during the same year.

3. After escaping from Azkaban Sirius plans his next actions a little more thoroughly than not at all. Was it really so difficult to write a letter to Dumbledore and tell about Pettigrew being Scabbers?

4. After Ron becomes prefect, he realises that the prefect's badge is a Horcrux of the first Hogwarts prefect. The same petty and pedantic soul that made Percy what he is takes control of Ron in order to continue its unholy mission of maintaining order and discipline at Hogwarts. Ron obviously sides with Umbridge, but it does not end there. Eventually even Voldemort doesn't survive Ron's maniacal crusade.

5. Due to a coincidence only possible in the wizarding world, all of Voldemort's Horcruxes end up in the wrong hands at the same time. The most chaotic war ever begins as Voldemort, Diarymort, Ringmort, Locketmort, Cupmort, Diademort, Harrymort and Naginimort all battle for supremacy.

6. "Once you start down the Dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.‚Äù After Harry casts the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus Carrow, something snaps in him. With the horrible threshold crossed, Harry resorts to the Darkest spells and methods in his final battle against Voldemort.

7. (Crossover) After Harry becomes the fourth Triwizard champion, the organisers have to get creative, because a fourth dragon cannot be acquired in such a short notice. In their hurry, they open a portal to the movie version of Middle Earth, but unfortunately do not consider all possible consequences of unleashing the hyper intelligent Smaug into an immensely rich but totally unprepared world.

But instead of getting body back by each horcrux by some hitch of magic, their number or whatever reason end up posseing host and intervertebraly retain the personality, quirks, and base goals of host, just you know with voldemort's amorality, memories, and sociopathy attached. We have Main voldemort, lockhart is locketmort, the vainest and most narsasitic dark lord with a wining smile and he uses obliviate rather than AK, making you forget how to breath. Ginny is diarymort and is still shyly infatuated with Harrymort, and you know has a pet basalisk. Dumbledore become ringmort, a grandfatherly voldemort who seeks to safeguard Harrymort, and defeat voldemort.

Naginimort gets possessed during voldemort's resurrection and escapes, only to be captured by animal control, he is trapped in zoo and begins influencing and taking control while learning about muggle world, and has to become as resourceful as the penguins of madagascar his goal to take over mI6 and eventually parliament. Harrymort is just your average budding dark lord that is worried about girls, getting through puberty, again-, dealing with all his copies and passing time in hogwarts since he always knows everything already.

Not sure who cupmort would be.

** Book 6, Harry goes to get water for Dumbledore and gets dragged under by the inferi. They lock him in this underwater cell but because they've been there for so long they don't take his wand and all the rest of it. There's someone else in the cell in suspended animation. It looks like Sirius at first, but it's Regulus. Harry manages to free him and they escape.

The thing is, I don't really know where to go from there!

  Dope idea! Since Vold is at large then, Regulus would likely be a walking target for the other death eaters. So...dodging them, showing them why he defected..maybe he could give insight into how Death Eaters operate to Harry, etc.

** Remus has a younger brother named Romulus and Regulus is Romulus best friend, maybe boyfriend later. Thats the idea. I also had the idea of that the chamber of secrets opened when the marauders where still in school and its full moon and Remus transforms and looks the basilisk into the eyes. Remus is still alive, but the werewolf is dead and i had the idea that the others teach him how to become an animagus. I even wrote a few chapters but i never posted them, because there are too many quetions, as an example "why was the chamber open" and "who opened the chamber". I have lots of other ideas, bit i already finished them in my head or add new things every day and i never come to the point to actually write them down

** A normal Harry potter gets dropped into a Wbwl universe and has to deal with all the bs that that world brings with it. In case you are unfamiliar:

-A Twin to rival Lockhart in his fame obsession and incompetence

-A completely over the top evil Slytherin Harry that is basically the next dark lord. Trained by X and is the strongest person in Hogwarts by the time he sets foot in it.

-A Manipulative Dumbledore

"Fame obsessed Parents

-some younger siblings (can be Normal Harry's main interactors)

-whatever this Ron Weasley brings with him

-if it's post Sorcerer Stone the Ghost of Hermione because nobody saved her or Wbwl Harry murdered her for some ritual and she reappears during Priori Incantatem

** Would be nice to build upon the world set in /The Sum of Their Parts/ (with permission), especially given the abrupt epilogue and time skip. Maybe a self-insert/OC Ministry worker and their reaction to the rise of Lord Potter, culminating in their allegiance or resistance to his cause. Or expanding upon one of the background characters from the fic.

** I have two ideas. They are both crossovers and I started out on both of them and I want to expand from just the one shots I have written. I will talk about this one though. A Harry Potter and Parasyte (The Maxime) anime crossover. Happens right after fourth year where Harry Potter's body gets possessed by an alien parasite. What I got so far is the possession and the Hall of Prophecy chapter. Though it's different from ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù gathering up some members that were part of Dumbledore's Army. I actually wrote two different versions. One is where the Parasyte just goes straight to the hall of prophecy and confronts the death eaters while the second one is a bit more diverse and a bit too confrontational. The second version is where ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù is in Umbridge's office alone and is confronted by her along with Malfoy and his cronies. (If you have watched the anime or read the manga, the Parasytes don't want to draw any attention to themselves and adapt to human society so they can complete their genetic goal) Though, that is the challenge the parasyte has to go through without getting caught. Since by chance it landed at the barred window of Privet drive and possessed The Harry Potter. Not to mention, its during the year where most of Wizarding Britain is calling Harry a liar and a crazy.The parasyte actually uses that to it's advantage since most students are inclined to stay away from Harry then e around him besides of course his friends. Not wanting anymore attention then it was already receiving from the body it possessed, ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù doesn't confront Umbridge at all, even joins her little student club while also going with Hermoine's ‚ÄúDumbledore's Army‚Äù secret club. (Harry is a lot more Slytherin in this fic) (I also have a portion written out as the parasyte, after killing the Dursley's, finds Harry's Hogwarts school supplies and such in the cupboard and learns magic. In the original Parasyte works, parasites are real quick to adapt and learn languages, especially when they have access to electronics and books.) Anyways I am getting off topic, back to The Umbridge confrontation. Umridge always was suspicious of Harry and because of Fudge in extreme denial about Voldemort being back. Umbridge of course wants to kiss up to the Minister's ass and try to find a way to get ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù to snap. (Which never happens) So when she finally got him in her office with the floo powder in hand. Umbridge thinks, Finally I can find out Dumbldore's real agenda, expose him and get a higher position within the Ministry. That's not the case here at all. (Sneak peek)

"An emergency came up Professor, I apologize if I am violating so many rules. I am sure that my actions will be justified soon enough." Harry Potter replies smoothly, his tone emotionless and bland as usual. Dull green eyes revealing no emotion whatsoever.

"Emergency? Does this emergency involve Dumbledore?" Umbridge asked smoothly, a dreadful smile curled up on her pink lips. The smile told the parasyte that she knew exactly why the teen was in her office at that very moment. The Parasyte rolled its eyes at the woman. She didn't know anything at all.

"I am afraid it does not," Harry responded calmly, eyeing Draco from behind, the blonde still had his wand pointed at him. The silver eyes of the aristocrat dared Harry to try and make a move against him. Not that the parasyte needed to, but it was running out of options and patience. The parasyte never once thought it had to resort to its more animalistic side. Instincts were too risky to rely on, too vague, the consequences too dire in the end. But at this moment, it seemed to be the best option.

"Oh? And what does this Emergency involve?" Umbridge asked, her eyes narrowing dangerously at Harry Potter who didn't fall under pressure in her petty interrogation.

"The Dark Lord."

After this Harry chomps Umbridge's Head off, Crabbe and Goyle book it,while Draco remains behind petrified with both shock and fear. Harry, knowing that Malfoy's father was a death Eater, decides to take Draco as a hostage when going to the Hall of Prophecy as a boon. I have a bit of a conversation happening between The Parasyte and Draco, where the parasyte reveals it's true intentions. Which is to side with the Dark Lord. The parasyte believes it was created from magic, and since its main task is to kill all humanity, it thinks it means all The Muggles. Voldemort has a large following and wants to kill muggles as well. I have bits and pieces written out as well as adding some things to help aid in with the crossover so it won't be as wonky. Like for one, Harry has a journal where the Parasyt and better understands Harry's character and better intimidates it, but being a non-sentimental creature emotions and empathy have a lot of work.
