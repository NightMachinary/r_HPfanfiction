I know everyone loves to bash Ron without mercy, but I'd like to see a Ron that uses his strategic mind for something else than winning chess matches in the common room.

Any suggestions?


** Hm. Not sure if it's what you want, but in my first story, "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", Ron starts out rather "flakey", but discovers that he has a talent for the military, and ends up the hero of the war.

I've written a competent Ron in "The Dark lord Never Died", but he's more of a secret agent there than a chess brain.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

** Linkffn(The Refiner's Fire) and its sequel, by Abraxan. If I remember correctly, they set up Ron to be a general or something in the sequel. It's honestly been YEARS since I've read it though, so if anyone else has a fresh perspective and can confirm or deny for me, that would be awesome.

  Harry Potter got rich and powerful after he received Sirius inheritance. Not all of his friends are really happy with the resulting situation. It's not so brill if your best mate is too busy fucking his harem to play chess with you, is it?
