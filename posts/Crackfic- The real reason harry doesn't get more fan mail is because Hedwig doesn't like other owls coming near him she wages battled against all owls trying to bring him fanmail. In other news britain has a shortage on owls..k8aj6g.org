** To be a post owl is the greatest honour a bird can have. For hundreds of years my line has been dedicated to carrying our burdens to their recipient no matter what. My mother was struck thrice by lightning in a single trip, but kept the, slightly scorched, letter firm in her talons. My grandfather flew from Hogwarts to India in a mere week and a half, a superb feat of endurance that had propelled him to the head of the parliament. Yet neither of these achievements, nor the countless others attributed to his family, compared to the challenge I face now. For I have been tasked with delivering this letter to one Harry Potter. To do so requires penetrating to the very nest of the White Death herself, something hundreds have tried, and hundreds have died for. Yet I am so close, I can see the window, glimmering with light in the distance, and no sign of the foe. Except wait! What is that? A flicker of pale feathers in the moonlight. Before I can even turn my head I feel the bite of sharpened talons sinking into my wing. Pain shoots through me and my head begins to swim. I can feel the air rushing up past me as I begin my final descent.

CRACK

What? What has happened. I am lying on grass somewhere, no longer falling. No longer anywhere near the destination. Moments pass, and the rending claws fail to appear. I have been saved. Against all the odds someone, or something has whisked me away from the great owlery in the sky. I turn to thank my guardian angel.

"Dobby stops all letters to Harry Potter!"

*** Also, Harry may have been worried about Hedwig when Umbridge had her intercepted in book 5, but she was merely roughed up, and those three aurors wouldn't be out of St Mungo's for years from the physical trauma alone.

** (a random owl tries to deliver mail to Harry)

"None shall pass."

"What?"

"None shall pass."

"I have no quarrel with you, good owl, but I must deliver this fanmail to Harry Potter!"

"Then you shall die."

** This just gives me a brilliant idea: A one-shot where Dobby and Hedwig have an over-the-top epic fight over Harry's mail - Involving magic, swordfighting, guns, karate, a car chase and other crazy fight stuff.
