This is more of a rant, but seriously, I have noticed that, recently, on 3/4 of the prompts posted on this sub, crack or serious, you have people calmly discussing it and trading ideas back and forth; which is completely normal, and then, suddenly, there's those insufferable bastards who come out of nowhere just to say "Yeah, but it can't happen, because in canon, [insert something relating to the prompt]" and nothing else and this makes me so angry.

Just... That's the point? In case you didn't see it before, the name of the sub is HP*fanfiction. FANFICTION. Fan. Fiction.*

What? You mean to tell me that Snape wasn't actually a male stripper when he wasn't teaching at Hogwarts?! What? Luna's father wasn't actually running a magical drug empire and talking about imaginary creatures because he was always high as a kite? What? Harry wasn't actually Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Peverell?

WOW, REALLY? I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED! I mean, it's not like I saw the movies or read the books or anything. Thank you for sharing your wisdom with us lowly mortals, Mr. Big Brain!

** There are some parts of canon which each of us considers core to Harry Potter. For each, that's different. Some people look at WBWL fics and consider them the best thing since sliced bread, others detest them because they can't see the Potters abandon Harry when they literally died for him in canon. Some will only read fics with canon pairings since they consider them quintessential, others can't stand them due to X, Y and Z. The list of possible examples is almost endless.

I bet that 80% of the "but in canon" arguments are from people who think that the prompt in question violates whatever they consider sacrosanct, OR where they consider the implications of the prompt world breaking (if X was possible, then Q should have happened long ago and made X impossible).

The only prompt I ever read that was kind of 'world breaking', was one about the sorting hat stopping sortings for child abuse or some such, and so when Harry comes up and gets sorted it was supposed to stop, because of his mistreatment at the hand of the Dursleys. And that would only kinda work, because Tom Riddle was also an abused child (orphanages at the time where awful!) and if he was saved from there (as the sorting hat would see to that) he would have mostlikely never have become Voldemort and killed Harrys parents etc.

I didnt comment on it or anything, but I didnt think it would work, because of the implications it had on the past and the present.

However, announcing child abuse in such a public way would probably cause more than one suicide and a lot of bullying. People seem to forget that kids are merciless bastards if they don't like someone.

**** I do like the idea of the sorting hat signaling child who are abused, in a more discreet way, of course.

However I do not think it would avoid Voldemort entirely. Voldemort is the way he is not only because of abuse and unloved, but also because he was conceived without love.

We can play Nature V.S Nurture a lot with this.

It would more focused on Tom Riddle than on Harry because to me it is more interesting to see how, despite the support, the love, and help he got as a child, he still turns into Voldemort, as in Supremacist filled with bitterness, resentment, and illusions of grandeur, that uses violences and death to gain power.

Less comforting than "hey, it was abused and all. If no one is treating anyone bad anymore, we wouldn't have bad guys anymore", so scarier, but more interesting and challenging to pull it off.

I've always hated this interpretation of canon and have always taken this to be symbolism rather than an actual reason for his sociopathy. Like, this is just saying that any baby conceived via a rape will grow up to be a mass-murdering psychopath, or to push it to it's logical extreme, any baby conceived via a one night stand with no love or emotion involved will grow up to be one as well.

The only real impact the love potion has on him is the fact that it cause TR Sr. to leave Merope when she stopped drugging him, which resulted in her giving up and dying which led to him being raise in an orphanage. Which still isn't enough to make someone a sociopath (hell look at Harry- raised without any love since he was a year old and abused worse than Voldemort, so even in canon that's not the sole reason). If anything it would be the inbreeding done by the Gaunts and their mental issues that were passed down to Voldemort that made him the way he is, if you're going to single out any one reason.

To take your example of WBWL fics, I have avoided them because Harry's identity as The Boy Who Lived is absolutely essential to his whole character, his whole conflict, and really his whole personality - especially by the end of the series. Harry would be a totally different person without his unwanted fame and notoriety. I'll even read crossover fics and fem!harry fics before WBWL, because to me that represents less of a reach than reading a story about Harry Potter when he isn't, y'know, Harry Potter.

** I think this is a low-effort way to say, “this prompt is bad”.

I feel two ways about this.

Prompts exist as a challenge for you as an author to find a way to make the characters do the prompt while still staying in character. Some prompts are harder than others but it's a valid concept.

But also, some prompts are bad. I'm not even a super canon-literal person but if it's not a crack fic, it really messes with your WSD if the characters are behaving in a way that they never ever ever would...

So maybe I am a rather canon-literal person, in the sense that the characters are the characters, plus of minus 20 degrees. If they aren't within that range, you are writing an OC, in which case you don't get to assume your readers care for free. OCs require actual character development.

** I seriously don't get some people's obsession with sticking to canon. It makes for a boring read because you've read that hundreds of times before. My personal philosophy on this is to only take as as much canon as you need. The HP/RWBY crossover I'm currently writing has like two years's worth of HP canon and roughly the first 10 minutes of RWBY canon. I still feel like it's too much so I'm considering completely ditching CoS as well.

** We've had a few posts like this recently commenting on criticism of prompts and I think the takeaway messages were ultimately that criticism of a prompt comes down to a few things:

1. It's a low effort prompt that has little substance. "Daphne Greengrass decides to become a doula"
2. The prompt assumes a canonical baseline that is not canon and people attempt to remind the OP. An example would be a prompt such as "Fed up with dealing with Susan's antics at home, Amelia Bones phones Draco's godfather, Severus Snape, to arrange a playdate." It'd be one thing if the OP then specified an AU but the change established in the prompt (playdate between Susan and Draco) is not a change from the baseline of canon, but a change from an unspecified AU where Susan's parents are dead, wizards use phones, and Snape is Draco's godfather.
3. A massive plothole in the prompt itself that should be addressed.

Frankly, even if criticism is completely unjustified, I fail to see why it's so angering. It's still discussion of a prompt and so long as it doesn't violate sub rules and civility, I see no reason why it warrants such a reaction. Just keep scrolling or click to make it go away.

** Wow you guys are upset! As a reader of fan fiction for 20ish years I don't understand this religious-like fanaticism for adhering to cannon.

When hp fan fiction started the series wasn't even completed yet, so it was understood that all fan fiction would not be cannon compliant. Cause it was FAN fiction. None of us were JK Rowling, we were just playing with her toys.

The AU tag used to be reserved for fics that really stepped out of the hp world (like no magic ever existed, all the characters are cats, story takes place on an alien planet, etc.) you know, like an alternate universe!

If a character or story arc veered to far from established book characters, they were marked as being OOC, or they noted the place they began deviating from the books.

It's still just a story, and sometimes you have to tweak a characters back story, or change a date, or historical event, or create a new opportunity to make a new story work.

Even with all the additional Pottermore entries, spinoff series (Fantastic beasts and where to find them), and the play sequel that should have never been written (cursed child) the history and rules that govern magic in the hp verse are still not well defined, and honestly JK wasn't very consistent with the ones she laid down either. So we all made stuff up as we went along, and some of the fan theories/rules make better sense than some of what JK gives us as official answers anyway, but I'm going off on a tangent.

The point is, you can be a fan of a series and love its characters and overall plot without being perfectly faithful to every minute detail the original author ever wrote about it.

**** I can understand your point of view, there is no defence for bad writing after all, and it's not all logical/scientific muggle stuff, there are a great many that use the same mythology Rowling used to base magic in the Hp verse on.

House elves for instance, I've read several fics over the years that used the mischievous and destructive nature of brownies and the lore surrounding them as a base, to explain the origin and subjugation of their race quite elegantly.

Or werewolves, I remember one fic that focused on Remus' time trying to sway the werewolves, it used the the story of Romulus and Remus as the source for the disease, and used ancient rome as a base for werewolf society, in which Greyback was less of a wild pack leader and more like one of a handful of Caesars. though still called pack leader, he was primarily a general, granted he had more leeway with the deployment of his “troops” than in a democracy, he was not the end all be all when it came to werewolf society, in the UK or Europe as a whole, as depicted in many fics, nor was Remus scouting the globe trying to locate lone werewolves or packs gone tribal in deep forests. It was refreshing for a werewolf fic, there was not as much importance place on alpha/beta/omega status beyond being used as a class designation, and the designation was not fixed upon the individual being turned. Through the course of the fic Remus had to navigate this society and try to raise his class standing to get before the higher echelons to make his case. I wish I could remember the name of that fic, now that I've described it, I want to read it again. I wanna say it was on an old archive site, ff.net wasn't super popular yet. And I don't think ao3 was even thing. It would have been just before or just after book 5 came out. 2003ish

Were house elves intended as a direct allegory for the victims of the transatlantic slave trade? Most likely not when it was written and if you see it that way...who REALLY has a weird view of Slavery IRL?

Then people complain about Fanfic with elves being anything other than victims because "aCtuAlLy Jk sAYs iTs...." and she's a person who says a lot of things as is her right as a sentient creature but like...

This is fanfic bby.

If I want to spitball with Kneazle deep state Wizarding Alex Jones esque satire within the world JK Rowling created now why can't I?

ARE WE FANFIC WRITERS? OR ARE WE JUST MAKING AN IMITATION OF CANON FOR OTHER'S APPROVAL?

Excuse me, I write HP crack fic that seem totally freakin genuine because it tickles such a deep part of my giggle bone that I just can't stop anymore and it's how I've been managing my stress for years at this point.

If I want to write about !Scourer William T Sherman wrecking things on his march to the sea wrecking Witches and Wizards along his way while using his Union status to keep his cover I FREAKIN WILL.

If I want to write Rose Weasley as a Slytherin because she makes friends on the Hogwarts Express and thinks to herself "Wow I hope we get sorted into the same house" because she's made a friend that slipped past her parents' biases from their school days and that friend is sorted into Slytherin and Rose thinks "Ahh well...shame then" so I can have her get SLAMMED by the Sorting hat with a big fat "SLYTHERIN" and just have her experience that character growth and all of the weird conversations with her father after that, and Albus just straight up getting spooked by the look on her face and pulling a Harry and getting sorted into Gryffindor. Then I get to have Scorpius and Rose making friends in Slytherin and Scorpius could be like "Ayyy lmao according to fancy Pureblood etiquette your chill cousin Albus who has beautiful eyes has to chaperone us because he's your male relative and nevermind that I think he's cute and I am super using this as an excuse to hang out with him until you both realize the etiquette thing is a playful cringy kid type scheme that is so so heartwarming."

IF I HAVE TO MAKE OCs to FLESH the PLOT OUT I will and you'll have to pry my messy ass side characters doing regular ass stuff out of my cold dead fingers.

When I write next gen fics I want a whole generation of kids that get to be kids again, their parents know just how gross it is to force them into battle before any serious adult relationships.

IF I WANT THEO NOTT TO WORK ON TIME TURNERS not because his friend's big bad magic Nazi daddy wants him to...but because he's driven to do the impossible so he can save someone's life. Someone he knew and admired and deserved better. His head of house, a man that was flawed and on occasion mistreated children but gave him the only advice that ever got through to a boy who knew more about arcane devices than he did about his own father.

If Theo Nott wants to save Horace Slughorn HIS HERO (Or Snape or Arabella Figg) from a blood curse that's basically just magical bad cholesterol I will bend whatever and whichever canon elements I have to to vent my stress on this make believe world that I have to.

I will die on this hill.

**** To be fair, fanfiction is rarely that good, my feeling (and point) is just that peoples' perceptions of characters (and events, and locations, and everything) have been shifted a lot by fanon interpretations of them. That's why I think it's a bit facetious to say people have to stick to canon or that something would be unrealistic in canon, because - like it or not - there's a v extensive fanon universe we've got here at this point and hundreds of stories in every subcategory and sub-subcategory that couldn't quite be original stories in their own right and are still different enough that they couldn't ever be canon.

As for the Potters being abusive or neglectful parents, yeah, don't get me wrong it's a weird trope and I've not enjoyed any story where it's not been justified properly. Although, to be honest, I'm not sure being willing to die for your child is necessarily correlated with treating them properly through childhood (this sounds worse than what I mean hahaha but it's kinda irrelevant) - that aside, though, I doubt anyone looked at the canon portrayal and instantly decided to write a fic about 'ooh what if they were alive and beat Harry on the daily and they forgot his birthday and and and'; we got different tropes that eventually developed to become the evil!Potters fics we see around the place. For example, in nearly every WBWL they're dicks, and it's now a subversion of that trope to actually make them more canon-compliant. I don't think these fics are generally good by any means, and you're well within your rights to see the portrayal as offensive, but imo it's fine that they exist.

** Yeah, it's funny isn't it? On one hand certain types of canon divergent & AU plots are so popular that they turn into the tropes we all know and love (or hate lol) but on the other hand ask for something different, outside of those parameters, and people jump out from every which way to 'correct' your thinking....but don't be offended, it's just "their option".

I really, really wish more people would just scroll on by if they don't like it. In such a big fandom as this (or any fandom really) there will never be a consensus - so just let people like what they like, request what they requests, prompt what they prompt - don't like don't read, just move one if it's not your cup of tea. Or do a separate post with Discussion flare, this is the right forum for it, not in the comments of a prompt or a request.

**** Protection against assorted Dark wizards and possibly creatures. See Harry's note to Dursleys in Ch3 of Deathly Hallows:

‘I hope so,' said Harry, ‘because once I'm seventeen, all of them -- Death Eaters, Dementors, maybe even Inferi, which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard -- will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you'll agree you need help.'

Moody says in Ch4 of Deathly Hallows:

‘[...] They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother's charm holds, but it's about to break and they know the rough position of the place. [...]

Dude... Do you seriously believe that Dumbeldore would've let Harry stay in #4 Privet Drive if it didn't provide protection from death eaters?

****** That's literally the point though. Dumbledore knew that if Harry was left unprotected, the remnants of Voldemort's forces from the war would seek him out and kill him in retribution. The only guaranteed protection was Petunia's house, as long as Petunia and Vernon didn't kick him out. There was nowhere safer - we've seen in canon that literally every other location on the map, from the Potter's house in Godric's Hollow to Hogwarts to Grimmauld Place, is not impenetrable.

Dumbledore believed, correctly, that while Harry's childhood would not be pleasant, he would survive it. Both for Harry's own sake, and for the sake of the war, that is obviously the paramount concern. Lily's sacrifice could and would guarantee Harry's safety.

I've always felt this was such a weak attack on Dumbledore. Man did some questionable shit, but I don't think you can reasonably argue that this deserves a place on the list. Judge JK Rowling for writing Petunia and Vernon largely as cartoonish villains all you want, but Dumbledore deserves better than this.

******* The initial comment was more to me a joke.I never said it wasn't a strategic move for protection of an asset. Nor did I intend for it to be an an attack. If it came across that way then I apologize. However, lacking other options or not, I feel that its a weak excuse for anyone to knowingly allow the Dursleys to get away with it. To the point that they only improved his situation, if marginally, after Harry's reintegration into the British Magical community.

Dumbledore put him with these people. Whether he acknowledged the abuse for what it was, power play or not, doesn't absolve his culpability. Again this is my opinion.

Dumbledore isn't a villain, but I wouldn't down play his slightly shady ways either. However, I do tend to over think most things like this.

For example, if the prompt was "Harry saves everyone from the basilisk by handing out sunglasses," it would be very reasonable to explain that that's not going to help. Now, if you want your prompt to be about the basilisk's gaze working in a different way, that's fine, but then that should be the prompt.

And I disagree that it's reasonable to explain that that's not going to help, unless you're doing it to further the discussion instead of putting it down.

** I agree that you don't have to stay within canon, and you can steer from it, if you want.

But at some point, and this is true for some prompts, this is just not H.P anymore. Someone want an original story with a vague magical setting, and just used the same name, but it's not the same characters anymore.

Combine with an alternate universe and then, you're not in Kansas anymore.

I love original stories. But don't label them Harry Potter fanfictions.

Whenu get a Coffe!shop A.U with a Happy Snape who's open-minded, and a huge liberal, that come to the coffee shop in the morning after his job as a stripper you're not in Harry Potter anymore. Especially if every characters are as vastly different (fun, outgoing Harry, Serious Ron, brainhead unmotivaged Hermione etc).

Calls it anti-Harry Potter if you want Could be fun. But not Harry Potter fanfiction.

Personally, I'm here to read about Harry Potter and its universe. I am happy with canon-divergent and AU, as long as I find something that is still Harry Potter in it. When I found a prompt or fanfiction and my first thought is "That's not Harry Potter", then I don't think it has its place here.

** Its a slippery slope. On the one hand you can be canon compliant and treat fan fiction as an extension of the series. On the other hand you can ignore canon completely and write whatever you like.

Neither is correct and everyone's going to have an opinion on what side they fall on and to what extent.

Personally, I feel that you should stick as close to canon as possible otherwise you may as well be writing original fiction.

It has always pissed me off when I see stories that are changed so significantly and fundamentally that literally the only thing separating them from original fiction stories is the names of the people and places.

I hate those stories with a passion because they ABUSE the fandom for cheap recognition that the stories don't deserve.

And it's worse when the actually quality of writing is decent. Like bugger off and write your own stories, don't piggyback on popular fandoms if your stories aren't even recognizable as a part of said fandom without sticking the main characters name on it

Yes, Mr/Ms Big Brain, we know what fanfiction is. But “fan” in the term includes that you are actually fan to some real existing universe created by Ms Rowling and published as seven books with Harry Potter as the main hero. If you want to write about male strippers, you just go girl (or boy)!, but why in the world do you want to call that male stripper Severus Snape, when that person has nothing to do with this activity. Go call him Augustus Fox and write your story. However, when you call him Severus Snape from the HP universe, than you should at least somewhat tangentially use the character described in the books. Yes, it is possible that this Severus Snape lives the dual life of Hogwarts Potions bat/male stripper, but you should explain how we got from the persona in the books to your character. If you have as your character happy drunk in orange robes why do you call him this name? Of course, because you can, but do not be surprised when you will have number of disappointed readers who expected something different and who are as lost as I would be reading your story. Or you have your work cut for you to persuade readers that this lunatic has any reason to be called this name.

So, of course, you can write whatever your want, all bytes in your computer are yours (or loaned from Microsoft), but don't be surprised if you won't find many people who would share your excitement with this bizarre freak in the original sense of the word.

TL/DR; nobody forbids you to write any crap you want, just be warned that it is still a crap.

If you are not going to use the source material, you are not writing fanfiction. You are writing fiction where you happen to reuse the names of a popular franchise. Or worse, you are hiding your work behind such names simply to get people who would not be interested to read it.

​

What is interesting about fanfiction is what you use from the source material. Sometimes that is simply a character, sometimes it is the setting, sometimes it is a 'what if this was different'.

It is interesting because it interacts with what we know in canon.
