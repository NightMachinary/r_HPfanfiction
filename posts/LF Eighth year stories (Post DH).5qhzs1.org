Mainly Cannon so Ginny and Hermione but Rob and Harry are welcolmed to.

(I've seen quite a few Draimone Fics in this setting that I liked so that's acceptable to)


** Poor guy just wanted some recommendations, probably saw a bunch of responses and got all excited.

To OP, when you say 8th year, do you want Harry back at Hogwarts or just any story that handles the school year after the battle? I'll see what I can find for you.

***** Sorry, I didn't know taking a step back after realising my temper was getting too damn high and spending a bit of time thinking, subsequently taking time to realise I was too hastey, was illegal.

Obviously I was wrong

****** Well obviously it's not illegal because I haven't arrested you and put you in reddit jail for the crime of melodrama. It is, however, attention seeking and immature.
