** I do not know any fics that does this, but I'm pretty sure it must exist somewhere.

Personnaly, I do not think it is a good idea to use a song inside a fic, for the same reason I dislike characters using film or quoting Internet. All of these actions risk to plant too firmly the fic into a period and a culture, while Harry Potter seem to be more timeless.

*** I also think songs are just too long-winded to justify using them in a fic. Quotes already take up enough space as is, and even then can be a bit out of place.

Perhaps if the song is a short nursery rhyme?

** FloreatCastellum does a great job with snippets of the Nina Simone song "Sinnerman" in this chapter of Hollow Ash: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12778140/6/Hollow-Ash]]

As the song plays in the background in the car, it simultaneously serves as foreshadowing for the plot, character building for the Muggle police officer in the story, and sets a nervous, foreboding tone.

** Not as such, but I've known a few people who will recommend a song title at the beginning of a chapter or section of a chapter to accompany reading it for thematic purposes.p

** I've seen songs used well for setting a scene in a fic. Like anything, it can be done well or it can be done badly.

I wouldn't suggest popping an entire song into a scene (unless it's some sort of puzzle that the characters are trying to figure out). However, sometimes it's nice to include a few lyrics if the characters are listening to a song that's appropriate for the moment. For example, at the Yule Ball, or Christmas at the Weasleys'. Music can be just as important for describing a scene as any other sense (touch, smell, sight & /sound/).

A few examples off the top of my head:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] has lots of scifi and movie references in it because of the main character's odd personality, so a few song snippets here and there fit with the style of the rest of the fic. Obviously this irreverent style only fits with certain kinds of fics, but there's a poignant scene in chapter 50 that does it particularly well.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14368581/][Of Your Making]] has a few Celestina Warbeck lines when one of her records plays on a gramophone. That kind of scene setting/world building could fit well in almost any fic.

** So called song fics are a massive (and widely derided) part of the fandom - or at least they were, until FF.Net cracked down on lyrics in stories.

** I certainly hope so. I've written a one-shot (though for RWBY, not Harry Potter), where two characters wind up singing a modified version of 'Sincerely, Me' from /Dear Evan Hansen,/ where one character thinks he's making himself more appealing to a romantic interest by pretending to be her teammate's long-term best friend, and the other character thinks she's helping the first one establish a mutual cover identity as an independent secret agent, since she herself is one. It's been taken down.

I've also written one for Worm where two characters (one of whom is black) begin singing 'Everyone's a Little Bit Racist' from /Avenue Q/ to two feuding white supremacist groups, which was actually my first attempt at fanfiction, ever. That one's still up, probably because it only features a couple lyrics while the other characters react, instead of detailing the whole song.

** I dislike both songfics and, especially, fics that insert lyrics into the narrative. Oftentimes theyre modern pop which A) shouldn't be out for the books set in the 90s and B) instantly and irrevocably date the fic to the year almost

** As long is the music is good and it fits with the narative. I've seen a few fics where it was handled well. I've also seen a few where it really wasn't. Those fics I immediatly stopped reading.

** I have used lyrics at the start or end of chapters to add 'punctuation' or set a mood. There's at least two fics I can think of where lyrics from a song or poem are used as chapter titles, and the tone of the chapter usually fits with the reference. Anything more than a quick tag is likely to be skipped by readers as being intrusive to the story. Good storytelling hides the author as a mouthpiece.
