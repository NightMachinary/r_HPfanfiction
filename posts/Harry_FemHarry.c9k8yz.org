Rec me Harry/Fem!Harry fics! I've got a craving for this pairing.


** I also like selfslash/selfhet which honestly needs more exploration. Now lets see, that polyjuice scene in DH.... or Tonks.... Why not have hermione be a furry.... heck, why not have selfslash/selfhet result in kids, and why not have trans(/)nb muggleborns and halfbloods, and a ritual for bigender people that gifts them functionality... then insert your favorite mpreg, tgtf, or intersex fics but with correct terminology and the like. Now i get that if anyone does my ideas incorrectly it turns into fetish fuel real quick. But if you do it as a sort of hpmor/saga of tuck style testing the waters fic, you could really make a difference.
