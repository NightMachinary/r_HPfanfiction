** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming)

It happens in this.

Warning: Harry is pure evil in the sequels. Don't read them if you're not prepared for a truly evil Harry. He's literally as bad as Bellatrix, if not even worse.

** These are my favourites, but they may not be exactly what you're looking for. Draco is not one of my fave characters.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] - This starts in second year. Harry eventually makes friends with most of the school including Draco. Harry prays to Loki summer after first year. Second year starts with Harry getting annoyed with Ron and Hermione. Bashing is only because people take a while to adapt to a more independent Harry, and slash warning is for minor characters. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] - A more paranoid, cunning Harry is unwilling to allow Hermione to control his life. He starts a whole club just to keep her occupied away from him. Eventually goes into business with Draco and a bunch of others. Kind of an anti-muggle fic. There is a whole book that can be read as a stand alone where Harry goes to the avatar universe and joins Aang and the gang on their adventures. Slash is for Harry. Complete.

** Does it have to be dark Harry? And why is this voted down?

**** You can ask for Snape/Harry while Harry is still 11 but if you dare mention anything negative about Hermione you'll get downvoted. Welcome to [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]]
