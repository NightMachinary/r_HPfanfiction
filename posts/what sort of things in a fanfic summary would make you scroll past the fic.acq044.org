if the grammar in the summary isn't the best, then i'll assume the rest of the fanfic is the same. less than 500 words in the first chapter makes me iffy. mentor!snape turns me away to. summaries that don't really explain what the fic is about and just has a quote from the fic annoys me.

for ships, i'll scroll past Snarry, Harry x Voldemort, Drarry, and Hermione with anyone other than Harry, Ron, or Viktor Krum.

Edit: a lot of people seem to dislike fem!harry, which is slightly upsetting because fem!harry is one of my favorite tropes. other than the of bad romance fem!harry fics (drarry, snarry, harry x tom, ect). there are a good few, Gryffindor's Girl, Apathy (dn crossover), Yule Ball Panic, Lily and the art of being ... i forgot the title, but all are good fem!harry fics. what is it about fem!harry that people dislike? of course people are allowed to dislike it, im just curious. ...should i make a different post for this?


** Really cliched story lines are a no from me.

‚ÄúGirl!Harry‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if Hermione was adopted by pure bloods!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if Neville was the chosen one?‚Äù

But on the opposite end, anything that's outrageously unrealistic and OOC turns me off too.

Once I read one where Albus Severus was disowned by Harry because he was sorted into Slytherin, the trolly lady was a crazy monster, and Bellatrix had a kid with Voldemort.

It was terrible.

*** I agree with each point in a small sense, but in most of them, I will give a bit of leeway.

1. Summaries are /hard/. I can sit down and write six or seven chapters and I will still be tapping my cheek, trying to figure out a summary. Granted, I never say that I suck at them in the actual summary, most likely on the note in the first chapter if at all. Trying to condense all my imagination, world, and events into a paragraph is something I cannot do. I cannot simplify things.

2. Depends on whether it is good or bad bashing. Well, I dislike bashing as a whole as it is quite dumb, but using character traits as a method to assume something (from a character's point of view) is great. In one of my stories, the main character hates Dumbledore and only sees what he wants to see. Another thing I hate is where characters (mostly Hermione) are made perfect. I consider this reverse-bashing.

3. Everyone makes mistakes. My mind often automatically corrects them, no matter what I read.

4. Depends on the universe and how different it is. I think, without a doubt, that Severus was beyond redemption. He bullied, tormented, and ruined the lives of children he taught. He did /some/ good at the end, solely because his own guilt was eating away at him. Even from a young age, he was not a good child and he clung to the happiness that he received from Lily and became jaded when it was taken. Love is more destructive than hate, without a doubt. In order to redeem him, you /must/ go back to the start.

Draco is a little different because he has redeeming qualities. Think of it this way: A terrorist comes into your /home/ and puts a gun to your head, telling you to kill someone or he would kill you, your family, and everyone you loved. The issue is that this terrorist was crazy powerful, had some major influence. Lord Voldemort came back from the dead. You must see that Draco would have had it rough. In order to redeem him, it can be done at childhood, pre-teen, or teenager. He quite obviously cares greatly for his parents, so even Lord Voldemort reviving can be a good point. He has a lot of arcs and potential, everyone just does it incorrectly.

I feel bad for mentioning slash, but what I said above is what causes issues with Harry/Draco slash. They have chemistry and they have anger. Love and hate are at the same end of the spectrum. One of the more common things I see is: Draco is mean! and, well, most boys often bully the girl they like?

Anyway, redemption can work if it is done correctly. There are a few that cannot be saved. Tom Riddle, Severus Snape, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Lucius Malfoy to name a few.

we don't see him 'ruining' the lives of anyone he teaches, lol.

but even if he did, that still wouldn't make him beyond redemption. this applies for /all/ redemption arcs, but /especially so/ for snape, who risks his life to save the lives of other people. your apparent idea that redemption can only go to people who haven't done any substantial wrong, or if they did, were forced to do so, is incoherent with what redemption actually is. you /have/ to do unforgivable things to be worthy of redemption. snape can be redeemed at any point in his life. bellatrix and lucius are flat characters with clear and flat motivations, so there isn't much to go on wrt their reform. riddle's entire character is about his belief in his own superiority over others and his fear of death. at a push, you can influence him as a child or teenager and have him pursue less malevolent means of attaining immortality, and achieving greatness

I mean, he made Hermione cry, caused Neville so much fear that the boy's boggart was him, and humiliated and tormented him in every class. He was a toxic person that would have been fired and sued in any real life setting. I am not a ‚ÄòSnape apologist', nor do I seek to bash him -- heck, I love his character. He was not a good person, though. The ends do not justify the means.

I apologise, but I consider abusing, belittling, and tormenting young children to be an unforgivable thing. Threatening to poison someone's pet is abhorrent, no matter how you want to look at it. Have you ever lost a pet before? Now, imagine someone -- a professor, who is someone you are emant to feel safe around -- threatening to kill it to your face.

Tom Riddle was a malicious child from the get-go. The only way you could redeem him is if you gave him a happy family outside of an orphanage. Same for Severus. The root of the issue is the childhood.

How is it misogynistic? I do not understand. It is a considerable fact and a quite true statement, not that I condone it. Half the men I know bullied the girl they liked and they ended up together eventually. It is something that happens, even in this day and age.

Of course, one could make an argument that this temporary distress is the reason why they did not go to Snape in the fifth book before jumping into action, and that if they did tell him Sirius wouldn't have died. Plus, the possibility of such behaviour causing lasting trauma is a very real thing that some people have to cope with in their adult years, because they had real people do that kind of stuff to them one or more times too many.

Yeah, it's a thing, but not everywhere. I would guess it relates to the bully doing it because they do not, at this point, know of any other way to get the girl's attention, but as someone who'd never actually seen this personally (where I lived as a kid, all the bullies happened to just be unpleasant people and none of them succeeded at getting any of the girls they gave their ‚Äúattention‚Äù to) I couldn't tell you for sure. Although you won't find me claiming that this isn't rooted in sexism on some level, because it likely is, but I don't think it's as simple as being an example of misogyny.

** - On AO3 -- 50 characters, ten pairings, and a million tags.
- Abuse fics. We know Harry was neglected and emotionally abused. I understand when people want to focus on those things, since they are horrific and JK didn't really acknowledge the trauma there, but I have no desire to read the Dursleys beating the shit out of Harry and raping him. Ditto for Draco and Hermione.\\
- Harry is Lord of Everything, because lol. Usually described as "Harry finds out the truth about ..."
- Harry/Hermione is the Malfoy's or Lestrange's kidnapped child. I'm not a fan of Dumbledore's, but that just ludicrous.
- Also, Hermione is a secret pureblood or descends from Salazar Slytherin in some way.
- Hermione thinks the conservative pureblood culture is all very sensible and learns their manners and customs so she can be accepted by them.
- Fem!Harry because while I have no doubt that it can be really well-done, it's often a self-insert fic or an attempt to write a female character at the center of the action. While I do find annoying that Hermione spends so much of the series helping Harry with his goals instead of having more goals of her own, I hardly want to reread the books from another perspective.
- Also, doing the books from another perspective, but keeping Harry as the center of the action, so it's basically 100k of the books being rewritten with Harry in being in Slytherin. If you're going to go through the trouble of giving Harry a whole new life, what's the point of having him make nearly the same decisions?
- Harry or Hermione go back in time and immediately take up sex with Voldie / Bellatrix / Lucius / Narcissa / Regulus / Snape or whichever character the author wants to save. In general, the summary for a time-travel fic has to be really intriguing, or I just scroll past it.
- Harry/Draco/Hermione are secret veelas, vampires, or come into sort of creature inheritance that makes them better at magic than just about anyone else, and also comes with a soul mate bond so they can be paired off with someone at eleven without actively choosing the person. The veela tag alone will keep me from reading just about any fic.\\
- Men being loved into being better. I personally love Lucius and Snape, because they are petty, vindictive, snarky people, and I find them fun to read as long as I don't have to root for them. It makes me gag when people pair them with Hermione or Ginny in an attempt to offer them redemption, especially when they have been interested in the girls since they were children, which is horrific. Using characters such as Hermione, Ginny, and Luna to write redemption arcs for fucked up men, implying that they can behave like perfectly wonderful human beings if only they are loved by the right woman is just offensive. Lucius, Snape, and Voldemort (and in some cases Bellatrix) didn't need attractive teenage girls who took the time to change their mind about everything they believed in and were kind to them even when they showered these girls with horrendous verbal abuse. What they needed was to work on themselves, and not be terrible, regardless of whom they were sexually attracted to/in love at any given time.

- 2: So not specifically Female!Harry as if its a female Harry from birth I might be interested, but I am not a fan of sudden sex change, or "secretly a girl" styles of stories. No, I would rather a solid female Harry OC if possible.

- 3: Honestly not a huge "traditional" Harry/Ginny pairing fan. So if its that pairing the story better be drifting far away from canon style.

- 4: Adding to 3... any story that's too much of a basic rehash of the canon story. I don't want a retelling of the canon story that just has Harry in a different house and that's the major change.

- 5: And finally, the one that is the biggest NO of all to me... Stories where you can just TELL that the author "censored" themselves to get a lower rating to attract a larger audience or avoid complications. The original stories are not rated K, or even T all the way through, so unless your story is clearly aiming to only tell a child's story, or a very tame and sweet story, don't censor it for a rating. It becomes fairly obvious early on and makes a story have no proper flow, nor be believable. There are elements of Canon that are rated M, and yet folks continually handicap themselves to T, or worse, K ratings at times. I am not saying there are no good K or T stories as there are plenty. I am just saying I have seen far too many fan stories with incredible potential that are ruined by the fear of an M or even T.

** Anything with more then 10 or so tags in Ao3. nothing turns me off quicker then an over tagged story.

Fics with evil! or bashing! Ron/Weaslys/Dumbledore tags, as they are almost always childish power fantasies.

Poor spelling and grammar is also a turn-off. If you cant be arsed to properly spell check a single paragraph designed to highlight your story, why should I believe that the rest of your story will be any different?

I don't mind quotes or whatever in the description, as long as its well written, and gives me some idea of what to expect. As an example, one of my all time favourite fanfics (not harry potter btw) does this really well;

"A new overlady, you say? She's a little short and flat-chested, although her temper is impressively vile. Oh well. Needs must when needs must. Too long have the lands of Halkeginia gone without true Evil. There are fluffy bunnies and happy ponies all over the place, frolicking! It makes me quite sick! No, it doesn't matter if she wants to or not. Because Evil always finds a way."

from the description alone, it sets up who the main character of the story will be (Louise), what the overarching plot of the story will be, ( Her journey to become the "evil" Overlady of her country) and what style of story this will be, I.e. a comedy, as derived from the tone and choice of language used in the description.

The other obvious: Spelling errors in the summary. If you aren't willing to proofread two lines that everyone sees first, I'll assume you aren't willing to give even a cursory proofread to thousands of words.

The more substantive one is when the summary makes it clear that the main character has been stripped of his/her autonomy so that s/he won't have to own his/her flaws and bad decisions.
