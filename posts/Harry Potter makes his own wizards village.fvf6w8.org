Harry Potter start making his own wizard village It becomes later a city or a town


** The only one I know the name of is Partially Kissed Hero. Harry hires some dwarves to build him a fortified town/compound thing entirely designed around defense against Voldemort and Dark Creatures. I enjoyed that part of the fic, but the fic undeniably has... issues....

There was also a fic where someone started buying like warehouses(?) I think and turning them into warded and self contained wizarding hamlets. In another someone ( for some reason I want to say Petunia, Snape, and Lucius) bought up all of Spinners End and turned it into a wizarding neighborhood. Can't remember what fics those two were from though.

** Harry starts making a small town like Hogsmeade on the mainland during the Cupboard series as Diricawl Academy sets up on Potter Island, but the war kicks up before it really gets built and we never see much of it. Linkffn(United We Stand by Stargon1), but the series starts with linkffn(The Cupboard Under The Stairs by Stargon1).

I'm also recalling a fic where Harry, Neville, and several others construct essentially their own Manor towns in expanded trunks, all linked together. Can't remember the name.

And of course Harry follows wizarding tradition and makes his own island country in the short, linkffn(On An Island In The Sun by Rorshach's Blot).

There are also The Harem Wars (Radaslab and Vince McGill) and Rocking The Boat by DerLaCroix that have Harry retreating to private islands/ family manor towns, but that's not quite the same as /making/ his own.

** Oh that's actually something I'm trying to write! It's a fem!Harry fic. She is kinda Dark, I guess? Still works with Dumbledore against Voldemort, but their relationship is less of a mentor-student and more of a fragile allience, especially as time goes on and their ideologies differ more and more. I think Dumbledore will both respect her and fear her potential because she reminds him of how he and Gellert used to be, but will try his best to be a good role model because he learned from his mistakes in how he dealed with Riddle. At one point she will start creating her own safe haven for magicals that is completely seperate from the muggle world, which will be a major factor in the story as the second war starts.

It's still in its "a word file of prompts that takes place in the same AU" stages though, so I don't think I'll be able to get to actually writing it soon.

** Ugh. You know what the bane of these stories is? The inevitable, dying-of-boredom "Chapter of describing everything." Reading one of these stories now, which is otherwise quite entertaiing, but this chapter has me actually making excuses for things like checking my email for other story updates, wandering into the kitchen for a snack, etc. They are excruciating.

In fact, it was one of these chapters that caused me to completely abandon Core Threads. To be fair, I'd already had a great deal of niggling dislike for this story because the author for some reason thought it was "cute" for an 11-year old girl (AND HER YOUNGER SISTER) to constantly make sexual innuendos, with the lame excuse that the 11-year-old thought it gave her control to be "outrageous." (That's not cute, just sick.) But the overall story was interesting enough until it came to a screeching halt with boring detail after tedious description about the mechanics of building the damn thing. That's not a story.

In this current story, we'll see if taking a break and copious skimming will get me to back to the story before I just stop caring. The fact that I'm 35 chapters into this thing and STILL considering abandoning it, I think indicates how dreary and tiresome this trope is.
