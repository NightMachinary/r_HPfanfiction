Tradecraft is the espionage community word for spying techniques, tricks, and technologies that they use to do their spying thing. Are there any fics that cover a magical equivalent of this? Sort of like the ladybug-bug in Where in the World is Harry Potter? or that siege spell door breach thing in that Indy!Harry fic I currently forget the name of. Just any magic-using techniques for spying or secret-agent-esque shenanigans.

Or any ideas for magical tradecraft that you haven't seen in a fic and would like to?

I'll also accept crime stuff in a pinch, like Call Me Moriarty ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11602420/1/Call-Me-Moriarty]]) and her kingpin-esque criminal network-building.
