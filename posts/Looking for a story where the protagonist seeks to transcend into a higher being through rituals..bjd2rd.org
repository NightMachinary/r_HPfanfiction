*** I've read it, but it's not quite what I'm looking for. Whilst he does become powerful, his concerns remain those of a human (or author insert [ ei: racist, sexist, elitist]).

His core values from his childhood remain those into his adulthood and he never goes through any transformation that forces him to reevaluate those beliefs.

Additionally he also remains a singular meat-bag that experiences time in a linear fashion, where Dr. Manhattan does not.

For reference, even the /Minds/ in Iain M. Banks' The Culture remain somewhat understandable by human standards until they *"Sublime"* and then they loose all perceivable interest in the materiel galaxy.

I don't think Noddlehammer actually wants to kill off the majority of life on Earth... but he does have an unfortunate habit of writing MCs that are assholes.

  What I personally think of those same people is irrelevant. I've stopped engaging with the world at large years ago. Fanfiction is in fact the only foray I make outside my room, so my thoughts and opinions will inevitably bleed through it to a degree, but that's nothing you need to get upset over. I am, after all, just a slightly overweight guy in his underwear typing away at a keyboard.

*- Chapter 52 authors note*

I feel the line, "/I've stopped engaging with the world at large years ago/" is indicative of a certain type of person. It's almost Incel like. Social isolation isn't healthy and it breeds prejudice and contempt. So although he turns it up to eleven in his works, it's likely very informative on his actual core values.

On a more specific note, the MC in FLOM writes off the entire Islamic world as barbaric and anti-science, ignoring the centuries where the Muslim world /was/ the scientific world. Here we see a character the writer tells us is the clever one, embrace really lazy thinking, the same kind of lazy thinking I believe the author practices.

Now I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just showing you how I arrived at my own conclusion.

****** No, no, I get you. It's actually quite likely that Noddle is really not a very nice person. But I do enjoy his writing to a certain degree, and people want people they like to be nice. In his previous Naruto fic series the MC was pretty agro as well, but had a much more laisez faire attitude in general as time wore on. In FLOM Harry is a bad person. Just, no, he is a bad person. He's spiteful, not as smart as he thinks he is, and prejudiced to a disturbing degree, culminating in his genocide of 95% of the human population of Earth regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual identity, or religion. That, to me, casts him more as a misanthrope, rather than a racist, which is sort of better? He hates everyone equally? To a certain extent, I give the racism a bit of a pass, because characters in fiction can be racist even if the author isn't, even MCs or characters we are supposed to like. And that's the thing, I'm not sure if we /are/ supposed to like Harry in FLOM?

Whatever, I'm not disagreeing with you, I just want to hope that Noodlehammer is really a good person... underneath the racism and misogyny of his characters.
