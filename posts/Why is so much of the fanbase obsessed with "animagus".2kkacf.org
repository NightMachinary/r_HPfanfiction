I really don't get the appeal.

In the books the biggest use of the talent was to:

(a) spend 10 years as a rat to hide

(b) spend a lot of time as a dog

(c) be a bug and listen in on private conversations

This apparently appealed to a lot of people because it seems like almost every story I try, devotes several chapters to animagus rituals, forms. Weirdest part - the only contribution to actual plot is always just the research / whatever rituals author decided to make necessary for transformation.

And it's always treated like this big deal about which everyone is so excited "oh what's my form going to be?... of course I would love to devote most of my free time for next year to get this great ability to turn myself into a lesser being. What's this you say... I could spend this time learning actually useful spells? Nah... imagine, a year from now I might be able to become a cow anytime I want"

Also... in most fanfics, after many chapters spent describing how MCs become animagus... they never actually use that for anything important afterward.

And really, aside from trying to get away/hide, why would any person ever trade utility of wielding wand-magic, for being an animal - aside from Zoophilic sexual fetishes?


** It has some elements that attract a writer.

Within HP, it's another one of those tricks of magic that the Marauders accomplished but Harry's crew never tried, again making Harry & co. seem like lesser wizards on the whole.

Fanfiction is all about correcting the oversights and exploring the corners only hinted at.

The process gives a writer an excuse for exploring the nature of the characters, plus opportunities for funny/embarrassing scenes and situations.

Every once in a while, a story has the hero or one of his less-capable allies utilize the form for spying purposes- one of those 'only you could do this mission' situations. It was enough of a risk in canon that Bellatrix killed a fox at the beginning of book six.

Oh yeah, and it's canon-approved reliable *wandless* magic.

I've seen a few where Harry's uber-awesome animagus change is the cause for his +Super-Saiyan+ Merlin/phoenix/dragon-inherited powers to awaken.

In general, I don't know if this would fall under the getting away or hiding category, but even in canon we see that some things, like werewolves and dementors, affect animals differently. The full list of things that shifting to an animal form can help save you from may be much longer.

The marauders learned the transformation to help Moony with his furry little problem. Ignoring the question of whether it is useful, Harry could want to become an animagus simply for the familial link to his dad.

All that said, I suspect that you are correct... if you find out that your form is a cow, you abandon the project and move on since turning yourself in steak to protect yourself from a werewolf seems less than safe.

** The Marauders made the map and did animagus transformations, Snape rewrote potions textbooks and invented spells, Lily made enchanted gifts, the twins made all kinds of elaborate prank items, Luna did a wandless stunner - all these at younger ages than Harry... and Harry? Conjured a Patronus two years earlier than the rest (one year younger than Luna and Ginny).

It's an easy out to show how awesome people are - the literary low hanging fruit equivalent of saying "hey, look, these guys are awesome!" in an "elaborate" way.

** Probably because the authors wish they had that skill. It could be pretty awesome as long as your form isn't terrible. Shoot, it'd be be pretty neat to be a mountain lion or bird of prey! Utilized correctly, your animagus form could offer a range of skills normally not available. But, yeah, I totally agree with what you say-the average wizard wouldn't need it.

I bet it'd be a hallmark of a Transfiguration expert. Wouldn't be surprised if most applicants for the Transfiguration post at Hogwarts were Animagi.

*** uhm - I will give you bird. And that's assuming you are able to take something more then your clothing with you when you transform. Might make small shopping trips faster.

What the hell is the use of mountain lion? There is a high risk of getting shot out of public safety concerns anytime you transform. If you are in a city or suburbs - useless.

If you are on the outskirts of civilization. Too big to sneak effectively... or climb. Mountain lions aren't even good for travel - compared to cars they are relatively slow and suck at long distance.

So still useless unless you are so down on your luck that you actually need to hunt for food yourself.

I... What? Seriously?

It isn't about "being practical". It's about /enjoying/ something. You consider turning into a bird and all you can think about is running errands...? What happened to the basic joy of unaided flight...?

If you don't get that, all we can really say to you is that it's a really common phenomenon for people to be enthralled with the idea of getting to become something with capabilities different than yourself. To even have a physical form radically different from oneself even if your abilities don't really change would still be a cool experience. It sounds pointless from a purely logical standpoint but it's true. It's a different way to experience the world.

Not that it has anything to do with my point, but mountain lions have sharp teeth, claws, and brute strength that humans don't possess...

**** Regarding mountain lions and birds, I just personally think they would be neat forms. I still think a common place animagus form could be very useful in spying situations, such as the war they were in. But, again, I agree with you-there's not very much practical application to it. It's probably more of a personal exercise to see if you can do it. If I were a witch I'd definitely attempt it because it'd be neat to turn into something else and because it would be a challenge.

That gives me an idea for a fic...

But seriously, I completely agree with you. Too often it seems like becoming an Animagus is just thrown into the plot without it being too important, just to make the character (usually Harry) more impressive. It doesn't bother me sooo much, except it's also often some mythical creature that's never mentioned in the books, or something exceptionally rare. Rare/absurd, not even important to the plot? That's just annoying.

To be honest, I don't actually think Harry would ever become an Animagus. It's too much of his father's legacy, and he was really more like his mother. His father was a show-off and exceptionally good at Transfiguration. Harry's thing was the Patronus at age 13, and even still he openly rejected displays of power. I'm not sure James would have snapped the Elder Wand.

** Especially since you can transfigure yourself into an animal, as Viktor Krum did (partially) during the second task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Though a complete transfiguration into something that can't wield your wand might require a partner to reverse.

Naturally, for the Mauraders, when Remus transformed, everyone else could have transfigured themselves into fiercer beasts, and Remus could have reverted them once he was human again. That would have been a lot faster and more flexible.

*** I'd certainly be quicker to just transfigure themselves, but in concern to full/partial transfiguration aka as Viktor Krum attempted, you'd have to consider what the vital differences between an animagi and a simple transfiguration actually are. While an animagus may seem to have a resistance of sorts from werewolf-inflicted wounds etc, would a transfigured person have the same protection?

I imagine there is a whole lot more behind why someone would become an animagus, whether it be for the perks or for exercising one's skill in transfiguration.

Ruljinn and Warhammer have the gist of it.

*** maybe it's just me.

I owned 2 dogs in my life. I did my best to be good to them. But their lives still sucked and than they got old and died. Aside from pets, my encounters with animals are limited to a few farm and zoo visits, where their lives are hell on earth, and animal education shows which when viewed in context of human life only underscores that being an animal on this planet sucks ass.

I associate animals with extremely limited ability when compared to human, usually messy and always painfully short lives.

To me dreaming of turning into an animal for a bit is sort of like dreaming of being a cripple for a bit - might be not too bad, but surely there is a better way to spend my time.

**** But as an animagus you don't lose your human side. Otherwise wizards would never be able to change back. To me, Animagus-transformation is like a war between the animal's instinct and the human concience. Sure, (magically weaker) people probably could get lost in their transformation, but that is one of the risks, that is why the Ministry has a list of known animagi. And that is why being an animagus is kind of a big thing. It's about control of your (inner) animal. Maybe even a bit Jekyll & Hyde-like.
