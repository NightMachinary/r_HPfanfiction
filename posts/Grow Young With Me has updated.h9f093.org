[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/28/][Chapter 28 is up]]


** How can this story be so fucking good and genuine. Heartwarming and fluff without being trite. Profound about loss without being disheartening. Vibrant about everyday (wizarding) family life without being a soap opera. While Abby and Harry are falling ever deeper in love, with every chapter I'm here wondering what kind of love for this story qualifies as.

Forgot to say thanks [[/u/taliesin19]]! Every chapter's worth the wait.

** James' reaction will be interesting to read. But once the children accept Abby, that's probably most of the obstacles gone from marrying her.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** I'm debating a total re-read at some point. Every update I reread the chapter before to remind myself what just happened. I think I need a full story refresher and investing that much time in this story sounds worth it to me.

*** Harry Potter is a widower and he meets a Muggle woman in a coffee shop and they have a slow burn romance. Very slow burn, but the subplots are well done and no one is OOC.

*** Yes; this fic is a shining example of when the summary really really doesn't represent the plot well.

Note that as well as being a widower, Harry is a single father of three, doing his best to be a good dad but struggling with losing the love of his life.
