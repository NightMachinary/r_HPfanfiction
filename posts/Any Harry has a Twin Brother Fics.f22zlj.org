Does anyone know of any good stories where Harry has a twin brother? To be more specific, I am NOT talking about WBWL stories those don't interest me. I would prefer if both brothers were raised together by the Dursley's. Also preferable if he is in a different house then Harry (Bonus points if Ravenclaw). Also no bashing, maybe a little if it's done well. These terms are mostly negotiable. If anyone has a story to recommend that would be much appreciated
