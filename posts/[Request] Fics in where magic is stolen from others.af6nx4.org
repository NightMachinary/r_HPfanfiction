We've all seen both canon and fanon accuse muggleborns of stealing magic from wizards and witches, but are there any fics where that actually happens? It could be anyone doing the stealing, not just muggleborns.


** That's a thing that happens in “The Wishmaster” linkffn(11409121)

  Lily is prepared to do anything to save her son, so with her dying breath she finishes the ritual to cast her wish to the Wishmaster, asking to send Harry back into the past. Years before that fateful event, a green-eyed toddler is found by Salazar Slytherin, who decides to take him in as an heir. But the child has dreams much greater than simply being Slytherin's heir.

** This is a pretty big spoiler for the fic, so I'll put it in tags:

[[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond]]

I thinks there's also a few indie!dark!Harry fics where Dumbledore is stealing Harry's magic or whatever, but I can't recall a name of any of those right now.

*** I actually don't mind spoilers all that much, mostly because I see them as something to look forward to rather than spoiled content.

That said, thank you for the recommends, I'll be sure to check them out.

** linkffn(Sunrise over Britain by Bobmin356) has that.

Voldemort stealing Harry's magic is the opening action in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Power He Has Not by Clell65619).

  A different spin on the Potter Verse featuring a manipulative Dumbledore and an evil worse than Voldemort. A look at what could drive three people to destroy the Wizarding World.

  Complete AU 7th book, Dumbledore is gone, the Ministry and Hogwarts in disarray, Harry and his friends are the only hope, but then Harry's Magic is gone. Some times it really sucks to be Harry Potter. HPHG eventually.
