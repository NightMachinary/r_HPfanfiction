I'm looking for fics where the room of requirement is both:

A: A major factor into the events of the story. B: More than just a training room, unique and special. (Ex: D.S.S. Requirement from "Wizards in Space," or the brotherhood hideout from "Relentless we survive."


** The most unique Room of Requirement I've ever read had it as the first room and Heart of Hogwarts, and that it was capable of simulating the entire castle. It was used by the founders to plan out how they would like the castle to look as well as to make changes to the castle after its construction. The fic characters didn't end up using it for anything particularly cool though, it was just backstory.

*** Can it simulate itself? ... Is the whole universe just the inside of the Room of Requirement?

The RoR can exist outside spacetime. 5th year Harry and 5th year Bellatrix both use it to hideout and hook up. It's used extensively as a time machine and for training.
