** Crossovers often bash Harry. Dimension Hopping for Beginners sometimes bashes Harry(s).

I can't think of any non-crack HP fics that obviously bash Harry right now - unless Harry changes dramatically / goes back in time, and then bashes the old-version-Harry, or wrong!bwl where /everyone else/ bashes Harry. Both types are still Harry-centric fics.

** If you'd accept mocking canon Harry with a rather non-canon Harry depicted, a number of time travel do-over fics start with Harry dying and usually Lily berating him for being an idiot.

HPMOR, to its detriment, tends to lampshade stupidities in canon (by saying it would be stupid, or by demonstrating how stupid it was), and canon Harry is targeted sometimes.

*** I dunno, I'm really tired of Harry-centric fics. I'd like someone else to be the super! indy! fivehundreddifferenttitles! grey! character for once. I'd settle for mere Harry-criticizing, really
