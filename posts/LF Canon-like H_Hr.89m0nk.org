as much as i like chemprof's "Notebooks and Letters" Fiction, it delivers a to much clever and smart Harry (and Ron). I know, such a Request would fit better in the Harmony sub, but i want to give it a try here. As we see during the Canon, especially during Book 5 and (yet even more specially) Book 6) Harry is dumb as a Bucket. I dont know, if this whole "creature in his chest" bugs me just because it always concerns Ginny or if i would be fine, if the same would happen on Hermione. Still, its so stupidity puperty...Jesus, that Boy is 16 Years old. Yes, i know the Puberty end biologically around 21 Age. Anyway, i can imagine, its difficult to write a Fiction with the In Characters of Harry and maybe Ron. But i would want to know, if there are H/Hr Fics that fit the "Canon Character" more. It doesnt have to follow the Canon, meaning: it can have AU elements or the Events do happen in different Order.

As i would read Canon based H/Hr stories, usually i avoid any Animagus or Badass/god-like Fics, since this doesnt happen in Canon. If there is no other alternative, i would consider in reading it, IF the Reasons are reasonable.


** In my opinion, The Augurey is the most plausible H/Hr romance yet. It gives a good reason why the canon pairings would break up, without excessive drama or any bashing. The romance isn't the defining characteristic of Harry's life - you can imagine him not being in this relationship, which is very rare for these stories. And it's based off of Cursed Child, so it's about as canon as you can get without going into post-epilogue marital infidelity fanfics.

*** I love that story, although Harry catching the Idiot Ball in the most recent chapter was pretty annoying.

  After the war, Harry Potter is desperate to make sure that not a single life more is ruined by Voldemort's legacy. Aided by the ever loyal Hermione Granger, he makes a decision which will forever change more than one life. An epilogue disregarding, Cursed Child inspired, Harmony romance.

** linkffn(12296750)

Pretty close to the canon characterisations, but with more background for Hermione (stuff about her family) without going into the often seen "You know, my wife likes to be tied up and have both her holes stuffed. I bet our daughter is the same so here's a fat dildo to fuck Hermione with. Damn, aren't we the most supportive parents ever?" territory of "acceptance". Overall pretty fluffy, but it is a good character depiction without bashing.

  Set during OOTP. The story of how Hermione's innocent suggestion of running a Secret Santa with the DA leads to the ultimate search for the perfect presents, an unexpected change in holiday plans, late-night mistletoe-kisses and revelations of profound feelings hidden deep down. Total HHr.

**** Granted, neither have I as this was an exaggeration, but as soon as Hermione's father makes an appearance, it's either shotgun dad with something along the lines of "touch my daughter and die" or it gets exaggerated to the point where her parents encourage sex because the author feels like teenagers sneaking around to have sex is worse than fascism.
