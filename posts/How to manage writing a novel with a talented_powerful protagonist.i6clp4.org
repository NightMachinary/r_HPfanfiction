I've read fanfiction for a long time and so, as quarantine has given me lots of time, I've decided to give my go at it. I feel like I've come up with some unique and exciting ideas to play around with, but I'm worried because the fundamental premise for my fic is that an OC son of Voldemort exists. I've seen plenty of fics with this setup, and, unsurprisingly, it seems to lend itself to works of poor quality. I want to do whatever I can to stop my writing from turning out the same way, so I came here for some help.

My character is going to be talented and intelligent. He won't be any stronger than Voldemort or Dumbledore were during their youths, but that isn't saying much. Advice for how to make sure that he doesn't become a gary stu is definitely something I'd love to get, but it's not my main issue. What I'm struggling with the most is how to handle legilimency. My OC is going to be a natural legilimens. It is essential, but I don't know how to limit it. How do you limit, not just magically and combatively (which seems relatively easy), but in every other area, an eleven-year-old with the ability to delve into the minds of almost every single person around them?

I truly feel that I can do something interesting with these concepts so I don't want it marred down by stupid, avoidable shit. Thanks in advance.


** Have his natural legilimency be a burden at first. Seeing into the minds of everyone around him, feeling their unfiltered emotions, hearing their thoughts, having those capable of occlumency think that's he's intentionally violating minds, and not knowing what's his and what's not? That wouldn't be easy at all. You can have him gradually learn to control his abilities over the course of your story.

As for the other areas of magic, simply place him on a scale between Hermione and Sirius. On the Hermione end, you have a somewhat intelligence woman who studies vigorously to achieve near-perfect grades. On the other end, you have a highly talented individual who barely needs to study to manage top grades but will not likely be duelling Dumbledore anytime soon. I'd suggest slightly closer to the Hermione end. An intelligent, somewhat talented man, that studies to achieve near-perfect grades, though he can still easily maintain a social life and have fun.

*** To add on to this, have strengths and weaknesses. Like good at charms but not skilled at battlefield transfiguration for example.

Or, since I imagine he would be more inclined to attack than defend be more skilled in curses and hexes than shields

**** I'm not so sure. The best wizards are generalists. Look at Sirius and James and how they excelled at everything. Look at Snape, potions master but also competent duellist with charms and transfigurations. The best wizards might have /affinities/, like James with transfiguration, but they're not weak in the other fields.

Hermione, the lower end of the spectrum I suggested, is also essentially a generalist. Her only exceeds expectations is in defense, understandably given her nature to freeze up during stress.

From "talented and intelligent", I got an impression that he wanted a character at least at Hermione's level. I imagine such a character would not have weaknesses, though I agree they may have preferences for certain magic such as offensive curses.

***** Perhaps weakness is not the best word.

I was thinking of something like Wind Shear [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]]

Where Harry mainly focused and developed his conjuration/transfiguration thing and didn't focus as much on other skills once he go so good at one. (At least that's what I remember)

***** Everything you said is right, but I also do think that by giving him a range of talent in different areas, people may subconsciously compare them to each other. Not sure if that makes any sense, but if he blows Hermione out of the water in DADA, but is only at a little better at transfiguration, it might make him seem less unjustifiably talented. I can also really focus in on specific areas and maybe even have him neglect others. I think even the most gifted people would struggle to match Hermione if they put in no effort in a subject. My big issue will be figuring out reasonable justifications for why he might neglect branches of magic as basically all of the ones people care about are just so cool and broadly practical.

**** Yeah, I can look into doing something like this. It'll have to be balancing act as, much like Impossible-Poetry said, I am planning on having them above Hermione's level and characters like that, in general, don't have many weaknesses, but I can try and make pronounced differences in different areas of ability. Wind shear was a good example. I also think that by at least illustrating his different areas of expertise, I'll be able change the reader's perspective of his abilities. People love to compare things so by keeping certain skills above others I may be able to make him feel less perfect, even if he is very talented in most (not all) of his weaker areas.

I can try this, or at least something sort of like this. The problem is that because he's a natural legilimens, he's abilities would be developed before he comes to Hogwarts. Voldemort is the example I'm thinking of. He could actively possess people by the time he went to Hogwarts, and while I'm definitely not gonna let this character do that, it would still be very weird if someone who could read minds their whole life hadn't learned any control by 11.

This I am gonna do, though he will be intentionally violating minds (not maliciously) so I think there is plenty to go on here. Especially with how he might interact with Dumbledore. He definitely won't be happy with the son of voldie reading people's minds.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'm not sure if you are talking talent or skill here. He definitely won't be as powerful as Sirius at least during his earlier school years, but I think a part of what could make a son of Voldemort story is seeing how characters deal with someone who isn't just his son, but who is in many ways similar to him. How can they look past his father's deeds when they see so much of him in the character? Should they?

I do think there are ways to keep him within your scale so I'll definitely keep that in mind. I can focus him on areas where the long term benefits might be pronounced but the short term benefits are comparatively smaller so his powers seem justified. Focusing on using ancient runes or potions for example. Not necessarily those specifically, but stuff where I can justify a genius still going very slow.

Thanks for the reply. It gave me some ideas to think on.

** Imo, what separates a Gary/Mary Stu and a hypercompetent protagonist is how much they struggle. If your protagonist easily defeats everyone they come across, gets the girl(s) and fuck you money while the world caters to their every whim they would be more of a Gary/Mary Sue.

If your protagonist defeats every opponent they come across but gets fucked up along the way, escaping through the skin of their teeth on several occasions and even getting lucky that's more hypercompetent than Sue. Nothing wrong with a hypercompetent protagonist, people love James Bond after all.

This is a very good point. Part of the reason I'm excited about this novel idea is that I think I've found some really interesting struggles that I can explore with it which I haven't seen done before.

Yeah, it's just a matter of balancing these things. Because my character is going to be quite similar to Voldemort on the surface, he's going to inherit some gary stu-like traits. While getting the girl and getting girls is obviously very different, Tom Riddle was extremely handsome and charming. Honestly, any character with legilimency who can use it subtly and is willing to use it should be startlingly charming. They understand exactly what people are thinking and feel after all. Now, romance isn't gonna be a focus and neither will him pulling girls, I'm just trying to make a point.

Yep, this is really important, and I plan to make sure he struggles and loses throughout, but I think it's harder in the earlier years (especially year 1). This may seem counterintuitive as he'll be stronger the older he gets, but it's because of the challenges within the early books. Book 4 onward all have incredibly competent villains so it's realistic for even the most powerful student to struggle. Even if he is as talented and hard-working as Voldemort, he's still not gonna be on Voldemort's level (or even close). The problem is that this is less true for the first 3 years. The main villains are all hidden from sight and really nothing occurs until the ends of the books which pose a real physical threat to an extremely talented kid. This leaves more time open for him to not struggle. I know I'm going to focus more on emotional/mental/interpersonal struggles than on physical ones, and I think I have some really great ideas for how to create those, but a lack of physical struggles can still make a character seem overly perfect.

I definitely think you are right on balancing between hypercompetent and gary stu. I'll be working hard to make sure he stays hypercompetent without becoming a gary stu.

** there is no one in the world who is so great or so likable that everyone they meet is going to like them and cater to them. If you're going to have a character that is hyper competent at what they do, make sure other characters react appropriately.

For legilimency, knowing what other characters think may not necessarily help understand why they think what they do or what to do with that knowledge. Your character could glean some information, act on it, and be surprised because the person acted differently to what they thought. Like maybe some random character had a crush on some other random character, and your character wanted to help that budding romance along only for the prospective coupls to be caustic to eachother because they don't know how to relate.

i don't know. minds are complicated. Mood swings and random thoughts bewilder me and it's my own head. Imagine playing spectator to everyone's brain stuff. It sounds overwhelming. Just because someone can naturally can "read" a mind, does that mean they can really understand what is being thought? Maybe your character has difficulty filtering what part of the mind he's reading. Like he wants to know what a person thinks about some important decision and instead all he gets is the unpleasant feeling of their currently damp socks.

you could have it be that, as your character never relied on facial expression to know what people are feeling that they don't know how to emote very well themselves. To other people he would seem emotionless and expressionless despite his unique ability for empathy.

imagine it like this. Most people emote quite a bit. Someone good at reading faces can probably get a good feel of what another person is feeling based on body language. it can come naturally to them, just a matter of noticing rather than a matter of intense scrutiny. They wouldn't be looking all the time, and certainly would still miss things, but when they do look, they see more.

This is definitely true but I do think it is less simple if you can read minds. It still doesn't mean everyone will like you, some people will truly despise you enough that no matter what you say or do, they will never like you, but if you can sense how people react both intellectually (telepathy) and emotionally (empathy), and want to make them like you, it will usually be very easy. That's the thing that really hammers home legilimency as really wild. You get a person's thoughts as well as the emotions behind them.

This is very true and also very important. Thanks for bringing it up. There is a lot of stuff you can do with this, but sadly it's still only a partial solution. The deeper and more complex the ideas my character is trying to read and comprehend, the more likely he'll make errors. That's only logical. This means also means that surface-level stuff should be comparatively simple and in many ways that stuff is the most powerful. There is no reason he shouldn't be able to feel the discomfort or annoyance of someone when he's talking which, when combined with their thoughts likely telling him the source of those feelings, should allow for incredibly easy social navigation. This confusion and complexity you bring up are very important and will make it much easier in many areas though.

Very true and no, I don't think it means they can really understand what is being thought, but it will mean they have a lot of practice. He's eleven by the time he goes to Hogwarts, this means he should have a lot of practice reading and interpreting minds. Still, I don't think that will make it easy or possible to always understand what people say. As you brought up, people barely even understand their own minds. Though I do think being an outside spectator may actually help evaluate and interpret people's minds in some ways, it would also come with lots of drawbacks and challenges. Another thing I can work with is the general insanity of wizards and the wizarding world. That would obviously make it harder for anyone to truly understand what they are thinking. If I make him used to reading the minds of regular people, he could struggle with adapting his previous experiences to his new situation.

**** I did my best to think of drawbacks, but it can be hard when insight into peoples minds is undeniably advantageous in so many situations. I've been reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771][Turning of the Times]] by noaacat and it has one of my favorite takes on legilimancy. It delves into the canon quotes from Snape about how the mind is not a book to be "read" or whatever and describes the magic as "occluding someone elses mind." Basically a foreign mind is going to be confusing and impossible to navigate so you have to focus and orginise their thoughts into something traversible for you.

edit: found a quote from the story

/Severus's blank look was answer enough, and Harry smiled. “Like I said, occlumency in someone else's mind. Yours didn't make any sense to me, because there was too much to process, so I slowed it down and organized it.”/

/“You... organized my mind.”/

/“I enforced an visualization, where it was a hallway and all your memories were paintings.”/

there are time travel shenanigans, and also a character with a special ability that could be very powerful, but is debilitating instead.

***** Yeah it is very hard. Right now I think there are a couple of things I can use to limit it. The first thing I can do is simply not have it constantly being used. It's confusing exactly how it works in canon because of Queenie, but it seems clear that besides with her, legilimency is generally similar to most other forms of magic (and even if it isn't, I'm writing a fanfic). This means it's a conscious act unless it occurs via accidental magic. Following this train of thought, my character won't always be reading minds, or if he is, it will be extremely surface level. He won't be constantly delving deep into other people's minds because he shouldn't have any reason to. I can also create more justifications for why he isn't going way in all the time. It's more risky, would take a long period of direct eye contact, and so on. This can allow me to keep the character from becoming all knowing, but it still isn't great.

Thanks I'll take a look at the novel, it seems interesting. I think the idea of magic protecting the mind is cool and I was thinking of doing something similar. The way I was thinking about it was that for wizards, the more they want to keep thoughts or memories hidden (even on a subconscious level), the harder their magic works to do so. This wouldn't be a trained skill, it would simply be a natural extension of how magic interacts with the wizard's will. Some would be naturally better while others might broadcast even their deepest secrets, just like people are good or bad liars. I'm thinking of if like the precursor to Occlumency.

I've also been trying to think about novels that utilize legilimency. I want to keep my novel unique, but that doesn't mean I'll throw away good inspiration. Sadly, it seems like most novels that delve into legilimency and Occlumency don't do it amazingly.

Thanks you for the help by the way. I think you've given me some good ideas.

** OnAScaleOfDebauchery and Subspace Embassy gave really good advice - I totally second every word of both their posts. In addition, I'd also say to give your OC weaknesses (Kryptonite, Moral Rules, Things They Fail At, Habits they want to hide, etc.), affections (People or Things They Like - see Nicer!Riddle's obsession over Hogwarts or Nicer!Draco's protectiveness over Pansy/Astoria), and/or Fondnesses (Things that make them smile or that they otherwise enjoy indulging in - be it fine wines, gardening, or cocaine). Prodigies (Gary Stu or not), like villains, generally aren't very relatable, which is why the advice always reflects ways to humanise them.

So, think of him from his classmate's point of view - humanisation is always about an external observer looking onto a character. If he's just a genius who blazes through everything and makes them all look bad, there's going to be some tension over that. So, what might make them like him? What besides the smarts might make them dislike him? What might make him tolerable? What feature of his character will they notice first (personality or physical or backstory)? What feature will they notice last?

It's a neat bit of psychological trickery that might help you work out what your readers will likely think of your character and can help you identify what could go into your character to influence those viewpoints. :)

Just remember that character features generally interact - either in conflict or in synergy.

Very true. I'm doing pretty thorough character planning so that I can ensure my character feels alive and real. I think I've got many of those already, but most of them are more significant. I'm also trying to find/develop a lot of tiny things to use. When I read novels, that's what gets me to see the characters as humans. I think of Ron's fear of spiders or Harry Potter loving treacle tarts. As you mentioned, fondnesses, but also all the other tiny things, good or bad, that make up real people, but don't usually get focused on because they aren't of much importance.

That's a handy trick. Character interactions make or break the story, so I knew it was crucial to try and see from the perspective of the characters, whether they are teachers, classmates, or anything else. Still, I've never thought about doing that so I can get an idea of what my reader might see when they look at my character.

Thanks for the insights. I think they will be very beneficial to me.

** A talented student is above of his peers, it doesn't mean he is above everyone. Even Voldemort was polite and respectfull (at least in appareance) with his teachers. A first year learning easily all the spell of his curriculum, and even some 2nd year spells in one thing, it doesn't mean he should start learning NEWT level stuffs. Also, I don't know if your OC is supposed to age the same age as Harry or not, but if it's the case, please do not make him use the Accio spell to find Trevor on the Hogwarts Express, this scene is overdone.

For Legilimency, maybe your OC could just have some raw talent into this branch, without being able to use il (until he learns it). As an example, he could always has been able to know when someone lied to him, and he could "read" a person to know his mood (angry, sad, guilty . . .), but he can't do "mind reading" before he learns about legilimency and practice it.

This is always important to remember. There are also other things besides talent that go into making some "above" another. Harry has boy-who-lived clout. Draco has rich parents. As well, I want my character to align with what has been shown power-wise. Dumbledore could do things that his test administration had never seen done before, but that was Dumbledore at the end of his schooling career. Voldemort created a horcrux while at school, but he was a sixth year. It seems pretty clear that the genuinely prodigious can push boundaries or at least demonstrate incredible feats of knowledge and skill by the end of their time in Hogwarts, but that doesn't mean they can do the same during their first couple years at Hogwarts. That level of power and skill came from six years of Hermione-levels of effort (possibly more so in some ways) on top of their natural talent. I think this is the root of how to keep characters from feeling overly powerful and perfect. Characters need to earn their power. Talented characters might earn it easier and quicker, but they still earn it. They don't simply know spells, they learn them like everyone else. This also goes with the fluidity of it. While characters might sometimes get significant boosts in power like when Neville gets a better wand, generally, they should get progressively better.

#+begin_quote

So my current plan is for him to be about a year or two beyond the curriculum by the end of first, with a variance between classes, though I'm not sure which ones he'll be best or worst at. Assuming I get through a whole year and keep it going, the gap will probably grow larger each year as he gets more time to apply his superior talent and work ethic (at least in the areas he's dedicated to). As he gets older, he'll get more specialized as the topics begin requiring more and more time and effort. Think Voldemort and the dark arts or Dumbledore and transfiguration. I think something like that would be consistent with the progression of prodigies thus far. I don't see classroom abilities as what set those two mentioned above from people like Hermione, so at least on an academic level there is another character who can be somewhat comparable. This will be especially true if he is dedicating a significant amount of time and energy to things outside of the curriculum. Does that sound realistic and workable?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Sadly, his being a true legilimens is an integral part of the story. As well, most of the issues of legilimency even come with pretty basic skills. He won't be doing jack to anyone with occulmency, though, that's for sure.

Thanks for all the advice.
