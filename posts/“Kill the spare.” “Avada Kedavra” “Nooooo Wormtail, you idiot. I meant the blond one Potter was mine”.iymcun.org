**** Are there any fics that follow this idea? Maybe after The Battle of Hogwarts?

That would make so much sense, actually. Resurrected!Voldy couldn't kill Horcrux!Harry because Horcrux!Harry actually has more soul, and maybe magic didn't like that, or magic didn't like Voldy trying to kill essentially himself.

***** linkao3(20631227) features Harry deciding he's done and ensures the horcrux gains empathy when it comes back. The horcrux then has to come to terms with being in the driver's seat, feeling bad about what he's done, and not letting on that he's not Harry to the people who might care about those minor details.

#+begin_quote
  Horcrux Tom Riddle wakes up in a clearing in the Forbidden Forest in Harry Potter's body. Vanquishing Lord Voldemort is the easy part; being attached to Harry Potter's soul for sixteen years may or may not give one a bit of a hero complex. Pretending to be Harry Potter, however, is much, much harder. Especially when all of his friends are actually kind of nice. This is a story involving the start of Tom Riddle's (very, very long) road to redemption.

******** Well, it certainly wasn't able to save him from a Basilisk that was being controlled by Voldemort, nor from Quirrell jinxing his broom, nearly causing him to fall to his death. So it seems to only protect him directly from Voldemort, as well as prevent physical (but not magical) contact from anyone sharing a body with Voldemort.

So, yes, that is what happened.

********** You mean the prophecy that Dumbledore explicitly says doesn't mean anything? That Voldemort put too much faith in it and that Harry had to fight him not because of the prophecy, but because Voldemort came after him and killed his parents? That prophecy?

Dumbledore didn't plan around the prophecy. The reason Harry had to die was because he was a Horcrux, not because of the prophecy. Dumbledore figured that he had a chance to survive after Voldemort used his blood in the ritual, but the prophecy really had nothing to do with it.

********* I'm pretty sure you have that wrong. The spells at the Dursleys kept Harry safe from any wizard or witch that wanted to hurt him, otherwise Voldemort wouldn't have waited until the boy's Seventeenth Birthday to try to kill him (the six Potters move would have been superfluous if the DEs could simply have ambushed Harry on the way home from Hogwarts, or at any time after they discovered where he was.

********** Whatever Dumbledore did at the Dursleys might have prevented other people from hurting him (well, with exception to the Dursleys themselves), but that's never actually stated. So, we don't know, and that protection is based on the protection in his blood, so presumably it wouldn't be more powerful that what it's based on.

If it is then it might have kept Harry safe while within the walls of the home, but was useless otherwise. Since Hermione could create protections in DH that were able to essentially remove their campsite from existence, I think Dumbledore could have placed some pretty damn good protections (especially since he can perform the Fidelius) on another home that Harry could have happily lived in, and it probably would have ended up with the same result.

Potions doesn't make any sense with how it matters which direction the pot gets stirred, but it works anyway because it's magic; that's what separates it from something like chemistry where you can describe what's happening in a math equation.
