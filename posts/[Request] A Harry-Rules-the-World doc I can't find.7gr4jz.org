Not "doc", "FIC" Damn new phone. Okay, this is probs gonna sound silly, but there's a fic I read and didn't bookmark, and can only remember bits. Harry had taken over Britain, maybe the world, was way older and had grown sons with wives and kids. A bunch of his canon friends were enemies, I vaguely remember Hermione (?) leading a task force through a... museum or something? to attack his family at night? It was interesting, and involved wizarding stuff meeting Muggle tech, and it's driving me BONKERS not to recall what it was.


** Sounds like linkffn(6254783) though I don't know if she leads them through a museum exactly. More like a really cool city.

  Voldemort's attempt at possessing Harry had a different outcome when Harry fought back with the "Power He Knows Not". This set a change in motion that shall affect both Wizards and Muggles. AU after fifth year: Featuring a darkish and manipulative Harry

** It WAS "Rise of the Wizards"!! I've reread the first few chapters a couple of times, but they're so different from the main story I didn't realize that was the one I've been trying to find. Thanks you bunches, [[/u/looking4abook]] and[[/u/kyella14]] for helping!

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
