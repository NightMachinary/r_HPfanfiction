:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Literally the only thing I remember was that Time-Turners were made from pieces of Atlantis, and that's why they were limited. I'm sorry I can't remember any more, but /any/ help would be appreciated

  Because as far as they were concerned, no one actually knew how to make a Time-Turner from scratch. The amount of Time-Turners in the world was limited because both the glass and the sand came from the same giant crystal quartz from Atlantis or whatever that was saturated with some sort of mystical "chronological magic".

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
