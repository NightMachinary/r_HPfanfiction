I had come across a few good fics in the Spider-Man and Naruto series where the MC was an SI into the body of Harry or another main character and I found that it's rather enjoyable to read when done well. Does anyone know of any like that for HP?


** I don't read other fanfiction, but it seems SI is a way less common in the HP-world than there. Usually, when asked about SI we point out to linkffn(13041698), which is really nice, but I cannot recall anything else ATM. Perhaps, kind of, linkffn(2053712), but that's a bit strange story, I am still not sure what to think about it.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  It is absolutely impossible for a muggle to find her way into Diagon Alley, visit Hogsmeade, see Hogwarts and play a pivital role in the magic world without having any magical abilities. This fanfic proves it all wrong. COMPLETED.

*** Second "What's her name in Hufflepuff"! It's a good read. It's weird how little SI exists for HP. I never finished this I remember really liking Rose Petal Red on AO3 from what I remember when I read it (not a harry SI). linkao3(11745900)

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]

  When someone dies, they lose their memory and are reborn as someone else. That's how it should be."Should" is the key word.No one wants to be reborn as Harry Potter. No one wants to keep their memories while being reborn as Harry Potter. I repeat: NO ONE WANTS TO BE HARRY- Oh forget it, I'm going into Slytherin.

  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Priority one, survive. Priority two, drag this world into the 21st century.
