:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok so I remember it being where Harry Potter and his kids Albus, James and Lily travel to an alternate dimension through a mirror in a shop Harry's parents are alive in the alternate dimension though he died as a baby and it was a crack fic I remember there being a particular part where Harry thought lily was sharpening her teeth and they were later kidnapped by that universes version of Voldemort

If anyone knows what fic this is plz let me know I haven't been able to find it for the life of me

  Scorpius really should have listened to his father's numerous and dire warnings about the Potter clan. Harry feels his pain. Gen crackfic WIP, yo. Seriously, so cracky.
