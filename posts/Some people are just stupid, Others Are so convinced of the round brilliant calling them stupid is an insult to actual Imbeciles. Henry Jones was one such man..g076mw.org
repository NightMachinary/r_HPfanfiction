A man so narcissistic and Convinced of his own brilliance. He expected the world to comply with his demands. He decided to orchestrate a power-play and bring Harry James Potter to his knees. By kidnapping little teddy Lupin, What Mr. Jones Forgot to take into account. Was that Teddy Was precious. Not just to have godfather but to every power player in magical Britain. And they didn't negotiate with terrorists, They disposed of them quickly ,quietly, and Indisputably. By abducting Teddy lupin , The imbecile Formerly Known as Henry Jones Had a target on his back the size of London.

His head on a pike outside of the ministers office was proof of that. Hannah Abbot noted As she waited for the beginning Meeting. She particularly liked the Plaque Andromeda Black Tonks had commissioned For the display. It's simply said, This imbecile went after Teddy, His Auntie and Uncles didn't take kindly to that.
