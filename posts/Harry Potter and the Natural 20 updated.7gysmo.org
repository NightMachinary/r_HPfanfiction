*** This is the last thing we need: authors begging for money to write fanfiction. That's the fastest way I can imagine for JK to demand that FFN, AO3, all the other big FF sites to pull all HP fics.

I'd be happy to pay a per-chapter subscription for original fiction, but not fanfiction.

***** What makes this different is that while most authors quietly pretend that fanfiction is not a thing, Madame Rowling did actually speak up and say she is fine with fanfiction for as long as no money is being made on it (there was a bit more, but that's the important part here).

That's what makes it different, because in this fandom getting money for it does not go against something that is forbidden implicitly but rather explicitly.

Personally I don't really care (not that I'm going to pay anyway, if it's required to read something then I'll just not read it), but it's generally good to know of things of this kind when you get into a not-so-legal area.

****** Patreon is a patron system, you're paying them to do w/e they want, much like Team Four Star doesn't (And hasn't, and in fact has cancelled/changed their schedule) to release the things people generally want to pay them for.

********* Which is missing the point again.

You asked a question. I gave you an answer to that question: it's different because Madame Rowling asked while at the same time giving something of an endorsement for fanfiction in general (and people are doing it out of respect because she asked). Then you tried to justify an opposite view by rules-lawyering in a way that no court would ever take from you, which implies that you do not respect her asking at all.

You are free to disagree with any point made. But in this specific case, by doing so in the way you are doing you have shown that you do not, on a fundamental level, have any understanding of the answer (rules-lawyering against people asking to please not do something generally is a sign that you do not respect them at all). Which means what you did does count as missing the point. I may have phrased the answer better, you could put that one on me, sure, but even if it were only about the legal side of it your attempt at rules-lawyering would ... not exactly be a positive thing.

********* Just because they haven't been sued yet doesn't mean that they won't be someday. Anime fandom is notorious for turning a blind eye on this sort of thing because of the nature of the fandom not because it's somehow legally okay.

And youtube has shut them down plenty of times for copyright infringement.

***** I'm guessing s/he is talking about the fact that FanFictions are based on another person's work and you shouldn't make money out of it. A Patreon to write HP FanFiction she kills le purpose of it. And JKR will definitely not let that slide. I know I wouldn't :) You want to make money, create your own stuff, don't make it on someone else's work.

*** Anecdotal, but I know of two other fanfic authors who've tried to set up Patreons and it hasn't gone well.

S'TarKan of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) did so and hasn't touched his fanfiction (to my knowledge) since then because he's been writing original fiction (I mean, that's not a bad thing overall, but rough for the people who wanted more ffn)

Brainthief of linkffn(0-800-Rent-A-Hero) started a Patreon to help support his writing of the fic and dropped off the map shortly afterwards.I thought I remembered someone saying he stopped writing entirely because FFN.net didn't want him soliciting money for fanfiction, but that could be totally wrong.

Again, those are just anecdotal cases though, so maybe it'd work out this time around.

Edit: Whoops, there's a thread on the front page right now talking about what happened with 0-800-Rent-A-Hero. Doesn't seem like it had anything to do with FFN.net, I guess the author just set up a Patreon and then stopped writing even after doing that. Sounds like burnout I guess.
