Like Bad Education by magicspacehole. Can be slash or gen. Gimme me humor ( i need it)!


** I find him rather funny in When Harry Meets Tom, on AO3. He has a rather spectacular breakdown at some point.

Edit: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317][here]] is the link (if it works). It's Tomarry but, even for people who aren't into it, I think it might be a nice surprise.

*** Yes! And I loved the scene where he's trying to figure out if they're siblings.

“Oh god, do I have a thing for my sister? Maybe we're just cousins. Yes, Wizards marry their cousins all the time.”

** Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary by The madness in me

Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

The relationship tag is “Tom Riddle/being petty” so that should tell you all you need to know.

#+begin_quote
  New legislation mandates all individuals campaigning for the post of Minister of Magic, must be a Pureblood of at least three (3) generations. Tom Riddle is a genius, and originally he was planning on just murdering his way into this, but now?Well.Tom Riddle was a very very petty man,and nobody discriminates against him.OrTom Riddle decides to fuck with the Ministry of Magic, becomes Lawful Evil, and somehow, accidentally, gets a literal goat in office.

** I really enjoyed A mentor's burden by Naidhe. Its a gen fic in which a young Tom becomes Dumbledore's biggest fan and follows him obsessively around lololol. Considering how the two hate each other in canon its such a hilarious and original premise hope u give it a try :))

SUMMARY: Young Tom Riddle watches Dumbledore set his wardrobe on fire and thinks it's the coolest thing ever. From that point on, Tom only wishes to become a man as great as his Professor. Dumbledore really, really doesn't know how to deal with the little psycho kid following him around.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List]] The Tom here is funny because of the voice in his head.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3542099/1/How-I-Learned-To-Stop-Worrying-And-Love-Lord-V]] This one has a Voldemort who is extremely afraid of nuclear bombs.

Both are unfinished.
