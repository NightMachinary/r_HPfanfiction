I'm looking for fics where harry is aware of his/her wealth and will exploit for her own gain or to do something stupid like buy a island for no reason. Just in general a fic where harry isnt afraid to abuse his/her money for fun. Slash is okay but if you can avoid any indepth sexual scenes. Any pairings are welcome. All in general it could be a crossover where harry is a smurf but he is wealthy as long as there is no one shots, I don't really mind. Thanks guys!


** linkffn(10364683) Harry uses his wealth to solve his problems. This fic is controversial because harry gets raped.

  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
