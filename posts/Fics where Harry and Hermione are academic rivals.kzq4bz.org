Most of the fics I've read with this scenario have showed some useless tropes like"I don't have to read too much,i'm a superwizard"Harry. The only one in which harry's struggles are shown is the cadmean victory.so some realism will go a long way. Thanks


** The main problem there would be the fact that most of stories with this kind of rivalry typically make it one-sided and treat it as a tool to bash Hermione and show how shallow and jealous she is

*** Yeah. Sadly. This is a caricature of sixth year, when Rowling does make Hermione a prat. I mean, calling someone learning from a book 'cheating'? Would it not have been cheating if he'd picked up pointers from the library instead of notes in margins?

It comes off as Hermione being upset Harry was doing better than her. Which is odd, as she didn't mind him being better than her in Defense.

Granted, yelling at him for testing spells he has no clue about is totally valid.

**** I think a lot of it is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality][protagonist-centred morality]]: anyone who criticises the protagonist on an ethical matter /must/ be in the wrong.

In a modern Western school or university, what Harry did would be considered cheating---specifically, plagiarism. Let's be generous to Harry and suppose that there was no restriction on the sources a student could use in the task. Then, Harry still used a source that was not a standard reference and failed to cite it, thus misrepresenting someone else's work as his own. Indeed, when he was publicly given credit by a teacher for inventing the improvement to the recipe, he failed to disclose that the work was not his, thus lying by omission.

Now, it's not unlikely that there are no rule against that in Hogwarts, but you can see how it's unethical, which Hermione called out. Indeed, Harry offers to share the HBP book at one point, and she refuses.

Also, the point about spells Harry has no clue about also applies to the potions. Harry is not qualified to assess whether Half-Blood Prince's instructions are safe and complete without actually attempting them. Snape could have easily omitted some step that would have been obvious to him but not to Harry, and then who knows what would have happened?

#+begin_quote
  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.

**** I think that trope arises because different attitudes towards vulnerability. I was number 1 in my high school class and a girl was number 2. She worked incredibly hard and she made sure everyone else knew it. I was taking extra classes online, staying up past midnight most nights finishing school work, reading ahead in the textbooks, the works. And I kept my mouth shut about it. There's more of a stigma about complaining about how rough a dude has it so we just never do it.

** I will never not recommend Victoria Potter to people looking for Smart!Protagonist fics: linkao3(13795605)

She gets an academic rivalry with Hermione in classes, including occasionally correcting each other's work and finding the other annoying for it.

Both are actual /characters/ - both Victoria and Hermione have their flaws, but neither is /bashed/ per se. They're just... Kids who tolerate each other's presence for the sake of getting the highest Potions grades. I also like that they both have to /work/ for it - they're smart kids, but they're still kids who need to actually learn stuff.

*** I don't think that fic is the best depiction of a meaningful rivalry though. It's very one-sided in Victoria's favor, and most of their interactions is just a way to show to the reader how much better Victoria is than Hermione. In almost every interaction, Victoria is the correct one, and Hermione is the only who has to learn from her "mistakes". The author even adds flaws to Hermione's character to make Victoria seem better:

1. *Homework:*

#+begin_quote
  Snape unfurled the scroll and held it in front of himself, his eyes skimming rapidly over the text. "I am not accustomed to having my instructions ignored, Miss Granger, and yet this is the third time you have exceeded the specified length. From now on, I shall be enforcing these requirements strictly."

  He then raised his wand and slid it across the parchment at a length of ten inches. Hermione gasped as the bottom half of the essay floated to the floor.

  "Told you so," Victoria whispered as Snape moved away.
#+end_quote

In canon, Hermione is never described as writing longer than required in any subject besides history, and I don't think Binns really cares. She's described as writing tiny to fit everything in, but she can hardly be punished for that.

#+begin_quote
  "Granger, you've basically copied the textbook out line by line," Victoria said, comparing the two side by side. Oh, Hermione's words were different, but the information was all the same, exactly as it was in the textbook.
#+end_quote

In canon, Hermione was literally shown to do extra research so she could explain certain topics more in depth on her homework. She also outlined her essays, which would suggest that she didn't formulate it in the same manner.

1. *Arrogance:*

#+begin_quote
  As the lesson drew to a close, Victoria was the only one who had managed a complete transfiguration. To her annoyance, however, Hermione Granger also came very close, making her matchstick grey and pointy and sending Victoria a smug look.
#+end_quote

Hermione wasn't very intentionally smug in canon, and was mostly just trying to help everybody even though her lack of social skills made it seem like the opposite. In this fic, Hermione is sending smug looks at Victoria for... what reason? This was the first day of class, so she never even interacted with Victoria, but she already dislikes her?

#+begin_quote
  "Finally here, are you?" Hermione said, moving some books to make room for Victoria. "Well, I've already done most of it. I suppose you'll want to copy me."
#+end_quote

Hermione doesn't even let Ron and Harry copy her until OotP.

#+begin_quote
  Victoria rolled her eyes. This was exactly why she'd been dreading working with Hermione: she had this irritating habit of assuming she was the only person who was interested in studying.
#+end_quote

This is the same girl who gave Harry a homework planner as a present, and put Ron and Harry on a rigorous study schedule so they could pass their exams?

1. *Intelligence:*

This doesn't even need to be said. In canon, Hermione is prized for her logical ability and intelligence. She breaks into Slytherin's common room, solves a 1000 year old mystery, figures out that Lupin is a werewolf, figures out that Rita Skeeter is a beetle animagus, manipulates Umbridge into banning the Quibbler so more people would read it, recognizes that Harry's vision is probably a trick, tricks Umbridge into getting kidnapped by the centaurs, and more. One would expect Victoria Potter's Hermione to have similar intelligence, but instead, she's possibly the dumbest character I've ever seen in a fanfic (exaggeration, but you get the point). She's unable to figure out simple riddles (it's pretty easy to deduce that Mars means getting angry), gets manipulated using extremely basic manipulation tactics, and can't deduce anything not contained in a book. She's not Hermione. She's a caricature of Hermione.

There are other examples of flaws that the author added to Hermione (her aggression, her extreme competitiveness, etc.), but those were the ones I thought off the top of my head. I get that the author wants to establish Victoria as a Dumbledore-level prodigy and wanted to use Hermione, who is generally regarded as an intelligent and talented character, as a measuring tool to show the readers how powerful and great Victoria is, but worsening Hermione's character wasn't the correct way to do so IMO.

**** And yet, even with all of that, it's /less/ bash-happy and more meaningful than 99.99999% of fics with similar situations.

Hermione's usually the one in the wrong /between the two/, but she's still consistently second-place in most classes, and occasionally when the two are /not forced to work together/, Hermione is shown to pick something up faster than Victoria does. They do spur each other on at times, rather than it /purely/ being about "Victoria's so much better than Hermione".

That alone means she's in a better position than most "Smart Harry" fics, hence my recommendation. It's not perfect, but it's the best I can find that's still a good story overall.
