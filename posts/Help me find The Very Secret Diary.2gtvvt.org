I'm looking for a fanfiction called The Very Secret Diary. It's by Arabella, who founded [[http://www.sugarquill.net/][The Sugar Quill]] and it's since been deleted. It's one of the best fanfictions I've ever read; it depicts how Ginny's relationship with her diary and Tom develops over her first year. The german version is still up in full [[https://translate.google.pl/translate?hl=pl&sl=de&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanfiktion.de%2Fs%2F46b394cf00002d99067007d0%2F2%2FThe-Very-Secret-Diary-by-Arabella&sandbox=1][here]], but a lot of the magic (no pun intended) gets lost in translation. If anyone has an English copy or link anywhere, I would greatly appreciate it.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10705988/1/A-Very-Secret-Diary-by-Arabella][Here]] it is! All credit goes to [[http://www.reddit.com/user/bohrmupfel][u/bohrmupfel]] for being an awesome super-detective!


** Hey ! I was the beta reader of that german translation and I do know -raven- so I wrote her an email if she still has her english documents of the work. I have changed my pc since then those days several times and I didn't worked with her from the beginning so I don't even have all the chapters.

If she answers me I'll let you know!

** It's a pity that it seems to be lost (hopefully temporarily). It was a brilliant story, like all of Arabella's stories that I've read--her [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=619&chapno=1][After the End]] was one of the first fanfiction stories I read in the fandom and I have fond memories of the experience.

** Well hello there I told you I'm gonna get back to you :)

So -raven- didn't reply to me so I tried the internet archive "Wayback machine" but it only stored the first two chapters so I searched for my really old laptop where I knew I had stored my emails and documents from -raven- since she always send me the english version as well.

Well I went through all the mails to save them up again and we are soooo lucky: -raven- send me in one mail with others chapters the whole documents of Arabellas fanfiction. PM me your mail and I'll send you the document.

*** Why not just throw it up on AO3 and note its original author? That is sort of what that site is designed for. This can't be the only person asking after this fic.

**** Hey! I don't know what AO3 is so at the moment I'm uploading it to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10705988/1/A-Very-Secret-Diary-by-Arabella][fanfiction.net]] instead and I'm halfway through.

EDIT: about notifying the original author: -raven- waited 2 years on an answer from the original author and since Arabella hasn't written anything on her page since 2008 or so I wouldn't have hope for that.

Edit2: Just checked out AO3. I guess I could upload it there too. The more people can read it the better.

***** AO3 encourages people to upload abandoned works, while still indicating who originally wrote it, which is the only reason I recommended it.

FFN technically doesn't allow people to upload other people's work, so it might just get reported and taken down. Glad to hear you're committed to keeping it alive and on the internet.

****** Oh I see. Yeah I wasn't so sure about FF.net but it is the only ff forum that I frequent.

Thanks for the idea :)

**** It is a pleasure. I remember reading it back then but didn't think I still had it. I'm uploading it at the moment both on fanfiction.net and archiveofourown.org/ so I hope it is found easily enough for those who read it years ago and new fans all alike.
