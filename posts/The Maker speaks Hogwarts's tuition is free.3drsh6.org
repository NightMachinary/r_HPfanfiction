** Well there is another reason purebloods don't like muggleborns! Because purebloods have paid the taxes that cover the muggleborns education. Not only do they come in without knowing the culture but the proper magicals foot the bill for their schooling.

I guess this sort of explains why we don't hear about any British competitors to Hogwarts. There is no need for a cheaper option.

Author revelations like this seem trite in the age of Twitter. Before the interwebs an author would have to write a new book to do something like this. Now they can Tweet from the toilet (I mean WC) and you've got some fresh canon.

** This will certainly be interesting. Makes Harry a bit wealthier when the series ended, disregarding whatever he may have been given or earned at that point, since he wasn't paying tuition. Also makes me wonder just /how/ little Arthur was making, for them to be that poor while only having to take care of multiple children three months of the year.

I'm looking forward to seeing how this gets implemented or taken into account. And it does explain why the ministry seemed to have the ability to appoint Umbridge. Maybe the Board is an intermediary between the ministry and the school. Ministry appoints or approves of the board, board oversees the school, ministry can go over the board's authority.

*** She said the tuition was free. She did not say the school supplies were free. Sending kids to school is not cheap. They would need trunks, wands, robes, quills, parchment etc. The cost would add up if you had to send seven kids to school. That's not including extras like pets and brooms.

**** I really don't think it would be as expensive as people make out. I know how expensive it was to put myself and my brothers through school- there were 5 kids in my family on one income low enough to keep us on free/reduced lunch, and I was the one going to the store with my mom for both groceries and school supplies.

Let's massively lowball and say that it was $400/mo to feed my family of seven people ($58/person/mo). That's $4800/yr /just/ on food. Increase that to 9 people and you have $6200/yr. For every child that they send to Hogwarts for nine months of the year it frees up $500 (or leaving home completely, $700). I can see them being extremely poor before Bill goes to Hogwarts, and that first year being difficult, but after that point they should be saving enough money from food alone to easily afford school supplies. After Bill's first year, they're saving at /least/ $500/year. And we found out in HBP that Hogwarts has a means of helping the poor or otherwise monetarily hindered afford supplies, which the Weasleys may have used those first few years.

Yeah it's expensive, I came up with an average of $200/year for 7 years, unevenly spread, per child for school expenses. Assuming every child got a broom and pet. Not including clothing that would be provided regardless of school status. But that's still less than the family would have been paying just to feed the kid the nine months they're gone. And that to me indicates that they shouldn't have been as poor as was implied in Chamber of Secrets, unless Arthur made a ridiculously low amount of money for being head of a department.

***** There's also the fact that uniforms add a significant cost. I went private and we had a number of students who were on scholarships. My first uniform kit (in 1995) cost my parents almost $1000. There was a second hand shop but they'd have your size if you were lucky. And then there's the bag, the sports uniform the winter uniform and so on. My friend who was scholarship had one item of each clothing. It was cheaper to wash them every night (and then only if needed. I remember her crying if she spilt something on her clothes) then to buy another brand new one. Every year we'd go to the shop when it opened every week until they got her size or the next two sizes up.

***** They have to buy *parchment* and stuff, though, and that shit is expensive. They aren't buying plastic pens and mass-produced paper, they're buying quills and ink and parchment. Then you need to get them cauldrons, which are expensive, and if they join Quidditch they'll need brooms... What if Molly and Arthur were saving money to pay for Ginny's wedding?

Children are pretty expensive, especially when there are 7 of them.

*** I dont think the Weasleys are POOR. Remember they helped throw Bill and Fluer's wedding. I would say that compared to the Malfoys, the Weasleys are poor. We only really hear rich people calling the Weasley's poor, and we only see into their vault the one time. For all we know that was just Arthur's account. I am certain that Charlie and Bill send money to their parents when needed, same with Percy after they make up.

**** Yeah, it's likely that they're only comparatively poor, instead of actually in poverty. It's still something I'm rather curious about, since they're described as being poor (though only by those with money) and getting things secondhand (Ron didn't even have his own wand or robes).

***** I agree, and I was surprised now that I think about it on how expensive Ollivander's is. 7 galleons for a wand. wow... If you think about the conversion rate, that is outrageous. The firebolt that Harry sees in his third year was 200 galleons. The wizarding world is outrageous. good lord.

******** Maybe wands are subsidized? Or maybe they are pretty cheap to make but the process is proprietary. At $50 a wand it does seem like a tough business model to make successful if wizards use the same wand for most of their life. I don't know, it feels like there is not enough information to determine anything definite.

** This is completely unsurprising; the only way Hogwarts having tuition would work is if there were also state schools for people to send their children to. Having your one and only school be private doesn't really make sense.

** I personally prefer the tuition idea with he public schools being the cost-free alternative for the majority.

I mean, just looking at the amount of students, one would think "That can't be all of them". There have to be more children out there, or else the whole wizard society of Britain would have about the size of a medium village.

Are there some official numbers? How many wizards and witches are the in HP's Britain?

*** She wasn't very good with any of the numbers, but there are meant to be anywhere between 1000 and 30000 wizards in Britain. It's difficult to tell because certain things suggest \ smaller population (e.g. the number of children at Hogwarts) but others suggest a larger population.

Rowling said once that she sees Hogwarts as a school with ~1000 students, which would imply a population somewhere in the range of 3000+. BUT we don't have any official figures really because lots of things are contradictory.

FWIW Hogwarts being free makes more sense than it being fee-paying, at least from my perspective. The majority of schools in the UK are free to attend, and the wizarding population is very small, and I think it's mandatory that children go to Hogwarts. It's a small population and every magical child has to attend.

*** I'm thinking they do but via the board of governors. Idk how things are done in the UK, but I know the US federal reserve has a board of governors, who are appointed by the President & Senate. So if it's similar, the board oversees the school, the ministry only steps in when they feel like getting their hands dirty, by going over the board. We know how Fudge was- content to sit by and assume or pretend everything was fine.

** I want to know something more concrete about the Ministry tax system. Who is taxes and why? Is it progressive or is there a flat tax? Hogwarts being free doesn't surprise me at all because er, she did set this in Britain after all and there's a very British feel to the whole thing and Hogwarts was literally the only wizard school.

That would be like having only fee-paying Welsh language schools in Wales.

** I'm sticking by my headcanon, well now headfanon, that Hogwarts is the equivalent of Eton which is why people in important jobs went there and why Purebloods resent the muggleborns who go even more as they've been on the list for years. It also explains why important peoples kids go to Hogwarts and why it's the 'premier school for magic.
