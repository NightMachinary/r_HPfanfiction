So the fic I'm looking for is one where Hermione is transported to an alternate universe where purebloods are servants called "house wizards" to corrupt Muggleborns and families like the Weasley's. Hermione replaces her alternate self who is arm candy to an evil Ron Weasley. Also, technology works at Hogwarts, I think.

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM

*** A Dramionist whose opinion I respect recommended it to me. I could sort of buy the premise, but what killed it for me is how /wholesome/ all the Slytherin kids were. I can see how Dumbledore's plan would have made Gryffindors and others worse people, but it wouldn't make Slytherins /better/ people.

**** Personally, I think it makes sense in context (the fic IS called Reverse) and the uniqueness of the story and quality writing style can make me ignore big aspects of canon.

BUT I can see how that'd ruin it for you. It kinda kills the purpose of the Slytherin house making them do-gooders haha
