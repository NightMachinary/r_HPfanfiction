I didn't know what to flair this, so apologies if it's incorrect.

I'm looking specifically for an android app for reading text to speech, so I can listen to fanfic at work.\\
Preferably something that has somewhat natural sounding voices, and the ability to read full pdf or ebook files so I don't have to copy and paste each chapter or anything like that.

Any ideas would be much appreciated, as a quick session of google-fu didn't turn up much that was useful. :)


** The official Fanfiction.net app does TTS, its not great but it works.

*** Mine loses my place and starts me over at the beginning of the story often enough that I've quit using it. üò•

** Most ePub readers (at least CoolReader and FBReader) do it. And of course, there is [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]]

** I use and like Moon+ Reader. I'm not sure how many customization options the free version has, but the paid version has tons. I also like that it (unlike the fanfiction.net app) starts reading wherever you are instead of at the beginning of chapters. I also like that it has named favorites as well as tags, which I use as a star-rating so I can remember what stories I liked and which I didn't.

** I use @voice and I really like it for the most part. It has some quirks, but it doesn't sound as robotic as a lot of TTS apps do. Also, you can choose from several accents, which is nice because then you can listen to your HP fics in a British accent if you like üòÅ
