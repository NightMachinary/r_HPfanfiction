I've been reading Hogwarts Hoses Divided, and just got to the part where !!!SPOILER!!! [[/spoiler][Harry and the Weasleys are sitting around the living room at Easter and talking about Teddy]] and I realized how much I want to read a fic where it's about them (Harry, Ron, Hermione, etc) that happens after Hogwarts. So, any ideas?

Edit: The spoiler tag isn't working for some reason, so I added "spoiler" in caps. Sorry about that.


** I haven't yet read the story you mentioned but probably you'll like this one. It includes a lot of talking about the imagined future lives, etc. Even in the kitchen iirc!

'These Cuts I Have' is a story that - as of now - focuses on the first summer after the fall of Tom Riddle. Harry and Ron start their training to become aurors while Hermione and Ginny prepare for their final school year. While these are the main projects all of them have to do their own coping with the stresses of the months before.

Probably the only FF I have ever recommended here but I'm just a big fan of Melindaleo's work.

*** I'm rereading my way through her work now, halfway through CotD. I'd recommend checking out linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dangerous Choice)

In the same vein as PoE and CotD but I think it's better written and the twists and solutions work better

  The war has been won, yet the aftershocks continue. The scattered survivors are left to pick up the pieces and find ways to move on. Join the various members of the extended Weasley family as they struggle to rebuild and cope with the consequences. And of course there are still Death Eaters left to find.
