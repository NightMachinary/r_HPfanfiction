Hey looking for again. This one is a HP/Doctor Who Crossover. It has Harry who is best friends with the Master's Daughter. While still Prime Minister The Master realizes his wife is pregnant and calls her his "Little Time Tot". She herself is a member of the Black Family. She leaves her daughter to live with Andromeda who raises her as "Something Saxon". She and Harry meet and she basically treats him like a minion. I remember her dying in History of Magic class and Harry totally freaks out and his magic tries to kill him. Saxon returns to life with two hearts and threatens everyone to know where Harry is. She finds him in St. Mungo's. Any help finding it is appreciated.
