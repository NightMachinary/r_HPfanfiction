He knew that they were being destroyed and I'm sure he had killed loads more people prior. He could have just made more. Right?


** Voldemort had only a few hours time between his discovery of Trio's intent and the Battle of Hogwarts. He didn't have time to make another horcrux, as his primary goal was to destroy Potter and his sympathizers.

*** If it really only takes cold blooded murder (as in: Fire an AK and use that as the catalyst to fracture your soul and pull a piece out, then that's just Voldermort being overly confident/arrogant: He himself didn't actively hunt Harry, he had his muscle, his goons, do that!) then I'd suggest he grab himself somebody (doesn't matter if it's a muggle, after all Voldemort's father (and family) worked fine for the diary!), go somewhere, do the deed and go back home -.- (hell, if he's really that pressed for time? Forgo sleep (pepper-up-potion keeps you awake during the day even if you hate coffee etc.) and use that time!)

ps: Fanfictions often say that he just couldn't split it anymore (it was/is already unstable otherwise Harry wouldn't have been a 'crux!) that would make a lot more sense!

***** Not only that, but Rowling's said that there is a disgusting and nauseating "ritual" involved, one that does not involve necrophilia or any sort of vampirism [as Myrtle was Tom's first Horcrux victim, and her body was untouched]. With Myrtle's death, given that in the book, Myrtle said she "stayed with her body for hours", a Horcrux may only be able to be made /after/ the murder in question.

***** Maybe...or maybe it's just a very evil act but takes only minutes (I mean killing somebody - via guns, explosives or, in Harry Potter, with the killing curse or a cutting curse etc. - doesn't take long and is quite evil if done in cold blood and/or because it pleases you (and you have not good reason))

THings went great for him in the time he had 7, when you think about it.

** There are a few different theories on why he didn't, my personal favorite is how much soul he had left. Assuming he started with 100% of a soul and each horcrux splits his soul in half, the first horcrux he made has 50% of it. the second 25% of it. the third 12.5% of it. the fourth 6.25% of it. the fifth 3.125% of it. the 6th has 1.5625 and his original body has the same amount as the last horcrux made. Any more horcruxes made would have severely diminishing returns in addition to breaking the power of using a magical number for his horcrux amounts. Especially once you start factoring in the fact that bits of his soul are being destroyed by the time he knows what is going on with his horcruxes he has less than 25% of his soul total remaining in the world.

*** I think it was something along these lines. Plus, horcruxes were such a rare and dark magic, I always assumed the magic to make one was complex and difficult. He couldn't just go out, find someone to murder, and make one like it's a potion or something.

***** Great point, Harry was an accidental horcrux. But was Voldemort intending to make a Horcrux that night? Maybe the difficult part was done, the intent was there, and the Horcrux thing happening was made easier because that's what Voldemort intended to happen (making a Horcrux, not specifically making Harry become one)... Although that begs the question of how Voldemort never figured out that Harry was a Horcrux.

****** This is my thought process. Dumbledore thought Voldemort was a Horcrux down when he went to kill Harry that night. For someone bent on world domination and being the best, killing the infant destined to be able to defeat you and gaining ultimate immortality all in one swoop seems pretty damn sweet. I would be surprised if he didn't go into that night intending to make a Horcrux.

As far as Voldemort never figuring out Harry was a Horcrux, Voldemort lost a lot of his critical thinking ability as time went on. Whether it was the Horcruxes, the spending a decade alone as a wraith, or just his sanity naturally erroding, he wasn't Tom Riddle by the time the books began.

Also, if you discount all the other reasons, that alone might be why he didn't run and make a new horcrux. He was insane and couldn't logically get past 'that little bastard destroyed my horcruxes, KILL HIM NOW'.

***** On the other hand, though, it is possible that the scar didn't truly become a horcrux but rather just something similar to it until the ritual at the end of the 4th year happened. We only know that the scar contained a fair bit of Tom's magic, and possibly also a part of his soul that was isolated from the whole thing by what Lily did, and it is a possibility that without the resurrection ritual happening it wouldn't have worked as a horcrux.

**** It's just the logical assumption. We know souls have a great deal of importance to wizards and that the damaging of one can be hugely bad. The Dementor's Kiss does nothing physical, but leaves the victim a shell. It's not odd to further that to the assumption that removing too much of the soul will have similar effects. It's entirely possible that making any more would have been unsafe and unstable, there's a reason he picked that number in the first place.

But if it was just that he could pump them out willy-nilly it would almost always be OP as heck and literally impossible to kill him. Think about all the items he could just make a horcrux.

** I read one fic in which Voldemort had made several hundred horcruxes -- one every time he murdered someone when nobody was around to observe. The flaw in that plan, as he later discovered, was that a horcrux had to possess a person to bring him back to life, and it would only bring him back with the personality and memories he had at the time he created it. And most of his horcruxes were pebbles and other unconsidered trifles.

** My take on this is that Voldemort saw the inherent flaw in his previous plans. He made them out of precious items hidden away in inaccessible vaults or remote caches, but when it came to using them, he kept getting drawn back to Albania- probably because that was the place that his last-made horcrux was stored.

To work around that he made a horcrux out of Nagini. This made the most-recent full horcrux an invulnerable mobile platform. Should Potter or some other enemy succeed in destroying his body once more, he'd be back in the game in a very short time.

**** Then why did he keep going back there when he was disembodied? If he could have gone anywhere, it would make more sense for him to appear to one of his followers. Instead he hangs out in Albania, first until found by Quirrel, then again when Wormtail retrieves him and sets him up in a temporary body.

My conclusion- he was returning to the last-made full horcrux, left in Albania where he had found the Diadem.
