Generally self-insert and OC focused fanfics are considered pretty bad, so what sort of elements do you think are necessary to stop that? Have you ever read a good self-insert? What made it for you? If not, what do you think it would need for you to enjoy it?

I'll admit I don't read many, but I think it's essential the plot go one of two ways: either away from the main plot of Harry Potter completely or to do the opposite and change it fundamentally. I hate the stories where you just add a character to tag along on all adventures and yet everything remains exactly the same. Harry Potter is pretty heavily based on coincidence, it's impossible to add another character who spends all their time around the main cast without changing anything. It's why I think you should either stay away from the main plot or go all in.


** I love good self-inserts that completely derail the plot (mainly Game of Thrones ones involving Industrialisation), so bear that in mind.

In my opinion, a good self-insert fic does not need suspense. You have future knowledge and your main goal is to steamroll the world you were dropped into as fast as possible (note that this does not mean taking over, merely achieving your goals). Your objective is to trash canon. All of those hours on reddit you spent arguing that X should have been done? Now it is time to put your money where your mouth is. Let's say your SI makes an appearance in the 7th book.

You could cook up a mad scheme to gain Harry's trust and join a hunt while foiling the obligatory love potion plot... or you could start doing things on your own. Loot the RoR, buy weapons on the Eastern European black market, hire a few mercenaries and go Death Eater hunting. Or simply walk up to Privet Drive and tell Harry everything you know, including stuff you can only know as a dimensional traveller (maybe playing it up as time travel is more believable). Then do the Horcrux hunt in a week and snipe Riddle from 500 yards after you cut out Harry's scar with a simple scalpel.

The SI is the ultimate fix-it story. It doesn't need teenage drama or angst. Your objective is to make things "right", not to preserve canon. For example, I'd definitely put a permanent end to ALL Death Eaters. They are Nazis without the somewhat understandable motivation that led to the rise of the NSDAP. There was no Versailles treaty fucking over Britain. They are the rich elite, not the people barely making it to the next month.

On the subject of shipping. Writing an SI/important character pairing seems like a cheap way of shipping yourself with said character. Perhaps Demelza Robins would be a better choice for you than Hermione Granger/Ginny Weasley/Harry Potter because the average reader will doubt that you are really the person whom any of those would fall for. The same goes for advocating ships. Either be completely open about why something will not work ("Tonks, Lupin will abandon you, better stay away from him, here's a bunch of inside knowledge to prove that I indeed have insider knowledge") or go with the more subtle approach ("Harry, who was the one girl always by your side"). Avoid ordering the characters around ("Harry, I really think you ought to bang Katie Bell because, look at that ass!") and generally only intervene where you think it is really necesarry. People should live their own lifes, only stop them from doing grave mistakes (like marrying Remus Lupin or chosing Divination).

*** Yeah SI's are mostly wish fulfillment stories and should mostly stay like that, they are fine the way they are. Adding artificial limiters or new opponents just for the drama just makes everything incredibly awkward.

**** Yeah, it is about watching it all come together. Bad guys came up with a convoluted scheme to defeat the MC? Too bad they didn't expect firearms. Pettigrew waiting at the graveyard? Suprise motherfucker, always check your back. Voldemort going to the Bones Manor? It would be a shame if someone buried thousands of S-mines there.

*** If you want a pairing, then I agree that you should probably not go with one of the more involved people (trio, close friends)...but someone like Fleur Delacour? (Note: Yes, I have had a crush on her when I was younger (book-version, not movie-version!) and I wouldn't throw her out of bed today either!) Or Nymphadora Tonks? (Who should change her name if she hates her given name that much) Yeah, those would work perfectly IMHO!

The question is: Do you give your SI magic? If so: Does the knowledge from the books actually help? So can you perform the magic or do you have to really buckle down and learn?

As for the other stuff, you can work that out how you want it! Step in when canon characters do something dumb or really break canon - or go after your own goals and ignore canon (who's to say you should step in, I mean you know that Harry survives, so why change canon? You can't say you truly know the canon characters because Harry is a flawed window into that world! Not to mention that anything you do might actually make it worse (note: I would probably still try to "break" canon, but I am playing devil's advocate here, because not everybody is super pro-active and all that, especially when they can avoid dying horribly because of future knowledge and possibly make it worse by tampering!), for example if you disrupt Harry's trust in Dumbledore ("Harry, that old geezer ruined your life, start thinking for yourself! Start living!" - Zonk! No more self-sacrifice because Harry is no longer willing to die!)...but it's your story, so maybe there is no self-sacrifice needed in your version (no 'cruxes for example!)

**** I'm a firm supporter of the "the scar is the Horcrux" theory, and that while dark magic is immune to healing magic, simply cutting it out should do the trick. And that the prophecy is wonky and not literally. Harry may need to have a hand in Voldemort's death, but he does not necessarily has to do it himself (especially if the power is love).

As for Fleur and Tonks, you landing one of the two hottest birds is almost as implausible as landing the main characters. As fun as metamorphic/polyjuice schenenigans would be, unless your SI looks like young Arnold Schwarzenegger, getting there requires more suspension of disbelief than magic.

** I've read a few good ones. I've been writing one myself lately after binge reading well... pretty much everything that has ever been recommended here. lol I should probably make a mega post about all of them.

I think the most important thing is that the author has the ability to be honest with their self reflection. If they know there own faults and are wiling to make fun of themselves a bit the story gets a lot better. The author has to be willing to not look cool and make mistakes. Just because your a witch/wizard now doesn't mean you're any more competent then you are right now at life.

Also, they have to be willing to throw monkey wrenches in the plot. Yes, you would want to be in Gryffindor and Harry and co's friends. But maybe they don't want to be your friend. Maybe you don't end up in Gryffindor at all. Maybe your best friend ends up being Stephen Cornfort or Eloise Midgen instead.

Personally, I wish so many of self insert fanfics didn't start with the character being reborn as a baby. It seems like half the fic then ends up being how frustrating it is for the author to be a baby. I've read so many iterations of it at this point that I just skip those parts.

*** Plus they always complain about going through puberty again, 100% of SI's complain about that at some point! I don't get the hate towards SI's when there seems to be tons of way more strange things on the fandom, like harry/lily or harry/voldie

** I avoid them as much as possible honestly. I think you're right; the character would need to be important to the plot but also I think the worst thing I see is when the character ends up romantically with another character. I mean there is a difference between self-inserts and OCs as well, and I think OCs are slightly better than self-inserts because at least they're less.. obvious? If that makes sense?

I also agree with you that they should be separate from the plot or completely all in. If they're all in, I think they should more be born from necessity. Like, someone ought to come up with their plot and then if they need a character to service the storyline, put them in, but I don't like when you can tell a character was just invented for the sake of being important.

And of course they need to follow all the basic rules of how not to write a Mary Sue/Gary Stu...

** I like SI's that worry about themselves and how much they can enjoy being in a world with magic. I really dislike them when they are just an excuse for the author so he can write about a bunch of OC's. Like, the SI has to buy something but before that happens you have to read how the entire life of the shop owner went before he mets the SI never to be mentioned again.

As other have said, change the plot or not at all. There's nothing worse than a story where the SI changes important stuff yet canon stays the same then blame it on fate or something equally stupid.

I also hate when SI's act childish and blame it on being ''in a younger body'', ''hormones'', ''puberty'' or whatever.

I don't mind if they pair up with anyone as long as there's no implicit sex, that's just creepy to me.

Also, no fangirling or the male equivalent over anyone.

Also, NO TAUNTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT! That's just stupid.

Also, no mental rants! If there's one thing that I hate in fanfiction are mental speeches. The MC gets asked a question then there's at least a couple of long paragraphs of ''thoughts'' with no time wasted irl. I've seen the worse of this on pokemon fanfics, the MC gives long and detailed comands on what's supposed to be a couple of seconds.

** I've read more than 10 million words of HP fanfic and I can say with some confidence that 90% of SIs are terrible. If you consider Daphne Greengrass and Susan Bones to be OCs, there are good fics involving them out there. These good Greengrass and Bones fics tend to follow canon in the first few chapters before diverging. And often, the relationship between the Golden Trio becomes disrupted - e.g. Ron bashing in the Legacy Preservation Act and then the OC comes in to fill in the gaps.

** -Step 1: write a story.

-Step 2: don't make the OC or SI the crucial character to the plot if it covers similar story as canon.

-Step 3: if you ignored step 2 then 93% chance you're going to insist on making them this Gary Stu/Mary Sue who can do all the amazing things and bang every woman they want because this isn't wish fulfillment, obviously.

** I think there are three main components of good SI story:

- ability to write something original instead of another canon rehash, or fix fic or what have you

- enough selfawareness to notice your own faults and show their consequences. Too many SI are god gift to wizardkind instead of flawed uman being.

- willingness to put in time to research what you are writing about. Unfortunately most authors who write about money making have no clue about economics, authors who love to write about nobility and Lords know nothin about how thing worked in real world and so on.

As a small consolation for all who has made it so far into my wall of text, there is great SI fic linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith]]). If you have any fic which pass all three conditions I have mentioned above don't hesitate to drop a link.
