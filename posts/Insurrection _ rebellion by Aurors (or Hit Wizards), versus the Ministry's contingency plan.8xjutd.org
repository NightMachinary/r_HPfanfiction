Maybe it's an insurrection by pureblood supremacists, with a recently installed Scrimgoer/Shacklebolt managing to escape and rally the public against the coup d'Ã©tat, or maybe Amelia Bones with Political!Harry try to have Fudge arrested and he activates an emergency device to get out of there and stymie their plan.

In any case, does anyone know any fics where the Aurors or Hit Wizards or other magical law enforcement rebel, whether pureblood supremacists or trying to impeach a corrupt minister, and the Minister for Magic plus allies put up a tough fight?


** I think I read something like this before - harry starts off as a shadow wolf and eventually gets partnered with Tonks as an auror before eventually fudge goes tyrannical and bones launches a coup against him resulting in a full fight in the halls of the ministry during what is technically Harry's fifth year. Probably not what you meant but look it up? It's called wolf by damonblade. Linkffn:4807588 I think that's how the link is supposed to work?

*** linkffn(4807588)

It's linkffn with no capital letters, and the fic number in brackets rather than after a colon. There's a bot guide on the right if you scroll down a bit (under the section about rules), but I don't think it's visible on mobile.

  Having vanished from his home life at a young age Harry Potter has been declared dead. On a field assignment for her training Tonks finds a unusual partner and friend while in the field and maybe a even someone more. Honks fic with maybe a few other pairings in the background but mainly Harry and Tonks. Enjoy and leave Reviews.

** ...Sigh...so nobody's written this? At all?

Fine, I guess I'll have to do it myself. Later. Maybe. When I stop procrastinating on every single other thing.
