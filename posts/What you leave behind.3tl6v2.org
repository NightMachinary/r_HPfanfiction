I was wondering if this fanfic was completed. I've read the first 11 chapters and it just stops so I was wondering if anything new has come out about it. Thanks in advance!


** I'm, uh, working on it. ^{_^}

I think at this point the limiting factor is time? RL has definitely kicked up since the summer.

Laziness could also be a contributing factor <_<

I am currently working on a new chapter, though! Like, there are actual New Words. I'm not saying it'll be out by X Date or whatever, because that's just a recipe for disaster.

At the very least, you can assume I'm still working on it; I have a rather huge notes file with all the plot / character stuff for all 7 years that I'd post if I ever decided I was just done with writing it.

The auther is still alive (he posted another fanfic is posts frequently on DLP so all you can do is waitin until he finds the time/joy/whater he dosent have to continue. Atleast I wait impaintely with you as I find this story amazing.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
