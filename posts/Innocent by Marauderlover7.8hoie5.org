I just started this story, im not normally a fan of WBWL stories so can someone explain what the Other Boy Who Lived thing is about? Im not worried about spoilers

Thank you


** It's been a while since I reread the beginning of the series but I think the characters are referring to Draco's brother who almost died in childbirth but lived, so people refer to him as "the boy who lived". The moniker (when referring to Hydrus) doesn't get mentioned beyond that first chapter, if I recall correctly.

Edit: because I didn't make it clear... Innocent is NOT a WBWL story.

Edit: Oh shit, that's actually a constellation. You're really reaching the bottom of the barrel with that one as parents: "Come, water boy"

**** Huh I never really gave the name much thought. From [[http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/hydrus-constellation][this site]] :

#+begin_quote
  Hydrus is also known as ‚Äúthe lesser water snake‚Äù
#+end_quote

I wonder if the author chose the name based on that meaning, implying Hydrus is the lesser snake (in a cunning Slytherin personality-wise way) to Draco?

***** Almost certainly, just IMHO trying a bit too hard... trying to be too clever you know? Not that great if a name makes me laugh out loud before checking Wikipedia. But okay, Harry Potter has a tradition of silly names...

****** I think at first glance it at least sounds less silly than Draco!

******* Hrm, Draco sounds kinda cool to be honest. It's just Draco who makes it seem ridiculous/pathetic.

** As orangedarkchocolate pointed out it's not a WBWL story, but I find that whole part of that story annoying. It just bugs me.

I would recommend the series for everything else in it, which is pretty good.

Incredibly railroaded canon rehashing and the author forgetting her own plot devices?
