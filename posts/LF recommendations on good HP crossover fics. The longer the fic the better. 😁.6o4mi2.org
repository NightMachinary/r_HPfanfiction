** linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is a fun-to-read crossover with Firefly. It excels in worldbuilding and merging the two universes. At times I wondered if the universes were made with each other in mind.

It also has a plot that is both post-HP and post-Serenity, so you will definitly find 100% new content, and not just a rehash.

The characters are well-written and captured, albeit a bit flat at times - especilly the ones from Firefly. That's not to say they are extremely flat, just not on the level displayed in the show.

The humor is the usual nonjon-style, but not as refined and well-timed as in his later works.\\
Still, as far as humor in fanfiction goes it's still nonjon and still more fun than 99% of the other stories on FFN attempting humor.

You do not need to have knowledge about Firefly, all relevant details are explained in the fic.

It's 200k+ words, so it fits your requitements. I can recommend the fic.

** linkffn(7591040) Its a HP/Dragons Of Pern crossover, and is pretty good. I started reading it 2 days ago, and im almost done with it. It starts at the first trial of the triwizard tournament, where harry is tired of life and is about to give up. But, he awakens the memories of the past, and dragons become a sentient species. It diverges from cannon within the first chapter. i think its well written, and a pretty interesting story. There are three different stories that form a trilogy for this. But, thats all that will ever be, as the author has lung cancer, and most likely will not be updated. The first two stories are done though.

*** How much Dragons of Pern knowledge is required? Because while I've heard good things about that series, I've never read it myself.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) (a crossover with /Dungeons and Dragons/) is fun, clever creative, and you don't really need to know much of anything about /DnD/ to enjoy it --- it makes a great job of explaining it. I also enjoyed /Star Wars/ crossover linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon) greatly, although it's more flawed.
