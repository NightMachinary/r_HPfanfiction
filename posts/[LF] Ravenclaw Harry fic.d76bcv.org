Just a smart Harry so he gets sorted into Ravenclaw

Atleast 100k words and no slash with MC


** linkffn(Wit of the Raven) is by far the best I know, although it's sadly abandoned.

Unfortunately the typical Ravenclaw fic goes along the lines of "Harry read ten books in the library and learned dueling, then he read twenty more and learned Occlumency because he was so smart", except in more words.

** [[http://www.hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] is the ultimate Ravenclaw Harry fic. Rowena Ravenclaw herself would tell him he needs to stop studying and get out more often.
