I need to say something about this because it bugs me to no end when I see it in fics, they couldn't care less, meaning that they don't care, there is no way that they could possibly care any less than they do now, by saying they could care less insinuates that the do care at least somewhat as there is the capability of caring less.

I understand that this is also how it is said in a lot of places in the real world and it bugs me there too.

Thank you for listening to my rant/red talk

** To be fair, it can be valid (if irksome) to use malapropisms in dialogue, to indicate that they're the character's mistake and not the author's. (Well, I guess it depends: never have a character say "should of", even if they'd get it wrong in writing, since what they're /uttering/ is still "should've".)

** I find it funny in sarcastic way, like "It would be possible for me to care less than I do, but I really don't care very much". But I'm kind of into the trope of "character who speaks with way more detail/honesty than anyone cares about" so that's probably why. It reminds me of the figurative/literally thing, in Archer they made fun of it by switching to "figuratively" where people normally use "literally" in hyperbole ("I'm literally going to kill him" changed to "I'm figuratively going to kill him"). I see it as similar to "couldn't care less" because that phrase is probably also being used as a hyperbole, like they probably potentially could care less if they thought about it.

** Because it's used frequently in real life, it's perfectly acceptable for characters to use in dialogue.

I've seen reviewers correct grammar mistakes in dialogue before and it weirded me out. People make mistakes while talking, it's natural. Narration is a different matter.

*** I'd note that it's used frequently in real life in the US - it's a common Americanism, but one that usually majorly irks British people because /it doesn't make sense/. Importantly, though, it's an American phrase - unless it's an American character, I would not say it's acceptable for most Harry Potter characters to use in dialogue. A story following on from Fantastic Beasts - no problem. Something about Harry, in the UK in the 90s? Less okay.

**** Randall Munroe has the unfortunate tendency to do that. Every time someone goes on a long-winded spiel, we're supposed to sympathize with that character.

I think it adequately got the point across - I couldn't care less if someone says "I could care less".

** This. That, and people who say something happens "on accident".

No.

That's not how that works. "On" is an indication of place or location and makes as much sense in this phrase as using "at" (that is, none at all).

The word to use is "by", which is an indicator of how the thing happened (in this case, because it can also mean "near", because English is a glorious fucking mess).

"On accident" makes me irrationally angry.

*** This is a more obscure one for many writers tbh. On accident is a variant that's perfectly acceptable in spoken English, so a kid or teenager saying that in dialogue isn't really that unusual and it does mean the same thing. Unfortunately, it's regional to America and Canada so it's a Britpicking fail.

(It likely came about as the opposite of "on purpose".)

**** Ha! To be honest it bugs me just as much when I hear it in person. But then again, I'm very much a grammar snob, which is entirely on me, but I do try to avoid being a dick and correcting people, because even if it's 'bad grammar', it's still perfectly understandable. Doesn't stop it being a pet peeve.

I hadn't considered the correlation with "on purpose", that's an excellent point! At least no one says "by purpose", my head might explode.

***** I find "on accident" strange - it /sounds/ correct in some pretty odd sentances where using "by" doesn't really work. Like... "That was on accident (on purpose)." Substituting the more correct "by" would make it incorrect because it should be "an accident" or "accidental" instead.

You're absolutely correct that it's wrong every single time in writing no matter what. But spoken? It's fine. And that unfortunately translates into written form.

My pet peeve is punctuation around dialogue, tbh: that's my irrational anger lol. And it's /distracting!/
