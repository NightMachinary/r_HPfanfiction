I've avoided Hp fanfics for a while so I could have new ones to read and I am still confused with all the hate on the Weasleys.

Ron is treated as a either a Jealous idiot who will try to steal from Harry or as someone who will actively help in ridiculous plots to kill him. Why is a teenage boy who likes to sleep and eat such an abomination, That describes most teenagers.

Molly Weasley is apparently an unknown potions mistress who has been planning to marry her daughter and Harry since the first war. She is also a screeching banshee who tries to control every aspect of her children's lives. She is a mother who lost family in a war and doesn't want her underage children participating as she should. Mothers nag it's not a unique thing to her.

Ginny is a deluded borderline lunatic who steals harry's boxers and watches him in the shower. Granted the films didn't do a good job of portraying Ginny but the books did a decent job of it.


** I don't believe in character bashing (strikes me as lazy writing), but the one thing no one seems to have commented on so far and it's my main gripe with Molly - the way she treated Hermione in GoF when Rita was saying Hermione was snogging everyone. That was cruel.

***** I love Fleur. At first glance she's this veela enchantress and everyone assumes she's shallow and vain. Then we get to know her and she's a brilliant loyal badass. And we realize that it's not a change in Fleur, it's a striping away of our preconceived notions about “pretty girls”. Our initial dislike is on us, not on her. And that's pretty fucking powerful.

Trump derangement syndrome (TDS) is a pejorative term for criticism or negative reactions to United States President Donald Trump that are perceived to be irrational, and have little regard towards Trump's actual policy positions, or actions undertaken by his administration. The term has mainly been used by Trump supporters to discredit criticism of his actions, as a way of reframing the discussion by suggesting that his opponents are incapable of accurately perceiving the world. Journalists have used the term to call for restraint when judging Trump's statements and actions.

Not to mention Bill and the wedding (forcibly cutting someone's hair), Fleur, and other stuff. But none of that necessary means she is a love potion mixing (although she did casually mention having done that, so the notion doesn't come out of nowhere), cackling witch with no redeeming features. I think it's the same sort of writers that'll make Dumbledore needlessly manipulative (yeah, he's manipulative. He is not, however, the type to manipulate for the sake of it, and similarly won't bother manipulating anyone who isn't in some way involved in the war), and Vernon a sexual abusive drunk who after his sexual abuse whips Harry. Those writers, I think, HATE feeling controlled and manipulated (understandably) and don't see how anyone with even /the slightest tendency/ can have any redeeming features, context or intentions be damned.

Its rather simple IMO. The trickster archetype is a well stablished one. A character doesnt need to be mean or evil to enjoy playing tricks. Furthermore the twins are generally played for laughs, so people use them as comedic devices.

Thats the thing with all of these fanfiction stories being mentioned. People like writing well know tropes. For Hermione that is the genius, for Ron the Jealous man, for Ginny the love struck fool. It goes on and on.

Those acid pops are sweets that 13 year olds can buy and clearly don't cause lasting harm, they're not something most people would even think of as dangerous.

The toffees were just a harmless practical joke that they've clearly been using for a while, and there's very few targets more acceptable than Dudley, the boy who considers bullying Harry his favourite hobby and single handedly ensured he didn't have a single friend until he went to Hogwarts.

They'd tested the snackboxes on themselves already and those first years were getting paid, it's not like they were tricking them.

** A lot of people have made really good points, so I won't rehash them.

Another reason that they're 'bashed' IMO is that a lot of stories want to start mid-way through canon and put Harry with different friends and love interests.

The easiest way to break up the Ron/Hermione/Harry friendship is to show how bad of a friend Ron is and how much better Harry (and most times, Hermione) would be with a different group of friends.

It's much more challenging to write character growth and a slow process of realizing that you've grown apart from your best friend. Better to blame the harridan Molly and evil Dumbles

** Here's the thing, it is VERY easy to take One act from Canon and magnify it to get a story where you want it to go. Molly, Ron, and Ginny just happen to be easy targets. There are so many acts to choose from. This goes the other way too(Albus, Snape, Riddle), but this thread is about the Weasleys so...

Ron acts like a jealous asshat for a while during GoF, so just make him that way from the beginning. The Movies also did his character dirty. Molly mentions using a Love potion at one Point, so just make her capable of brewing them flawlessly for years. Ginny still has a crush on Harry before she starts Hogwarts, so making her obsessive about it is easy.

Bashing the Twins is harder to do because they don't do anything that can be easily exploited. They don't prank Ron, Harry, or Hermione while they still have the Marauder's map. There was that bit with the candy they gave Dudley, but no one ever seems to remember that. We also don't see enough of Bill and Charlie to bash them Properly. Percy just kept his mouth shut and distanced himself as much as he could, sure mocking him for choosing the ministry over his family can be fun, but I haven't seen a fic that ever goes deep into it.

Let's not forget how they hissed at first-year students, how they were relentless with Percy (the teasing crossed the line to bullying when it occurs that often), and how they roped first years into testing their products. (Things could have turn really ugly there).

I don't understand the hate on Molly but I do understand where some of those ideas may have come from.

**** That's my problem. The thing about Ron is that, aside from being a pureblood and Harry's friend who's jealous about things, he doesn't have his own thing that makes him stand out. He was the Quidditch guy for about thirty seconds until Harry became a wizard on a broom (forgive me for the pun). He needed his own special thing - like in SS, when he was a chess player of some skill. I think that it would have been perfect if JKR had gone all-in on making Ron a Seer who (like Trelawney) sucks at attempting to make predictions but hits Homer's when she's not trying. (JKR said to listen to what Ron says, particularly in jest or when angry. He's got a respectable record on calling things, when you watch him from that angle.) That being said - I think the problem from his behavior in GoF could have been put in the past IF he had ACTUALLY apologized and had to pay even a slight penance for his behavior... even if that was him finally admitting that he was in fact jealous of the things Harry had, that he knows that it's not Harry's fault and that yes, he (Ron) needs to let go grow up a bit and act like a real friend. If you look at Ron, when he does something mean to either Harry or Hermione, he never really has to apologize or gets off lightly - so if just once, he had to say aloud to either of them 'I'm sorry for being a dick' AND MEANT IT... it would have killed off a lot of the Ron-bashing and been a turning point for his character in the films.

Also - how about really setting him apart from the others from the start? Harry's the BWL, Hermione's the brains of the outfit... why don't we go into another direction completely with Ron and give him something that the other two don't have, may not even want right away and gives him a perspective that allows him to speak with as authority and confidence on the subject (as well as developing a sense of self-confidence VERY early on)? How about... we put him into a relationship? It could be that adorable sort of cutesy thing where they 'like-like' one another and do the kid-like things that very young - and as they mature, they go through all the bumps but gain the experience, which allows Ron to warn his friends about things and give them advice. That partner for Ron is also an important character who can become a sounding board for Harry and Hermione.

For the TL:DR crowd - have Ron sincerely apologize for bad behavior to his friends, give him his own special skillset that stands apart from what Harry & Hermione can do - and perhaps we make him the only one who has an actual romantic relationship from the start (which allows us to see the Golden Trio from another POV). That's one way as to how we can stop the Ron-bashing.

-But Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring at Harry as though he were a ghost.

"Harry," he said, very seriously, "whoever put your name in that goblet - I - I reckon they're trying to do you in!"

It was as though the last few weeks had never happened - as though Harry were meeting Ron for the first time, right after he'd been made champion.

"Caught on, have you?" said Harry coldly. "Took you long enough. "

Hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other. Ron opened his mouth uncertainly. Harry knew Ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didn't need to hear it.

"It's okay," he said before Ron could get the words out. "Forget it. "

****** You're proving my point for me. It's not enough to try to apologize, even if Harry said it wasn't necessary. After what Ron did and why, and after essentially leaving his 'best friend' out there with no one else but Hermione for support for after almost a month of being treated like a leper and then ONLY coming back AFTER Harry aced the First Task without any help from him...

You also prove it because Ron KNEW what the first task was. THAT would have been the perfect time to come back and then not really apologize openly - because bringing that information that would help Harry to, you know, not die horribly at the jaws of a dragon, would show that he was truly sorry about his behavior. Showing up after and expecting for things to be the same as normal...

Here's the thing. Harry may or may not have needed to hear an apology from Ron - but for everything that Ron did, he needed to give him one. It's a matter of demonstrating respect for your 'friend' after betraying him like that over something that you know (because you've been around him for three years!) that he wouldn't and in fact couldn't do. Ron is so pathologically desperate for attention that he simply couldn't bring himself to acknowledge what he knows is the truth: that Harry loathes anything resembling public notice, and would have taken another AK than do something that would bring him more international fame, take fame from a deserving member of his school and cause him to be (once again) shunned by the entirety of the school (remember second year?). Just because Harry joked about doing it doesn't mean that he actually would - and if he did, there's no way that he wouldn't have told Ron about it or suggested he try as well. Ron, on the other hand? I doubt that he would have told Harry... or worse, I don't myself believe that he would have told Harry, based on the type of person Ron is. After all - the Mirror showed who Harry and Ron are. Harry wants a home and an extended family, whereas Ron wants to stand apart from all others, covered in fame, glory and awards.

Anyway... THAT is why he should apologize; for calling Harry a liar about something he simply couldn't lie about, and for leading the charge to hurt him at the worst possible time.

I suppose I have a different opinion that most --- I don't think that his fall-out with Harry was due simply to /jealousy/, but rather he felt betrayed and hurt. I agree that Harry wouldn't have done something like that, and I think this is where Ron's insecurities come in --- he didn't think that he was valued enough as a friend, and believed his best friend had left him out of something important.

I think it's important to pick up on the fact that at first, Ron /did/ ask Harry about what had happened. He didn't immediately turn against Harry, like it showed in the films.

#+begin_quote
  To his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed. *He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.*

  “Where've you been?” Harry said.

  “Oh hello,” said Ron.

  He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. *Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him.* He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.

  “So,” he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. “Congratulations.”
#+end_quote

First of all, notice that he isn't at the party --- he probably assumed that Harry would immediately go up to the dormitory, and explain what had happened. Instead, Harry spends /"nearly half an hour"/ down in the party, and returns wearing a banner around his neck, which looks like he has had a good time with his admirers. JK Rowling puts a lot of focus towards this banner around Harry's neck, bringing our attention to the fact that Ron is watching Harry /"struggle to remove it"/.

Ron then starts asking Harry about what happened, but Harry doesn't give him very straight answers, probably making it look as though he is lying.

#+begin_quote
  “Well... no one else got across the Age Line,” said Ron. “Not even Fred and George. What did you use - the Invisibility Cloak?”

  “The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line,” said Harry *slowly*.

  [...]

  “Listen,” said Harry, “I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it.”

  Ron raised his eyebrows.

  “What would they do that for?”

  *“I dunno,” said Harry.* He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, “/To kill me.”/

  Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair.
#+end_quote

I think it all comes down to it being a big misunderstanding. Ron should not have doubted Harry, and he should have had more faith in his best friend; they both should have spoken to each other afterwards, and sorted out their fight. This is something that JK Rowling said on the matter:

#+begin_quote
  /I would say Harry has flaws and failings. He was too proud [in the fourth book] to talk to Ron about what was bothering them both. Harry was walking around thinking, 'I'm the one with all the problems,' and he did have a lot of problems, but Ron had been a faithful friend for three years, and I would have cut Ron a little more slack./
#+end_quote

Both boys were too stubborn (or, as JK Rowling put it, "too proud"), to speak to each other; they both felt betrayed, and refused to speak to each other.

*I'm really confused about what you said:* */"Ron KNEW what the first task was"/.* Ron /didn't/ know what the first task was --- that was only in the films. He had no idea how much danger his best friend was is, otherwise he would probably have been right there supporting him. *I also don't understand what you meant about:* */"for leading the charge to hurt him"/.* He ignored Harry, but he didn't act against him.

#+begin_quote
  Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He wasn't laughing but he wasn't sticking up for Harry either.
#+end_quote

He didn't support Harry, but he wasn't /"leading the charge"/?? He didn't laugh at Harry, he didn't wear 'Potter Stinks' badges... he even checked up on Harry in the middle of the night, because he was worried!

******* Knew it how? Maybe I missed something but I don't recall Ron ever knowing what the first task was beforehand. Even in the movies all Ron knew was that Hagrid wanted to see him, and in the books Hagrid tells him to meet up directly. You got a page number for me so I can verify that?

Ron was 11 when he saw the mirror. What 11 year old doesn't think of being famous or winning awards, especially with five other accomplished/skilled brothers before you and only a mountain of hand me downs to your name? Ron's just a normal guy, the most normal of any of the three main characters. Of course he would have pretty shallow desires at 11. Holding that against Harry's earnest and tragic desire for family seems kinda silly.

I honestly don't see the point of some belaboured or excessive apology from Ron, from a story telling perspective. Everyone involved, from the readers to Ron himself, knows he's in the wrong, and reading through some drawn out apology when he's already been forgiven seems pointless.

******** Halfsies on Ron and the dragons (and I'll cut out the movie, because that really does make Ron look bad here). The blame (if you want to call it that) still goes on a Weasley - Charlie, not Ron - because he should have directly told Ron to tell Harry what was coming. Why? Well, saving Ginny from the Horcrux-Riddle ought to be worth something...

Ron's not a normal guy - his chess skills are proof of that, and it's something that his brothers and Ginny either don't do or not as well as him. I can't agree with your point here because what Ron wants is to have all the things his brothers have BUT (and we see this throughout the series) he simply doesn't want to put in the work... and he simply doesn't have the nerve that his brothers and sister do to really give anything his all when he tries. (Ginny's comment on anything being possible if you have enough nerve is priceless.) Also, those aren't shallow desires; they're only shallow if you want those things simply handed to you, and aren't prepared or willing to do the work to get them. Ron has to be all but forced to do schoolwork, and his nerves when playing Quidditch... as Harry said, it makes him spotty on the field.

Lastly - no one said anything about a drawn-out, excessive or belabored apology from Ron. You're right - everyone involved knows that he's wrong, and if he just said so ONCE... then it never has to be done again and everyone would go forward. Really, though - if someone treated you the way Ron did Harry and in similar circumstances and you could be satisfied with the knowledge that he didn't give ANY apology for all he said and did (let alone the apology you describe)... I confess that you are a better person than I could be.

No one said Ron need grovel. A friend would want to make an aggrieved friend feel better about his actions and at least apologize. I mean, it's not as if Ron's expected to offer a night with Ginny and some treacle in the Room of Requirement in the way of apology... now, if he were to get Susan Bones and Katie Bell in there with the treacle, I think Harry would forgive Ron for everything he's done, said and thought about for the next year. (Make it Daphne Geeengrass and Fleur, and it would be a DECADE. 😁😁😁😁😁)

********* Without a doubt. I mean it could be argued that the tournament organizers were ultimately at fault for expecting one person to handle a dragon when it takes at least eight people to subdue one, let alone a 14 year old, but Charlie could tossed him a bone.

I don't mean normal in that he's untalented, certainly not that. Only that his life experience is probably the most normal and relatable. He doesn't have a tragic backstory or a desire to belong. He's got a regular, if large, family with regular family problems and understandable issues that stem from that. He's down to earth, is what I mean.

And I wouldn't peg Ron as a lazy person, exactly. Sure he's no Hermione, but he passed every class he took save Divination and History of Magic, which probably has more to do with the teachers of those classes than him. Hell, he made it through his first two years with a mismatched and then broken wand. Sure he doesn't always try his best, but he's also a kid for most of the series. Most kids that age aren't trying to be their best selves in any area. I can't think of a single student in Harry's year that does manage that task all the time.

An apology would be nice, and I would have let him give it personally, but Harry quite emphatically forgave Ron before he could even get the words out, and interrupted him when he tried to push on anyway. At that point it's clear to all involved that Ron was an ass and he was sorry. Sure, the words would have been nice, but that was for Harry to decide in the end.

********* Ron has been shown to do schoolwork independently throughout the series; he doesn't need Hermione looming over his shoulders to do it. He does his homework reluctantly, yes, but what kid his age is enthusiastic about homework (except Hermione, but she's a special case)?

I also feel like there's no need to keep trying to apologise to Harry if Harry keeps cutting him off when he's trying to tell him it's not necessary. He doesn't need to go on and absolutely insist on apologising when it's being dismissed.

I'm not on board with your argument about the dragons. In the books, Ron wasn't involved with Harry getting to know about them.

#+begin_quote
  Hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only Harry could hear it, “Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin. Wear that cloak.”

Charlie shouldn't have told anyone, because no-one were supposed to know about the task. Telling Harry would be blatant favouritism and cheating. Charlie had no clue that Harry learned about the dragons. It was all Hagrid.

I do wish that JKR had exploited Ron's strategic thinking a bit better, though, but he was meant to be a normal, rather average guy.

Not completely. Is it understandable, especially with Ron's character in mind? Yes absolutely.

Ron has a massive inferiority complex due to his brothers and stuff. On top of that, he is friends with the Boy-Who-Lived and is often overshadowed by him. In first year Ron gets smacked by a giant chess piece for Harry. In second year Ron almost got obliviated and couldn't help Harry save his sister. In third year Ron got his leg mangled by Sirius.

Irrelevant, because her crime was that /she didn't care about Ron's feelings when he thought his beloved pet had died./ That's what she did wrong. Leaving aside whether it would be her fault if he had died (and just been a rat), the fact is that he was upset and she /didn't give a shit/.

I've owned cats my whole life. I can't imagine bringing a cat into a shared space that /already had at least a rat and toad/ without discussing it with anyone and letting the cat just run free. That's a dick move right there. She expects Ron to keep Scabbers locked up where he can't get eaten but makes no effort to lock up Crookshanks where he can't hunt. Selfish.

If my cat did possibly hurt someone's pet (or "merely" chase it off to be possibly lost forever) I'd be apologetic, and you know, actually give two shits about other people's feelings about their pets, especially someone that was supposedly my best friend.

Plus, you know, Scabbers was alive, but Crookshanks /really did try to kill him/, so Ron's not even wrong. I'm not sure what Ron had to apologize for - being somewhat inaccurate I guess?

If someone said "I hope your dog gets run over" and then your dog does get run over, and you blame the person, who was in fact recklessly driving, but it turns out someone else ran over your dog... um, okay. I don't know I'd be too quick to apologize for yelling at someone in that situation.

****** For Harry/Tonks

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor]] is probably one of the best fanfics in the fandom. Kind of strange, but fantastic writing and world building.

- Anything by the author ChelseyB. They're far more romance focused. Unfortunately they were deleted from FFnet, fortunately they're available to [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsN2ZmLThIYWJYUVU][here]]. Half Blood Auror and The Rebel And The Chosen are the best long form fics she wrote for H/T.

Harry/Fleur:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Left Behind]] a fantastic H/F rewrite that petered out in second year =/.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/1/When-a-Veela-Cries][When A Veela Cries]] Gets far better post chapter 6. It's definitely angsty, but it's enjoyable.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]]. Honestly this fic is dated, and silly, and not that great. I still like it though because Jbern is really good at writing inventive action scenes.

Kind of both:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and The Wastelands of Time]]. This and it's sequel are excellent adventure with a side of romance stories. The author is actually published now, and you can see his unique style continued on in some of his published works.

Ginny and Hermione are bland in different ways. Ginny's actual character is a little basic, while the thing with Hermione is just that she's the most obvious person to be paired with Harry. Not to mention how her character is boiled down to "smart bossy girl" in a lot of fanfiction.

The main thing I dislike is when people act like Harry and Hermione is some avant-garde belief, and that they're beyond other people that favor Hinny.

*** I respect your opinion but i really disagree.

Im not going to convince you otherwise, and Im not really trying to, but I more or less just want to show the other side.

I love reading Weasley centric stories. In fact, I dont think there are enough. My favorite stories are those that expand on something from the books that does not get looked at so well. Molly dealing with things after the war, or with her inability to protect her children as much as she would like to. George dealing with Fred's death, or the twins dealing with leaving school and owning their store. Bill having to deal with falling for Fleur during a war and then once he brings her home dealing with his mother and sister treating her terribly. Percy dealing with the guilt of leaving his family as it becomes increasingly obvious that something is very wrong. Charlie having to deal with the fact that he is far away while his family is in a war. And Ginny having to deal with the PTSD of almost killing a bunch of people on her first year and nearly dying then slowly growing into a more developed person.

All of these scenarios are canon enough that not a lot of character breaking needs to happen, but also far enough from tbe main HP plot that writers can take some liberties and really showcase their own writing skills.

  And I, in turn, respect your opinion. But I'm not one to read canon compliant fics, even if they are set after the war.

  I don't expect full-on AU, but the main reason I go to fanfiction is to explore different friendships and paths for Harry. Even point-of-divergence fics are OK for me, so long as they don't go along the lines of canon all the way.
#+end_quote

Thats totally fair. I suppose the difference lies in what we are looking for in our fanfics. If you dont mind me asking, what exactly do you find appealing about AU stories?

I have found a few I like, but generally they are shorter cute stories about James and Lily.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, others may be interested in reading and writing about the years after the books, but not me. If I do go post-Hogwarts, I'd prefer something different from the routes of canon.

  And yes, I'll repeat that I don't hate the Weasleys. It's just that I far prefer to read about, for example, the Delacours, Changs, Patils, Perkses, Davises, Parkinsons, Greengrasses, Browns, Finnigans, Boneses, Thomases, Tonkses, Abbotts, etc.

  There's a whole list of different families and their dynamics to create and explore.
#+end_quote

Oh I like reading about all of them too, its just that the Weasleys have a lot of stuff that they face that I find interesting.

I generally like character studies that go further into what a person would "realistically" be feeling in the situation. The Creevy brothers are interesting for sure. So are Tonks and Remus.

Even some Slytherin stories are great because tuey provide a different perspective.

** It's because they're looking for an easy antagonist and these are exaggerations of flaws and lines that really exist in the books - Ron is jealous of Harry inasmuch as the fact that Harry has money and attention that Ron craves, and yeah, he does have some disgusting eating habits, but they're realistic character flaws that make him into a three-dimensional person. And Molly makes comments about Harry being part of the family, and in OotP she (imho) does come off as a little bit controlling, but that is understandable when she has a husband and children involved in a war she already lost her brothers to, and younger children not of age yet that desperately also want to fight. But those flaws and lines do exist. And Ginny's crush, obviously. All of these things exist to add dimension to their characters, but they are ridiculously easy for an immature author (or reader) to inflate into the Weasleys we see in those fics for an easy antagonist. Anyone who's stopped to take in deeper themes of the books - and anyone with more than 20 years of life experience - understands that the world is full of shades of grey and every action has motivations and consequences, good or bad. But these are just immature readers and writers looking for a black-and-white explanation.

EDIT: I mean, Ron's eating habits aren't a character flaw, but it's a trait that some people don't like and will choose to exaggerate like OP mentioned. But he's a poor kid taking advantage of free food - which is a completely normal thing. And he's tall and skinny, I wouldn't be surprised if he has one of those super-metabolisms and is actually hungry all the time.

So making Ron and/or Ginny part of the 'bad guys' is an easy way to generate a plot and push Harry and/or Hermione toward someone else. Add in Molly's throwaway mention of love potions and voila! an entire new set of plot points evolve.

The fanon depictions of them, even when they're not being bashed, aren't entirely flattering either. Ron enjoys eating too much and is always insensitive to others. Ginny is a bit too fangirl-ish towards Harry. Are the twins bullies who share hive mind? Probably! Percy's a complete prat, like Hermione but with fewer friends. And Molly is an overbearing shrew married to poor semi-spineless Arthur. It's rare to see any fic that doesn't include at least one of those traits.

Ron and Molly specifically tho I see it more like people were mad at certain things they did and want to see them called out or punished for what they did .

The light bad dark good and Slytherin good Griffindor bad kinda stories I think less popular than they were before. Alot of people just like exploring fanon now so the comparison to canon especially for ships I think less a thing.

Ron getting called out in general I think dying down a bit partly cuz people like a change or people think Ron gets a bad rap and others are being too harsh.

The other Weaselys generally get wrapped up with Ron and Ginny. And then get pushed to extremes to make them all look bad. But it is dying down I think compared to before. Though it was way more popular before and there are alot of fics and its not like non existent now so if you are just coming in it probably just seems like there are in general alot.

Molly specifically tho I think that's less true . I see more of Molly getting called out more for things she specifically does in the books more than she used to.

Like her treatment of Fleur, her fight with Sirius, her reaction to Rita Skeeter's articles about Hermione and her flippant attitude bout love potions. Its like a newer trend i think I don't think people talked bout it much before. And unlike Ron she doesn't really get called out in the books or face consequences so people want to either call her out or make her look bad or have her face consequences or just have her punished.

** I really do not like how Molly try to parent Harry by sheltering him.

While I understand where she come from, I consider her unreasonnable, and honestly unwise and not smart for it.

It starts with Book 3. She didn't want to tell Harry about Black and that he was after him. Arthur make the decision, and right one, to tell Harry.

And then, there's the whole of book 5. Harry is a teen. BUT he is the target of Voldemort, and he'll have to fight in this war, there is no avoiding it. Even if Molly wasn't aware of the content of the prophecy, she knew perfectly well that Voldemort wanted to kill Harry, and would try to do so all the time.

THe best way to protect Harry, or anyone in his position, is to prepare him, not to shelter him as much as you can. It is sad and unfair and cruel, it's sadly the reality Harry lives in.

And repeating ad nauseam "but he is just a child", do not help anyone, and would have put Harry in even more danger if other adults didn't override Molly.

Sirius had his own issue as a parental figure to Harry, but he was right on this one. Harry needed to know the truth, the whole truth, and to prepare himself for what to come. And since Voldemort had reborn, the sooner, the better.

Molly violently disagreed with that, and took it as a personal offense when people didn't listen to her.

I have no doubt that she loved and cared for Harry. But I think that she was very misguided.

But it doesn't make it, okay.

So, if I had to read Molly bashing (which really isn't my cup of tea), this is what I'd like to explore. How this coddling and sheltering could turn very ugly if left unchecked, or if other people are a bit more submissive.

So, not a evil-cruel caricatural vilain Molly who want to stole money and marry of her Daughter. This is bullshit.

But something along the line of a mother's love can be scary and dangerous, even for her children.

I'll always remember this mother that killed her children believing that they will be happier and safer with God. Okay, the woman was sick in the head, and needed help. But you know what ? The sad thing is that she did love her children.

While I don't want to see Molly going that far, far from that, I think it'd be interesting to explore this sheltering style of parenting in Molly, turning it up to 11, and watch the horror.

But I wouldn't like the story if it goes to bash Molly. I'd like it if it focused more on the effect on each children, and show some compassion for Molly, because that would be more a act of a mentally unwell woman, traumatized by her brother's death, and unable to cope with it.

** Molly Weasley:

- Speaks happily of using something tantamount to a date-rape drug to get Arthur's attention. Ask Tom Riddle if that's worth giggling over.
- Bosses Sirius around /in his own house./
- Refers to a book by Gilderoy Lockhart, a man that exposed himself as an incompetent fraud and tried to mind-wipe her son and honorary son so that he could leave her daughter to die.
- Is openly dismissive of her husband's favorite hobby and treats protecting wizards from mostly-harmless scams as more important and worthy work than protecting innocent Muggles from abuse ("So you see, it's a very important job and I tell him it's just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.").

She's a loving wife and mother, to be sure, if possibly a bit overly-clingy due to the loss of her brothers. Unfortunately, she's also bossy, opinionated, and despite being on Team Good seems to still consider magicals to be superior to and/or more important than Muggles.

Basically, canon mostly treats love potions as harmless fun, completely ignoring the potential implications. A mild love potion might be fine, just an attraction potion that makes you go "hey, he/she is kinda cute..." - if that's what Molly was talking about, it's not really problematic. We're just not given enough information about the potion she talked about or the ones the twins went on to sell at WWW to be able to make a definitive judgement.

And yes, no real high-school teacher teaches kids how to make date-rape drugs. On the other hand, consider what some of the other potions and spells in canon do and whether those are things that should be taught to children.

Arthur's hobby is a bit silly, the car is cool, but it's actually illegal to use any of the magical stuff he put in it, and outside of that he's apparently not even figured out how to pronounce electricity or what a rubber duck is. It's also implied to be why he never managed to get a better paying position in the ministry.

Not enjoying your spouse's hobby is one thing, but you should at least acknowledge that it's important to them and respect their feelings.

** I think that the trope started because of some stuff Ron did in the books and it was super exaggerated and it became a trope because people love hating it.

Molly is seen as overbearing, and talked down to Sirius, and has a line about love potions, so people went up and expanded greatly to her being evil, and greedy and wanting Harry's money (everyone seems to want it in these fics, lol) despite her being a good mother, who raised seven children to be decent and kind and is always willing to help others. And she is married to Arthur, who is an awesome guy and a good father.

Ginny is more complicated because the movies didn't do her any favors, and many people see/saw her as "stealing" Harry from Hermione or whoever they shipped him with.

Strangely all the other Weasleys(maybe except Percy), especially the Twins are seen as saints who are forced to tolerate their terrible family members.

Some of the stuff is comical, with Molly being cackling evilly with Ginny as they brew love potions and Ron pretending to be Harry's friend(lol) wanting to get poor Hermione to himself as his housewife.

These tropes evolved from common trope in fanfiction where they take characters they don't like and take their flaws and expand them to absurd limits, or sometimes just invent new ones.

Normally, if I don't want to write a character, for any reason, I can just make them a minor character.

-Don't want Harry to be Ron's friend? Place him in another House, or just in another train compartment and have him befriend Neville, or whoever you want.

-Still want Hermione to be part of it, just have them meet in the Library, easy. Without Harry, Ron and Hermione's friendship likely wouldn't have begun.

That alone is an easy way to not have the Weasleys you don't want to in the story.

-Oh, but what about stories beginning in the middle of the books.

Those are harder, and require more work, but don't require any bashing or evil acts on the part of anyone, just have Harry meet other people (however, remember that, as far as you go in the books, the trio got even closer) or make him change schools and/or go to another country.

If you want to keep him in Hogwarts, Fourth Year is around a good time because of their fallout over the Tri-Wizard, no need for much drama, just have them drift apart even after they reconcile. Maybe by making Harry meet others that befriend him and are more compatible with the personality you're using.

I work with he assumption that almost any situation and/or trope can make a good story, if only the writing is good and the author puts in the work needed.

Molly and Ginny because Ginny was hardly around and rarely got chances to shine, and when they were around there was a particular scene where she Molly and someone else were giggling over love potions as if date raping someone is amusing. Combine that with Harry's sudden onset of 'omg ginny's pretty great' and how awful that romance was....

*** One. I don't think even if I was Ron, would give Harry information about the dragons because it's cheating and might risk his brothers job. He cares for his friends and although he has his flaws, he has positive things as well. He's smart, goofy and cares. He can be insecure and brash but I think he has good intentions. And I dint think you've read the book because in the book, Ginny was around and has had so much times to shine. She is a good willed, stubborn girl whose speaks for her mind and doesn't ‘giggle over love potions as if raping is good'. Anyways if love potions ‘rape' people, it would have been a big problem and been banned so I don't think it's that bad (considering the fact we've gotten not a lot of information about it. I do get what you are coming from because of the movie, they cutter a lot of Ron's and the Weasley's good scenes and their character but judging from the book, I don't think they are ‘bad guys'

I do see that they did some mistakes and could be seen as rude and blunt. But one mistake doesn't make up a character.

Anyways Harry and Hermione has flaws as well yet people ignore them and treat both of them like Gods? Ron is a great character who isn't too perfect and has flaws like every other character in the books. They re human, as well kids, of course they are going to do some dumb things and say stupid things. They are still learning to be a person. No one is perfect

**** I read the books. Admittedly not in a long time however.

Cheating was all but encouraged. And you would think a real friend wouldn't care in the eventuality that a fucking *dragon* were involved. They helped take care of one just four years prior. A baby one. And it bit one of them and made their hands swell up. He knew damn well how nasty they were.

Ginny had very few appearances up until book five that weren't one-scene-wonders. She had more than I suggested sure, but it wasn't like she was around like Ron and hermione.

Love potions literally made Voldemort. Merope gave Tom the potion, he got her pregnant, she stopped giving him the potion thinking he really loved her, and he ran like the hounds were at his heels, leaving him nothing. What exactly are you on? They were even implied somewhere (if not in the books then I think by Rowling. Could totally be barking up the wrong tree here.) that they were partly responsible for his total lack of understanding of love.

And I never said Harry and Hermione were flawless. Harry was a dumb jock who cheated in school and usually considered quidditch more important than school despite the megalomaniac after him. Hermione was little miss perfect and would have been incredibly grating with how bossy she was.

***** Yes I agree with the dragon part. Yes, although he was in danger, you must remember Ron was in a fight with Harry and is very stubborn. That is his trait and could be seen as a flaw at times. It was his mistake but I don't think Harry would accept Ron telling him about the dragons with the fair play and everything. Also there might have been a chance he didn't know (I can't remember if he did or not) but if he did know, you are right it's his fault and mistake there. You are true with Ginny as she wasn't there a lot. Yes, Love Potion for sure raped Tom but he's a muggle and I don't know (I am not sure if it's mentioned in the books or anywhere) if it will be as strong as an effect for a wizard. But if it is, I wonder why the ministry hasn't banned it. And I think it's is a joke and it's was a serious thing they were planning.

Ron ate a love potion laced chocolate that wasn't even meant for him and was instantly infatuated with Romilda Vane. It EASILY is as bad as it sounds.

And I know they probably weren't /serious/ about it, but the fact it can even be joked about was off-putting. The fact that you could easily make the claim that Harry was love potioned in sixth year by her is also off putting. That doesn't mean it /happened./ Teens will be teens after all.

** I've held back reading many fics because of the Weasley bashing. True, they're a flawed family but the family stays tight. Even Percy came back into the fold when he was needed.

I don't understand why the Weasley are bashed and the Black family is considered the epitome of good family culture in some fics. The Blacks are inbred pureblood bigots whose history of bloodthirstiness finally flipped the tables on them. Bellatrix, Walburga etc. had absolutely no sense of family, only that everyone should uphold the ideals of a good pureblood (rid the Wizarding World of the Muggle filth etc). They also tried to kill or banish members who didn't.

Molly Weasley had a considerable amount of flaws; namely, her close-mindedness when it came to girls showing the kind of behaviour the Victorian era probably approves of, the age-old attitude of a mother clinging to her soon-to-be-married son and despising the daughter-in-law and finally, her readiness to believe all the utter shit the newspapers printed without bothering to think or verify. You can't entirely fault her for trying to keep the children away from the war (useless as it is). She lost two brothers to the war and she's clinging to some normalcy amidst a war that would tear her family apart again.

I certainly didn't like that she bossed over Sirius in his home. But I think a lot of us can admit that Sirius did see Harry as an extension of James. To be fair to the guy, he and Harry hadn't spent the amount of time needed to know he wasn't his father but an entity who didn't grow up like James in an affluent family. She was kinda right about that.

With the exception of Hermione and Luna, most of the female characters are not well-written at all. I suppose a lot of people hate Ginny because Harry fell in love with her out of the blue. It felt more like infatuation rather than love. JK messed up on that front. And the fic writers ate it up and made Ginny a vapid, self-possessed idiot whose main ambition in life is to become Mrs. Potter. Such a shame because she had the potential to be written as an incredible character.

PS: Those who wouldn't mind reading a BAMF Ginny should probably check out this fic.

It features a Slytherin Ginny who has to overcome so many challenges, being a blood-traitor in the house of snakes and generally being so badass that I fell madly in love with the character. And the slow progression of the Hinny relationship was so well written that I really wished t was canon.

** Because from an adult's point of view the whole meeting for first-year stinks of a setup. Molly, who has been taking children to Hogwarts for at least 7 years prior to that, and attended herself for 7 years, has somehow forgotten how to get to the platform. So why are they even on the muggle side if there's a different route that she would normally take meaning that this is genuinely new for her? Or why is she attracting attention to herself by shouting about muggles?\\
Secondly, after Harry has passed a few other compartments with few or no people in them Ron turns up and the rest just happen to already be full, the same Ron that got on the train at the same time as Harry as he was with his mother who led Harry to the train?

Thirdly, the ONLY other friend Harry makes in first year is Hermione. The most famous wizard in living history only makes 2 friends in first year? There's no way that would be possible unless someone was keeping people away.

Fourthly there are Rons social and study habits (not to mention his eating habits) and propensity to get Harry in trouble by speaking for him (Dual at midnight anyone?)

When you read the books it's quite clear that meeting Ron kills Harry's desire to learn as much as he can in the wizarding world. As he starts out reading as much as he can before the train, and then falls back into the same study habits he had with Dudley, and it only takes Ron two months to achieve this.

I could go on, and other people already have done, but this is the gist of the main points in book 1.

  At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.

  Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him --- and they had an owl.

Also, as far as I know, the Statute of Secrecy has no problems with wizards drawing attention to themselves. The issue is with drawing the attention of muggles to the existence of magic. Yes the former may lead to the latter, but the former is not illegal. As long as a wizard isn't doing magic or showing magical things to muggles, he can do stand up comedy in a muggle bar if he so wishes.

As for why they don't use floo in canon, that's a good point but I don't think there's any good in-world explanation for it. Rowling used it to force travel in a train which served as a stage for the "intro" and "outro" of the current year.

******** Just because there are disturbing undertones to the stories as written if you look at it with an adult eye, doesn't mean that they're not a fun read. But that's true of many stories in history, both fictional and not.

Do you think that Oliver Twist is any less enjoyable than other contemporary stories because it deals with hard stuff? The same is true with Harry Potter, you don't need to ignore the problematic aspects of it for it to be an enjoyable read. IMO, those same issues are many of the things that allow the whole story to be driven along. Where other students may have gone to the police (Auror's) at several points during the story and short-cutted several plot lines, Harry doesn't because his history says that they won't help. He doesn't know how to deal with the press, or how to ask the right adults for help either.\\
McGonagall loses his trust pretty early on when she's too overworked to help or listen properly to what Harry and co are saying. Literally, everyone else in the story is either an adult or has a trusted adult to help them until Luna is introduced. Here is a bullied young girl who has a father that hasn't been there (in both senses of the word) since her mother died, and has taken refuge in the fantastic because she too has been failed by pretty much every adult in the story.

Also, there are many characteristics that makes molly and the Weasley pretty suspicious. Like how they were standing on the muggle side of the platform talking loudly about Hogwarts, and muggles, when it's clear that they have floo at home, and they don't know anything about muggle world. Usually, it's just plot convenience that fiction writers use to make a good story.

** I think a lot of the aversion to the Weasleys is the exact opposite reason that Snape and Draco are beloved by a lot of the community - namely, casting decisions the movies.

I mean, in the books, neither Draco nor Snape were described as attractive. Someone put together a list of the adjectives JKR used for Snape, and he sounds like he hit every branch falling off the ugly tree. Draco less so, but is still not described as handsome.

Whereas in the movies, Alan Rickman and Tom Felton are both charming and handsome.

Meanwhile, the Weasleys are described as either attractive (Bill/Ginny) or neutral (Charlie/Twins). But in the movies, they are hideous. I mean, if Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe had chemistry on screen, Rupert Grint legit made me flinch the first time I saw him. And Ginny - the girl that gets the hero - is /GROSS/. A total surfboard and a face so plain it practically blends in with the stone walls of the castle.

Go look up Bill Weasley (who was supposed to be handsome and super cool). /THAT'S/ the guy that landed Fleur? Jesus! I think he should have thanked Greyback for scarring his face up, it was an improvement from how he looked before.

So it is just a reverse Halo Effect (a term for aesthetic appearance offering advantage in life). Because HP fans see the Weasleys as ugly and gross, they write their personalities to match their appearances.

Edit: For some visual proof of what I'm saying, it's unlikely people would hate Ron if he'd looked like this: [[https://bit.ly/32RvNdJ]] (Thomas Knight) as opposed to THIS (🤮): [[https://bit.ly/3nrLYX6]]

  The Weasleys were pretty horrible in canon if you look closer.

  Molly raised her children to follow strict gender roles (treated her sons harshly and let them play around all they want to, but spoiled Ginny and didn't allow her to play with her brothers),
#+end_quote

Gender roles? We see all of Molly's children are made to help keep the house. The boys degnome the garden specifically as a punishment, but other chores are decidedly gender-neutral. Everyone chips in on the cleaning.

Harry and Ron notably have to peel potatoes--gender roles would presumably indicate kitchen duty being women's work.

We don't see Ginny be "spoiled" at all. She's never given anything new just for being a girl.

As for playing with her brothers, it's made very clear that she was excluded by their choice, not Molly's.

#+begin_quote
  publicly embarrassed her children
#+end_quote

Two instances come to mind. One was Molly's cleaning Ron's face with a tissue in public, and while that would embarrass an eleven-year-old boy, it's barely worth mentioning in this series. The other was the Howler, but that appears to be a traditional punishment for serious infractions when face-to-face communication would be difficult.

#+begin_quote
  slut shamed a teenage girl

I won't argue this one. Molly's treatment of Hermione in /Goblet of Fire/ was very poor.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Loopholes that would allow him to experiment only for his own knowledge and would harm no innocent bystanders.

Because he acts like a Jealous idiot at times in the books? I mean yea he has plenty of redeeming moments, but thats how his character is written. And while you can certainly forgive it as being "teenage angst" or just general teenage behavior, it doesnt alter the facts.

You gave a bunch of reasons to dislike her and all are valid, but very few reasons to like her. So again... not surprising. Sure she is the classic "overbearing mother figure" which shouldn't really cause "hate" but it certainly doesnt endear her to folks either. Throw in the theory some have that she was told by Dumbledore to "meddle" in Harry's life from the start and there are questions to be asked about how innocent her intentions at times are. She also treats certain other characters like Tonks and Hermione absolutely TERRIBLE at times to the point where its impossibe to see her as a good person.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny is a deluded borderline lunatic who steals harry's boxers and watches him in the shower.
#+end_quote

Now as for Ginny. Here is where I agree somewhat and keep in mind this is coming from someone who does NOT like Harry/Ginny as a pairing. She is certainly over bashed but a lot of the fault of that can be laid at the feet of JK herself for developing her poorly and treating her as a minor side character until SUDDENLY shes the love of Harry's life (yea yea I know a bit of an exageration). The point still remains that she doesnt seem a good fit for Harry at any point until out of the blue she is and its very clear that they were never meant for each other until JK needed to sort the pairings out.

--------------

I guess my point is, The Weasleys were, in my view, never written very well into the context of the Story by JK with a few exceptions or moments. They are clearly intended to be Harrys "adopted" wizarding family with some comic relief added in at the start and later becoming something more. But they never seem to "fit" quite right and more importantly, seem to waffle in strength of depth the whole book series. It makes it easier to poke holes and find things you don't like.

And its not hard to argue that the ENTIRE story could have been written without the Weasleys involvement and it would arguably be just as good if not better in some peoples minds. Its hard to say the same about many other characters or groups.

Now.. I am sure I will get some hate for saying that but I want to point out that I am a huge fan of the Weasly twins, Bill, and Mr. Weasley, and I don't exclude them when reading or writing FF. So don't treat me as a Weasley basher although I will openly admit I am not a Ron fan.

**** here's my thought process on this:

considering harry potter was written in the 90s, by a woman born in the 60s, the values of traditional wizarding families are very much reflective of the issues of the times she grew up in. the most noticeable of those issues is blood purity, reflecting racism and the ideals of nazi germany.

from this, i'm assuming that homophobia would also be an issue. that doesn't mean gay people wouldn't EXIST, just as gay people have existed in all of history, no matter the acceptance of it.

in addition, since harry was born in ‘80, he would be 20 in the 2000s, when queer identities were slowly being recognized and accepted. by 30, it would be rather normalized.

none of us actually have any idea how the real world would impact the wizarding world and their ideals and perceptions of non-traditional relationships such as queer ones, but that's what fanfiction is for! many people, like me, assume the traditional values also encompass sexuality, but slash pairings are still popular. it's just another obstacle to overcome.

** There's a lot of things that stuck out to me even before writing / reading FanFictions that was just odd to me even growing up even all the way from book 1.i dont hate all the Weasleys but Ron Molly and Ginny where always sus for me

In book 1 Molly walk through the train station talking very loudly ( even with the statute of secrecy) about Muggles as if she's trying to get someone's attention then she asked what the platform number was as if she hadn't spent 7 years going there herself and hadn't been sending her boys there for the past 7+ years. Now I could say that she does this every year for lost muggle-born students BUT it's not brought up again. Ginny has a weird almost obsession with Harry before she's even met him. Harry's sudden love for her came of the drop of the Hat many suspect that she had love potion him seeing that it shows in the movies she's looking at love potions and Fred and George's shop. Ron is understandably has a problem with fighting for attention with as many siblings as he has. books 1 and 2 there's not much to be said apart from how he treats Hermione book 3 is when it starts to get questionable yes he is a fan of quittage BUT his father works at the ministry he knows how dangerous Sirius Black is so when their friend points out hey this random broomstick could be a trick from this supposed mass murderer who supposedly sold out our best friend's parents all he cares about is she got the broom taken away ( no I do not let Harry get away with this either he should have thought about this rationally) especially since you're first year Harry had a broom problem with Quirrell messing with his broom it's not that too far-fetched just think that Sirius Black could have done the same. In book 4 Harry tells Ron and Hermione that he's happy. that maybe he can have a normal year now with the age line they've been friends at this point for over 3 years. Suddenly Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire and Ron doesn't believe that he's telling the truth when he says he didn't put his name in that he doesn't want the fame or the money if you're friends with somebody for 3 years you would know that he doesn't like the fame that he got from his parents dying and him not. He doesn't talk to his friend until after the first task when he decides "ya maybe Harry was telling the truth that he didn't enter his name into this deadly comparison." Ron abandons Hermione and Harry in the last book to continue doing horcrux hunting and spends time with his family while well Harry and Hermione or out there in the wilderness.

I don't personally hate Ron Ginny and mrs. Weasley but there are things that just stick out as suspicious to me. I myself I'm using Ron Ginny and mrs. Weasley bashing in the book I'm writing

Point 1 - I would be very, very surprised if a decent portion of Harry's age group didn't have celebrity crushes on him due to how ridiculously famous he is. That Ginny would have a childish infatuation isn't surprising at all.

Point 2 - Rowling is absolute shit at writing romance. That's pretty much it. Like, just compare it to the trainwreck that was Harry's fling (?) with Cho. Not any different in terms of coherence.

When you travel with kids, you repeat things like destination or train number so *they* remember them.

Also, Molly was not talking loudly about Muggles. Here's what the book says:

#+begin_quote
  At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.

  “--- packed with Muggles, of course ---”

  Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him --- and they had an /owl/.
#+end_quote

Harry *happened to overhear* the word muggle, she wasn't shouting it. Also, muggles don't know what "muggle" means so she might as well have been saying some random made up word and the Statute of Secrecy would not have any issues whatsoever.

For example instead of just not having Ron like Hermione in order to make their Draco/Hermione stories work they need to make Ron so bad that even Harry leaves him.

** To respond to The user TheAncientSun and others.

1. Ronald Bilius Weasley being lazy is definitely a supportable character flaw. The problem is when that character flaw become a problem by being transmissible to the Hero or worse blocking the forging of the Hero assets like studying ambitious magic like ancient runes courses. Being born into a numerous family that is poor, jealousy is a sentiment that is normal to develop. But Jealousy and laziness don't work well together. You see one could work with Ronald being Jealous to give him some ambition to have both Harry and Ron sorted in Slytherin in a fanfiction divergent. But as Canon Ron have both Laziness and Jealousy it is not possible in Canon to transform that flaw into an asset. And the conjonction of both flaws is easy enough to transform into someone that would be easy to manipulate be by Dumbledore or worse.

2. Molly Weasley is more difficult to analyse from where it comes. But one could tell that Molly is not a calm lady under the Patriarch of the family control. She is not someone that fit the Patriarchal society that Britain Wizarding World is.

3. And there is of course the obviously setup meeting in first Year that is literally oozing Dumbledore manipulation. The arguments of user Dark-phoenix-lady are found. What would have happened if Draco was Harry first friend ? (We both know that once Harry give his loyalty it is heavy.)

4. The interpretation choices made by Chris Collumbus didn't help. There was no casting error for Rupert Grint, if the confidence of the casting director are to be believed he was the one boy with a face that Collumbus wanted and he played the character very well. It is the interpretation choices of Chris Columbus that reduced Ronald character in the films.

** This is a combination of two things IMO.

The first is the simplest, fanfiction being written by inexperience writters often flanderises the characters. Where in the books Hermione is smart, now she js a genius that can figure anything out. Where Ron can be jealous and insecure, now he is just that. Ginny had a crush on Harry so now she is a stalker. Ect. Ect. Ect.

The other is that the movies made both Ron and Ginny way worse that the books, and for a lot of people the movie superseded the books. You will notice that a lot of people also have Luna and Neville getting together as per the movies.

** Why? I think a lot of it is movie fans who see nothing but the rather heavy onscreen chemistry between Radcliffe and Watson. The movies royally fucked the Weasley clan over. If you've never read the books, I can easily see being blindsided by the cannon ships. If you did read the books, and didn't see the ships coming, well, I have to assume you skipped books 1 through 5.

The rest are those who found it insulting JKR didn't consult with them personally before making Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione ironclad cannon.

Now, I'll admit my own bias as a true blue Hinny and Ramione fan. That said, sometimes I do want to read something different, and the rampant bashing makes that hard to find.

It is possible for Harry and Ginny to not be a ship with out making Ginny an evil, gold digging super slut. Just as its possible for Ron not to be an abusive jealous jackals.

The Molly hating I've simply never understood. Other than people pushing their own issues and demons on her. Molly is never shown to be more than a loving, and yes, over protective mother. Was she mean to Fluer? Maybe, but Fluer was also quite a stuck up snob. Did she slut shame Hermione? No. She read an article that was deliberately made to show Hermione hurting Harry, who Molly viewed and loved as her own. Speaking as a father, its very, very easy to miss truth and jump to conclusions when you feel your own are being hurt. Especially if you aren't there to see with your own eyes. She made one comment about brewing (not using) a love potion. I just don't see it or get it.

Like I said, I'd love to venture out of my cosey little Hinny corner, but the rampant bashing makes me reluctant. I've started a number of promising fics only to stop when the bashing slams in from left field.

Anyway, to the original point: why do people bash?

Because the want to. Because they can. Because it fulfills some need they have. Because they are bored, even.

And thats okay. Nobody is forced to read it. I just wish it was labeled more often. Much love and respect to the fic makers who do!

** Weasely hate has toned down alot imo

Why people hate on them ...well it's usually Ginny Ron or Molly people hate on.

Ginny it's usually they don't like her with Harry and want to show her as the worse option to who over they prefer Harry with. Or they just don't like her and want to show her as bad.

Ron it's kinda the same with Ginny only its not liking him with Hermione. But as opposed to with Ginny the ship I think has less importance imo. People were really pissed off at Ron for his worst book moments and many I don't think ever forgave him. He does get called out in the books but many don't think it was enough and just want to see bad things happen to him. They may just flat out hate his character.

Molly is basically the same as Ron but with no shipping reasons. The difference is alot of the time what I see from people who don't really like Molly or hate her, is that they are frustrated she doesn't get called out in canon. Common frustrations with Molly in canon I see come up are things like, the howler she gives Ron, destroying Fred and George's inventions and being generally unsupportive of their passions, Being unkind to Hermione based on Rita's Propaganda, being unaccepting of Fleur, admiting to use of love potion, and using Sirius's imprisonment in Azkaban against him.

These are things that she isn't really called out in canon except maybe the last one a bit. And they aren't framed as that bad.

So I bring up this difference because even though I think Weasely bashing as a whole is going down Molly bashing and Molly critical stuff is going up.

The primary issue with Ginny was around shipping. But its been over a decade since the last book was released. And in fandom what is canon and what isn't as far as shipping goes is kinda irrelevant at this point.

For Ron ya people hated his worst moments but he was called out for them in canon and people were calling him out for a very long time in fandom. So most aren't that interested in seeing more of the same.

Molly though wasn't criticized by canon and the fandom largely loved her and sympathized with her for very long time. Alot of Weasely bashing was people not liking Ginny or Ron or both and being like well im not the biggest fan of Molly so ill bash her too. Imo for a long time it didn't have as much to do with the issues people have with her specifically. But now alot of Molly bashing does. So its not as played out and if its more critical and less bashing people may just be on board for that because they are less used to it in non bashing fic with Molly.

Sometimes it can be done subtly - like showing Dumbledore as a slightly more flawed individual who you shouldn't put all your trust in but overall a good person - But generally I find that if it's bad enough to be called bashing (especially if the author does so in the tags) the fic is probably pretty cracky.

**** Eh, I like Percy, plus the argument between him and Arthur was both of their faults. As for the letter, Percy sent it out of brotherly love and concern.

****** Gotta agree with Bleep on this one.

Percy was a fanatical authority-worshiper and ambitious political/social climber. He put his career before his family, happily embracing Fudge's delusions. His devotion to The Rules may have contributed, as he could have developed a perception of Harry as a troubled rule-breaker to the point where it overrode the whole "saved Ginny from dying" bit. Whatever he heard from Ron about the trio's adventures was probably dismissed as made-up or exaggerated, which in turn would only have reinforced the idea of Harry being a bad influence.

*** I agree it always weirds me out that molly is seen as a bad parent but arthur is a saint. If she is sooo awful to the kids and arthur allows it is he really a great dad. I would love to see more Arthur bashing to balance things out.

** I think you might have a bit of a biased perspective, or you got quite unlucky with the fics you've checked out.

I think it might help you to filter out [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] as in sorting it with "most favorites" or "most comments" on top so you actually get the good ones.

I mean, all of these depends on the writer of course, but there are actually a lot of "realistic" perspectives on the characters. And there's an equal amount of good highlights on all the characters, and of bad perspectives.

I've been an avid HP fanfic reader for more than 10 years, and read thousands already, and I definitely have maybe seen just one fic where Molly Weasley has any skills in potions for example.

On [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] alone, there are already like ~625k fanfics. And there are a LOT of other Harry Potter focused fanfic websites. So you definitely would need that sorting option.
