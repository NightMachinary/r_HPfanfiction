I'm looking for a fic where a student finds themselves back in time and try to prevent the war from happening. It really doesn't have to be an OC, an SI is fine. I've read A Curse of Trurh before and I really liked it. Of course, it has to be well-written.


** How about a SI and an OC:

*** The premise sounds alright, and the writing is fine. However, I can't get over the religious overtones of the SI.

**** That's why I'm pretty up front about it. Religion is a major theme of the story, as I've often wondered what a world would be like where magic is very real. What does that mean for faith and historical religions? To me its fascinating but I get that it's not for everyone.

***** Just as a counterpoint, normally religious overtones are a big turnoff for me too, but I've been OK with this one so far!

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks.

*** I'm actually into the whole religious thing for that story. It adds lots of depth to the protagonist, describes his motivations, what he struggles with, and it is even better because other characters have no religion and they struggle with understanding him. It hit home for me, I'm an atheist, my brother struggles with religion (I think he's pagan now...?) And my father is very Christian. This fic felt very real to me.

** This isn't really time travel but it's about an OC who is born as Lily's sister and she tries to change everything that happens. There is a lot of focus on the romance between the OC/Regulus though.

** Linkffn(the debt of time) This one only meets some of your criteria but is well written, long and complete. Main character is Hermione and she can't actively prevent the war but does set up a few things into motion.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. [Currently Being Updated.
