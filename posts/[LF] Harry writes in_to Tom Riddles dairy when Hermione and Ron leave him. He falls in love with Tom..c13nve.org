I want to say this story is based in fourth year, both Ron and Hermione believe that Harry cheated to get his name into the tournament. I believe Harry was so desperate to talk to someone that he found Tom Riddles diary and starting writing in it.

I think Tom Riddle was doing the tasks for him or something, when Harry said he was scared. In the end Harry makes a truce with Voldemort he will stay out of the war and move away and Voldemort will make Tom real for Harry.

I think the Skytherins defended Harry sometimes too from everyone if I'm remembering right.
