I've been reading a lot of fics lately about Snape teaching occlumency, and I've been wondering how he learnt it himself. Has anyone read a fic where Snape learns occlumency and legilimency?


** my headcanon is that either a) his mother taught him, or b) in his own personal practice of trying to learn wandless magic either in a desperate bid to get around the trace, or just learning how to use it to look more powerful or something (hello robe swishes), he discovered occlumency listed as a wandless magic and was like â€˜that sounds like something I want/it will make my brain cooler'

I just see young Snape as wanting to seem as powerful and big-brained as possible to gain him some form of personal power and control, which led him to the mind arts (including leglimency/mind rape) like Riddle's somewhat similar path led him to horcruxes because he didn't want to die etc etc

** I think it was in 'The Snape Chronicles'--in that fic, the explanation for it was that Snape was a natural occlumens (much like Queenie is a natural legilimens) who began occluding as an infant. His mother was a legilimens who would regularly prod into his mind. I quite liked that explanation.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
