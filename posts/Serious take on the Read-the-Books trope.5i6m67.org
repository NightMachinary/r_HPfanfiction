There are a lot of "characters read the books" fics out there, and most of them are terrible (and short-lived). I would say the three biggest reasons for this are:

- Quoting the entire text verbatim, making the fic twice as long as the actual books (not to mention copyright issues).
- Someone interrupts *literally every sentence* just for the sake of commenting.
- No plot whatsoever. It's basically an MST3K-style riff, if you're very lucky.

Has anyone tried to write this trope in a way that avoids these problems? I'm a firm believer than any (okay maybe almost any) trope can be made to work in the right hands, but I've never seen anyone come close with this one.

I actually tried this myself, but it's just a start, and I don't know if there's anyplace I can post it without any trouble. I've covered the first three chapters of Book 1 so far. I direct quoted a little, but it's less than 10% (maybe less than 5%) of the text, with total length significantly shorter than the canon chapters. I could probably get rid of the direct quotes, because I wouldn't have to use inane circumlocutions at the sentence level that only make it ten times as confusing. People interrupt only where it's realistic to do so (which is ten times less than in most such stories), and there's an actual plot where multiple people (Umbridge, Harry, Dumbledore, etc.) try to /use/ the books for their own ends.

Any advice on what I can do with this? Or do you think it's not worth pursuing?

This has a lot of potential. As long as you properly balance between these two "stories", I could see this being really good.

Let me know when you post it!

** It is definitely worth pursuing. I have been looking for a really good fic (but not a cracky one) that utilises this trope.

I hope you go through with writing this and request you make a post about it when you do.

Edit: I think that the most interesting part of this trope isn't their reaction to the book but the fallout. It would be awesome if the character/characters reading the story tried to change something thus causing the whole timeline to change. (I think theres too little butterfly effect fics)

** This is a series called Hogwarts Reads which is a bit comment-on-every-paragraph-y but it has a non-canon Haphne subplot which is unusual for a ReadTheBooks fic:

****** Nope. The furthest I've ever seen is part way into 5th year although I reckon there are 2 reasons for this:

One - The author gets fed up of retyping novels as they get lengthier.

Two - With most of these being set in 5th year it gets narratively weird for students to read about Harry's 6th and 7th years which haven't happened yet.

Your best bet is to look for the Marauders reading in 1980s, the Order reading through them, the next gen kids reading them or some kind of tine travel book transport but none of these sub-genres interest me so I can't really help you.

Good luck and happy hunting.

P.S. These fics often get deleted for copyright so fictionhunt.com is your friend.

** I had the idea to maybe eventually write a "read-the-books" story where they don't actually read the books. I mean the characters find the books, read them off screen (off page??? whatever?) and then react to what they read and try and change the future.

** Yes! I think it's worth pursuing and I'd read it. Also, what about interactions with the fanbase or author? The fanfic way would be to have the OC self insert character fall in love with Harry/Draco/whoever, but it doesn't have to be like that. I was watching Supernatural and some key information came from a fan of the books who'd memorized everything and extrapolated from there. Or when the main characters ran into fans, they didn't think the fans were cool, but rather overly obsessed weirdos.

** I could see this done as a drama quite well. Give one or more characters a loose outline of the books before they actually take place. Details are missing however and eventually you tip the scales too far.

** Wow, surprisingly positive response. I'll probably finish off two more chapters and then try posting to FFN. I'm still kind of nervous about the 5-10% direct quotes, but there's not a lot I can do when they're actually integrated with the dialogue rather than just alternating lines of quotes and "story".

** The Hogwarts library is sentient and trades veela romance novels with an alternate universe library in return for a set of the HP books in linkao3(when in doubt, go to the library by lullabyknell). The oneshot ends when the library directs the philosopher's stone to the hands of [seventh year Lily Evans] [/spoiler].

** There was a fic called In the Past to Change the Future (FFN deleted it) and it had Hermione going back in time to share knowledge with Marauders (minus Peter), Snape, Regulus, Lily, Alice, Frank, Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Moody. It did have the text verbatim, but the reactions were well thought out and did become plot points. There was realistic conflict resolution between groups. Sometimes a character would offer more elaboration and they would discuss it in a tangent. This is what I liked the most about it. Another thing I liked was that the author started from Book 4, with Hermione summarizing 1-3.

Unfortunately the whole series got deleted in the FFN Purge while the author was on book 7.

** I love this trope and would love to read this! I've actually read one where instead of quotes, the author would say "page 3 paragraph 5" and we were supposed to have our books out in the same edition I guess and follow along.. that was definitely the most annoying fic from this trope I've read..
