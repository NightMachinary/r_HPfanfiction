** I like him as the crazy-awesome, sweet-tempered cloudcuckoolander. Always childlike and smiling and joking except when things get dire, because he's sitting so high above everyone else in station, power and intelligence that no one will berate him for it. With just a hint of sadness below for the failings of his early life, but this should be buried deep, not something he'll start rambling about the moment someone mentions Grindelwald.

*** A flicker of pain across his features at the mention of Grindelwald is how I like it. Like a phantom twist of a knife in his chest. A wince, a memory of pain and sadness, all pushed aside before it can truly register on his face.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** Canon Dumbledore. Slightly eccentric, unfailingly polite, solitary to a fault, and capable of performing immensely powerful magic when the need arises. The one piece of characterization with no canon support that I really like is that he's not the best at the day-to-day operations of Hogwarts and leans heavily on Minerva for that.

** I love the kind of Dumbledore that's a war general. He's the one who makes the tough decisions, and that sometimes involves being manipulative and morally iffy, but in the end he's understandable. It's a difficult balance to strike, and one that I'm sure I haven't done right every time I've written him.

** I'm actually not sure I've ever read a fanfic with him in it... he's my favorite character, but my interest is more analyzing his purpose in the books, reading and writing essays, etc, which is the main way I participate in the fandom. I'll read fanfics about almost everyone else though, and during long commutes my go-to thoughts are imaging different characters (usually Harry) in different scenarios. But never Dumbledore for some reason... I'm not really sure what this says about me.

** Contrite Dumbledore, who accepts that he's been a giant shithead and - instead of being an awful leader/general - starts doing things that are useful: Like teaching, alchemy, research and offering occasional pearls of wisdom. Also acceptable if he uses his status and connections in the political arena. Of course the contriteness can be skipped if it's an AU/rewrite.

Absolutely not to be confused with crocodile-tear-Dumbledore, who just apologizes profusely all the time and everyone goes "Aww poor Alby, we all know you just wanted the best".

**** I like the Dumbledore in this:

linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9824342]])

But he's basically just a better Dumbledore in every respect, who replaced the canon shithead.

The Dumbledore in [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]] by Keira Marcos also comes close. He tries really hard to do right by Harry and never repeat the mistakes of the past. Harry's experience at the Dursleys was a bit more drastic in that fic.

I just like a more whimsical and laid back Dumbledore instead of a cynical chess player. But it's hard to find that.

I think I often don't approve of stories with a sympathetic Dumbledore, because they usually focus on apologia and I sort of despise that.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** Childlike, don't put too much emphasis on the twinkling eyes but do mention it. Incredibly intelligent and good at adapting to new situations. Genuinely sad about what Harry has to go through, but still sticks to his 'greater good' philosophy throughout - shows strong willpower, which he definitely should have. /Very/ good at manipulating a situation through subtle gestures. I suggest reading up on manipulation for his dialogue; it helped me a bunch developing his personality in my head.
