these things would have had a negative effect on Harry and in the books it's just forgotten, but are there any stories were the staff and students are forced to come to terms with what they did and actually have to put effort into repairing there relationship with Harry?

Especially the Gryffindor quiddich team after the way they treated Harry in First year, in the books it's mentioned that they didn't even use his name during practice and they drove him to the point were he goes to wood and offers to leave the team.

No slash


** Pretty much any edgy indy!Harry holds that against the student body.

*** I was looking for something we're it's not Harry who starts the change in behaviour but another student resizing the way they are treating Harry is wrong.

Sort Harry is in denial and doesn't want to acknowledge it and the students being nice to him and standing by him freaks him out.

***** Sort of but nothing really comes of it. I am looking for a stories were the student who notices actually gets other students to change.

Like the weasley twins finding out from Charile about Norbert and actually working out that that was why Harry was caught out of bed and Gryffindor lost 150 points and tell the rest of the quiddich team leading to them felling guilty and actually trying to be closer to Harry.

Or after second year the students find out that Harry nearly died down in the chamber of secrets Saveing another students life after the school had spent most of the year cussing him of being heir of Slytherin.

** I remember there was one, but I'm not going to bother linking to it becayse honestly it was a pretty bad story. The entire thing was just an endless stream of "that was mean" -- "was that mean?" -- "yeah, that was mean." And pretty much all conflict and interest drained out of the story because anything that could even remotely be thought of as unfair or mean or anything but 100% supportive was weeded out from the story. Which meant there was no mystery, no suspense, no character and no interest.

******* Except that if you go into someone's post that is a request just to tell them that they have problems, you likely have bigger ones.

OP is looking for a particular plot element, but did not specify why. Making assumptions about their reasons, likely wrong assumptions if you think about OP's words (“actually have to put effort into repairing [their] relationship with Harry”), and at the same time telling them off for those assumptions is just foul.

******* By your logic, fanfictions is also not real, so it doesn't matter what the person is after. Its like condeming someone that likes to read incest or non-con dom, It shouldn't matter to anyone one else what the person looks for in a fic.

********* So...by that statement we should all forgive Umbridge's torture because reading fics that give us revenge type plots on her mean we have problems? I wish I could roll my eyes far enough into the back of my head to give your statement the respect it deserves.

Listen the point of reading anything ever is to feel exactly what the writer wants you to feel. Feeling like wanting revenge on behalf of friends is normal in real life. When reading we often feel very close to the characters we read about. Hence the reason for wanting to read about the particular genere the OP was wanting to read.

OP, I think you would like Harry Potter and the Daft Morons. It has Harry instituting the change in fourth year but it's really well written.
