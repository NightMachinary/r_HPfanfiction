Probably every HP fan at least once wished Hogwarts to be real and imagined getting a letter. For fandom Hogwarts is something amazing and lovable. “Hogwarts -- is my home” and all that. But nothing is ideal. Imagine you're attending Hogwarts, what do you think you would have disliked about the experience?

I know I would have hated dorms. I have trouble sharing a room with my closest friends, I can't imagine sharing a room with other people every day for seven years. I would have trouble with curfew because I never ever had one. I also would have struggled without the ability to plug in my headphones and listen to music.

So what do you thing would be not-so-magical about Hogwarts for you?


** The first thing that comes to mind is the lack of maps - Harry and Ron are late to their /very first/ class because they get lost and McGonagall gets salty about it - it's like, they have been in the castle for less than 24 hours how did /everyone/ not get lost?

*** This would bother me too, and it's why I can't buy the idea that the Marauder's Map is the only such artefact in existence.

Students like yourself, and like me, would invariably think "huh, a map would be very handy, /let's make one/".

I think the Marauders would have been following a well-trodden path in creating that map, adding their own personal touches and flair, and there would be some excellent variants throughout time.

** *The dorms*

- I totally would hate to share a room with people who are not my sisters and I already hate sharing my room as it is. I've done it pretty much all my life. Though, since we'd be forced to share, I'm pretty glad that the beds are canopy beds where you can just draw the curtains and you can probably easily learn a silencing ward spell or something to keep the noise out.

*No maps*

- I find it completely ridiculous that such a large castle doesn't hand out maps for first years. My high school wasn't that large but I still used a map, if only to trace out my route to my classes for the first few weeks. I also find it stupid that the teachers or any of the other students didn't seem keen on helping first years out with where to go. Honestly, do they expect everyone to just know where to go? From what I've seen, there aren't any signs or anything pointing out which class is which. How would you know one class from another if you're new?

*The stairs*

- Particularly the moving kind. Not only am I lazy, but I'm basically terrified of escalators. Why the /hell/ are there moving staircases in Hogwarts? Especially if they can make you late to class?

And before anyone points out that this is too mature of an analysis, here in Germany you get Hitler and the Holocaust shoved down your throat every other year in history class, starting in Grade 6 (and before that on TV and in newspapers). And for me, that meant at age 11.

** OMG I can't pick just one! My first thought was all the stairs, but I did have that at my boarding school. My second thought was the tricky navigation: moving staircases, trick stairs, doors that are only there on alternate Tuesdays, etc.

Third thought was the shoddy teaching, and I think that is the winner. Between the teachers who are bad at their subject (Binns, Trelawney, Lockheart), bad at teaching (Quirrell, Snape), oblivious to bullying (McGonagall, Flitwick) and those who think the school is some sort of social experiment (Dumbledore, Umbridge), the fact that there's no tuition is not enough to compensate.

Fourth thought was the inconcistency of the house point system, that actually fosters enmity and sabotage rather than cooperation and camaraderie, but I think the shoddy faculty still wins.

In my high school the English classrooms were on the second floor of an extension that could only be accessed from the ground floor. Going from the second floor of the main building, down to the ground floor, across to the extension, just to go back up 2 sets of stairs to the second floor was awful.

*** Bit late to the party here.

The lack of safety concerns is understandable when you look at dispersing culture as a whole.

Deadly smoke and potion fumes in a concentrated dungeon? Clear the air with a spell or bubblehead charm if needed.

Broken several bones in your body? Disappear the bones and drink some skelegrow, good as new the next morning.

Serious flesh woundwith severe bleeding? Vulnera Sanentur fixes that right up follow it with a Blood Replenishing potion and you're good to go.

Basically, why care about safety so much when there's an easy fix for most problems.

As a student or even as a teacher, all those stairs would leave me considering leaving after the first month.

** *Homework* I barely did homework, so the actual enforcement in HP wouldn't have gone down well. Nor would quills, for that matter.

*Teaching Style* Hogwarts just picks whoever for their staff and hopes they can teach. I was never a 'listen to lecture' child. I enjoyed them and reading the texts - but it turns out I actually learnt best doing activities and beyond practising spellwork, we never see thing. Like, you never see them re-enacting goblin wars from desk tops with paper swords and scrunched up canons. Nor inducting other staff to tear the heads of teddies for the Battle of Normandy. Not even the more placid group projects, drawing from instruction on their classmates backs or 'speed dating', etc.

*Lack of supervision* I was both incredibly private and one of those kids that clung to adults. I reckon I would have wandered the hallways but found it very difficult to be policed only be prefects/head girl/boys. I would have loved Percy Weasley in my early years, lol. I would (did) happily attend informal detentions for a bit of praise at the end.

*The Library* The librarian in my school library was lovely, if strict. Well, there were a couple but the other was quiet. She'd always help you with your German homework. Admittedly, she did drive out some of the noisier pupils. I only really used it for hobby reading but the idea of dusty old tomes would have put me off. I couldn't have got through old, boring style books. Or, the lack of internet.

**** These are a small selection of the things that went on in my history classes, lol. The history teachers had a cupboard of teddies. It was one of our early lessons in Year 7, then later I was volunteering learning support in my free periods and got to see it all over again in Year 12.

I know about the cupboard because my form room was in the same room, form being a school-wide event three times a day (two for 6th form - years 12 and 13). We found a toy that would play a long track of music on some sort of delay and pulled off a long stint of hiding it for our tutor to find. On the earlier attempts we even managed to pretend that he was the only one who could hear it.

All our subjects were expected to have interactive lessons so we were still doing fun classes aged 18. In Geography, we had group projects involving making landscapes (cross-sections) from cakes sliced, fitted together and decorated.

We also had Year Group eco responsibilities which for luckier years involved tending to the sheep and chickens despite being in a city. Unfortunately, mine was not involved but my group of friends carefully positioned our lunch spot close enough to hold and stroke them. Every chicken was a different breed and certain chickens were escape artists - so a number of classes were called off for chicken herding/capture.

After a few years, the school finally built a new enclosure.

** I don't think I would have want to go, really as a child, if I thought it had been a real possibility.

First : I wouldn't hate not seeing my family, at least on week-ends. I was a very vulnerable 11 years old, that needed her mom support and affection a lot. While I could have deal with not seeing her all week, I couldn't have make it from September to Christmas, especially while trying to adapt to a whole new worlds. Letters by lot would not have been enough.

(With all the magical transportation that exists, especially the floo, I still don't understand why Hogwarts students couldn't go home on week-ends, or even had to be boarded. What about kids that live in Hogsmead? Must sucks to live a few minutes from your parents and not being able to see them).

Second : sharing a room with 5 other students, maybe more? Big NO. I already had issues sharing a room with my own sister.

The staircase situation would have frustrate me to no end. I do have a good sense of direction, and having that thrown out for no particular reason and wasting time for no reason would have annoys me.

Eg, I remember when Harry struggled with the summoning spell, the solution wasn't to figure out theoretical aspects more - it was for him to practice it as much as possible until it clicked. Or with transfiguration, basically every class seems to be practicing some transifuration and not the theory behind it - though IIRC there is some mention of notes being taken here or there.

To me, what's shown 'on screen', so to speak, is that the students are continuously learning by brute forcing the magic and practicing it. That's the impression that Hogwarts leaves to me - maybe that's because that's how Harry learns, maybe it's because JKR didn't want to go into the minutia of it, etc. I think it's perfectly reasonable to come out of it with a different perspective/view on it, like you are - and perhaps if it were written with someone like Hermione as the main POV character, it might turn out to be the case.

No matter what we nerds wish, we don't see a single class scene in the books that isn't directly important to the plot or teaches us something about the characters. Frankly, most of the classes seem to be taught in a similar way to a course I took in grad school. Most of the learning is spent out of class, while classroom is time for practical examinations and some in-depth lecturing. Very old-school pedagogical methodology.

/Explain how to perform a levitation charm/

"Say the incantation and swish and flick your wand."

How are you going to get a two-foot essay out of that???

The essays /must/ be closer to "What limitation does the mass of an object place on the levitation charm? What methods could overcome this?"

I just think JKR left out the theory because a) it would be very poor reading for most children and b) it would require giving serious thought to the mechanics of magic and maintaining internal consistency was not her strong point.

  They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements.
#+end_quote

Practicing wand movements is given pride of place there.

Homework doesn't always imply essays, either - it could be a set of questions to answer about the practicalities of magic, limitations, etc. But those don't necessarily imply actual theory, either.

Eg, "What is the limitation on mass for the levitation charm?" (Assuming there is a limit) is not theory. Explaining /why/ there's a limit would be. Or, writing about how to do it isn't theory - explaining why the wand movements are what they are would be.

None of the references to essays in the books strike me as anything deep, theory wise.

Edit - and to be clear, that's all to explain why Hogwarts doesn't seem theory heavy to me. I can easily understand why someone would look at the examples and come away with the opposite impression

There are also no classes on wizarding literature, art, music, anything cultural at all. (How does the school even make sure that the students are adequately literate, given that the standard for purebloods seems to be homeschooling until age 11 with no "Three R" classes after that?)

Also, I would have really disliked Potions as a subject, now that I think about it. The theory is interesting, but the methods for teaching it are so sink-or-swim that it just seems stressful.

*** My primary school had a points based system similar to Hogwarts, though we had winners every week. Nothing shamed me so much as losing points for the house as the teacher would tell you how many tallies we had lost/gained and who caused it.The school-wide shields were hung onto the walls by nails/hooks and each week we would see the change in rank. I was also infuriated that other pupils got more points for the same behaviour as me.

(Ok, my secondary school did too but it was weirdly segmented so the house points mainly affected sports and a few extra-curricula things/challenges. It was done on a year group basis depending on the number of forms. Ours had two forms per house, plus one that got double points.

For example we had a separate award type for attendance, my form was often hovering in the top three although we rarely actually won. A known truant on the brink of exclusion was moved into my form as they hated their form and tutor. It was hoped our known temperament would encourage them to attend. Well, there was immediate fury and grudeholding - though we were polite for the two occasions the boy showed up to form. We never came near top for attendance again and no amount of petitioning to have him removed on account of the fact he wasn't there anyway worked.)

So, yeah - it did inspire us to work harder but it was also shit in many ways. These days psychologists are pushing for schools to drop rewards and punishments ('consequences') entirely. The absence of a reward, after all, is a punishment. (In strictly laymen terms and not getting into the whole positive/negative thing.)

5. The lack of safety in general. They can just hex each other and teachers just take points and give a detention. If I punched people in school a few times, I would probably get suspended or something.

6. It's just so weird that your class is so small and basically just the same people every year. (that's probably boarding school in general though) If you don't like your dormmates, you probably will never have a good friend, since students in different houses don't really talk.
