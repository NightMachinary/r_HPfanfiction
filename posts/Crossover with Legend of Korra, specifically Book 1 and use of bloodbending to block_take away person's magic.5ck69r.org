I got to thinking about how most witches and wizards don't seem to truly appreciate magic in most stories I have read. They don't love magic, they aren't in awe of it, they don't have enthusiasm like certain muggleborns, and they can't imagine living without magic.

So what if there was a villain(or random mythological event) that could take away their magic, either permanently or simple until it was unblocked.

Enter Amon, villain of Legend of Korra season 1. He was a highly talented waterbender and was taught bloodbending by his father, Yakone, a master bloodbender, likely the most powerful in the Avatar universe. Bloodbending could be used to block chi pathways in a human, effectively taking away their ability to bend the classic elements (for those unfamiliar, fire earth water air, and their subskills: lightning, metal, lava, blood, and flight)

Amon himself doesn't have to appear in the Harry Potter universe, but if someone had the same kind of power appeared, they would fuck shit up. Voldemort with the ability to strip others of their magic? Absolutely terrifying. On top of the usual Death Eater activities you would experience (extensive torture, rape, imperiused, etc) there is a very real possibility of your precious magic being taken away and you being allowed to live.

I don't know if any story like this exists, but at least the idea is now out there. If you do decide to write something like this, keep me updated!


** Seems interesting. I'm going to be taking a short break from my WIP after a few weeks, and this seems like an intriguing idea to work on.

  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.
