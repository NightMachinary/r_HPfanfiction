** I hate how any girl that likes Madame Puddifoot's is automatically presented as being a shallow bitch.

Is it just me that thinks a visiting a magical tea shop actually sounds kind of cool?

Just because Harry doesn't like something, it doesn't make it automatically bad.

I also don't like Cho bashing.

Edit. I also hate it when you find out a important person from history was secretly a wizard, and a character says something along the lines of "You don't really think a muggle did that!?".

I know it's stupid, but I just find it a little insulting, like they're saying muggles aren't capable of doing anything without magic.

*** honestly, you can not say Dumbledore was not an advocate of Child Abuse. Harry asked Dumbledore many times not to go back to that house and while yes Dumbledore was a great man, he always replied with a you must. So by definition it makes him an advocate of child abuse. Dumbledore placed Harry in a home that abused him. period. and forced him to return there every year. Period. And there are signs in the books that He was physically abused as well as neglected. So while I agree with you as a whole, when I think of Dumbledore, I think of a man who made the best decisions he could, and one of his terrible ones was advocating the abuse of Harry Potter.

**** The thing is, I view that whole thing from Dumbledore as an exercise in pragmatism. If Harry lives there he is protected from Voldemort by powerful old magic. If Harry doesn't live there he isn't. Dumbledore has reasons to believe Voldemort is still an agent playing the game, and Harry is the most important piece in that game.

Dumbledore clearly cared about Harry. He tried to design the situation so that even after he died Harry could win against Voldemort and have a chance at survival afterwards. Dumbledore isn't a saint, but he shouldn't be demonised either. He's the man with the knowledge to end the war and save thousands of people, wizards and muggles alike, from the tyranny of Voldemort.

Sometimes you have to make difficult choices, and sometimes the ethical choice under one ethical framework is an unethical choice under another. Dumbledore and his motivations are fairly complex. From his perspective he made a number of 'correct' choices which nevertheless weren't nice ones.

** I don't like it when authors make Luna right.

Luna's thing is that even in a world of magic she believes in crackpot conspiracy theories and people either pity her because she's incapable of normal social interaction or bully her for the same reason. At best she's been raised in a strange home environment and isn't good at discerning fact from her father's nutcase theories, and at worst she's either schizophrenic or severely autistic.

And then in fanfiction suddenly nargles are real and Hermione is an idiot for not taking Luna's word for it and having faith in their existence. The fey arrive and Luna laughs good-naturedly at Harry for being so narrow-minded as to not believe as she does.

Well I'm sorry, but until I see a gritty action thriller about Luna single-handedly fighting down an army of heliopaths against overwhelming odds, with only her wand and her wits standing between her and fiery doom, this trope will be a deal-breaker.

I think this is really an issue of semantics.

To me, dark and light are synonymous for good and evil. For whatever reason we generally describe magic as black/white or dark/light rather than good/evil, but there's no real distinction.

To you, as I understand it, dark/light applies to /actions/ and good/evil applies to /intentions/. Therefore someone performing 'dark' actions with good intent is not evil, if the ends truly justify the means.

I think /Grey!Harry/ is a more appropriate label if Harry has good intentions (but questionable methods) than /Dark!Harry/ - it makes that semantic ambiguity less of an issue. I go into a Dark!Harry fic expecting a character who is driven by fear and hate, not some sort of James Bond with a license to AK.

Because he's loved her for so long, even though he never admitted it to her, she /must/ love him, and if she doesn't? It's potions. It's a good thing she was waiting to have sex until marriage though, otherwise Harry wouldn't have been able to be with her.

It's such a stupid trope. It's why linkffn(8101469) is one of my favourites, because it shows Hermione isn't perfect and it has nothing to do with her being Potioned.

** - When Ron is portrayed as a bad parent who lets his kids get away with murder behind Hermione's back. Hermione and Ron did a perfectly good job co-parenting Harry, there's no reason why they wouldn't be able to meet in the middle with their own kids.

- When Lily Evans is portrayed as flawless and Petunia Evans is literally the worst person ever and just irrationally spewing random stuff at a saint-like Lily. It's hard to fault fanon because we never saw Lily knocked off her pedestal like James/Sirius/Remus were. But still, if you're expanding a character's story, they need to be a real flawed human being.

- When Harry and his family live in Grimmauld Place. First of all, not canon as per the epilogue. But second of all, hard to imagine him wanting to live there. He was mildly repulsed by everything associated with the house in HBP.

- Fake moral ambiguity. Basically, when a darkish Harry (i.e., Slythern!Harry) does something that seems morally grey or questionable, but the author bends over backwards and warps canon to make sure Harry was morally justified in terms of canon morality. Like a pureblood-raised!Harry is rude to Hermione because of her blood status, but it's okay because she's 10x more annoying than she is in canon.

- Bashing. Of any character. Doesn't matter if I like or dislike them, it's lazy and terrible. I hate Rita Skeeter as much as the next person, but I was really annoyed when a fic had her forcing her way into a funeral a few days after the battle in human form and aligns herself with Umbridge.

*** This is late, but Lily got plenty of pedestal-knocking in her time too. Snape's memories disparage her as much as they flatter her - from the way she'd come to a conclusion and completely talked over his attempt at an apology (somewhat justified given the situation, but with a little imagination it's something that could cause major problems) to the way she pushed blame on him right from childhood (they both read Dumbledore's letter to Petunia, but when Petunia found out Lily got angry at Severus for some reason).

So from those two instances alone we have a girl who doesn't like owning up when she knows she's wrong and who doesn't like listening to other opinions when she's convinced she's right. See, flaws!

**** There are definitely some hints toward potential flaws in canon, but this doesn't always come across in fanon. I do sort of wish we had seen more of a come-down for Lily. James had the Snape's worst memory scene, Sirius had Kreacher/OP in general, and Remus had the part in DH where he leaves Tonks. But Lily didn't get one of those humanizing moments, which always made me a little sad.

With regards to the stuff pointed above, I don't know if I agree with you about her treatment of Snape and what it might mean. To be honest, I think Lily had given him so many chances and anything he said wouldn't speak as loudly as his actions. By the time they end the friendship, she already knows that he's planning on becoming a death eater and she calls him out for using the word "mudblood" about people that aren't her (though I'm sure he didn't do it in front of her). Imagine if Lily had been black and Severus had been an aspiring white supremacist who used the n-word where she wasn't around. So I think you could actually argue that she let the friendship go on for longer than it should have.

So I would actually argue that a potential flaw is that she's got a little bit of a saving people thing. She thought that if she just tried hard enough, she could save Severus.

I get the impression that the reason she's upset at Severus in the platform scene is because she feels like Severus is messing up her relationship with Petunia. And even though it's not so much Severus as the entire magical world, Severus is still the stand-in for the magical world at this point. Severus is the one who told her about magic, and the two of them formed a friendship apart from Petunia where they mostly talked about magic. Of course, the more time Lily spent with Severus, the more Petunia felt sidelined. Plus, she already realizes that Severus doesn't like Petunia (he's not very subtle) and has made zero effort to get along with her, so that doesn't help her feeling that Severus is partially to blame for her suddenly rocky relationship with Petunia. Also Petunia is her /sister/, so she would be absolutely justified in choosing Petunia over Severus at age 11.

I have a hard time believing that pushing blame on Snape was a regular thing that she did, because she tells him she's made excuses for him for years.

***** It's sad because the only people who have day-to-day memories of her to share are understandably biased. The rest of them like you said have at least one living character with reason to dislike them and thus provide a balanced view. The whole mythos that built up around her sacrifice probably didn't help either - you can disparage Harry's father, but how do you tell him the oh-so-powerful motherly love his very survival depends on didn't come from a perfect angel?

As to Lily's flaws, I pointed out things which were only justified by context and could be extrapolated into pitfalls. Severus was wrong, yes, and she had no obligation to continue the friendship, but a truly "perfect" human being would have let him actually say his piece. She didn't, and while she might have made the right judgment call she made it without assessing all possible information.

In fact, to illustrate my point, here's their "conversation" (because really she was doing all the talking:

#+begin_quote
  It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.

  “I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.”

  “I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just -- ”

  “Slipped out?” There was no pity in Lily's voice. “It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends -- you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?”

  He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.

  “I can't pretend anymore. You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine.”

  “No -- listen, I didn't mean -- ”

  “ -- to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?”

  He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole...
#+end_quote

Note that we /never hear what Severus was actually trying to say/, only what Lily thinks he wanted to say. "I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just - "...what? Yes, "slipped out" is the most logical progression, but then she proceeds to state her own case and point out that he doesn't deny it /without actually giving him room to speak/ as she continues talking. He opens his mouth, but closes it without speaking - and based on Lily's cues we immediately take this as an admission of guilt where he could as well be shocked, confused, taken aback or struck with sudden insight. She says they've chosen different paths, and he replies with "...listen, I didn't mean - " /and she immediately puts words in his mouth/. Again, she levels an accusation ("you call everyone of my birth Mudblood") and then /turns and leaves/ while he is struggling on the verge of speech (something he'd been shown to do whenever he was emotional).

Now, I'm not saying she interpreted their conversation incorrectly - those are most likely the exact things Severus was going to say/defend - but the fact is that she said them for him. It's not difficult to surmise that she often uses that tactic in other arguments and debates. It's even easier to devise a situation where it backfires on her because she's wrong about her opponent. In fact, off the top of my head, take the period where Sirius believed Remus was the spy. It seems for a while the Potters distanced themselves from him - he wasn't in on the plan to protect them and it's very subtle but he's the only Marauder not referenced in Lily's letter. I can very, very easily imagine a "conversation" between Lily and Remus much like the one she had with Severus, where she spouts her conclusions (from talking to Sirius) at him and then walks away perhaps accompanied by Peter. Boom: fatal flaw and dramatic irony with one stone. For the trifecta, imply that Remus knows something that would implicate Peter if Lily knew and...and...okay now I have to write this fanfic...

Yes, she also has a bit of a saving people thing - can again be used for dramatic irony in her interactions with Peter. And again I'm not saying she regularly pushed blame on Snape in particular; in fact, you said in a nutshell what I was trying to get at. /She makes excuses/. For herself when she's more or less as guilty as Severus, for Severus when he's more or less as guilty as his peers. It's a somewhat narcissistic trait, and very common - /I/ didn't do anything wrong, he's /my/ friend so of course he's not like the rest, he hasn't done anything to /me/ and so it's fine if I keep talking to him.

This makes so much sense, I really like this.

I see your perspective about her talking over Severus as well. I'm not sure if there's really anything that Snape would say that would excuse him at that point, to me a big part of that interaction is her realization that Snape's actions matter more than his words.

In the first book Harry is described as small for his age and then we never get a clear update about his height. When he's in Snape's memories Harry notices that he is within an inch of James' height and in the last book he is described as having almost reached his father's height. And James is described as tall a couple of times (in the Mirror of Erised for example).

However, as you mention, there are a lot of characters that are described as taller than Harry. So, ¯\/(ツ)//¯

I've been waiting for story that explains why wizards/witches don't just glamour their robes so they can appear normal among muggles.

** I hate hate hate hate long disclaimers at the top of every chapter! Yes, I know a random fanfic author doesn't own Harry Potter. If you feel the need to remind me every chapter, keep it to one line, at absolute most. "Disclaimer: don't own HP" is good enough. When you get clever/cute, and write a 150 word disclaimer at the top of each chapter, I'm not marvelling at how original you are. I'm just irritated at the intrusion into the story every chapter, and annoyed that you haven't even made the disclaimer identical from chapter to chapter, so I can quickly skip over it. Oh, and vaguely suspicious that you're using the disclaimer as filler to drive up your word-count. As a random example, Bobmin356 is an absolutely terrible offender for this. But that's just off the top of my head; I could come up with many, many, many others. I assume every single other reader loves these creative, long, and intrusive takes on the disclaimers, because authors insist on writing them, when they could put that extra effort into the actual story. So I guess this qualifies as something unique to me.

** - Dumbledore bashing is the absolute worst, done by writers who either do not understand the subtle nuances of his character /at all/ or those who use it as a blatant plot device. Both cases are a sure sign of bad writing.

- "Meek Harry" is the second worst. Often used by writers who seemingly have not read canon (canon Harry was quite capable, physically and emotionally, and stood up for himself), writers whose perspective has already been warped by "meek Harry" fics, or writers who want to do Dumbledore bashing. I often end up going to DLP to wash my eyes out after seeing this, and has heavily biased me towards DLP's recs.

- "Harry with superpowers" also gets on my nerves. Not necessarily bad writing, but I think any story (and contrary to intuition, even AU ones) are more interesting if Harry has similar abilities to those we know in canon. Making him the heir of some ancient line and/or making him "see" magic with Mage Sight... stop pls!

- "Love potion Ginny" killed Ginny as a character for me, which is kinda sad. Even fics that have her as a decent character make me "meh". Isolating headcanon from canon is surprisingly difficult.

- Love massively AU stories (eg. linkffn(Sword of the Hero; Wastelands of Time; The Skitterleap; The Denarian Renegade)). Really a breath of fresh air.

- Love crazy and fresh ideas like linkffn(Trial by Troll).

- Occasionally love stories where Harry is skirting the line between sanity and madness.

*** I can't stand meek Harry. I stopped reading a fic today because every other paragraph Harry needed a hug or he was gonna cry. It was horrible. I can understand that Harry has a few issues to get over but people take it to an extreme that just ruins the fic.

** I'm puzzled by the fact that EVERY fic makes harry smarter. On one level I understand. Pretty much any change you make to the story is going to have an effect, and it's hard to imagine a change that makes harry worse at magic. And fanfic writers are readers, so it's natural that they want a reader as a hero, right? But it's just stunning how often something unrelated --like harry getting lost in the woods after his second year--leads to harry discovering the underlying rules ofagic and unraveling the secrets of the universe. Blows my mind.

** Biggest one that I dislike is Harry getting all these inheritances such as Hogwarts' Founders and whatnot, that was hidden from him by Albus. It's one thing to investigate why Albus has his key and apparent control, but to be this huge ass villain is a bit much. Albus was manipulative and he played his cards waaaaaay to close to the chest. Also with the inheritances, Harry becomes this political powerhouse by age 12 and has power to sack Hogwarts staff, mostly Snape.

Speaking of Snape, there was this one series that was good until the author doubled back on the progress with the interaction between Harry and Snape (can't remember the first story but the second is Hermione's Booknook). Though that was one problem I had, the other was that Harry was learning more ON HIS OWN than in school. Plus, how everyone is ok with it or jealous and then, BLAM! Starts his own school, at which point I stopped reading, so much potential wasted.

Then there are the stories that grab you and you are just salivating for more that never comes, story left incomplete and you are devastated (one Sev/Lily story I loved did this, it was great, dealing with a what if that was pausible. Had some good OCs too.)

** When Ron is portrayed as a boor who only finds bullying Hermione funny, when Hermione is overly-bossy and humourless, and when Harry is a melodramatic wangst machine who only complains about 'muh prophecy'. The trio in canon are pretty hilarious snark machines, so for the love of all that is good and holy, don't leave that out of your fic.

** Not necessarily unique, but I was just reminded of this in another thread. I hate time travel stories where nothing from canon changes. I just don't see the point of "We must keep the timeline the same!" retreads.

** I dislike chapters dedicated to a shopping trip in Diagon Alley buying all sorts of things that the author never uses or mentions again. It ends up feeling like the author wanted to show off his or her creativity instead of having a plot.

I also dislike the use of Time Turners for training. It's a fun idea in theory but the fandom took it and overused it so much that I can't help but cringe when I read any mention of them.

** I absolutely love the idea of the wizarding world having all sorts of highly formal traditions, like rules about marriage and courtship and such.

On the flip side, it bugs me when it's basically the real world, but with magic. Seems pretty unlikely with how isolated they keep themselves.

Oh! And as a big fan of Snarry, I'd be super happy if I never again read some variation on the theme of the "I am not a kind man" speech from Snape.

** I hate the Sorting.

Time travel and AU "redo" fics are my standard fare, and I'm game for another escape from the Dursleys followed by a shopping trip in Diagon Alley.

But I just can't go through the Sorting again and again, especially if it's a fic that covers multiple years at Hogwarts. Really, another song about how the houses are different but should all get along? More names in all caps? No thanks.

I just scroll through it all now and hope nothing really important happens. It's not like I don't get why authors feel they need to include the scene, but I'm just exhausted by them. Too formulaic, too many random names that I wonder if I need to care about, and as someone who dabbles in songwriting, the Hat's songs are uniformly terrible as songs.

** I absolutely detest how newspapers are presented in fanfiction.

*Harry Potter Arrives at Hogwarts!*

Insert actual newspaper story here

*For more information on Harry Potter, turn to page 3*

*For information on what Hogwarts is, turn to page 4*

*For information on other famous people that went to Hogwarts, turn to page 5*

I have never known a single newspaper to do this. Especially when the articles listed on on what is obviously common knowledge in the wizarding world. Just don't put more articles, it's simple!

** In an AU where Harry is absent from Hogwarts or sorted out of Gryffindor, but where Hermione still ends up attacked by a troll (putting aside that without Harry around, it would almost certainly not happen in the first place), she shows up in the story months or years later limping, crippled, etc.. That, of course, makes no sense whatsoever, since Harry has all the bones in his arm vanished and then regrown overnight in CoS. Pretty much all nonfatal injuries not inflicted by Dark Magic are something from which wizards and witches make a full recovery. There is /no/ in-story (Watsonian) reason why she would be suffering their lingering effects weeks, to say nothing of years, later.

I will not speculate what out-of-story (Doylist) reasons or motivations writers have in writing her like that.
