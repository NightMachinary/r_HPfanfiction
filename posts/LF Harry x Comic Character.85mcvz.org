** Harry and Harley by Rihaan. It is an in progress story where an overpower Harry gets transported to the DC universe and ends up meeting Harley and Ivy and going on a crime spree together. It has been really interesting and they have recently brought Death from Neil Gaiman's Sandman into things, although only as a short reference for now. There is smut, but the story is good as well, in my opinion.

  As he stared into the eyes of a grinning, insane, albeit very attractive jester, hoisting a comically intimidating mallet across her shoulders, he realized that he wasn't in the Department of Mysteries, or London, anymore. But he didn't care. Harry checks into the madhouse, and makes himself at home. Harry/Multi, AU, Powerful!Harry/Hermione.

** What do you mean by comic character? Comic as in comedic, or comic as in from a comic-book series?
