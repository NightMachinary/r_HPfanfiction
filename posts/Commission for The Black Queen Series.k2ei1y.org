Hi, all! I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing a few commissioned drawings based on the characters from The Black Queen series by Silently Watches. If you are interested, please DM me with an example of your art style, and we can discuss further details of the project. Thank you!


** Not an artist, but I would recommend [[/r/starvingartists][r/starvingartists]] for art commissions.

** Not an artist really but just wanted to say this is one of my favorite series. There's a lot of components of it people adamantly dislike, understandably so with a few parts, but all together it works for me. I just recently finished re-reading the series which I've done a couple times since the forth story was finally complete.
