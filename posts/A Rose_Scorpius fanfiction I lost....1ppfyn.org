I'm looking for a Rose/Scorpius fanfiction, romantic and with sexual scenes and such. It starts in their.. Sixth or seventh year? Not sure about that. I remember thm being on a quiddich match together, I remember that both of them wants to be aurors but Scorpius gets rejected. Both of them are top dtudents.

I believe the story was finished, anyhow it was really long. If you could help me, I'd be so grateful. If you need more clues, tell me! Thanks!
