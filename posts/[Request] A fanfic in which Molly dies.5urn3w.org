Hi Everyone,

I haven't read a lot of fanfics, but around the time book seven came out I read two really great fanfics. There was one in particular that had Harry having flashes of Voldemort going around and killing random mothers, and there was nothing he could do. One night he had a dream where Voldemort went to the burrow and killed Molly, and when they arrived she was dead. There was a funeral scene and everything.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about?

Thanks.

** Hmm, I don't know about the killing random mothers bit, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Enemy Within) or maybe its sequel, Harry has a vision of Voldemort killing Molly. Also had a funeral scene. Hope that helps.

  In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry's mental link to Voldemort is stronger than ever. Can Snape teach him to control the nightmarish visions? And is their connection the key to ending Voldemort's reign?
