In other words a fic where Snape dosent suddenly become so easy going and nice to Harry. There needs to be hurt/comfort and drama. Snape needs to be a nasty git who slowly changes towards something more tolerable. Slowly.

** My favorite fic of this type is [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/gatewaygirl/BM.html][Blood Magic]]. Snape isn't as nasty as he is in In Blood Only, but he's pretty closed off at first. So, more of a snarky grump than cruel. Gateway Girl /nails/ Sassy Harry, which is probably my favorite part. Snape and Harry share a particularly morbid sense of humor in it. That said, it is an older fic, and was written partly before HBP. It also uses some things that have become cliche since then.

** "Realistic Snape is Harry's Father" is an oxymoron. Snape isn't Harry's father. James is. That is an indisputable fact.

Since I consider the genre absurd, I can only point you towards a parody of it:

**** Don't be ridiculous. There is an obvious difference between a fantasy fiction and completely disregarding a fact that forms the entire basis of the books with extremely flimsy justifications. There are things that are absurd even in a fantasy setting: MPreg will be one. 20 inch penises are another. And yes, changing the parentage of the protagonist counts as absurd as well. Stories needs to makes sense in whatever setting they're set in: and this does /not/ make sense.

***** Of course it makes sense. You can't possibly be so naive as to think that it's impossible that Lily could have had some sort of romantic relationship that led to Snape being Harry's father. There are plenty of different variations of events that could lead to that happening. It's fantasy fiction, more it's fanfiction of fantasy fiction, any event can be changed and manipulated given a reasonable justification. The /only/ problem with Snape as Harry's father is that he would be genetically different, but that can be excused between it being fantasy and the artistic license of the author of the fanfiction to mnipulate the world slightly. There's a massive difference between mpreg and literally doing what fanfiction is meant to do.

****** Blatant retcon-ing of an obvious fact does /not/ make for a good premise. You can also put in contrived explanations to make Dumbledore evil, but that is a stupid premise because just /isn't/ evil, and going out of your way to show how every action is proof of his evil-ness is not good writing. Same for evil Weasleys tripe, where Molly asking her children about the railway platform is supposed proof of a conspiracy to control Harry's life. Same for those stories that make out Voldemort to be a good person. General writing maxim: if a premise is so at odds with canon that it will require a load of justification and suspension of disbelief, then the premise sucks.

Even if you do find all required explanations to show that Snape is Harry's father, it still isn't a good premise, because it would require loads of exposition and explanations and retcon-ing to set up. If a writer is trying very hard to justify something to the reader, they've already failed. Good writing doesn't need to justify things to the reader, because everything already feels right.

TL;DR: "Snape as Harry's Father" is an objectively bad premise.

******* Are you seriously trying to say that Snape being Harry's father is as ridiculous as Dumbledore being evil? Snape being Harry's father is completely possible. He and Lily were best friends for years. It's not difficult to imagine a scenario in which they had a brief affair or in which Snape simply never went quite as far down the dark path and they actually ended up together. Most fanfiction deals with alternative pairings, it's not a difficult concept.

Evil Dumbledore is not only completely contrary to canon, which is not inherently negative whatever you believe, but it's completely irrational. Unlike Snape being Harry's father, you /cannot/ logically and realistically make Dumbledore truly evil without completely overhauling his history and character. The same is true for making Voldemort good.

****** Whether it makes sense or not, it is sort of silly. Changing Harry's parentage, blood status (likewise his parents' blood status) etc. means that it's no longer Harry - just an OC with his name. Considering how many fics manage to do that without changing Harry's genetics, it does seem like overkill to many.

That being said, fair play to OP searching outside of the romanticised lens of fanon Snape.

- So many new locations for no reason? No longer Harry Potter's world, so I'm not interested.

********* And let's face it, /all/ fanfic is "sort of silly." We're playing with fictional characters set in a magical universe, invented by a professional writer, and we're dreaming up new adventures and comforting/smutty/AU versions of their lives. The reasons for writing fanfic vary from wish-fulfillment to creative excitement to the desire for positive feedback, and on and on. We're not all here for the same thing. The ability to multiply variations on a theme, to explore the characters and the world in endless fascinating combinations, is part of what makes fanfic so delightful (and sometimes maddening).

I'm in the camp of believing the idea should be judged by its execution. If the author can persuade me and the story casts a spell, I'm not going to dissect it in search of logical fallacies. If I held all stories to that level of infallibility, the HP series itself would be lying in shreds at my feet. But everyone has different lines drawn for suspension of disbelief. Some people stop short with, "Would/did it happen? No," and they won't be pushed over that line even by the most brilliant example or cleverest refutation of that "no." Others prefer, "What if?" IMO, "what if" is the main reason Potter fanfic is such a vast, robust, astonishing, and irresistible realm of AUs, narrative side alleys, shifting landscapes, character studies, magical second-guessing, and porny self-indulgence. There's a bit of everything here to accommodate different tastes.

"Snape is Harry's father" is an intriguing idea, and it resonates with a lot of the tensions and issues in canon. Snape and Harry's crackling hostility and the history behind it make for one of the more interesting 'mysteries' and character arcs in the series. It would certainly throw a spanner in the works and challenge Snape's preconceptions of Harry. And it would wrongfoot Snape even more; his Potter loathing aside, he's one of the least suitable candidates for father figure ever.

Evil Dumbledore, hmm... I've written a version of Dumbledore that's unsympathetic to his manipulations and his behavior toward Snape, partly because I /do/ have problems with Dumbledore's flaws and decisions, and partly as a thought experiment. Thought experiments, or stories borne of conflicting feelings or the desire to pursue one aspect to its extremes, are legitimate sources of fiction. They don't get to supplant the obvious intent of canon, but they can jump off from the cracks and inconsistencies in characterization to explore a different point of view.

Ack, sorry for rattling on for so long. I don't have another suggestion for "Snape is Harry's biological father," but aspeninthesunlight's gargantuan fic "A Year Like None Other" linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061]]) has Snape adopting Harry and Draco in their sixth year. It was written pre-HBP, and it's wildly AU, but it's highly entertaining and quite a rollercoaster ride.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  #+begin_example
      When starting this, please keep in mind that A Year Like None Other was started long before HBP came out\. It was always my intention to write an alternate 6th year and when the canon Year 6 was published, it meant that my own little saga seriously diverged from canon\. So reading this, imagine that Years 1\-5 did occur, but nothing we discover from HBP and DH is necessarily true this time around\.The most important divergences are these: In this universe, Snape \*is\* a pureblood and his father's name was Hostilian \(which tells you a lot all by itself\)\. Dumbledore never died \-\- and certainly not at Snape's hand\!   This story is completely finished and is about 760,000 words long\. It took me a while to get it all posted here at AO3, but I am very happy to report that the whole thing is now online for your \(hopefully\) intense enjoyment\!And now, on with the show, which begins with A Year Like None Other \(completed\), continues on into A Summer Like None Other \(also completed\) and wraps up with A Family Like None Other, a Year 7 novel that I am still writing\.

********** For the record, I agree with you. My only reason for playing devil's advocate was because of how horribly Snape's character is often executed in fanfiction. From what I've encountered so far, authors who use this trope often hate James (and canon!Harry) even more than Snape. The first time that I read a story bashing James while glorifying Snape in the same breath left me feeling "meh". The next few dozen or so? You can imagine.

*********** Yeah, I have to admit, I've read very few Severitus fics because most of them make Snape soft or secretly noble in some way, and the sentimentality is an instant back-button for me. Snape's a bitter, venomous, intelligent bastard with very little experience of love. I can imagine his reaction to the news that Harry is his son would be horror and probably outrage that fate is humiliating him in this way. The discovery would be terrible for Harry and disturbing for both of them. Also, I see Snape as a self-loathing man, and he's perfectly capable of projecting his own disgust with himself onto any offspring the universe's sick sense of humor might foist upon him.

I'm not a fan of James, but character-bashing is always boring, and so is glorification. And I simply can't read fics that bash or belittle Harry and what he endures. That is, I'm down with fics in which /Snape/ does those things, because that's totally in character, but if the author maligns Harry or distorts his behavior and his motives to fit an agenda, I'm out of there.
