Are there any quidditch fanfics which are about harry and ginny playing pro quidditch together post deathly hallows?


** Vitam Paramus by Endless7 A game of Style and Brutality by BarneyXII The first one is more of a romance but Harry is a professional quidditch player, so has a lot of quidditch too.

*** I've actually written quite a few....

Quidditch World Cup has Harry and Ginny playing pro quidditch together on different teams. It doesn't end well for them.

Vitam Paramus has no Ginny.

Twelve Days also has Harry and Ginny in the league together but they again are not on the same team and it doesn't end well.

Iron And Gold doesn't feature Harry or Ginny but is my best quidditch by far. Harry is a tertiary character. Ginny isn't in it at all.

** So... not exactly what you're asking for but...

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/1__Beauxbatons/][Hope by Jeconais]] is a Harry/Gabrielle fic that takes place when Harry is off for a year due to an injury. It's very quidditch centric with several games narrated. Unfortunately, it also has Veela mate/bonding tropes. There isn't any bad blood between Harry and Ginny, however.

**** Again, I'm sorry that it's the wrong pairing, but it's the only quidditch-centric story I've read where I didn't skim over the actual matches. @.@
