** Was expecting something very different, raciest is drastically different from racist.

** Racist!Harry is an interesting premise that I would very much like to see explored. Personally, I think it should go in the direction of blood purists actually having a point due to some clever contrarian reason, or it being a Bad Idea to put the nation's money supply under the exclusive control of people who disrespect the right of first sale (hot take: DMCA anti-circumvention provision was a goblin conspiracy). "Voldemort did nothing wrong," and killing goblins [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz][For the Evulz]] is rather less good, I think.

But however you go about it, it is /very very important/ to remember that the word is spelled *racist* (raciest!Harry is when Harry is the most lewd), and that racist and racial are distinct words that cannot, in most cases, be used interchangeably.
