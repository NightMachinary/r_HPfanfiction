I'm not able to retrieve my password or sign up for a new member name. Is that website closing down?


** Just follow instructions on the home page, I guess.

"Site Emails

So apparently the site isn't sending out emails with temporary passwords for new accounts now. Nor is it sending out emails for password resets either.

Once you've registered, please email [[mailto:sh.userhelp@gmail.com][sh.userhelp@gmail.com]]. Or if you need a reset.

Please be patient while you wait for a response - the help desk gets over 70 emails a day, and I go through all of them to make sure they are not spam, so it does take me a bit of time

I will need to know your user name - the database (which is available to everyone as the member's list) is by user name ONLY. So I cannot search by email addresses.

I also need the email address that is on the account (the one you made the account with) to verify that it IS yours once I can go into the account.

Please also list the archive name. Sycophant Hex has five archives, and Ashwinder is only one of those archives.

Thank you, Celis"
