**** Wouldn't you be better off looking for survival stories on the internet from humans that have gone through these types of tragedies?

** I'm writing a story that's partly about the aftermath of Merope Gaunt's rape of the muggle Tom Riddle, as he tries to put his life back together. Nothing graphic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15430560/chapters/35816418][In the Bleak Midwinter]]

I wrote a story in which someone used the Imperius curse to attempt to rape someone, but was stopped. Somewhat graphic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255][Employee of the Month book one, Hiraeth]]

These stories probably aren't exactly what you're looking for, but I wanted to comment mostly to support you writing whatever you damn well please, unlike the comment above. It makes no sense to say that it's fine to write about any other sort of crime, murder, torture, whatever, but rape is the one crime that's off-limits.

** There's no need to include rape in your story; there are a plethora of other ways to inflict trauma. I think you should try a more creative approach. As a random example, perhaps your character is Imperiused and forced to maim someone they care about. It would engender feelings of intense violation at the loss of autonomy, guilt for failing to resist/carrying out the deed, horror and despair at what they'd done, regardless of their culpability.

It needn't be so visceral as all that, either. Maybe instead your character makes a grave error and initiates some terrible chain of events by accident, or maybe they witness something awful unfolding and they freeze, or they do the wrong thing, or they're simply powerless to stop what happens next.

Straight-up torture is bland, as far as traumas go. Harry was tortured with the Cruciatus in the graveyard and he never once thinks about it afterward; what really shattered him was Cedric's death, whom he was helpless to save though they were mere feet apart, or Sirius's death, compounded by fact that his reckless decisions brought it about.

Lastly: in my opinion, rape is a flat out unnecessary inclusion 99% of the time, and if it truly is necessary, you're better off implying it/referring to it as a past event in a character's backstory.

** linkffn(imprisoned realm by lovehp) I won't spoil it for you.

Personally, I think straight up torture just for shock value is boring as fuck. Rape is about power and a part of war, don't be graphic about it either, but imply/reference is more powerful than showing it. And do your research about the repercussions of torture.

** Depending on who you ask, my stuff would be an example of how to do it wrong/go too far. The entire story was started on the assumption that a girl!Harry who found herself stuck in the Little Hangleton graveyard surrounded by Death Eaters would be in for a hellish night, and to construct a backstory where she might be able to reasonably recover from that. Thus, Holly suffers in similar, lesser ways before she ends up there.

linkffn(Holly Evans; Spiral Tangents by wordhammer)

Chapters 3, 5, and 11 of the Tangents in particular cover the worst incidences. Concurrent chapters 20, 26-27, and 50 of the main story deal with the fallout of those events.

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

  Steamy vignettes from Harry Potter story 'Holly Evans and the Spiral Path'; Rated M for sex, violence and/or weirdness. Spiral references at the top of each chapter, so you know where it fits in the story.
