Basically what it says on the tin - has anyone ever read a fic where Hogwarts finds out that Harry hears his parents murder when the dementors get too close? Maybe after he faints during the Quidditch match or something? The idea came to me and I really want to read this scenario (buuuut I'm too lazy to write it myself lol ) Cheers in advance!


** Yes and it's normally a high point of 'Read the Books' style fics but they often get taken down for copyright reasons so you'll struggle to find them.

**** I've got some fictionhunt.com links saved on my laptop but I'm away for the week. That's where you'll have to look because they get removed from most other places. RemindMe!10 days

***** Ok, I'll reply to myself and link you all in to this message. Sorry I took so long but I forgot, even with the remind me bot. It's now after 1am and I suddenly woke up in the night and remembered this.

Anyway:

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7137232/1][Reading at Hogwarts: Prisoner of Azkaban]] is a good example of what you were looking for. It is third in it's series which runs to the end of the graveyard scene in goblet. It includes the following

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7042461/1][Reading at Hogwarts: The Philosopher's Stone]]

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7073100/1][Reading at Hogwarts: The Chamber of Secrets]]

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7339539/1][Reading at Hogwarts: The Goblet of Fire]]

 

This is a similar series called Hogwarts Reads:

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7555671/1][Sorcerer's Stone]]

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7618498/1][Chamber of Secrets]]

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7833066/1][Prisoner of Azkaban]]

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/8009681/1][Goblet of Fire]] (Incomplete)

 

And another called Discovering the Legend (I've got a note saying bits are missing from the GoF one but haven't confirmed again.):

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/8711227/1][Book 1]]

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/8739916/1][Book 2]]

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/8770685/1][Book 3]]

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/8493913/1][Book 4]]

[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/9149358/1][Book 5]]

 

I can give links to other fics of this style but most authors either get bored somewhere in book 1, just do a best bits selection or, in the worse case scenario, do a read-the-books-as-I-would-have-written-them option. /Cringe/

Anyway, you've got all my links to the PoA-y ones with others learning about Harry's Dementors. They also do that in a new fic I'm reading called Whispers in the Night but it's not spectacular linkffn(12104688).

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.
