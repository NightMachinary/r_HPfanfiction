I'm looking for a Harry-centred fic with an interesting war story. I mean some chilling Voldemort/Death Eaters encounters. A scary Voldemort would be very nice. Any pairings are acceptable, as well as any raising. But no Fem or Dark!Harry please. Any of you guys know anything of the sort?

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
