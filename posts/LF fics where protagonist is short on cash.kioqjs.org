There's so many fics with an independent protagonist where the first thing that happens is that they discover piles of money in a Gringrott's vault, and I'm tired of it.

I found it refreshing how in "Unfogging the Future" Lavender turns up with maybe a couple of galleons, and the first thing she does is try to find a job. I've started a story where young Tom Riddle picks up odd jobs in Knockturn during the summer holidays, but I'm impatient, and I want to read, too.

I figure that wizards would have inventive ways of getting by with no money. Tom would confound muggles into thinking he's paid for stuff, but "good guy" characters would have other methods.

Any recommendations?

Not really, but there are elements. Dudley get a Hogwarts letter as well, so Hagrid doesn't have to come collect Harry. They never go to Gringotts.

Harry thinks he's dirt poor and gets a part time job as Filch's assistant so he can pay uncle Vernon back for his school supplies. Later his housemates find out about this and bust a gut laughing, "Dude, the Potters are loaded!"

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.
