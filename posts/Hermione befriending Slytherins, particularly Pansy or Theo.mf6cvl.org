Looking for fics where Hermiome is either sorted into Slytherin and befriends Pansy/the Slytherins or where she befriends them as a Gryffimdor. Any age, no specific ships, prefer it to not be a muggle au but anything works really. Complete works preferred.


** Think Battle Scars and Breathmints could apply although it's a Dramione story.

*** Either/both i just like dynamic of little 11 year old hermione ending up with these slytherins with outdated beliefs and pulling her "well we're not having any of that nonsense" spiel

Or hermione post war befriending/romancing slytherins and teaching them that their ideals were wrong

Edit: nope, not a problem!

These stories all end in romance, but most of them are slow burns that start with building friendships first.

  Hermione Granger knows who she is. She is a Gryffindor. She is a Muggleborn. She is Afro-Arab. She is English. She is a Muslimah. She is a good friend. She is smart. She is an activist. She is things that she will never say out loud.Hermione Granger knows who she is. The problem: No one else does.1. Not her friends.2. Not her parents.3. Not even her. Not yet.

  When her search for a potion to combat her nightmares brings Hermione to the lavender fields in Provence, France, she's rather shocked to recognise the mysterious witch living there.

  At this very moment, Hermione Granger is a tiny muggleborn child who's tried half a dozen spells. No one is scared of her. No one knows to expect her."We're really doing this," Pansy eventually says, breaking the silence. "We must be insane.""We're saving the country." Hermione tears her gaze from the sunrise across the treetops of the Forbidden Forest to find that Pansy is already looking her way, something resolute in her gaze. It's too solemn of an expression for a child, but Hermione's probably isn't better.

  Hermione has a pregnant adopted sister, parents who don't believe she's bisexual, and a crush the size of the Great Lake on Pansy Parkinson. Taking Pansy up on her offer to be Hermione's fake date to her parents' Christmas dinner could solve at least one of those problems...but it could also make everything worse.

  Hermione knows working herself into the ground isn't a healthy coping mechanism, but right now it's the only one she's got. When deliberate intervention forces her to work with one of her old schoolmates, will things fall into place, or will they just fall apart?

  “I don't have to justify my place here to you.” Millicent's voice is like ice, and Hermione can't help herself from flinching, pulling back in her seat to put more distance between them. She's faced down dark wizards, but this feels different. Hermione feels her cheeks warm and thinks about trying to apologise, to take back her words or say something to take away the sting of them, but before she can say anything Millicent snaps, “Why are you here?” After the war Hermione tries to make up for her wartime by working in the Department of Magical Accidents. She's not expecting to end up working at a desk opposite one Millicent Bulstrode, but she'll put up with whatever she has to, if it gives her a chance at getting her parents' memories back.

  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
