Sounds more like a story idea than a Request, but its actually what im curious if such exist. So, such a Story would obviously be AU (although i dont mind if some canon compiance is inserted). James had a Lover in his Time but then he died. He however had a Son (Harry), who visited Hogwarts. At some Points, both get to know each other and she is breath token at how similar Harry looks like James. They exchange Experience and Stories about the deceased one and she grows more and more attracted to him....possible this is also the case for him.

Eventual Lovemaking is possible. I thought about that Harry has just left Hogwarts, maybe even 1 year or two after it, they meet.

It can also be a Non-magical Fic.


** Sooo, how old would this person be? Because she would have at least some good 20 years on Harry.
