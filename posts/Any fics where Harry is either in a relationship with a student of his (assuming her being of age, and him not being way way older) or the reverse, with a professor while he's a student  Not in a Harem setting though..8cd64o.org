#+TITLE: Any fics where Harry is either in a relationship with a student of his (assuming her being of age, and him not being way way older) or the reverse, with a professor while he's a student ? Not in a Harem setting though.

I've read one where he has starts dating a girl in her seventh year a couple years after the war, and in the end, they both die. Really shitty. So yeah, the only one that pops to my mind besides that, is Hope by Jeconais with Gabrielle still in school.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.

** There is for the love of magic where he sleeps with his teachers while he was in school but you said no to harem. It was more of a friends with benefits kind of deal between them though. The story did not change into a harem not untill much later. This Harry really did not want to be tied up.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.
