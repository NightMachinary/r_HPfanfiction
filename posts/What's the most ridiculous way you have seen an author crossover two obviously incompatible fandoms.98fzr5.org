I'm not talking about bringing a character into another fandom, not making the two environments coincide in the same world. Harry transferring to another dimension to the Elemental Nations can be conceivable, but they cannot exist in the same word. I have seen fics where an author tried to make Lily the long lost sister/cousin of Kushina purely because of her hair colour. Adding an entire continent to the earth is something not even magic can do, never mind the obvious cultural, technological and economic differences between Muggles and Wizards on one side and Naruto's world on the other. There's probably more ridiculous examples than the one I've shown, but this is the one that put the idea into my head.


** I recall a Dresden Files crossover that began with Lash in limbo, discussing her identity and semi-redemption with Uriel. She agreed to his proposal and suddenly found herself in the Potterverse.

The chapter ended with an author's note: "If it takes a deus ex machina to make your premise work, make it a literal deus ex machina." Words to live by.

*** I'm weirdly ok with that, especially since the author admitted to it. After the initial jumping off point, did anything else feel incongruous?

Hey, it worked for Stephen King in /The Stand/.

** Well it may not be the most incompatible but I have a problem with Naruto crossing to a universe with what we could consider a version of our world (HP, Marvel, DC, Buffy, ...).

HP has the muggle world which would be our world so you can cross it with more or less whatever is with a somewhat realistic world. Its magic makes it compatible with magical world like GoT or LotR (with dimensional travel of course) even if you have to tweak a bit but magic is known so it doesn't come out of nowhere. As for Star Wars and Sci-fi in general well you can more or less say it's a far future world or another planet.

For Naruto the lack of "our world", different geography, no technology and the OP mega destructive combat skills (bijuu dama) makes it, in my opinion, really hard to crossover with our universe. Even with dimensional travel I find it hard to read and believe because of the sheer amount of *fundamental* dissimilarities between the universes.

I'd begun a AvengersXNaruto fic with a dimension travel but I just couldn't get into it because I couldn't picture Naruto in our world. Too many differences to even compare.

I didn't read lot of other fics out of HPverse but I'm pretty sure a lot of mangas would have hard time crossing over their universe with "our world" for more or less the same reason.

*** In my opinion even crossing over with Naruto can work with some world building. Maybe Naruto is in the past, there are just hardly any Muggles and they channel their magic differently ?

**** Hmm the biggest problem still around would be the geography. Another planet maybe or a dimension travel but again the differences in everything makes it difficult in my opinion. Mahouka or Negima would mix better just because of the geography (and ok there is magic but you see what I mean).

But maybe later I'll change my mind. After all, when I began reading fanfics I was reading only cannon fics. I'll first have to find some good Naruto fics X)

****** ahah was more talking about overall world geography. It looks like they present the world in Naruto as the whole planet

** There's actually a pretty decent HP and Avatar the Last Airbender crossover. It's weird, but it works strangely well because of the way the story was told.
