:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic I read a few months ago, I'm pretty sure it was on fanfiction.net. It was a FMA HP crossover where Edward Elric teaches at hogwarts. I know there are a lot of those , but I am trying to find a specific one; I think it was incomplete, but I remember it was during Harry's 5th year, and Umbridge at one point establishes a decree saying that teachers cannot wear casual clothes as a way to get at Edward for wearing muggle clothing. Edward responds by wearing his military uniform instead, stunning the students. I know this is like looking for a needle in a haystack, but any help is appreciated.

Edit: I found it! It was on Ao3, not ff.net. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23413075/chapters/56112547]]
