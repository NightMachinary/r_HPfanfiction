** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again]]: So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

*** Hadn't read Faery Heroes, but I'm giving it a shot. I'll even read past all the bashing in the first few paragraphs.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/844334/1/Amulet-of-Time-1-The-Age-of-the-Founders]] read this a long time ago. If i remember correctly they actually invent pranking so i believe there was at least some element of humour.

*** Oh I loved this story though I read a translated version back then. The story is awesome even but it has its sad parts and it's not completed. Fifth part has 12 chapters since 2005 and the author doesn't react to any mail so one should keep that in mind when starting it. It's still worth it but as far as I remember there should have been 12 parts or so (?).... so the story hasn't even really started yet even while already having ~400,000 words.

  Harry Potter goes back in time and has to start everything again. Do you think he will be careful not to screw the timeline up? No, he doesn't even think about it! A story featuring a loony Harry and a Magical World that seems willing to adapt to him.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

Time and dimension travel, shortish, complete, great fun.
