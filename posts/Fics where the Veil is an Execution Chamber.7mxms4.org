After reading a tv tropes pages that mention it, I want to read some fics where the Veil is basically the wizard world's guillotine.


** Mm...I've seen fics where it's used for execution, and I've seen fics where it sends people to other worlds.

I wonder, what if you had a fic that combined those? A canon-flavour Harry Potter world is accidentally invaded by a second copy of Voldemort, or Bellatrix, or Umbridge, after said villain's homeworld tosses them through the Veil? In an attempt to execute them, I mean.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

They only use it at the very end of the fic though and its not at all the focus of the plot so idk.

  Sequel to 'To Play the Devil'. Harry and Tom left our world behind, but the new world is far more dangerous. The washerwomen guard the fords; reapers walk the noon-day fields; the Gentry are riding, and Death moves against them. Enter a land of fairies, enchantment and fear. When they face foes they never imagined can they stay true to themselves? No relationships.

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when your only friend is your worst enemy. The war ended over a hundred years ago. Harry Potter and Voldemort are old, out of practice, and politely ignoring each other. What a pity that couldn't last. In the Black Forest something is rising which will require them both to stop. Major non-canon elements. COMPLETED.
