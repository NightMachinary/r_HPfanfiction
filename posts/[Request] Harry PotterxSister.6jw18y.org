#+begin_quote
  Twenty years after a falling out with the rest of the Marauders, Remus Lupin has completely cut himself off from the wizarding world and opened a restaurant in the muggle one. Unfortunately for him, his past comes back to haunt him in the most irritating way possible: his restaurant seems to attract the weirdest possible customers, both magical and muggle. Episodic, Remus-centric.

  It was depravity, they knew, perversion of the vilest kind, but living in a dark cupboard with your twin sister for eleven years tends to slightly warp your notions of right and wrong. AU, incest. H/OC

  What if Harry had a twin sister, someone who grew up with him as they ventured through life together, instead of him facing the world by himself. And Malfoy has a sister as well, which makes life even more chaotic. Sequel to Battle of Wills, with AU elements. Story begins with Harry's 4th year. Harry/OC/OC/Fleur. Warning: wincest, BDSM, harem.
