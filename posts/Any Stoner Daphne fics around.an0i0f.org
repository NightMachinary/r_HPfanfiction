it's been joked about a few times on here but are there any fics where Miss 'Greengrass' lives up to her last name and is stoned off her arse all the time? Be a nice change of pace from ice queen Daph to see more of a work shy hippie Daph who's just like "why cant like... all the houses become like just...one house man...lets just chill and respect each other" :P I know Hufflepuff's get painted as the stoners all the time due to the 'puff' name and having their dorm right near the kitchens but think slytherins shouldn't be left out haha any fics that are general stoner style crack comedies will be acceptble too as long as they're pretty funny.

***** Neville for Gryffindor, it helps ease his anxiety and noticeably makes his memory worse.

Luna for Ravenclaw, I mean obviously, some of her thoughts sound like it could have come from some college dude after taking a huge hit from the bong. "like, its the ministry covering this shit up man"

Tonks definitely did probably until her 6th or 7th year when she decided to try to be an Auror, then IDK Ernie or Leanne probably.

And Daphne as the head distributor, Probably taking over from some older cousin who graduates her first year.

** The closest I'm aware of is Runic Animagi on FFN, a Haphne fic in which Harry dabbles with weed in the summer between fifth and sixth. Pretty sure the Daphne here is relatively normal, though :< It's been a while since I read it (only searched to confirm the name), so read at your own risk :p

******** That is true! I think it's fascinating how that happened, and especially her being with Harry. I do suppose her being Astoria's sister probably has some bearing on that.

James does definitely present her in a fun way - and that was actually the first time I read a story about her, so I missed most of the whole "ice queen" thing.

We /do/ need a fun Slytherin!
