I was reading a lot of fanfics, and there's lots of marriage contracts and patriarchal culture, often criticized, and a lot of hate towards homossexuals the wizarding society, due to not reproducing.

Then it struck me, it makes NO SENSE at all, really. If you think about it, second years, no matter how intelligent, were able to brew polyjuice potion, so it can't be THAT complicated, and that's a potion that rewrites the ENTIRE body and it's genetic makeup, however temporarily.

How likely is it that in the entire history of the wizarding world, some pureblood family, that only has daughters, didn't create a potion or ritual to change the gender of their firstborn? That would change far less of the body then the polyjuice, and since you're not becoming someone else, and the change would be only a single chromosome, it could be permanent.

Such a thing would have an immense impact on society, gender roles would be meaningless, genders themselves would be fluid, "hey, i'm felling like a female today, let me hop over to the medical wing to change my body", people would change their gender like changing hairstyles.

And even if it the change wasn't permanent, it doesn't take an hour for a woman to take the potion and have sex with another woman, impregnating her, witch would make females the dominant ones in society, seeing as they can be father AND mothers.

So does anyone know any fanfiction even remotely on this concept? and yes, i'm currently reading a lot of the normal genderbending ones.


** No, but if you find any let me know.
