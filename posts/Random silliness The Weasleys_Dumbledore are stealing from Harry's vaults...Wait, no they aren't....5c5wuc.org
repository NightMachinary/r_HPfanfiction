"Mrs Weasley, I've just found that I haven't been receiving financial statements from Gringotts for the past 10 years when I should have been, and you and Professor Dumbledore have periodically been making withdrawals..."

Mrs Weasley blinked and looked at the balance sheet presented to her, "Didn't anyone ever tell you, Harry?"

"Tell me what?"

"Well...you know how in the first war against...You-Know-Who, your parents were in the Order of the Phoenix. My brothers were as well. I stayed out of things with Arthur, but we still talked to Lily and James, and, well..."

Molly sighed, "It was dangerous in those times, members of the Order were dying left and right...your mother was worried that she and James might not come back one day, so, we made a promise; if they were killed in action, we'd take care of you..."

Harry glanced at the sheet again before looking up at Mrs. Weasley, "But I've been raised by the Dursleys..."

"Yes, but you end up staying with us a lot, dear. In any case, your parents gave the okay for us to withdraw money from your vault for you, and we've had financial agency ever since."

Mrs Weasley blushed, "Although I do have to make a confession...we have borrowed a few galleons from time to time when we ran out...we did pay it back, it doesn't /really/ cost 700 galleons to go on holiday to Egypt, you know..."

"Professor Dumbledore, these withdrawals from my vault in your name..."

"Pre-arranged monthly fees for tuition, and limited right to withdrawal for the purpose of meeting extraordinary expenses, like your medical bills. Yes, I took some so that McGonagall could give you a Nimbus 2000, yes, I took some to pay for the considerable amounts of chocolate you consumed during third year. No, I can't pay for it out of school funds, the notoriously philanthropic Lucius Malfoy is stingy when it comes to Hogwarts, no, Severus can't brew all the medical potions required, he doesn't have enough time to do so and we'd need to buy most of the ingredients anyway."

Professor Dumbledore sighed, "I'm sorry, Harry, I haven't had a lemon drop for the past three hours and it's made me a mite cranky."


** I'd like to read that in a fic once. Harry gets pissed at everybody, paranoid that the whole world is against him, becomes Lord Potter and all that fuzz, is about to go full blown independent!Harry-genre and then finds out that the Weasleys and Dumbledore are really in his team.

Now that I type it it sounds like these fics should work anyway.

This particular one-shot is about an Independent!Harry who jumps worlds to escape after being betrayed by pretty much absolutely everyone in his own world, and ends up in a world where the good guys are reasonably 'good' instead. Except that Harry is expecting more betrayal, so he's violently neutral.

*** Adding onto this, I really want to read a fic where Harry gets really, really paranoid about his money and proceeds to acquire wealth and horde it. I want him to buy a mansion and then snub everyone that is poorer than him. I want Ron to ask for money for a treat or something and just get glared at and then abused for asking for money. I want Harry to toss that relationship away and claim that Ron was just always after his money.

Years later, I want him to notice transactions by the Weasley's and he goes and confronts him, forcing Veritaserum down Molly's throat, asking why they were stealing HIS money. Then I want Molly to say softly that they had been putting money into his account, which is where a vast amount of their money was going, so that Harry could have a nice house when he was older.

Then, I want their situations to reverse and Harry's the poor one, living in a hobble. Penniless.

Pity it wasn't completed...

Out of everybody who the Potters could have picked for this, I highly doubt it was the Weasley family. First of all, there was Harry's GODFATHER. Then Remus (even though he's a werewolf), then MAYBE Peter. James and Lily had other friends. For example, A few Order members (of which, neither Molly nor Arthur were during the first time through). Possibly Andromeda Tonks' family who had one child -- and could be suggested by Sirius himself if he couldn't do it, as she was his favorite cousin. There were plenty of people.

None of whom were the Weasleys, who already had quite a few children before James and Lily died. They wouldn't have wanted the burden to fall on a family with so many kids, and so poor themselves.

***** I was actually going to put in stuff about how they picked the Weasleys precisely because they were poor, with the assumption that they were good people and it was alright for them to dip in now and then...but I forgot to put it in.

I suppose I could also make up silliness about how the Weasleys were 32nd down the list or so, with everyone else being disqualified (dead, dead, in Azkaban, anti-werewolf legislation, dead, insane, dead..) or not confident in their ability to handle the Potter money.

Or in the interest of maximum silliness; /everyone/ was given financial agency over the Potter accounts and /everyone's/ been dipping into them.

You could write a series of one-shots along the lines of 'If I had a thousand galleons', with everyone who takes a handful of Harry's money.

Neville buying new and exotic plants for his collection? Snape investing in apothecaries? Griphook buying black-market magic items? The dementors of Azkaban sponsoring research into the effects of chocolate? Umbridge going clothes shopping? Voldemort buying the Harry Potter books?

Only when it suits them.

Yes, or else they'd be original fiction.

It varies, but generally not so much. /Make a Wish/ is pretty short on believability, for instance. /Seventh Horcrux/ is rather more believable most of the time, but that's not saying much.

#+end_quote

Even a serious fic could justify the Potters asking the Weasleys to at least keep an eye out on Harry, even though they already had six children at that point. The "most logical" possibility never has to apply to any fic.

***** A bit late, but it varies greatly from one story to another. Some crack fics take a bit that is in canon and focus on it to the point of insanity which can be funny in a cracky way (“Birth of a Name”, for example); but others simply take the general setting and proceed to twist it into a pretzel just for amusement and do not leave things as they were just for the sake of making it believable from the viewpoint of canon, with the result being most definitely not even close to canon in any way (“The Worst Muggles Imaginable” is here).
