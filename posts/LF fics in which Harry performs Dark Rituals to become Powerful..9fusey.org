  After the events down at the Chamber, Harry decides to become the master of his own destiny than to let others decide his fate. He learns of a different connection that he shares with Voldemort; and magic that will make him a more than equal to the Dark Lord.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

***** Its small at the start, him just disliking it, which is fine. Later it gets preachy (about half way in), then the last 10 or so chapters are full on genocide. The author tries to claim in ANs that its just Harry's views but honestly who writes about the hero committing genocide without their own views shinning though.

****** I mean I can easily understand writing about your protag committing genocide if it's been set up as how the character thinks or whatever, the real issue was it came out of absolutely nowhere, had nothing to do with the story at all and that's what made it obvious he was just using the fic as a stand-in for his own thoughts.

******** Protagonist does not equal to the "good guy"

They're just your main leading character/s. So yes, a protagonist can commit genocide, and if it's set up in advance and fits with their character, it might even make sense.

Obviously it doesn't do any of these in the fic we're talking about, but saying a protagonist isn't supposed to do anything is flat out wrong. They're just a character in a fictional story, they can be made to do anything.
