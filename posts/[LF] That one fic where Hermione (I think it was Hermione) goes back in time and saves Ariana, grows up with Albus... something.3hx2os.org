I've been looking for so long I'm halfway convinced I imagined the whole thing. But I know I wrote a fanfic *unpublished that was based off it so it must be out there...

I can remember someone (I think it was Hermione) going back in time. She saves Ariana, is introduced to the Dumbledores, who are all happy that their son has an intellectual equal to be friends with. The girls at Hogwarts have to take the equivalent of Home Economics because Victorian England, I think there was a confrontation with a Malfoy at some point with Kendra and Hermione sassing them.

I know it was a good fic. I just can't find it D:


** I haven't seen any with Hermione but I know one where Harry is reincarnated as Gellert Grindelwald's elder sister. She doesn't have her memories from her past life per se, but she gets ideas and snippets from it.
