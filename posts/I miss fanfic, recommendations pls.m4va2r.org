I haven't read fanfic in ages and it's killing me, but I can't find anything to read >:(

I like time travel, dimension travel, wbwl, slytherin!harry

For ships I like drarry, PLATONIC severus and Harry, tomarry. And I only read Harry centric.

Maybe I should broaden my horozions I suppose. My favourite fic, for context, is linkffn(the second string) and I will recommend it until I die.

PLease if you have any recommendations please recommend

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

** Platonic Harry Severus linkao3(Swung by Serafim by Flamethrower)

I also like The Second String. This is a very different story but the writing quality is still very high with fun adventure and smart harry.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** Mostly WIPs-

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][dead things]]:

#+begin_quote
  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.\\
  Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
#+end_quote

dark lord harry fic- it's a oneshot. (I recommend checking out the author's other works too, by the way. I like Ink in particular.)

2.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16308554/chapters/38146754][Inevitabilities]]:

#+begin_quote
  Tom and Harry are inevitable in any universe.\\
  OR: While Dumbledore and Grindelwald play their chess game across Europe, two young wizards form an unlikely friendship.

#+end_quote

4.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24340054/chapters/58690147][Oblivion]]:

5.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17658731/chapters/41644856][What Souls are Made of]]:

#+begin_quote
  A mysterious object in Bellatrix's vault sends Harry, Ron and Hermione spinning into the past and to a Hogwarts like none they know.\\
  Posing as students, Harry catches the eye of the Head Boy, Tom Riddle, who is nothing like the Voldemort of the future. He's charming and sly and manipulative; both brilliant and deadly.\\
  It isn't long before they're tangled in a game more intricate than anything before. A game of heightened stakes, of tension, and the odds are stacked against Harry. With the threads of the future unravelling, can Harry make it out intact? And what is the cost, of truly getting close to Tom?
#+end_quote

6.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27745546/chapters/67912519][Stars, Hide Your Fires]]:

#+begin_quote
  Things go awry when the trio beaks into Gringotts. Harry finds himself trapped, locked in the Lestrange vault, wandless and alone...\\
  With a horcrux.

  What if the Dementor attack in 5th year had ended with Harry losing? What if someone had stepped in to safe him? And what if Harry ended up in the past with a chance to be more than he ever was before? A story about a forcibly time travelled Harry and its consequences... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

  Delphini comes into her own. Harry and Voldemort find common ground in their love for her. Pandemics, coups, civil wars, and sentient castles get in the way.

  Voldemort won the first war. Harry is happy to live as an unnoticed squib at Hogwarts. Unfortunately, visions and rebels don't allow that and Harry soon catch the attention of the dark lord.
