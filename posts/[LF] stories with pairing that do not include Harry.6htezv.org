#+begin_quote
  Six months after Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord, Voldemort, someone decided to turn back time and change history where Harry Potter was reduced to nothing more than a myth. Strangely, only Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger, mortal enemies at best, were unaffected by the sudden time shift. Now they must find a way to return to their true timeline as only they know the truth.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  Tired of Draco's arrogant claims that he can 'get any girl he wants', Daphne proposes a challenge to knock him down a peg or two. However when Draco unexpectedly accepts, the stakes are raised and neither Slytherin wants to lose. Elsewhere, Hermione has her own point to prove, but when she finds her path crossing with Draco's, will either of them succeed? 4th Year A/U *COMPLETE*

** So Harry is one of my least favorite characters so I routinely exclude him when doing fic searches and I adore long stories. You might like some of the stories I've faved on FFN, there are too many to post without more details on what you like so I'm just going to post my userpage. Just sort by category [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/138316/][here]]. Hope this helps!

**** Hmm. Works fine for me. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/138316/][Are you clicking on the link on the word here from my post?]] I didn't use a fanficbot link as it's not a specific story I'm directing to but my favorites page on my whole ffn profile.
