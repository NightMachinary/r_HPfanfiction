Why is it in almost every hp fanfiction they yell out the spell incantation? Couldnt they speak in a inside voice? Or am i reading into this too much?

** I assume that, just as non-verbal spells are harder than spoken ones, quiet ones are harder than loud ones.

*** Add to that the number of times spells were yelled out in the movies, likely for dramatic effect.
