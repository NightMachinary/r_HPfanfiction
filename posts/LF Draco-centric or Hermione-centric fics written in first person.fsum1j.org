Haven't read fics w/ either of these POVs written in 1st person. So send them over! Preferably well written. Any ships are fine.

Thanks in advance!


** linkffn(exile) is one of the best nonconventional Draco-centric fics I have ever read. I don't remember whether it was in first person or not but I highly rec it regardless.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

*** It wasn't in first person, but Exile was a very good fic. I wish there was a continuation at least up to the point where he and Astoria met.

** There's surprisingly few which come to mind. linkffn(6532581) What the Room Requires is a classic which manages to include both POVs. There's also linkffn(5537755) which is primarily third-person with first-person diary entries.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
