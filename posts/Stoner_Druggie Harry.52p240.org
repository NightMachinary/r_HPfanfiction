Stories where Harry becomes a stoner or abusing drugs. Also would enjoy Harry the drug dealer/crime king via selling drugs.


** linkffn(Death Eaters and Benadryl) doesn't have quite a Druggie!Harry, but it's close.

--------------

I've had this plot bunny for a long time, inspired by the thread about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3h10vo/harry_potter_the_yob_who_lived/][a fic where Harry grows up immersed in the British youth gang culture]].

Harry is Sorted into Slytherin, but doesn't really fit in, because Slytherins think of themselves as a wizarding aristocracy and vassals of sorts (e.g., Draco as opposed to Crabbe and Goyle), and Harry doesn't fit in to that; but, over time, he finds his place in Slytherin as this scrappy wheeler-and-dealer. Meanwhile, Hermione, due to a slightly different encounter on Hogwarts Express, finds herself in Ravenclaw, has a generally pleasant if uninteresting time there, but, due to a lack of active discouragement from Snape (because not Gryffindor or Harry's friend) and a few other Butterflies finds herself excelling in Potions in particular.

Fast forward four years. Voldemort is back (somehow), and Slytherin is increasingly uncomfortable for Harry; but magical items that provide protection and bribes are rather expensive. Harry's done recreational (and other) Potions dealing, but his brewing efforts don't work out very well (he did minimum necessary in Snape's class). Several times, he almost gets caught. Meanwhile, Hermione, the Potions prodigy, also finds herself in desperate need of money. (One possible reason is that because she is a Muggleborn who stands out, her home is targeted by a Death Eater raid; her parents survive, but they require very expensive magical treatment, since much of the regular magical medicine doesn't work on them.)

She approaches Harry with an offer to partner up, with Hermione managing the brewing, while continuing to live a respectable life, and Harry managing the distribution. Harry agrees for the money, the thrills, and, yes, the product. They set up in the Chamber of Secrets, sneaking ingredients past Filch, with Harry bailing out his distributors when they're caught and trying to not have their product stolen, even as Hermione decides that the money to cure her parents isn't enough, because she must also get enough to set herself and her parents up in France. They grow their operation, clashing with the Weasley Crew (because The Twins also brew to raise startup funds for their joke shop, Ron got involved because he's got nothing better to do, and Ginny wants to emulate Harry Potter), and then expanding out of Hogwarts when their product's reputation reaches the Knockturn Alley, bringing new threats and new opportunities.

The whole thing culminates in Harry Potter and the mysterious "Madame Curie" taking out Voldemort because he's in the way of their drug operation. In case it's not obvious, it's...

*Dumbledore:* This is very much /not/ how I thought the Prophecy would play out, but... OK. As long as they don't try to poison my lemon drops again.

--------------

Oh, and this fic would /not/ be a Harry/Hermione 'ship. In a nutshell,

*Waltermione "Madame Curie" Granger:* [on 'ship with *Harry*] It's arrogant of me, perhaps classist, I know, but, well, I could just do /so much better/ than Harry, even if I didn't have Viktor. People look at him and see a Quiddich player, but the Goblet didn't select him for his flying skills, you know --- he is all around the best wizard of his generation in Durmstrang. I have a dilemma, though: I've developed a most wonderful reflex enhancer, completely undetectable using available techniques, with only a few minor side-effects. Quiddich captains would pay good galleons for a dose, but I don't want my Viktor to get addicted, and I don't want him to lose because of what I sold to his competitors, you know? Am I being too moralistic?

*Jerry "Boy-Who-Cooked" Potter:* [on 'ship with *Hermione*] Hermione? Are you mental?! She's probably got a bloody checklist for shagging, and two more for what to do before and after! Me, I've got me a Muggle girl back home. Probably gonna marry her some day: you can't really /relax/ around the witches, you know? Rest of the year, what can I say? Gryffindor girls are daring, Ravenclaw girls are curious, Hufflepuff girls are eager to please, Slytherin girls are flexible, and none of them can resist the Potter charm.

The fic doesn't have to mirror Breaking Bad exactly.

You even said before Harry had no trouble charming witches from any house. And yes, he would engage in hate sex with rival Ginny Weasley.

******** You make a good case. At the same time, being friends with Ministry's high officials' children would work well to underscore the contrast of the double-life she's living, one as Hermione Granger --- Ravenclaw Prefect, Model Muggleborn, straight-O student, and Potions prodigy, a shoo-in for Head Girl, with a bit of a stick up her arse --- and Madame Curie --- the ruthless drug lord who is rumored to have done things that even Death Eaters found repulsive (a surprising amount of which is even true).

That said, none of this precludes Jerry from sexing up Susan and Ginny alike, ignoring Hermione's interminable lectures on operational security.

********* I like the name Jerry. How could anyone forget 'Tom and Jerry', where Tom always tried to eat Jerry and Jerry trounced Tom badly?

The police chief lost her family to Death Eaters before. Having lost faith in the current administration and hope in carrying out justice, she fell to honeyed words from 'Madame Curie', who promised her profit, revenge, and support for her political ambitions. She was willing to sacrifice her principles for the 'Greater Good'.

You probably know about this already... well if you don't, you're lucky. Harry is a fifth year Ravenclaw and he's been brewing a potion with similar effects to amphetamines, has been selling it to a distributor, getting cash to fund his wack experiments.

I won't say more to spoil it, this is among my favorite fics, brought to you by the author of The Wastelands of Time. As per the author it features a metric fuck-ton of mystery, crazy magic, gripping dialogue, compelling characters and a Harry that's probably too cool to exist (not really).

Check out technomad's work, he has a story called "written in the style of" or something close and i think there's a criminal one but don't think he actually deals drugs in it but i could be wrong.
