  Dumbledore's schemes took everything from him, including the man he loved, but now Harry has devised a means with which to travel back in time to his younger body before he started Hogwarts. He's going to get another chance at his life, and this time Dumbledore won't be getting in his way.An unconventional approach to a Do Over story.WARNING: This story is a W.I.P. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
