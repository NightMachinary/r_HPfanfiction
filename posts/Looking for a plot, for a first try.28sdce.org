I've been thinking for a little while now about possibly writing a story of my own. I have a few plot ideas in mind but I'm not quite sure as to how to approach them right now.

To people who have transitioned from reader to author, how difficult was it to transition, and could you offer any advice? To my fellow readers, do you have a fic idea that you'd like to see come to fruition? I can't promise any good literature, but I'd be happy to share a chapter with you when it was completed.

I'd prefer nothing relating to slash, I can work with canon (or near canon) pairings to a degree, but I'd prefer it to be about the story, not about the couple(s).

As always, thank you for reading


** Hi

I have had a couple (thousands) of ideas in my head, bu I am not really a good author, so they are pretty much rotting in my head :)

One of them is an inspiration from the plot about using a spell to get another BWL to come to their dimension or universe and solve the Voldemort problem because of reasons...

The twist that I want to see is that instead of the usuall Aloof/strong harry appearing, I want 3 different harry potters to appear.

One is a Necromancer, dealing with death and destruction. He is shrouded in shadows and has long hair hiding most of his face. Has a old wood staff as long as him.

The next one is a Paladin of sorts ( by now you can pretty much guess that I love RPG games :p) Having long hair but in a pony tail. A heavy hammer by his side and a book hanging from his hips. A light shining on his face irrespective of any light whatsoever.

The last one is most normal looking of the bunch. A long trench coat, short military style haircut and a couple of old guns hanging from his hips. Instead of a wand, we see 2 bands on his wrists with runes on them.

All of them while use different styles have one thing in common. All 3 are mercenaries.

--------------

This is just a description. I want to see a Voldemort that is cunning, charming, A genius minded villain. Who IS one BAMF. And a Dumbledore to match.

I also want an AU world fully explored, not just the British Isles.

That is the one I want ( well one of many really). Just thought that I would share it with you.

Let me know if you need any more details :) Or if you have a plot that you want to write but aren't sure of, I can proof read it. I have wasted pretty much 8 years of life at FF.net and other websites, so that experience would count I guess :D

I'd aim for the 10-15k word one-shot/novelette as a first timer. Nothing epic, but enough space to develop ideas and release multiple chapters.

Easy, but I am a lifetime reader of fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery novels. And recently, fanfic. I literally have a book or reading device in my hand 80% of my spare time. So I just started trying to write like the stuff I like to read.

As for advice, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28hjdf/advice_for_new_fanfiction_writer/][read this thread]]. Most of that is good. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28hjdf/advice_for_new_fanfiction_writer/cibau24][My entry in that thread]].

My take on this is, write what /you/ want to read. Otherwise, it is just a writing exercise, and those are fucking /boring/.

That story you just /know/ no one else has done yet? The one you thought up seconds after finishing that last fanfic you read? Or maybe that "what if" daydream you had?

Do that.

Keep a notebook (or text file) of ideas, writing them down *when you have them*. Pick one /before/ you think you're ready. Then post early and often, and listen to all the polite and constructive feedback. And laugh at the haters, especially the ones who misspell words in their reviews. Those are great.

Okay, maybe make your first fic an adventure story with a good hook in the summary, not a Tonks and Ron (??) romance. Nothing too obscure and hard to relate to, if you want lots of feedback.

Or maybe do something weird, and boost it here. You'll get fewer readers, but they'll respect the fact you did something original, and the feedback will be more than "like it, post soon pls."

Your writing will suck at first, unless you are some kind of natural genius or do other kinds of writing for a living. That's fine. No one ever killed someone with bad fanfic, and you can always fix or just rewrite a favorite idea. No such thing as "ruining" an idea.

Just take a swing at it, see what happens. And post to this sub with a link.

** Well to start off with I should mention that I only write slash/femslash and all of my stories to date mostly deal with the romance.

However. I can give you general advice based on my own experience. I'd been reading fics for a few months before I started writing. I didn't just read the stories. I studied them; I noticed the language, the phrases, and how people put together their stories. Then one day I sat down and just wrote whatever came to mind. It was short, just a small piece in what I'm hoping to someday be a part of a much bigger story. It used many of the words and phrases that I'd read in other people's fics. Keep in mind that until you find your own writing voice and style, you may have to borrow from the things you've read or otherwise come across. The most important thing though is just to start. [[http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/20058265/writing-fanfiction-a-big-list-of-writing-prompts][Take a writing prompt,]] or an idea of your own or perhaps no idea at all, and just write whatever comes to mind. Don't worry about if something sounds off or if you don't think it's believable. That's what editing is for. Just write.

...or a top politician and major racist, who in canon grabs the ear of the Minister for Magic, all on his own. Someone who we know has dark artifacts from the last Dark Lord himself. Someone who desires power, and has tasted it before: Lucius Malfoy.

What I'm saying is, that's sort of a weak thing to hang that change on. Doesn't automatically follow that smart = evil. Or that discrimination leads to masterminding mass murder and governmental overthrow in the future.

--------------

How about all that, but the point of major change is where Hermione snaps during OWLs from all the stress and harassment, and does a magical version of a school shooting. Just as emotionally charged, violent, and stupid as in real life. No romanticizing it. Half a dozen students die, and not necessarily the ones she'd been targeting.

And she gets away with it, like Tom did before. That begins her descent into evil.

--------------

Much more likely, logically speaking. Remember, no troll to bring the boys into her life. She'd have just cried alone in that bathroom all that night, and then continued to be lonely and teased, possibly for years. That follows directly from the initial "no Horcruxes, Voldemort dead" part, and makes the desired end result actually come about.

That is how you do a powerful plot bunny.

**** As the poster of the original plot bunny (as seen and explained, and later expanded upon [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/27dc0l/plot_bunnies_thread/chzssve][here]]), the Malfoy family does not go for leading positions because those tend to be replaced too often. Their MO is to attempt to be the power behind the throne, which we can see with Fudge / Wizengamot / Board of Governors and so on. In general, he's old money (estimated net worth by Forbes was $1.6 /billion/), and as such, doesn't have much to gain from becoming a Dark Lord himself.

***** Good stuff. I can see it. I'd still look for a nudge event, though. And a better plain than personal revenge. Tom's was finding the Chamber of Secrets and holding the school hostage for a good part of a year before killing someone, and then framing Hagrid to make sure Hogwarts didn't close. Knowing he was the heir of Slytherin lead him to believe he could and should rule magical Britain, if not the entire world.

Hermione needs both, too. A push and a plan. First, something to send her over the edge and actually take action. Doesn't need to be something anyone else recognizes, but big and public would be better. Something to make her go all-in. After that, a plan is formed, then lists and a schedule for taking over the world. Dark witches kill people. Dark Ladies /rule over/ people.

--------------

If no Horcruxes, maybe she just finds Tom Riddle's perfectly normal diary in her second year at Hogworts, stuffed behind a cracked tile in the third-floor girl's bathroom. No boy stuck inside writing back, sure, but it is still full of his notes on all the teenage-badass plans he had to show them, to show them /all/. And perhaps notes on how to use each and every one of the Unforgivables. She then has to use something she found there, something very Dark, in the heat of the moment to defend herself. And she finds she likes the clean and efficient results.

She's not charismatic. She doesn't have Gryffindor wrapped around her little finger, like Tom did with Slytherin. So maybe she doesn't want everyone to bow to her, but instead forms a plan to give power to the powerless, like house elves and maybe even Muggles themselves. They would be her army. Willing or not. And if a few pureblood bigots needed to get ground into potion ingredients in the process? Well, that's just the price of /progress/.

****** I can't take full credit for this idea (just most of it), since the germ of it started [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-rec-thread-the-eight-part-soul.291356/page-65#post-14473398][with this forum post]], and was expanded upon in that thread (where I post as "Pahan"), but one possible "nudge event" for Dark Lady Granger might take place in her second year.

Even if we take the original thread's premise that there are no Horcruxes, Tom Riddle's Diary may well still be a parasitic magical artifact that contains his mind-state upload. (It makes sense for Tom --- obsessed as he is with not dying --- to create a self-restoring backup of himself, though he only made one, because it was not a very satisfying solution: it would be only a copy of him that gets restored, after all.)

Said backup still ends up in the hands of Lucius Malfoy, the conflict between him and Arthur Weasley still takes place, and Ginny Weasley still gets the Diary. Animals, ghosts, and students are petrified.

Hermione, lonely and bitter though she might be, begins her own investigation, because, someone or something is hunting people /just like her/, and nobody seems to be doing anything about it. She may not be a Parselmouth, but one of the consequences of having no human friends is that she has become friends with Moaning Myrtle. With Myrtle's testimony and possibly other help, Hermione solves the mystery in the beginning of May, only to get Petrified on her way to inform the teachers.

She is awakened a month later, to learn that Dumbledore has been removed, Hagrid imprisoned, and Ginny (or someone else, if Diary had jumped) has vanished in the Chamber. She tells a teacher (or Pomfrey) about the basilisk and the location of the entrance to the Chamber (deduced thanks to Myrtle), but they do not have a Parselmouth who can open the Chamber, so they are unable to save Ginny or whomever might have the Diary at that point (though it is possibly too late by then, anyway), even though Dumbledore and Aurors are able to capture or kill Tom Riddle on his way out. (If captured alive, he is quickly executed, since nobody --- including the likes of Lucius Malfoy --- actually wants him around.)

Dumbledore is able to pressure Lucius to resign from the Board of Governors, but Dumbledore's own position is highly precarious (because a student /did/ die on his watch), and nothing more can be done against Lucius.

Hermione gets credit for solving the mystery, and she gets her Award for Special Services and her fifteen minutes of fame. Suddenly, everybody wants to be her friend (except for the Slytherins), and she even gets to hear nice things from people like Ron, like "Seems like you're a real Gryffindor after all!"

However, she also learns that Hagrid did not survive his stay in Azkaban.

It could be that the gentle giant's heart was not as resilient in the face of the Dementors as one might have expected (with him being in his mid sixties, and who knows what the life expectancy for half-giants is?), or it could be that an overzealous Dementor (and a hostile or negligent warden) got him Kissed. Either way, he has been killed --- or, worse, desouled.

With Hagrid being a relative nobody, a penniless, wandless, uncouth half-giant who wasn't that great a wizard even before he was expelled, and with Dumbledore's position being precarious enough as it is, there is nobody to push for justice, especially since the orders to put him in Azkaban had come directly from Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge.

Hermione is horrified, but she does not find a receptive audience in her campaign to get justice. Rather, she encounters indifference and thinly-veiled racism and classism (because something like that could never happen to a /proper/ wizard or witch), victim blaming (because it's Hagrid's own fault for messing around with dangerous creatures, drawing suspicion to himself), and general cynicism and a sense of helplessness. Dumbledore, in particular, deeply regrets what had happened, but he knows that if he pushes for more accountability in the fiasco, he is going to be caught up in it as well, so he chooses the lesser evil and keeps his head down. (Not, incidentally, Greater Good. That's Fanon. Dumbledore /rejected/ Greater Good. That's why he broke up with Grindelwald.)

Hermione can't let it go, though, and, soon enough, everybody who suddenly wanted to be her friend no longer does. Even the Gryiffindors, who agree with her in principle and in House solidarity with herself and Hagrid, don't see what can be done, and they don't like to be reminded of it.

Hermione is, once again, alone. She can accept that a tragic mistake had been made, but lack of consequences for Fudge or Malfoy and the general indifference tell her that the wizarding society in general and the Ministry in particular cannot be salvaged by working within the system. It is dead to her. Even that paragon of all that is good and right, Dumbledore --- the wizard who is a big part of why she had asked the Sorting Hat to put her into Gryffindor over Ravenclaw or Slytherin --- is, for all his magical capabilities and righteousness, unable to act within the law and unwilling to act outside of it. He and his teachings are dead to her as well.

Thus it begins. Hagrid /will/ get justice. All those oppressed and neglected, be they Muggleborn, Muggle, Squib, house-elf, centaur, werewolf, goblin, or not 100% human, /will/ get justice. The wizarding world /will/ change, or it will *burn*.

TL;DR: In the second year, Hagrid dies in Azkaban, and even though the real culprit is caught, nobody is held accountable. Hermione doesn't react well.

******* Really good. Like it.

Magical world culture and government is a very weak spot in the original series, which makes it a good target for anyone waiting to disillusion a protagonist. The sheer number bad people and ideas in the Ministry, and the dearth of good counter-examples, doesn't paint a pretty picture.

Even the leader of the "good guys," Dumbledore, is such a continual fuckup, irresponsible administrator, and absentee mentor figure that he seems automatically sinister to the rational reader, regardless of original intent.

Hence the wide array of evil or manipulative Dumbledore fics.

******** I like it too. Now, someone who can write dialogue worth reading, like yourself, needs to actually write it. (Speaking of Hermione taking over the world, how's /Harry Potter and the Witch Queen/ coming?)

I do think that, averaged over the authors who write these sorts of fics, the motivation for manipulative Dumbledore is about 20% Dumbledore's actual behavior and 80% the authors' desire to power-up Harry beyond all reason without admitting that powering-up Harry is a part of their AU's premise, rather than something actually supported by canon, because admitting /that/ would open them to justified accusations of writing a Gary Stu, especially since they tend to do it tastelessly. So, they invent conspiracy theories that Dumbledore had somehow suppressed Harry's awesome potential in canon, and the only change in the author's AU relative to their vision of canon is that the conspiracy unravels.

(Notably, powering-up characters /can/ be done tastefully. HP:WQ comes to mind.)

********* Interesting note on fanfic. I certainly agree. Character power creep is seldom handled well in fanfic, either in origin story or execution. Usually, even the best are worse than the worst Dragon Ball Z plotlines.

--------------

As for my fic: sure, this relates to the topic. And thanks for the compliment, but I think there is still a lot of room for improvement there for me. And in other places. Talking about my writing process and failures might help other writers, especially those first starting out.

So, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]] is alive and healthy. Almost have the next two extra-long chapters done, but I still want to make sure I end this storyline right. Might turn into three chapters if I can't trim it better. Or four.

I probably shouldn't mention at this point that I've written almost an entire other novel's worth of stuff since my last update. Just not all (or much, really) for that story. Sigh. There is a lesson there, somewhere.

My biggest block was that I had a bad case of "yelling at Dumbledore" that took something like a month to resolve in my sparse writing time. I'm over it now, after three or four rewrites of that section. Intelligent, informed, proactive characters confronting him without either freezing in place and saying nothing, or immediately listing his multitude of failures as a bludgeon to influence him is... harder than I thought.

Overall, the most important thing I'd change in my process now that I've written a lot more long-form fanfic is, finish the rough drafts of entire plotlines before starting to publish anything. Having a "good idea" of how everything will be resolved and lots of notes isn't really enough, at least for me. With a minimum framework written and available to refer to and revise, it's less stressful and there are fewer surprise delays.

That's where tastefulness comes in. You pull it off in HP:WQ, I think, for two reasons:

1. Your point of view character is not the same as your powered-up character and, in fact, has a very strongly expressed personality --- being mentally an adult with untreated PTSD, among other baggage.

2. Your powered-up character is Hermione, not Harry. That may seem like an arbitrary choice, but it has the benefit of being relatively unusual in the fandom /and/ there is also that --- at least in my thinking --- a powered-up Hermione is more interesting to read than a powered-up Harry, at least assuming their canon personalities and motivations remain more or less intact. In short, if you power up Harry to be more talented/powerful than Dumbledore and Riddle put together, that would make it much easier for him to protect people about whom he cares, defeat (non-lethally) people who threaten them, and make it easier for him to pass his classes, therefore leaving him with more time to play Quiddich, and his foes will neutralize him with the simple strategy of not targeting anyone he, personally, knows and cares about and not performing any dastardly deeds right in front of him. If you power up Hermione to be more talented/powerful than Dumbledore and Riddle put together, she'd be working on her own notion of the Greater Good to impose on the world (whether the world wants it or not) before the day is out, and then she'd be implementing it.

That's really Rowlings's fault for making canon Harry such a cypher. One can tweak that, of course, but then one ends up with a HINO, even farther into the Gary Stu territory. Not to say that it's impossible to pull off. For example there's /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ by The Santi, which features the most blatant HINO ever (to the point where it's the Twin Who Lived Nathan who goes through canon adventures at Hogwarts, while "Harry" goes off to Durmstrang). However, it also features a detailed, well-thought-out vision of Durmstrang that has become my hedcanon for it, as well as compelling and realistic NCs. But, that's a rare exception.

** The best advice I can give is to start writing with the character/scenario that you know best. If you find yourself always reading stories where, say, Harry becomes the next Dark Lord, maybe start with something like that, putting your own spin on it. Once you're more familiar with writing and have built up your skills a little, you can branch out, try out new characters or plots. It worked for me.

** Honestly, best advice that EVERYONE will give you is to write and once you have written something down (doesn't have to be much, maybe just a paragraph) read over it, if you like it and don't think you can make it any better then continue, if you think you could do better or hold yourself to a higher standard, then probably go over it. This probably is probably the best advice I can give you (I was/am a writer on Fanfiction.net, I'm on hiatus because of school), good luck.

I have a Fic idea, it involves Weasley bashing and probable Dumbledore bashing tho: 5th year Harry discovers he is being fed love potion (wow.... The cliches) and goes into a deep mood, only to be snapped out of it by some girl (any girl, doesn't really matter, except for Ginny of course haha, probably someone unpredictable like Daphne Greengrass etc.). Dumbledore finds out and goes apeshit. Going into the war Harry and his companion and friends (the DA, renamed of course, and Lupin,) are facing attacks from Voldemort and Dumbledore and the Order (minus Sirius (if he isn't dead), Lupin and the twins) in what is called the biggest war in both the muggle and wizarding world. Outcome up to you. Works as primarily a Romance/Action/Drama type Fic.

This idea is nowhere near perfect, I literally just came up with it like 5 minutes ago. It would be nice to see it be put into action. Don't sweat if you don't want to do it (I feel like an ass for saying that for some reason), just chuck me a PM regardless of the decision (that feeling just came back).

More advice, this is the longest post I have ever written haha, some essentials are Grammar, spelling, punctuation, Capital letters etc. These are essential to keep a readers attention, this will also make or break your Fic.Personally, if i see a fanfic with bad spelling etc, I will give it a chance, But if it doesn't improve I will likely stop reading.

Good luck and HAVE FUN doing it.

There are a lot of characters in the grayer areas of the conflict (the Malfoys obviously, but even Pettigrew to an extent) that would be happy if both sides just vanished by the end of canon, so you could pick one or two and explore them. There really is a lot to work with here.

Sirius is a shoe-in to protect Harry but he's hardcore pro-Dumbledore as his second priority (likely to go with "Albus Knows Best"), so that would be a problem and an interesting thing to explore. Snape is basically on a lifelong mission to see Voldemort dead and Harry alive, but there is the tendency to rely Dumbledore... but then again, if Remus (who owes Dumbledore basically everything good that ever happened to him) is going to go with Harry, then so would those two.

While the ideas are riddled with cliches, they aren't nearly as bad as some of the others. Writing in general is so full of cliches and near-incestuous influences that define genres (Tolkien has been ripped off so hard that by the time he was dead all his bones had already been picked clean) that any lit major would say that there exists no known truly original work from the last forty years or so outside poetry. So don't worry about it.

If you like the idea enough, write it. If not, you could narrow it down a bit (main character is Harry, supporting duo: Hermione and ???, mentor: Remus?, other adults: ???), write a general idea of the plot, choose locations, etc... play around with the idea. Our imagination is there to be enjoyed after all, it's what makes reading awesome :)

****** You can be a good person despite acting like an ass. It doesn't make you any less an ass.

You can make yourself feel better by putting others down. That will /never/ make you a bigger person.

******* Why did you go and have to launch a personal attack? I said his idea was terrible, you're the one one who insulted me.

******** Because you phrased yourself in a purposefully offensive way. You offered nothing constructive. The idea of an average kid discovering he's actually not normal, finding new friends with which he beats out pure-evilly-darkness and saves the world is a horrible cliche before HP. You literally did nothing but say: "whatever faults you found, you're right".

I didn't launch a personal attack. You behaved like an ass ("that thing you love, what you imagine as awesome, that you wrote down here to share with the world... it sucks") and I called you on it, similar to what you did to [[/u/CMacca99]] only without hiding behind passive-aggressive phrasing.

You created antagonism, purposefully, with the intent to do nothing positive. I at least have the moral fig leaf of doing a public service to this subreddit.
