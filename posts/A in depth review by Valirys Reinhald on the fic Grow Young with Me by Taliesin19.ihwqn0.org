Since Valirys is shadowbanned currently he asked me to post his review here. So here it is.

** Except the quality of review is on par with those on the DVD box. This is not a review, it is a promotion by a fan. There is not one weakness found, and although I like the story generally, it has plenty of those as well.

The glaring one is the length. With 233,370 words it is in the [[http://commonplacebook.com/art/books/word-count-for-famous-novels/][range]] of Jane Eyre, Moby Dick, or HP and the Half-Blood Prince. The question is, does it have enough plot to sustain this length? The answer is clearly no. There is not much more than “girl meets a boy, the boy is too lost in his own problems it takes some of her effort to get him out of his shell, the girl turns up to have problems as well, they are together”. It is possible to have a nice novel with so simple plot, but that Pride and Prejudice (which is similarly simple) is just half of it ([[https://www.janetogeorgette.com/word-counts-for-your-favourite-regency-romance-novels/][120,697 words]]).

Yes, it could be, that in the modern time with our twenty seconds clips we are not used to (an example is from “House of the Seven Gables” by Nathaniel Hawthorne) having a character waking up, dressing, and walking down the stairs (that's literally all that's happening) in twenty pages. But unfortunately, that's the audience the author writes for. And by the way, even The House of the Seven Gables clocks just [[https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/104/the-house-of-the-seven-gables/][108,616 words]].

*** Interestingly despite our short attention spans we (or at least I) often put up with long or boring writing in fanfiction for some reason. Not even realising I just read two whole novels in the space of a few days.
