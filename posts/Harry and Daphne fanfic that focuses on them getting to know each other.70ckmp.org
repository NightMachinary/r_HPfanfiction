********** OKAY. Let's remember for a second here this is a Harry Potter fanfic. One that is presumably set simply later in the original, canon HP universe. We know Harry's character. Even with this odd behaviour, we know Harry Potter would /never/ rape anyone. He would probably force someone to marry him to spite them, and then pretend they don't exist to spite them even more. Harry has shown himself to be a little bit of a vindictive bastard in canon. The actions he takes in the beginning of this fic- which you clearly did not read as much as skimmed through- make sense, and he makes a very rational, if morally ambiguous argument as to why he could easily live with refusing to revoke a contract drafted by his own parents.

Oh and by the way: fuck you, you addled fool with no understanding of logic or rationale. How in the /fuck/ did you read my comment and think, "Oh! He's saying marital rape is a lie! He thinks bad marriages are the same as forcing someone into a relationship!"

First of all I tried to read the fic a year ago and only stopped after 3 chapters. Secondly forcing someone to marry is not morally ambiguous its downright evil and thirdly I never said that he tried to rape her, only that he threatened to do so and he clearly makes her think that he will do it.

But i guess if you think that forcing someone in a relationship against their will destroyed their chance of raising a happy family and taking away their freedom is rational and logical. Then you simply lack the ability to empathize with the victim and nothing i can say will change you mind.

But for once put your self in her shoes and think how horrible would it be for ot to happen to you, your mother, your sister or anyone you care about just for once

Apparently Potter wants to find out if a relationship could work out and demands 5 dates, promising to cancel the agreements afterwards regardless of how it goes.

******** While many fanfics of this type usually add in the need to have sex for the contract to have effect, this one does not.

Thus he is not treathening rape, since there is no requirement to have sex. The gist was that Potter will gain from it in a business sense, and due to Voldemorts destruction of Potter property, he does not lose anything because of the contract, since it's already gone.

Admittedly he was being an arse in that scene, even if he didn't mean what he said.

********* That does not matter, Daphne does not know what is going on in his head and he does not tell her. He is letting her know in that scene that he is willing to force her to marry him and if you read the scenes beforehand when the lawyers discuss the contract you would know how few rights she would have.

So he does threaten her in that scene quite clearly and plainly.

Moreover even after that he forces her to date him, even if its for a little while he still disregards her choice and forces her to go on 5 dates with her in which he can easily manipulate her to get what he wants.
