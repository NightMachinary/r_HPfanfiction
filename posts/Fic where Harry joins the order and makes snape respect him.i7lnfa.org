:END:
Iirc in that part, Harry is at an order meeting, and snape and molly say he shouldn't join, and snape calls him spoiled, so Harry says “okay look through my memories” or something to prove what happened in his childhood. Snape like tried to pull back but Harry wouldn't let him, and forced snape to watch the memories. What's the name?


** The answer, for those curious, is Harry Potter and the sisters black
