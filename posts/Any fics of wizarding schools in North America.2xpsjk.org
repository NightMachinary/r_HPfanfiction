*** ^ Seconding Bellerophon. Sad she quit writing, but all three of her stories are above average quality, really long, and completed, so I can't be too sad. I do hope she pops back in in the future to drop another good one on us.

This fic has Harry transferring to a school in Minnesota of all places. I like that the author put in the effort to create a new school in an unexpected location, instead of going with something standard like Salem. I don't remember much from the story, but I think it's fairly decent. Mainly it was fun to read because the school is located in a real town in Minnesota that where I lived for a while. It was strange reading a fanfic and recognizing the places mentioned.
