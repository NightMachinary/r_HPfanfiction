Have I been reading to much Fan Fiction? I do not understand how Dumbledore could be so cruel, as to leave Harry with his mentally and physically abusive relatives without ever having checked on him? In the "Muggle" world the Dursley's would have been charged from everything from neglect, to straight up child abuse. Dumbledore kept a dangerous stone capable of bringing Voldemort back to life inside the castle, the very year Harry started at Hogwarts. A set of traps so easy, 3 first year students were able to overcome. Like Snape said, he literally raised Harry like a pig for slaughter. How is this man, who left Harry to face 10 years of abuse, seen as such an amazing character? I suppose it was all for the greater good... Hopefully wizards know about therapy.


** You have to understand something: the seven books of HP are almost like watching evolution occur in literary form.

The first three books are classic fairy tale stories, and are analogous to the finned-species that would eventually develop legs from their fins:

- Magical school
- Evil "step-parents" (ugly too, because why not)
- Old white bearded wise man
- Castles filled with talking paintings and three-headed dogs
- Villain with a snake-fetish and half-baked plans reminiscent of something a second-tier Captain Planet villain would come up with

The 4th and 5th books are where the changes become obvious, like you start seeing alterations to fins in fossils and see development of small or even vestigial legs:

- Larger world-building begins to occur
- Greater interaction in the magical world outside of Hogwarts for the main character
- Danger becomes a more constant threat, rather than just something that the happens once or twice in the books
- There is an exact point where you can say "okay that is where they started to develop working legs instead of just useless limbs." Its the moment Cedric is hit by the Killing Curse. Its no longer a fairy tale, its a war story, and anybody can die at any time. Magic is no longer just a whimsical tool, it can be a weapon of unimagineable horror.

By the 6th and 7th books, the whimsy and lightness has been utterly eradicated. To complete the analogy, legs are now fully developed and capable of supporting the species, and show up in all of its progeny. The books are now fantasy/war stories instead of fantasy/adventure/friendship stories. Examples include:

- Murder created soul-splitting
- A cave filled with an army of the undead
- Multiple deaths in stories of named characters that no longer become a story focus for the long term (Moody and Dobby)
- Demonstration of the moral gray area that people occupy (Dumbledore, Snape, Harry, etc.)
- Portrayal of the Death Eaters and Voldemort less as fairy tale villains and more like modern terrorist organizations (charismatic leader, central idea for rally point, use of guerilla tactics, etc.)

What I am trying to get at is that Rowling, intentional or not, began to change the style of the stories halfway through. This is understandable, given the nature of the main story arc, but it calls into question many of the story points and character decisions made especially in the earliest books (ex. giving time-travel to a 13 year old, practically everything about CoS).

She had a set story, and she wrote the books in essence to reach a handful of end points that she wanted with the minimum amount of additional story (they weren't exactly short books). This is partly why many "miraculous" situations resolve themselves in Deathly Hallows for Harry, Ron and Hermione (ex. what would have happened if Harry hadn't inexplicably said Voldemort after months of not doing so for no good reason).

** The canon story does not make much sense from a logical point of view. The author had this idea of a pauper becoming a prince and put her ideas to paper until she came up with Harry.

Fanfiction works around that by coming up with different ways to explain the implausible.

*** Canon CoS plot is awful:

- A 13 years solved the plot in an entry level creature book whereas the entire staff was basically useless. It's really a worst manifestation of the “useless adults” trope in children's literature.
- Petrifications in Basilisk attacks are actually the exception. You need tons and tons of luck to have 6 petrifications instead of someone getting killed.
- Dumbledore knew Hagrid was innocent, and he should know where Myrtle was. Why didn't he ask her a few questions during the 50 years in between? The CoS plot would be instantly solved if Myrtle just answered how she died. I personally think it's another case of “useless adults” or “stupid characters” tropes.
- JKR had a habit of dragging the plot until the end of the school year. Fic writers are under no obligation to do that.
- Basilisks were extremely dangerous creatures. Just imagine how many would have died if that thing had gotten into the Great Hall during a Feast! Since Hogwarts was Magical Britain's ONLY school, the damage of that attack to its future could be worse compared to London hit by a megaton range nuke. If Dumbledore really cared about his students and was not a dumbed down plot device, he should identify Myrtle's killer as a Basilisk long time ago and take drastic steps immediately after the first attack.
- Basilisks had one huge Achilles heels: roosters. I expect Dumbledore to seed the entire Castle with roosters after the first attack, if he figured out the truth of Myrtle's death.

I greatly appreciate authors who develop their own COS plot. Unfortunately, still too many rehash it, even some of the best ones.

Or maybe the indirect sight thing is a red herring. The basilisk must be able to see you clearly to kill with its gaze, and this one was nearsighted. And maybe Harry befriends the basilisk instead of killing it, and the Power the Dark Lord Knows Not is prescription lenses.

**** - Entry-level in the meta-narrative. Hermione didn't seem to be reading out of /Fantastic Beasts./ Plus, in-story /Fantastic Beasts/ is not the same and is also not necessarily complete, especially since Slytherin could have created a one-off hybrid. Most importantly, none of the sources mentioned petrification--only death. Seeing that, you're probably going to skip over that entry the first few times...I do admit it strains credulity, though.
- I thought it was implied that Tom learned his lesson last time and was actively avoiding killing people to keep the school from being closed.
- It would have helped. It would have taken some more detective work on Dumbledore's part, but yeah, he probably could have solved it. The bigger question is why did they let Hagrid keep working at Hogwarts when he was expelled for suspected murder?
- Definitely this. The plot could have been done in half a year. No attacks from December to May? No Quidditch matches from November to May? Yeah, JKR isn't great with time.
- Already wrote that one.
- Not even that far. If he figured it out, it would be a simple fix to blast the Chamber open and take a rooster down there.

** I love reading fan fiction for HP. The initial world was so wonderful, regardless of flaws, that so many people have been able to express themselves creatively in it.

I'm always tickled and excited when writers bring things up that make me go... Oh yeah! I remember coming across one where Hermione asked Remus if he was renamed after he was bitten. And while reading the books I was so pro-Gryffindor that I cheered like Rowling wanted me to when Dumbledore gave all those points out at the end of year feast and Gryffindor ended up winning. But it didn't occur to me, until many fan fiction authors mentioned it, how cruel and unfair that was to Slytherin students.

****** When you do something wrong, is your first thought to go and say something to the authorities? To make yourself look bad, maybe even be sent to Azkaban? Probably not.

Besides which, I think you are forgetting that it was not common knowledge that Voldemort didn't die in Godric's Hollow. Hagrid and Dumbledore are pretty much the only ones who indicate otherwise until he shows up himself to Harry in the forest (or in Quirrel form apparently). And Hagrid pretty much takes what Dumbledore says as sacrosanct. It is entirely within belief for almost everyone else in their world that Voldemort really was dead; after all, no one understood why he was gone in the first place. People tend not to ask too many questions when "miracles" happen, because they are too afraid what they might find.

Also, the way you say "responsible for the second war" is terribly misleading. You could say the same thing about Harry: sparing Pettigrew lead directly to the second war. You can say the same about Dumbledore: not stopping Voldemort when he was younger lead directly to /both/ wars. Should we blame them, and any number of others in canon who are "responsible fo the second war" because of their actions.

I think you missed the point of Snape, Regulus, and Slughorn in the story though. All of them were conceited, or ambitious, or spiteful, or jealous and so on. And yet, when the time came, they found that there were things that were *more important* than blood purity or identity or jealousy or greed. With Regulus, he knew it was a horcrux. He knew what that meant, that Voldemort had split his own soul through murder. It emphasized how little he cared for anybody, not just the house elf. If he needed further proof, the army of inferi in the lake further established this fact to him.

******** Or...he turned because Voldemort, despite his begging and the incredible benefit of the information Snape provided, still killed Lily anyway. It points out Voldemort doesn't care about anybody, even when it would require practically no effort. Thats the whole point of Voldemort's character: he loses every time against Harry because he cannot understand the importance of love.

Snape is an asshole. He is petty, vindictive, and someone I would never want to know, even his movie version. But the point of his story is that love was more important than anything else to him. He willingly rejected his other long held beliefs because of it.

Still doesn't make him good (despite what Harry may have claimed afterwards), its just more of Rowling's hammering the whole "love conquers all" theme.

Fics often find easy solutions to these problems, but as described in canon, it's entirely possible Dumbledore's trail would go cold before Voldemort returned.

Perhaps had he not taken points of Gryffindor for stupid reasons they'd be somewhat even, but even then let's not forget it was McGonogall who took 150 point from Gryffindor in one night, so actually it was their own damn fault that gryffindor was in last place.

****** And still the most damage from the house points did not come from Snape, but McGonogall for their own actions, which means as much as we "See" snape taking points which is all of what 1-2 potions classes in PS? it doesn't seem to matter.

Slytherin had: 472 Gryffindor: 312 Ravenclaw:426 Hufflepuff: 352

Now let's see Harry and company lost 150 points by themselves. So if they hadn't that'd be 462. Combined with the points they lost from other teachers excluding Snape comes out to be 467. IF you added the points Snape took back into the equation it brings it up to 479. A mere +12 points that we know were taken for sure. But those -12 points Snape took were less than the -20 points taken from Draco by McGonogall and therefore cross it out. Furthermore, if Snape were taking so very many points from other houses all the time, then I hardly doubt they'd all be so close. Even with Snape taking points unfairly, they had 6 other classes in First year alone, and 8 other classes Third Year and Up to gain more points with different professors. You have 10 other professors against one. It was more than likely that they also got points taken from other professor's. Which they easily could have avoided those and won now couldn't they?

Snape is unfair, and shouldn't have taken points without having a legit reason for doing so. But even with him doing so, Gryffindor still could have won the legit way. Had they even attempted to do so. They could have followed the rules so McGonogall didn't have to take all those points. They all (All Gryffindors 1-7 years) could have actually studied and done as much as they could to gain points, especially Harry and Ron who after all lost the house a good 100 points on their own and 50 more that Hermione did. But God forbid Ron and Harry don't copy Hermione's notes and homework and actually do their own work, and studying, so they may know the answers and may know how to gain said points back. But alas.

Snape is unfair, well so is life. People can sit back and whine about that and blame the world for being so unfair, or they can just go find a way of making it better regardless. And given that Gryffindor could in fact win regardless of Snape's influence I blame Gryffindor themselves.

The word you are looking for is plot holes, inconsistency and loose structure of story with no clear picture. It was intended for an audience that claps when hero saves the day instead of audience that might look into a story and say, 'wait! What?' And that's what gives fanfiction so much leeway. There is so much information that can be used to fill the gaps and every inserted clog seem to fit the greater system and make it work.

****** To me Dumbledore never seemed to be intended as perfect or all knowing. Harry, at 11 years old, sees him as such because he's a child. Other adult characters see him as a leader and a role model because he is inteligent and a war hero (Grindelwald as well as Voldemort) and an educator. But every character in the HP verse, from the very beginning has always had more than one side to them. Ron is loyal and funny and righteus, but also jealous and callous and thoughtless. Hermione is smart and empathetic, but condecending and arrogant. Harry is good at puzzle solving, brave, passionate and overall a very good friend but he overlooks many things, can be thoughtless and is quick to anger. McGonagal is fair but strict. Malfoy is crule but witty. Almost everyone, from book one, has good and bad sides.

So to me Dumbledore developing more (and even Petunia and Dudley later on) doesn't feel any more "tagged on" than Snapes backstory. In fact it feels much less so. We don't see much of him in the fist few books. He's mostly just there for one or two scenes, not nearly enough to get to know him well as a character. The more we later learn about him the more rounded he gets.

I really appreciate the moral dilemma Dumbledore had to face in knowing he had to either set Harry up to be miserable with the Dursleys or set him up to die. Because that's what would have happened. He'd have lost his blood protection and been dead against Quirrel at the end of book one. I think it's unfair to afford every other character their flaws and not do it for Dumbledore just because he "should have found a better way". There wasn't one. That's it.

I think the fact that his plan worked it also something that many people forget. Harry was a horcrux and for all intends and purposes should not have survived the end of book 7. He did because of Dumbledore betting on the smallest hope that if the blood protection from Lily, that Harry and Voldemort shared, was maintained, it would mean the Voldemort would not be able to kill him.

I mean, you can criticise JK for writing the HP universe that way I guess, but I cannot stand this trend in fandom where people seem to blame Dumbledore for everything from Voldemort's rise to the Dursleys not caring for Harry as they should have. Other people made choices too which lead to these things. Petunia could have chosen not to blame an infant for being magical, but she did. Tom Riddle could have chosen not to go around killing people, but he did. I do not blame Dumbledore for his optimism and his will to give a second and third and a thousandth chance to literally everyone, up to and including the person literally in the process of trying to murder him. In fact, I admire him for it. Some of the time it worked out for him as we see with Hagrid and Snape and Remus, sometimes it didn't. The Dursleys are the best example.

A lot of these things are down to genre and theme in the HP novels. The idea that the underdogs will win, that love, loyalty, family and friendship are more powerful than physical or magical or political strength. The hero has to overcome adversity to reach happiness. I think it's important to remember that JK is also an abuse survivor, and at the time when she was writing the first book lived off of government aid as a single mother. The books are a reflection of her experience. (Which can be clearly seen in how she writes the ministry for one but that's another wall of text and this reply is too long already.)

******* I didn't say Dumbledore was to be seen as perfect, but as virtuous and wise. The issue is we see him directly put Harry in those circumstances. He even admits to knowing what would happen to him there. It's not even clear the bond of blood protections were better than other options such as the Fidelius. After all, he would later be attacked right up the road from Privet Drive and House elves could Apparate right into his room (imagine of Lucius had realized he could order Dobby to teleport Harry away from the warded home).

So it's far more complicated than "He goes there and lives otherwise he dies". JKR seems to have had the idea for the tried and true "hero comes from poor circumstances", but the way she constructed her world made things lose cohesion. Dumbledore is great in many ways, but never even checks in on Harry? That's just neglect.

Also, you have to be careful with JKR's history. As I recall, she said that someone had inflated her life story a bit. She was on government assistance for a few months. Definitely not fun, but it was, I suspect, not the entire inspiration for Harry and her story.

Gandalf knew what he asked of Frodo would lead to pain and suffering of the innocent Hobbit . He asked anyway, for the greater good, without really warning Frodo in any kind of detail what he would face..

Obi Wan, who is a wizard of sorts , knew Luke would find out how he was kept in the dark eventually. He took him on the quest anyway.

Dumbledore could be excused for assuming Harry's last relatives would treat him nicely. We are constantly shown that Dumbledore can be forgiving and assume the best in others. And then we are told exactly the opposite. JKR couldn't maintain that core contradiction in the series, that Dumbledore was wise and good, and yet didn't realize how awful Petunia and Vernon were (and after all, McGonagall told him in book 1 that Dudley was not a good influence). So we had to be told that literally there was no other choice because of course Dumbledore knew. Which forced a change in him being the paragon of good, and made a more complex view of him necessary.

Being stunned by revelations that you are a pawn in a bigger story is not unusual .

One of the most famous thing about this specific series is that book 1 is written for a child audience, and it gets increasingly complex as it goes on. So many things that appear simple or relatively innocent in book 1 appear less so later on. People fall over in a slapstick way when talking about He Who Must Not Be Named... later, we learn about torture and terror and other things that aren't funny at all. That's not a contradiction.

******** No, not really. The Dursleys were always terrible, and Dumbledore is not naive. But remember, Dumbledore is not the villain. Harry got screwed by Voldemort. Prophecy discovered by Voldy's minion. Parents murdered by Voldy. He's at risk from age 1 for the rest of his life, until he is old enough / powerful enough to fulfill the prophecy. So he is stuck in a nasty safehouse (Dursleys) until he is 11 years old. Then he goes to Hogwarts, where he is still at quite a bit of risk. Dumbledore's main fault, and open regret, is that he didn't foresee the risk of Tom Riddle and destroy him before he gained power. You definitely could argue that Dumbledore should have placed Harry with a loving wizarding family; that he didn't is a calculated move that--- in the end--- actually worked out pretty well.

** Dumbledore didn't raise Harry for slaughter. He manipulated Voldemort into using Harry's blood during the resurrection ritual, so that Harry would become immortal as long as Voldemort was alive, therefore giving Harry a way to survive having his horcrux removed.

He didn't tell Snape or Harry this, because he wanted Harry to believe he really /was/ going to die, so that when Harry "sacrificed himself," and "died," it would activate the same blood-love magic that Lily used to save Harry as a baby, therefore making Voldemort unable to harm anybody that Harry was trying to protect.

Notice that I put "died" and "sacrifice" in quotations, because at no point did Dumbledore actually plan for Harry die; he knew Harry would come back.

There's also an explanation for Dumbledore's actions in the Philosophers Stone, and for why Dumbledore didn't remove Harry from the Dursley's, but those explanations require a little conjecture and a /huge/ wall of text. I might make a longer post that goes into the details of Dumbledore's plan, if anyone wants to read it.

At that point, Dumbledore strongly suspected Harry was a horcrux. I don't think he got hard evidence of that until Book 5, but either way, he appears to have begun working on that assumption, trying to find a way to kill Voldemort that left Harry alive. He may have believed Harry had to die for a little while, but /not/ from the start.

At the end of Book 3, Trelawney's prophecy made it more concrete. Voldemort was prophesied to come back bodily. It's hard to say when, but sometime before the end of Book 4, Dumbledore figured out the blood protection loophole and correctly predicted that Voldemort would sew the seeds of his own downfall.

In fact, it's clear in in GoF that he didn't realize the possibility until after Harry told him how Voldemort returned ("something like triumph appeared in his eyes"), and in OoTP it's clear (as JKR confirmed) that Dumbledore didn't realize Harry was a Horcrux until then (the line, "But in essence divided?").

Dumbledore thought the Prophecy gave Harry an out, but it wasnt until GoF that he could actually see a way for it to happen. Harry was a sheep to slaughter, at the very least intentionally put in an abusive home (inarguable, Dumbledore says so in OoTP).

**** Sorry mate, but I don't agree.

Triumph requires success, which requires an attempt, which implies a plan.

The "but in essence divided" line is immediately followed by a look of satisfaction on Dumbledore's face --- /not/ a look of realization, which means he already knew (or at least suspected) that Harry was a horcrux, and that test merely confirmed Dumbledore's theory.

Plus, once you know that Voldemort has horcruxes then it's not hard to figure out that Harry is a horcrux himself, and I can't imagine Dumbledore not entertaining this theory from at least Book 2.

Also, your two points are logically incompatible with each other. First, you say that Dumbledore realized Harry didn't have to die in book 4. Then, you say that Dumbledore realized that Harry was a horcrux until book 5.

If Dumbledore didn't know Harry was a horcrux until book 5, then he would have literally /no/ reason to think Harry needed to die during book 4, and therefore wouldn't have had a moment of triumph when he learned of Voldemort's resurrection.

Also, I think it's worth pointing out that even if you're right about Dumbledore learning Harry was a horcrux in book 5, then that means Dumbledore never /ever/ actually planned to sacrifice Harry. If he did only learn that Harry was a horcrux in book 5, then that means he had already realized Harry could survive /before/ he realized Harry needed to die; there was never a point when Dumbledore knew Harry needed die without already knowing Harry would survive his "death."

Therefore, Dumbledore never thought of Harry as a sheep to slaughter.

As for the Dursley situation, I'm writing up a more lengthy post that explains my views on that, and if you want I'll link you to it when it's done and we can continue this discussion there.

Fair enough. But he had no way of ensuring he survived until Voldemort unwittingly gave him the way. That's a big reason why he was afraid to tell him the Prophecy, as Voldemort having an unknown number of Horcruxes made the conclusion of the Prophecy seem inescapable since Harry would never run.

Harry being a horcrux was the dominant fan theory between the release of Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows. Some fans had even predicted that a part of Voldemort's soul was within Harry years before the existence of Horcruxes was even revealed.

I'm just saying, if uneducated fans can figure it out, then Dumbledore should have some idea.

That being said, your JKR interview is The Word of God, and I don't really have a response to it. However, JKR also insists that the lunch lady on the Hogwarts Express was actually a secret magical terminator, so, YOLO --- fuck it --- I'm sticking to my theory anyway.

*** That's not fact! Where did Dumbledore manipulate TMR? Sorry, but I don't see it! In fact I seem to remember Voldemort doing that because he a) wants to breach Harry's protection and b) because he sees Harry (because: Prophecy!) as his main enemy! Dumbledore's blood would probably have been ok, too but he can't best Dumbledore in his weakened state (hell: He never actually could best Dumbledore) and all other sources of blood of the enemy aren't as potent (Moody would work, Crouch after all had him under lock and key!), so he kind of had to go with Harry!

I agree that Dumbledore raised Harry as a sacrificial lamb! A person raised with higher self-esteem and self-value wouldn't easily lay down their life after all (especially for a world that alternates between worshipping the ground he walks on and villifying him for being "the heir of slytherin" or "a deranged murderer")! No, Dumbledore IMHO knew what he was doing (otherwise he would have never talked about condemning Harry to "...ten dark and difficult years..."), he wasn't enjoying it but that doesn't mean that what he did isn't WRONG on so many levels!

ps: Also: Why not capture Voldemort, let Harry live a long life and then kill Voldemort once Harry is dead?

I'm writing a super long post about this, but the gist of it is that the events of the Philosophers Stone were not actually about protecting the stone --- it was all a charade by Dumbledore to trick Voldemort into seeing a prepubescent 11 year as a credible threat. It was only after the Philosophers Stone that Voldemort decided to use Harry's blood in his resurrection ritual; before he encountered Harry in the first book, Voldemort considered Dumbledore to be his greatest enemy. It's worth keeping in mind that Voldemort didn't know he couldn't touch Harry until /after/ the events of the first book.

But this is more or less a pet theory of mine, so don't take it as fact.

*** True, Harry interfered where he shouldn't have. However, it could be argued he was meant to. As many have pointed out, all of the obstacles were easy enough for first years to make it through.

How could each have made it harder and more protected? That would be fun to think about.

Maybe mandrakes instead of the Devil's Snare for Sprout's. Even baby ones are supposed to knock you on your ass without earmuffs, right? So if someone went down there unprepared... Bam! :D Stick a key to the door in a pot under a mandrake. You need to unpot it to get that key.

Problem is, mandrakes were introduced in book two...

Side note for the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone in the mirror... There had to be a failsafe to get the stone it somehow, right? Because, aside from Harry, who would want it, but not to use it? Let's you live forever, turns metal into gold... And if there's a failsafe (Dumbledore has to get it back out somehow) it might be able to be overcome.

** I am no Dumbledore fan, but cut the old man some slack. Nobody could have figured out Voldy's secret about horcruxes like Dumbledore did. Considering how universally hated Severus was, nobody else would have bothered to utilize his talents and make him a spy. Sure, in the end, Harry and his friends did all the heavy-lifting and killed the baddies, but it was all made possible because of Dumbledore's tactics and guidance. Without him, the order was destined to fight a losing battle, let's be honest.

Also, I always like to think Dumbledore retained some of those 'For the Greater Good' philosophies from his cavorting days with Grindelwald. Because it explains why he was always a bit callous towards emotions, pain and suffering at the individual level, and was willing to manipulate people in the worst possible ways in order to achieve the greater goals.

I was just thinking this yesterday. A brilliant Severus-Lily fanfic that I had thought was abandoned, ended up being completed last year, and by the time I finished with it yesterday, I finally realized that I could no longer go back to the books again. Sure, I might have taken a quick peek now and then, to relieve specific moments or check up on facts, but I could not read them again from start to finish because fan fiction had warped my mind - kinda turned me from Smeagol to Gollum. James Potter had already transformed, in the space of one book, from being one of the coolest dads ever and an all-round awesome guy to someone who brought back my worst memories of being bullied in school. But when I realized that the books expected us to forget this revelation about James and go back to remembering him with fond memories, I turned to fan fiction and over-indulged, so much so, that reading too much to reinforce what I felt about James in the end made me hate my favourite character from the whole series - Sirius!

** Everyone forgets that the actual books are books. JKR wrote them and then a publisher ripped them to pieces before they actually went into print.

Fanfiction is a totally different world, we can write whatever the hell we want to and make it as long or as short as we want with zero consequences. An actual published author does not have that priviledge. The first drafts of PS were twice as long as the published versions, and a publisher told her that they would never print a childrens book if it was over 50k words. JKR essentially created the young adult genre of fiction where books can be adult novel length and still appeal to younger audiences. It wasnt until GoF that she was actually given free reign to write the books how she wanted, and even then her editors most likely tore the drafts apart until they reached a final manuscript.

I say all of that because when people bash canon in comparison to fanfiction they usually forget the limitations placed on the original author. They aren't writing in the same conditions that fanfiction authors are writing in.

And those were cases were the child abuse was blatantly obvious, while in Harry's case they may have even just judged that his treatment is not bad enough to be deemed child abuse.

Finally, I'd like to mention that while there are many aspects to the Harry Potter universe that stem from Rowling's shortcomings as a writer, I think many of the things that often get critisied as too unrealistic are specifically intended that way, to point out the problems of society she grew in herself. Snape's abuse of his pupils, Umbridge's abuse of her authority with the students and larger population just meekly accepting it all, the ineptitude and corruption of the Government, the bigotry, the cowardice, etc.

#+end_quote

By which metric? She is certainly not unpaid (which would be the usual definition), quite the opposite in fact. She also has approperiate education: A Bachelor of Arts in Classics from Exeter, so she is certainly quite knowledgable about literature.

Her worldbuilding is sometimes slightly inconsitent, but even the best-paid pros at Disney (seemlingly) fuck /that/ up.

However, her characters are usually great, have motivations, the world is lovely, the stories are easy to understand yet have depth, she juggles multiple themes perfectly, and - most importantly - her works are very enjoyable.

Like you can critique her all you want, her books are far from perfect.

But calling her an amateur? That is completely and utterly moronic.

Considering it was her first novel, i think noun1 ,noun3 and or adj 1/ adj 3 can be correctly used. No one is saying she's inept NOW,, but what else would you use to describe a new author ? Keep in mind that she worked as a researcher/secretary before that...its not like she studied to be a writer in school or something.
