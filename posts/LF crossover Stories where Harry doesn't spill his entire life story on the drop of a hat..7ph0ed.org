I was browsing crossover stories lately and come across something annoying on the most of them. Whenever Harry really gets angry he starts to spill his entire life story. Boohoo I was abused since childhood, brought into a secret society composed of idiot people who thought I was Jesus, Forced into the role of a Hero for ungrateful society, oh woe is me! boohoo... Anyway ranting aside, I'm looking for stories with Cool headed Harry, who does not spill his life story on the drop of a hat, plays that cool uncle.


** /Browncoat, Green Eyes/ is a really fun Firefly x/o, and you don't get into the meat of who Harry is until about halfway through. It's a great read.

** speaking of dropping life stories at the drop of a hat i've never actually seen a story where the sorting hat wasn't restricted on giving out info.

wouldn't it be neat to find out that he has no restrictions at all and would basically tell anyone anything if he liked them?

*** You'd have to set the fic between the first ever sorting and the morning afterwards. You know, the time it takes for the parents to learn about it and decide to burn the hat and take their kids away from a school that effectively condones mindrape and spreads the retrieved secrets to the wind. Seriously, the hat is already creepy enough as it is.

** linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) It takes at least a dozen chapters (And they are /long/ chapters) for Harry's past to be revealed.

*** To be fair, they represent something like two weeks time 'in-universe'. That story has some serious pacing issues. Still like it though.

**** I never get the complaints about pacing. Sometimes life moves incredibly fast. In other moments nothing happens for weeks. Sometimes people meet and end up having sex within six hours. Others take years of relationship to be comfortable with that step. Sometimes you meet people and feel comfortable around them after an hour. Or you hang out in the same circles for years before making a deeper connection.

So why should fiction treat this differently? Forcing every story into the same pacing restricts creativity and removes plot options.

#+end_quote

Because they're entertainment meant to keep your interest, and if there are extended stretches of slow parts it's boring and a slog to read through.

But nothing's necessarily wrong with having weird pacing and slow parts, it's just that many readers will find it hard to remain interested.

****** The problem this fic has is more along the lines of the fact that each scene takes up something like 10k words and spans about 20min in-universe time, and then there is a skip to next scene, so there is no natural sense of progression in the story, no sense of passing time.

***** Its over 600,000 words and there has been no active romance in the fic, even though its tagged romance.

I know what I get in a Kathryn fic though, so its all good.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307781/1/Heroes-Assemble][Heroes Assemble!]] by Stargon1 might be you would like to look at. It's a HP and MCU crossover that includes other known Marvel characters. Harry is basically left England to explore the world, not really staying in one place too long. He simply want to be a wizard sort of traveler who would be learning about culture.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.
