Hey guys, im looking for a fic i started recently but then closed without realizing. What i remember about it was that nevile was the BWL and harry sees him talking to sirius in the fireplace and is mad about that.

Harry also draws as a hobby and tonks finds his notebook early in the fic. tonks also becomes his friend after that.
