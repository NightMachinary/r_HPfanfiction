Pretty simple request tonight. I'd like to see fics where the four champions bond and become friends. Preferably short, fluffy stories, but longer ones are acceptable as well. For longer ones, I'd like to see Cedric survive and remain friends with Harry (as opposed to becoming a Death Eater for some odd reason. Fanfiction is weird sometimes /s). I like the idea of them teasing each other, sneaking out to the Hog's Head for drinks after the tasks, etc. Bonus points if they don't take the tournament seriously as a result of developing a friendship with their "rivals".

No bashing (unless it's the champions making fun of the tournament or the organizers.)

Thanks!


** linkffn(11534019) has them being friends and going for lunches and stuff. Not the main focus by any means, but it's a more laid back environment I would say.
