#+TITLE: Most marriage law fics seem to be badly and cliche-ly written with very ooc behavior. Did anyone here come across a well written one?

I like the premise of marriage law, and I'd like to read a well excuted one! Can be any pairing, any length, any category, as long as the writing is on a high level.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4661762/1/The-Gilded-Cage][The Gilded Cage]] was one I particularly liked - it's HG/SS and I think they did a really good job of staying in character!

** Ok. So, I've been reading fanfiction for longer than it took to get through the books. So my notion of OOC is..skewed. But, I'm very much into well-written stories and don't stand for simpering, stupid, immediate changes in behavior. On that note, here are some of my favorites

I hope a few of those are ones you might enjoy.

**** Yay! I sometimes feel like my tastes in ffic have become so non-canon that I'm of very little use to the sub. But hopefully some of these are up your alley.

** There's a couple of really old ones that I recall (I admit I don't really go for these types of stories anymore). Both are one-shots:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]] by S'TarKan (of Nightmares of Futures Past fame).
