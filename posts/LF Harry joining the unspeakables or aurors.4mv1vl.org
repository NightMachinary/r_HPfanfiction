I'm looking for fics where Harry joins the unspeakables or aurors. Harry needs to be at least above average in power/skill. The fic needs to contain fight scenes (either in training or in the field). Romance/relationships are ok as long as they are not the primary focus of the story. A good example would be Harry Potter and the summer of change.

Please no drama stories about politics as an auror or something equally as boring. Thanks

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially not one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

#+begin_quote
  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

** linkffn(Case 129) is a one-shot that involves Aurors and Harry, but not necessarily the way you mean. It's really good though. More details would spoil it.

** If youre cool with slash, The Boy Who Lived Twice (linkao3(330906)) is really good. It's a "secret identity" fic like I've never read before. In it, Draco and Harry are both Unspeakables - but Unspeakables in this fic are spies who use polyjuice (even amongst themselves) to hunt criminals. No Unspeakables know who the other Unspeakables really are - even their own partners. They work in pairs and Draco and Harry are partnered and neither knows who the other really is, until accidentally Draco finds out Harry is Harry...

The slash is pretty smutty, so you have got to be okay with that, but the fic is REALLY well written and unusual. The action scenes are also cool and well done.
