I've read Winds of Time, of course, but I was wondering if there are any recommendations?

Edited to say I just noticed that you asked for Harmony, not Hermione. I don't know of any fics where Harry and Hermione as a couple go back, sorry.

  Sirius Black's life has gone completely haywire. Disowned. Related to Death Eaters. His brother hates him and his best friend is a stalker. Lucky for him, he's never had problems with a girl. Until now.
