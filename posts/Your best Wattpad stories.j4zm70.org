Hii everyone. I was wondering if you got any good Wattpad stories? I usually read about Draco, Fred or Oliver Wood, but I can read about any of the cast really. I want something that stands out from the rest, but if you would just give me some tips I would be really happy! (Sorry about the english btw it's not my first language)


** Muggle by TinaX2 or Potter by TinaX2 are really good! The Marauders by Pengiwen is also really really good, it goes from year 1 to year 7, and then it covers their lives while working for the Order.
