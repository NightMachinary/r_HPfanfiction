For some reason the fandom loves to bash the Weasleys/Dumbledore to the point of obsession. I'm just curious as to what stories that you've read or even heard about that have the worst amount of Dumbledore/Weasley bashing. Which fics have their most evil portrayal ever? Let's discuss!


** I can't remember the name, but the worst Dumbledore I read made me stop and just go, "Damn." Early scene had baby Harry using accidental magic to make his toys float. Dudley and Petunia were laughing and playing along when Dumbledore burst in the house. Petunia turned, "Professor Dumbledore, thank you for bringing Harry us. It's like having my sister back."

... hrm, can't have a happy, well adjusted Harry, "OBLIVIATE! You hate Harry!"

  Harry is hit by a misfired undoing spell in third year and starts to remember things causing him to flee together with Hermione and a few others, including a godfather he didn't know he had. For Wizarding Britain and Dumbledore in particular old oaths and secrets are now brought to light. Dumbledore bashing, AU. / Story ends at the end of third year.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]], a H/G author, writes imho the worst Dumbledore/Weasley bashing. Usually, authors go easy on Arthur and the Twins, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]] paints ALL of them in a very bad light as they sold out their own daughter to the Ministry. Dumbledore was first killed in an ambush and later sentenced to eternal torment by Harry through the Resurrection Stone.

In his forced marriage one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11367427/1/In-the-Heat-of-the-Night][In the Heat of the Night]], every Weasley except Ginny got again bashed into oblivion, with no redemption.

In the dimensional time travel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3751748/1/Harry-Potter-and-Merlin-s-Reaper][Harry Potter and Merlin's Reaper]], Voldemort won the first war, murdered Arthur and Molly, and corrupted all remaining Weasley children.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

***** Oh gosh I've read that one. I was in it for the Harry/Hermione pairings but it was not worth it and the absolute worst. Bashing aside the levels of potty humor were disgusting, and Ron has never been more OOC including fics where Ron is a death eater. I wish I had brain bleach to wipe away the memory of that fic it was so bad. Where's an obliviate when you need one?

** one of them was a next gen story with an old bitter harry talking with rose

as ron and hermione had fled the country due to stress from the war and never returned sounds intresting, they could both be filled with regrets and remorse

Only we discover ron turned abusive and his entire family disowned him and its not like it was a slow decent in which we discover ron was broken by leaving harry behind nah its a throw away line about how they are divorced and ron was kicked out of the family for abuse

another ron turned into a rapist
