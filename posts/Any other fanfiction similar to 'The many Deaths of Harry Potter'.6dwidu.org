Absolutely loved the fanfic and devoured it within one day. Someone feed me more


** Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon might fit your criteria.

It has Harry and Hermione working closely together and repeatedly going back in time should one of them die followed by repeated attempts at correcting past mistakes and new takes on canon events. Major differences would be that the time travel starts later and Harry doesn't become as morbid and/or ruthless. linkffn(6517567)

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** Do you mind slash? This fic is somewhat in a similar tone although not really that similar.

linkao3(Again and Again)

Harry keeps getting thrown back in time every time his life ends and is trying to find a way to get it to stop. Although in this fic he gets tired of looping and decides to not kill Voldemort and team up with him instead.

The summary is not very accurate. Harry isn't really evil/dark and his power and experience is well portrayed. Dumbledore bashing is not really bashing most of the time since his behavior is somewhat understandable since Harry is ignoring him and prophecy. The slash between Tom and Harry is not too bad since it's skippable and Harry ends up making him mostly sane and look more like Tom Riddle rather than Voldemort.

*** It's a good fic overall really, the slash itself is tolerable (said by someone who avoids slash like the plague) but it does fall off a bit in quality towards the end. It's a trope I've noticed in a lot of fics, when sex is introduced to the story it often loses its way a bit as far as the plot goes and it feels like the writer is pushing characters into situations rather than the characters themselves getting there.

**** I have definitely noticed the same thing. I just don't understand how writers can write something with a good plot, great writing, good chacterization and then completely derail all their work just for two characters to get together and start acting super OOC. They clearly understand how to write welI, but choose not to on purpose. It's really disappointing and one of the reasons why I tend to be weary of fics with any kind of romance.

***** I don't mind reading stories with romance /in/ them -- but they're a sight different than romance /genre/ stories, (which have a very specific set of conventions and plot expectations). One should not turn into the other partway through the story. It's just sloppy and infuriating and half the reason that I avoid shippy shit.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.

I wished the writer wouldn't have forced their hand to write it as slash :( going canon with Snape's perspective of having to go back in time constantly would have been fantastic and maybe the only change would be at the end when Harry sees Snape dying in his own blood, Snape would have included sets of memories where he time travelled so much to make sure Harry wouldn't have died
