Hello everyone!

I'm looking for fics where Harry began speaking Parseltongue at an early age (reason for this doesn't particularly matter, just that Parseltongue is something he spoke often as a child) and it left an accent when he was speaking English. An example fic would be Child of Azkaban (linked at the bottom). Let me know if any of you have any recommendations!

linkao3(Child of Azkaban)

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

** It is not really what you're looking for and it really doesn't play any part in the story so far but in linkffn(Harry Potter, Geek of Magic) "snakes don't speak it [Parseltongue] among themselves. Snakes don't actually have language. When the minds of the snake and the parselmouth connect, the snake uses the parselmouth's own language faculties." Sounding concerned, Hermione said, "So how words translate back and forth is just how Harry's mind works." (Chapter 17)

So it's more like his Parseltongue has the accent. But that really only appeared twice or so in the story, but i can recommend reading it nonetheless.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

Parsel is a pretty good one. They talk repeatedly about him having an accent.
