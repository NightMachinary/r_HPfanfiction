****** Rather than saying that the load was named after the magic item, it would be more right to say that both item probably got the same name because of their shape.

The word "*Baguette*" comes from the Italian "*Bacchetta*", which may be derived from the Latin "*Baculum*" or "stick" (though the etymologie is uncertain). So in France, une "Baguette" is a small and thin stick:

- Magic Wand = Baguette magique
- Chopsticks = Baguettes
- Drumstick = Baguette
- Conductor's baton (?) = Baguette de chef d'orchestre

I couldn't find any source to confirm it, but the loaf of bread probably been called like this because it has the shape of a stick.

******** It's a bit hard to explain, but "un bâton" is a stick, while "une baguette" is a little, thin stick.

It's a bit hard to explain the difference because the line is not very clear but basically :

- If the stick is short (Between 20 and 40cmI guess) and thin, it's "*une baguette*".
- If the stick is pretty long (more than 100cm) and thick, it's "*un bâton*" (a walking stick as an example).
- *Bonus*: if the stick is short and thick, it's probably "*une matraque*" or "*un gourdin*" (a bludgeon).

At the same time, in situation like when playing with a dog, we will always talk about "lancer un bâton" (throw a stick), no matter the size of said stick.

********** Une "*Verge*" is a "wand" made of woof of metal.

Technically, it's the name of these sticks that were used by teacher to "give a correction" to bad students when physical punishment were still a thing (hit on the finger, the head, or butt . . .).

Nowadays, the term is almost exclusively used as a metaphor for a penis.

I remember hearing a few years ago that there was an incident in Quebec, because the Canadian parliament has an officer called the "Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod", which was translated into French as "Verge Noir". It stayed that way for years before someone pointed out the connotation. There were some funny newspaper articles about it, and they changed the name to "Baton Noir" or maybe "Baguette Noir" (I don't remember which).

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

** There was a story where Harry ducked out before Hogwarts and went to hide in America instead. Among other things it portrays wizarding Britain as insular and backwards. In America (and I think other countries) most wizards have adopted wands that look like regular #2 pencils so that they can fit in and discretely cast spells without needing to wave around a weird looking stick in the middle of a Muggle office or university. There may have also been mention of chopstick wands in countries were they'd fit in but I can't remember for sure.
