** ... and the victim, has to see her atacker every day of her existence.

(Yes, he felt so guilty and stabbed himself).

And... the mother of the victim (Rowena) send the atacker toward her daughter. Maybe she lost all wisdow with her diadem???

I don't remember any fic where that creepy idea comes to play.

Only a Severus Snape's thought that it is fitting, the Slytherin ghost is a murderer, the Ravenclaw ghost and Gryffindor ghost are murdered.
