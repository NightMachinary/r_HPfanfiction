I'm looking for something about the main character learning cool/useful Divination. Basically, making it a legit thing that can be learned and used. Only thing I've ever come across like this would be 0-800-Rent-A-Hero. Thanks guys!

*** Hmmmm... I've seen this one rec'd before, however I have avoided it because of the multi pairing. How prevalent would you say it is?

**** There's not really romance yet. It honestly would be better if the author just never got to it and dropped it from the description.

After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** linkffn(8233291) While mentioned briefly the 'scrying' the main character does is a subset of divination. I do wish there were more scenes of her using 'finding divination'.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
