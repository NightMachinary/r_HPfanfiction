...What happens next?\\
Does Dumbledore take a drop from his emergency stash of Felix Felicis and tear off to Obliviate Harry before he claims his lordship?\\
Does he withdraw all his money from Gringotts and retire to the Bahamas?\\
Does he leave a scarecrow (a literal strawman) in his office to be hexed/arrested/yelled at whilst vanishing into the shadows?\\
Does he engineer a ruse to make people believe that, Moody/Crouch Jr. style, he's been a captive of a fake!Dumbledore for the past few years and is innocent of all the embezzling and Snape-hiring that bashee-Dumbledores do?

Edit: Yes, the Potterwatch Percolator also makes coffee.


** He calls an emergency meeting with a mind healer out of concern that Harry is going insane

*** I think ZebJeb wrote a funny thing once where the Grim Reaper rants at Dumbledore about how he mucks up everything. Dumbledore's excuse for trying to stop Harry was that he believed that the radical politically-oriented change in Harry's personality was because he was possessed by Voldemort.

**** Yeah, I've read things along the line. I'd like to read a story where Dumbledore is actually, 100% correct in his reading (Harry basically being a paranoid schizophrenic and jumping at literal shadows, etc. Could be played for laughs or drama).

Arekay's power of paranoia does come close. Harry's actually mistaken that his whole life is a giant plot by Dumbledore, who is instead just massively incompetent at everything except casting spells.

***** I can't remember the name of the fic, but it was a confrontation between an Indy!Harry and Dumbledore (who seemingly rises from the dead) in Hogsmeade after the death of Voldemort, where Dumbledore explained that everything (vaults, magical training montage all the usual cliches) was orchestrated by him and Harry just played to his tune. He gives Harry the option of teaching him how to be the ultimate manipulator. The fic ended with Harry finally making a decision to either follow Dumbledore or not.

** I think "Rise of the Wizards" has a Harry that is wrong about Dumbledore trying to control him or use his money. He takes up his Lordship (eyeroll), becomes massively powerful (massive eyeroll), but makes a lot of wrong conclusions about Dumbledore and his own friends.

*** I know that in Make a Wish, Harry goes to confront Dumbledore towards the end of the fic. First thing he asks about is the whole "first year training" thing. Ends up, Harry and Co actually screwed up Dumble's plans in first year, the stone was a fake that would turn Voldemort into a lemon drop. Or it could have been one of the many, many omakes for the same fic.
