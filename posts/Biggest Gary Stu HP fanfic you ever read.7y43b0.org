Whether you liked the plot or not, what fanfics screamed all too conveniently powerful Harry?


** Oh, the one where Harry is a science genius that ran circles around everyone. It was somewhat of a SI fic for the author who didn't deserve a fucking bit of praise for that long, convoluted shitstorm of a fanfic. It was the Shades of Grey of Potter fanfiction. Methods of Rationality my ass. Ugh, I've never wanted Harry to die a more painful death than Ramsey Snow by chapter fucking three in my life.

*** I wholeheartedly agree. Everyone says that it makes sense by chapter 150, but that's bad writing if you take 150 chapters to explain why the MC is a dick. Harry doesn't come across smart, he comes across as a whiny smartass. I get that he is supposed to be the "revenge" of the bullied smart kids, but he's more the personification of that weird kid who used to play around with his gas lighter and derailed the lessons with off topic questions you ought to ask after class.

** My Top 3:

- Harry Crow by Robst\\
  I don't think I have to explain this much. Harry is the biggest Mary Sue ever. He is literally outwitting everyone, the perfect gentlemen at eleven, can defeat any fighter no matter their skill-level, everyone not-evil loves him, and he gets the highest titles and honors at the youngest age.\\
  linkffn(Harry Crow)

- Partially Kissed Hero\\
  Much more eloquent people have described this, but the MC also does everything right - always. Everyone that is disagreeing with him is evil.\\
  linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero)

These two fics are just bad.

- Core Threads\\
  In this Harry accidentally conquers an entire world, can do everything at Lightspeed and has no limits to his abilities. Oh and he's also 100% good and never abuses his power.\\
  linkffn(Core Threads)

This one can actually be fun to read, just for the heck of it.

****** Probably because the anti Muslim rant. It seems to become a more common sentiment in the western world and for every person complaining about it here there are a few who like it but just don't come here (this sub is relatively small after all). I mean, the Harry Potter fanfiction community seems to be ok with evil concepts neither Hitler nor Stalin ever dared to touch (marriage laws and similar forced marriages), so you can expect a certain degradation of the moral compass.

Personally I've never read it and frankly I don't care about it since the fic is supposed to have worse issues. However, a growing dislike of Islam is not surprising due to the events of the last 17 years. And if an opinion becomes popular in society at large, it will make it into fanfics eventually. And since more and more people share that opinion, it gets you popularity.

**** I just wrote this in another thread but all of robst's (Harry Crow author) stories are just an exercise in how quickly he can "revolutionize" the magical world. I will say the Core Threads is actually ok. Just finished reading it and it wasn't great but I don't regret the time I spent reading it. Its over the top and super out out of Canon and I really dislike the superfriends trope (Harry creates a gang of friends with amazing power that he personally trained from year one) but it was overall a decent story and didn't take itself too seriously which is the problem that I always have with OP!Harry stories

****** By revolutionize I mean how quickly Harry can eradicate blood purity prejudice, convert Draco, make everyone love goblins, fix Slytherin house, uncorrupt the ministry, and still have time to train a group of super soldiers and then kill Voldemort. They're all incredibly long winded stories about Harry solving every problem ever imagined before his third year.

Edit: all of robst's stories are fine if you want a feel good story about Harry being perfect. They're just not my cup of tea at all

** Pretty much any story with a political Harry where everyone just bends over. Harry has dirt on exactly two people, Fudge (random arrest of Hagrid) and Malfoy (attempted killing curse after the CoS). He has no evidence of anything else (He didn't actually see Malfoy slip the diary, Sirius was locked up by Bagnold and Crouch and Fudge can claim that the dementor with Crouch Jr was an accident). Besides that, Harry has some goodwill, but that's it.

** Any HP fic by stargatesg1fan1. One of his stories is nearing 1,000,000 words, shit ton of crossovers, and no challenge for god!Harry who is more powerful than all of the other gods, killed, and absorbed Hades. This Hades, by the way is more powerful than any other Hades you've ever read, and Harry killed, and absorbed him, while he was already a god. Harry can b****slap Superman, give a wedgie to Thanos who has all the infinity stones, basically massively OP.

**** I'm sorry. If it helps, if you want a story where you can just watch the main character steam role everyone, and get all the girls, it's not too bad I guess. It has decent pacing, and decent grammer. It's not bad if your looking for a wish fullfillment story, I mean there is a reason Superman is so popular.

If your looking for a story with good plot, good character development, and where the mc struggles, even just a little bit, this isn't the author you're looking for(ha, just realised, Star Wars reference).

** Heartlands of Time/ Wastelands of Time. Great stories to be honest, but Harry is a bit overpowered from having lived multiple multiple lives and knowing where to go and what to do and getting both Fleur and Tonks multiple multiple times.

Again though, great stories and I'm looking forward to the second one being finished.
