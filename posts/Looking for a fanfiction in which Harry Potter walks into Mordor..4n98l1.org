  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

  Harry Potter shows up in the middle of the Council of Elrond, and shows them why all magic is equal, but some magics are more equal than others. Brace yourself: it's a Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings crossover kinda-sorta crack!fic one-shot.
