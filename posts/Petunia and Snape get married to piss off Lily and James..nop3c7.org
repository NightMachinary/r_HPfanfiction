** I could see petunia getting fed up with the terrible men she's dated and keeps hearing her family talk about how perfect Lily is and how petunia needs to be more like her. Petunia meets James and their friends and is unimpressed. Then the wedding happens and she's not even the maid of honor. She decided to give Vernon a chance after months of him trying to woo her and let him be her date for the night only for Sirius to “prank” them. Vernon freaks out and wants nothing to do Petunia again. She then loses her job or rumors are started at college by him. Petunia decided to swear off dating for love and instead her focus becomes making Lily pay. It wasn't hard to find Snape after all he never moved. Even without a lot of money I could she Petunia being good at crafts and Snape can transform rocks into tables and pumpkin into a carriage for the night. Petunia is so impressed and with all the acting there doing she starts to really fall for him.

** I don't think their plan would work. Lily would be /happy/ that her sister is getting over her prejudice for the magical world and that Snape is doing the same vice versa, and... James wouldn't care xD

”‘Tunia? Sev?” They heard Lily call out from the living room. The house that the two of them bought (just to further everyones belief) had a floo, which Petunia was honestly confused about, and Severus just let it sit there.

“What do we /do/? What makes them angry?” Petunia said desperately.

”Both of us, truly, but they have already made past that.”

Anyways, both miserable people decide to face the music, because it wasn't like they could stay in the bathroom forever, and the house had two stories and would kill them if they jumped out the window.

(Petunia looks at Severus oddly at this, “Can't you just, magic us out, or whatever you people do?”

“That's /not/ --- well,” Severus gave a pensive expression, before they heard a /second/ voice appear from outside. “Petunia? Sni---Severus?” James.

Then, Severus decided, to hell with it.)

Both parties sit in the living room, on each couch. The air is, awkward, yes, with Lily and James (mostly Lily) beaming with /too much/ happiness, while Petunia and Severus (trying their hardest to look ‘couple-ish' which is hard, since both don't have much experience) exude an angrily dark air to them.

”So, tell us!” Lily exclaims.

”Tell you what, exactly?” Petunia replies.

”Your love-story.” James says.

”Merlin, help me.” Severus mumbled under his breath.

**** you can not mess with the Potters,

they where the og pranksters.

as soon as petunia and snape got together, they knew what was up

so they decided the best course of action would be to be intensely supportive to annoy them even more

** I doubt it would work.

Lily would be surprised, by try to be supportive most likely, or just ignore it depending on how one views Lily.

James? "Eh, they deserve each other." (and not meant in a good wholesome way)\\
Hell, he might laugh.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

*** There's also linkffn(13697614), “The Art of Longing”, which is an incomplete rewrite of the already-incomplete linkffn(11182721), “Unspoken Wishes”. Both are also pretty good Severus/Petunia fics with realistic premises and characterisations.

**** And then there is “[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/138566101-a-magical-love-affair][A magical love affair]]” by charmed9292. I am really usually not harsh in my reviews, and when something is really bad, I rather not say anything about it. In this case [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/ad-a-magical-love-affair.html][I haven't managed to do that]]. The premise of the story is so interesting and the result is so sad, that I have just had to write down what I felt about the story.

  When Petunia Evans sees him for the first time in years, on her doorstep, breathtaking in his grief and anguish, she can't help the burning longing and fierce curiosity that is kindled in her heart. Petunia knows that she has never felt this way for anyone before, but can lovelorn Severus ever love another? Or will he always pine after her magical sister? (Sevtunia)

** This plan would backfire...hard. Lily would see it as proof that they are getting over their respective prejudices (magic for Petunia, and Muggles for Snape). Not to mention Snape was planning to join the Death Eaters before he graduated Hogwarts, and Death Eaters, by their nature, HATE Muggles. This would be like a Neo-Nazi marrying a Jew to spite another Jew. If Snape STILL planned to join the Death Eaters, then he would have a VERY hard time explaining this to them.

As for James...why would he care about Snape and Petunia getting married?
