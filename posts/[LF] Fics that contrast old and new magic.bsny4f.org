There's a trope where old magic is better that is common in fanfiction. The deathly hallows, the philosopher's stone, and the founder artifacts all support this view. Are there any fics which contrast this against newer magic? Perhaps how wandlore advanced, new enchantments, and the reason why some of the older artifacts creation methods were lost to time?


** It's not HP, but there's an interesting mix in Mother of Learning, where magic education and skills have improved overall, but the gods have gone silent and so divine magic (which operates on higher rules and does things normal magic can't) has been lost.

** My main thought on old vs new is that older magic was 'powerful' because you'd often take power from the world (elements, spirits, Gods etc) but there was magnitudes greater control and quality of life with newer magics that take from oneself.

** It's a plot point in my story "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", but mostly the contrast between pre-wand and wand magic.
