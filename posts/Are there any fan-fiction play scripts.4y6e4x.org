I'd love to read some good HP play. Please don't mention Cursed Child. I'm interested in actual fan-fiction.


** I'm sure they're out there but you won't find them much in the high-traffic sites. Fanfiction.net forbids script-style fics for whatever reason and it's become a protocol (I think - somewhere between a habit and a principle) for people to adhere to that restriction, even on other sites where scripts aren't forbidden.

** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmwM_AKeMCk&list=PLC76BE906C9D83A3A][A Very Potter Musical]] is hilarious and very highly recommended. I'm not sure about a written script but the entire thing is on youtube.

** My ex boyfriend wrote me one that I can send to you. It mixes the plot of Inception with Harry Potter (Maurader times) and is a silly take on things. Supposed to be a musical but I dont know if I saved that bit
