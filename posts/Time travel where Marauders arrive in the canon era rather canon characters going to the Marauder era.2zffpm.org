In other words, fics where James Potter and Sirius Black show up at Hogwarts circa 1995.

** Interesting idea. I'm somewhat tempted to this for myself (might be able to fit it into a Regulus Black idea I have).

*** I just read your flair and wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed Replacing Hermy. It's great and I lol'd several times while reading your crack fic.

** Copperbadge/Sam Storyteller's story [[http://copperbadge.fanficauthors.net/Cartographers_Craft/index/][Cartographer's Craft]] might be worth checking out. It's 200k+ words, complete, HP/SB slash.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

** I had an idea for a fic back when I started reading fanfiction (pre-HBP) where Snape somehow traveled to the future and spent enough time with the right people that he bought into (was indoctrinated into believing?) the whole Harry-is-our-only-hope-against-Voldemort thing. Then Voldemort invades Hogwarts and in the course of the battle Snape sees Voldemort kill Harry and is very soon thereafter thrown back into the past (somehow?). Knowing that the future is lost and that Voldemort will eventually win, he becomes a Death Eater to save his own skin. Later his conscience gets the better of him and he becomes a spy.

Unbeknownst to him, Harry had some kind of protection or something and isn't actually dead and catches Voldemort off-guard, defeats him, saves the day, and yay everybody's happy.

I never did anything with it because I couldn't figure out how certain plot points would work (especially without being super cliche), but I've never come across another story with the reverse-time-travel idea.

** Ooh, I know I read one once, but don't remember the name. The idea was that the marauders somehow made the map a horcrux and then somehow get re-embodied in canon era.

Ah, found it- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4220317/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marauders-Horcrux]]. Just a one-shot that ended early and wasn't continued.
