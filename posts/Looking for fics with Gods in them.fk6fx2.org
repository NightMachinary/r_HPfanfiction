I'm looking for fics that have Gods show up.


** There's one where Harry has a bunch of Death Gods talking to him in his head and they're all slightly insane - both from being Gods and from being stuck together for centuries. Can't remember the title though.

**** It will get there. Jezaray doesn't drop all of the exposition on you at once, they spread it out over much of the fic. Truthfully that one could probably have a couple of names changed and be sold as original fiction though.
