Basically looking for fics where Harry is a powerful unknown quantity in the wizarding world. A mystery to the other major figures, players, or those in charge.

Just to clarify, I mean that for whatever reason "Harry Potter" as a known person either doesn't exist, exists in a different form, or has died/vanished/whatever. Harry...... either from another dimension, time, place, or perhaps simply the Harry of that world that has vanished or "faked his death" or something, shows up and attempts to change or influence the world. However he does so from the shadows, or hiding secrets, or behind the scenes, or in disguise... and the world around him struggles to figure out the new powerful player in the wizarding world.

I am mainly speaking magically powerful in some way, but politics being included is fine. He may make alliances or have relationships, but keeps things close to the chest. Light, Dark, or Grey.... all are acceptable. Mature fics preferred. Romances, Smut, Lemons, and the like are fine and welcome if done well. No slash please.


** Three of Kathryn518's fics have done this.

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

** linkffn(10709411) Basilisk Born

The story has worked it's way up to some considerable length so far, but I still get the feeling that it is far from finished. The story hasn't really gotten too far into people trying to figure out who Harry is since it split's it's time between Harry that is dealing with the Second Wizarding War in year 5, and Harry that was thrown into the distant past and how he was involved in and shaped many important wizarding events. In the far past, nobody really tries to figure out who he is or what he's doing because it doesn't really matter, but it picks up in the present. He is very powerful as far as most wizards go 'in-universe', but the fights and such aren't such a big focus in the story so there's really not much of a spectacle such as you'd find in some other stories. Also there is literally no romance except a small scene that I felt was put in mostly because the author kept getting hounded by people asking if Harry was ever going to get around to banging chicks. My biggest grievance with this story is grammar, the author is not a native English speaker and it is painfully clear especially in the early chapters. It get's better, but I'm kinda a stickler for grammar and errors will annoy me so I did have to expend considerable effort trying to look past it.

linkffn(9704180) I'm Still Here

Harry is thrown into alternate world and sorta in the past with "Girl Who Lived", he's hell bent on stopping Voldemort and pretty ruthless compared to canon Harry and most other fan versions I've seen; though mostly it's just because he doesn't have much qualms with killing Death Eaters and doesn't take shit from Dumbledore. I'd say he's Gray if anything, Chaotic Good or Neutral. He cares about people as much as canon Harry, but he's almost fanatical in his desire to kill Voldemort. There's a whole lot of people trying to figure out who Harry is, and figuring out his motives. Some of his stuff is behind the scenes, and he is magically very powerful basically as powerful as Dumbledore or Voldemort. There's romance in the story but it's not the major selling point yet, I think that the author wants to build up to it but since it's not the primary focus it hasn't developed yet. Fantastic writing, updates are sporadic though when they come through they are very large. I have no idea how much more is left for this story, but it's nearly 300k words already and I think it's going to be a while yet before it's finished.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
