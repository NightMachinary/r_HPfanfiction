** He is not an anti hero in these, but these 2 fics are good:

linkffn(Exile) Draco is sentenced to live with out magic for a while so he ends up running off to the muggle world. Has some entertaining moments of what it's like for a wizard that has no clue about muggle culture having to figure everything out.

linkffn(The malfoy case) Draco/Astoria fic that follows Draco's trial after the war. Has some good writing and provides a realistic version of events post war.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.

*** A note on /Exile/, the fic is complete, but the whole story is not, so just be careful. It's also really hard to understand the timing of events, but that could be considered intentional because Draco does not keep track of his exile at all.

** I would love to read a fic where Draco realises early (3 year or earlier, preferably before he called her a mudblood) that the whole pureblood dogma is bullshit because the best student is a muggleborn. I don't expect "I love muggles" on a baseball cap, but some acceptance at least. This is the only way I see Draco/Hermione happening. Where he defends Hermione if Ron is a prat (as usual) or if some other Slytherins talk shit about her. Because he stopped seeing her as the mudblood and sees her as the awesome, loyal witch she is.

This story could include some hilarious scenes with Draco and the Grangers.

** I like him in i'm still here, want him dead in child of the storm, and am ambivalent about him in a few other fics where he's a secondary character. I've never read a story with him as a protag and liked it.

** Incomplete, but he is an amoral protagonist in linkffn(7733386). Abraxas Malfoy is excellent too.

  Time travel. It's always about Potter. Draco Malfoy doesn't like that fact, but there is no one else who has the power to change the world. Sending his memories to his younger self he hopes to create a better future. Intelligent Grey Draco. No slash.
