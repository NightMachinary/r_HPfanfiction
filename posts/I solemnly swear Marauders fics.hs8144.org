Hi, for some time now I've been looking for good and fun fics about the Marauders. Can you recommend something?\\
I would like a story that focuses on their friendship and adventures they had during their time at Hogwarts or their lives after Hogwarts (with friendship being the main focus of the story). There can be a bit of romance, but I don't want the story to be all about James chasing Lily and asking her for a date every day since they boarded the train to Hogwarts at the tender age of 11.\\
The thing is, I want the story to be as faithful to canon as possible, which means, no Wolfstar, no Lily/Snape, no creepy Peter, no magic that seems over the top, no magical rituals, goblin rebellions, Snape white-washing or things like that.\\
Does a fic like this exist? I have to say I almost lost hope of ever finding one.\\
Oh, and it would be nice if the story was completed or at least, not abandoned :)


** White Flags has significant Lily/James, but they're already seventh years and there's plenty of emphasis on the other Marauders too.

The Story of Four Friends is complete and goes from first year to the Potters' deaths.

The Speculum Curse is a one-shot (well, four-shot) written before all the books were published, but has a certain fun spirit that I really like:

Against the Moon hasn't been updated for a few years but hits your other criteria and is 850,000 words:

  Who'd have thought that the man who tore them apart was the one who brought them together? Head Girl Lily Evans is determined to keep her distance from the Marauders but that's easier said than done when James is Head Boy and in love with her. It also doesn't help that she becomes rather attached to Sirius during an eventful Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson...

  Twenty years before Harry Potter entered Hogwarts for the first time, four young men had made that self-same journey. Twenty years before Harry Potter there were the Marauders. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. This is their story. Post HBP. Complete.

  It's the day before a big Quidditch game, and James is acting very strangely. Could it be a Slytherin curse? And can the other Marauders help?

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

*** Thank you for your suggestions. Judging by the summary, /White Flag/ looks interesting (I have a thing for Lily&Sirius friendship).
