It is after the war/Hogwarts. Harry goes into a bar and sees Tracey Davis, who is being forced to marry someone much older than her. She ends up leaving with Harry, staying the night and following him on his travels when he asks. Daphne Greengrass is either a movie star or a model, and her father has married Pansy Parkinson. Hermione has written out their adventures in Hogwarts. Thank you in advance.


** Read the story long ago. IIRC, this is the Story: linkffn(harry potter and the chance meeting)
