I was just curious about this. I know it lets you link to non HP fics but does it work on other subreddits? I really love it and get annoyed having to link the other way on other subs. I thought I would ask here first before attempting to use it and looking strange to people who don't know what it is. lol :P


** Yes, it only works here.

**** If you want to use the information it gives in another subreddit, call it in PM (just PM [[/u/fanfictionbot]] with linkffn(FICNAME) as normal).

** It's enabled on a couple other subreddits that I asked [[/u/tusing]] to add, but not site-wide.

** Can i ask what other subreddits? I'm curios about which subreddit's have discussions that at least require you to link fanfictions.

*** I was mostly thinking the [[/r/rwby]] subreddit. They like to talk about Fanfiction a fair bit as well. Not even close to this subreddit of course but still a decent amount.
