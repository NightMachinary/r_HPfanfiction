So, hear me out, I know that they're used to refer to the same object in canon, but could you imagine it actually being 2 different stones? Would fit with the "power of three" for magical stones. Hell, the naming would also work out pretty well - philosophers for life, sorcerers for gold. A bunch of other lore-twists could be applied to this as well, for example with the stone in the mirror being the sorcerers stone. Drag in mythology, like Midas, and suddenly you have lore that needs minimal exposition as well, just throw in the name once during a dialogue for flavor or use it as a major plot-point if you wish. So much potential with a minor change...

I know where I'd drag this, but I also know that my writing is not suited for fantasy. Also, absolutely horrible at dialogue.

Have fun, happy writing :)


** I could be mistaken but the Stone of Death (which I'm assuming you're referring to the Resurrection Stone) has nothing to do with the Philosopher's Stone/Sorcerer's Stone. The Latter two deal with the Stone that Nicolas Flamel created that can be used for the Elixir of Life.

The difference in naming is due to JKR's publishers did not think the US audience would understand/like the UK title of philosopher's stone so they had the book's title changed for the US market. So there is only one stone here. It is known as the Philosopher's Stone in the UK and as the Sorcerer's Stone in the US.

Now your premise that the Resurrection Stone is the stone that flamel uses is interesting. Eg he found an alchemical process that uses the Resurrection Stone (that death created so you could (with consequences) talk to the dead) to extend Life. (Not exactly something that IMO that death would want to happen).

If you were to have the Philosopher's stone and sorcerer's stone be two different stones you would need to create a back story for what the new stone did. So what would you do? Simply make one stone turn things into gold and have the other brew the elixir of life? Or would you do something more expansive.

*** Yeah, the idea was a "set of 3" thing based on the tendency in the HP universe for sets of 3 and using that - my idea was more splitting the canon philosopher's stone into 2 and having them be part of a set with the resurrection stone (had a brainfart on the name of that)

The premise would be that Flamel holds 2 of the 3 stones and lets everyone believe they're the same so when he sends a stone to Hogwarts, he sends the one he needs the least. Pulling in the myth of King Midas would then let you play around with the idea that each of the stones would bear a curse like the resurrection stone causing depression, as is heavily hinted at in canon. The sorcerers stone could aptly cause you to turn anything you touched to gold as long as you were in contact with it while the philosophers stone could cause infertility or increase lifespan but not slow aging (flamel as shown in Crimes of Grindelwald is quite old and frail after all, if magically powerful)

I'm not very good at writing out my thoughts, which is also why I didn't write a fic based on this myself (it always ends up a horrifying mess) and the whole stupid idea literally came to me during that weird point between being asleep and awake, at 4 in the morning, and I needed to get it out :P

Hadn't even thought of the Flamels using the resurrection stone tbh, but it kinda makes sense if you twist the lore a bit? Trying to work within the confines of canon while adding flavor and using loopholes like the changed names between EU and US is kinda my thing when I make up HP stories in my head :P

EDIT: aw hell, just had another idea...
