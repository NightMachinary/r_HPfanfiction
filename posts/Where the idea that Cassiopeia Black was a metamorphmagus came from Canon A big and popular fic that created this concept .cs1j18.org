** The wiki tells me that in canon, she appears only on the black family tapestry. Considering I have literally never heard of this character before this post, it is likely from some fanfiction developing this character from literally nothing and gave her the trait.

** I read Black Family/Harry is Sirius' Heir and thus Lord Black fic all the time and have not once come across a fic where Cassiopeia (or any other canonically named Black) is a metamorphmagus, despite the ability often being sited as a family trait and an indication of great power in any of the ones that bother to mention it at all.

Please link some of the fics you've found this in; I would love to read them!

*** Of the top of my head, linkffn(Black Sky; Honour Thy Blood; Green in the Grey; All According to Plan; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

But I must've read at least a dozen more with her being mentioned as a metamorph. Maybe its just the genre of fics I read that makes this a common occurrence for me, but this felt as an accepted headcanon for a bunch of people. Clearly I'm mistaken.

**** Thank you for the recs! In Black Sky it appears that Fem!Harry is the metamorphmagus, not Cassiopeia. Tonks is the only one in Honour Thy Blood and the Green in the Grey. She does appear to be one in The Prince of Slytherin and All According to Plan. The latter of which I will be reading. Thank you!

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
