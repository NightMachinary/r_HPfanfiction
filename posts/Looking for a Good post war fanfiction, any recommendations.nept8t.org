So basically what I'm looking for is a fanfic that takes place right after the war, preferably with cannon pairings. Has anyone got any Good ones to look up?

** The classical ones:

- “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond]]” series by Northumbrian (start with “The Tales of the Battle” and continue)
- stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer is before Winter, which is the main story), make sure to download it as the server I think is going away (HPfanfiction.com is well supported by [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][FanFicFare]]),
- “Inner Demons” by serendipity_50 linkao3(601124), the first fanfiction story I've read. There is only one the first.

#+begin_quote
  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
