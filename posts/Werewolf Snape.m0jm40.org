Any fics that explore Snape getting bitten in the werewolf incident? No marauder or Dumbledore bashing. Also, because this error is so common, the mudblood incident is after the incident, not before, so the fic should get the order right.

  Lily Evans doesn't marry James Potter.Severus Snape doesn't become a Death Eater. A loving relationship with his best friend is the happily ever after that Severus has always dreamt of - but he should've realised that a formidable magical couple will always attract attention from all the wrong quarters. With Lord Voldemort infiltrating an ineffectual government, Muggleborn rights eroded, and Lily unable to work, their lives are left in peril.Lily adores her supportive boyfriend, despite his streak of darkness, and in this terrifying new world, she knows his illegal potions are the only thing keeping them afloat - but the pressure of being a second-class citizen pushes her towards the only people who accept her: Severus' sworn enemies.Haunted by his Cokeworth past, Severus is determined not to let history repeat - but can he evade the rich promises of Lucius Malfoy, the lure of the Death Eaters, and the seductive call of the dark arts?

  “The scar is small, at least,” Pomfrey says, pulling the bandage snug around the cleaned wound. There's a pity in her voice that makes Severus want to throw up again. “It will be easily covered.”Dumbledore catches him inspecting it, as if mesmerized. “You are lucky to have survived at all,” the Headmaster says.Severus does not say I don't feel very lucky because it is stupid and obvious. Instead, he says unsteadily, “I want to press charges, sir.”Pomfrey stills, tightening the bandage to the point of discomfort.“Remus Lupin would be executed,” Dumbledore says. “The Ministry takes a dim view of werewolves who infect other wizards.”

*** Thank you! Unfortunately, I've already read both of those, and highly enjoyed them. It's a pity that they're one shots though. Those are some of my favorite authors, and the concept is among my favorites. (Btw the bot linked to A dealer not a Death Eater, which is another story entirely. Very good nonetheless, but not what you linked.

**** I have no idea why it did that lol. Bad bot xD

It's a great one. There's one other I've read where he transforms alongside Remus in poa, but since he's taken wolfsbane, he's able to be in control. I don't remember the name of that one. Probably Jaxon's again.

There's a fic by by Terri testing, spirit of vengeance that has him killed in the shack. It's interesting. Very angsty.

  AU. Harry doesn't get to have the idealistic image of his father's youth for long. In his first year, he learns that James was late at the Shrieking Shack, all those years ago.
