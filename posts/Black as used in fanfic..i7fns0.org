** I dunno, never really thought about it. Capitalizing "B" in "Black" when referring to the race/ethnicity/skin colour seems like a fairly new... development, all told? Not a new /thing/, I'm sure, though I've never looked into its history. But it feels fairly recent for it to have taken over the Internet the way it has.

It still feels to me that the uncapitalized form is the “norm” when just randomly mentioning a character's skin colour for exposition purposes; if someone wants to /identify/ as capital-B Black that is of course something I respect, as should everyone, but it's not a straightforward thing, and in the context of a story where there is a family with the last name "Black", whereas there /wouldn't/ really be many characters who'd use the modern usage of "Black" to identify themselves --- well, no, it doesn't seem unclear to me. /shrug/

(To elaborate on that last point, I am, to begin with, fairly sure that 1990's British English didn't commonly use a capitalized "Black" as an identity, no matter how long the Americans may or may not have been doing it. And moreover, only Muggle-born characters would be likely to make a point of it either way, because at least within the /common conception/ of the Wizarding World, "blood purity" and actual species differences replace any Muggle conceptions of race and racism. It is unclear how long there have been black-skinned wizards in the British, and, more generally, Western Wizarding World --- but worldbuilding-wise, they can't well have had a history with much in common with Muggle Black history; no slave-trading, for example, since inasmuch as the wizards ever “needed” slave labour, it was House-Elves who suffered the consequences, rather than human beings turning on each other. And so on and so forth.)

*** Sure! I see that. I think Black as capitalized in mainstream American media is a fairly new thing- since 1970 maybe- but people are pushing for it to be done more now as part of the larger re-thinking of racial attitudes on going rn. I know most people think it's common sense because it's a reference to proper name or noun. Like August or Taiwan. I think when talking about skin it might make sense to be like black or Black- it's either a commentary on the individual skin tone or the ethnic identity of the person.

I think it seems unclear to me because the context of using Black in media is more frequently seen by me as a reference to race then the specific context of using Black to refer to like a character group from a specific work of fiction.

I have no idea how the British use Black as a racial descriptor so that is fair! In story it would make more sense to read it as Black (the house) then Black (the race). I think the theoretical racial dynamics of a magical society are interesting but JK Rowling never really addresses it in text besides the obvious metaphors of blood purity and cultural preservation. If the Wizarding World is free from racial discrimination is a interesting question and I agree it depends on level of interaction with muggles and what history Black wizards have in whatever version of fanon is followed. Great insights! I think probably I would be more open to the idea of societal bleed-through of rhetoric or discrimination- the Magical world picks up a few cultural attitudes and institutions from the muggle one just on basis of size and shared space.

**** Black (with a capital B) has been the default in Britain for a while to refer to those of African descent.

The Associated Press style guide, which most American media follow, capitalized Black about a month ago in the wake of the recent activism after the murder of George Floyd.

A lot of identity/affinity groups have historically advocated for capitalizing these terms to emphasize a unifying purpose rather than a pejorative one. It seems these are now coming into mainstream use with Black, Native, Deaf, etc. all encouraged under the mainstream journalistic style.

That said, words can have different meanings, and Black is a legit family name, so there really is no difference - they're both referring to identity rather than a description. I believe "black" is not considered particularly pejorative and is probably okay as a standard literary descriptor when you're talking about an individual, but the recent trend does throw another meaning into the capitalized form.

***** Got it! Pretty much what I assumed about the recent change from semi-common to standard. Interesting to hear about Britain! Surprisingly socially progressive. Yeah I much prefer Black and don't really care about black.

****** It's not as if Britain is surprisingly socially progressive - it's that the US is surprisingly non-progressive. Remember: The USA is about the only country that decided to re-define "hispanic/latino" as a "non-white race" - [[https://www.latinousa.org/2014/05/02/invention-hispanics/][in 1970.]].
