So, yeah, most of those are /BAD/, and normally have other glaring problems(grammar, bad plot, inconsistencies, Mary Sues, etc), but what about using some good writing and taking a more realistic take on those?

Where the relationship is not just for wish fulfillment but to increase drama and enrich the story and plot.

I was just reading some fics, seeing a thread here in Reddit, +and remembering one of my country`s most famous soap operas+ and I thought that I don't ever remember seeing a realistic and well-written take on how a Harem or multiple wives would actually work out for Harry(yeah, I imagine why), so I would like to see other people's take on it. It reaches to a point that a fic having a harem means it's bad most of the time.

Most fics have all the girls be super ok with it, and even love each other, but that's mostly wish fulfillment, and the characters are often one dimensional.

Let's imagine that in some quirk of laws and/or situation, or even because Harry can't decide, a Harem is possible. And that the characters are changed /just/ enough that they "accept" the situation, but still *keep true to themselves*.

How would the relationship work? How would the different members relate to each other? Maybe they only like Harry and tolerate the others, or maybe it's a combination and there's "groups" and that generated conflict.

How would children be raised? Who would be the First Wife, if there's such a thing? What about age differences? Previous disagreements? How would the younger Ginny react to Fleur? Or Hermione to Tonks? The more tomboyish and "worker class" Ginny to the rich and sophisticated Daphne. All of them reacting to Luna roping their children in a hunt for snorknacks and wrackspurts.

How would Harry himself react to these problems?

How would his children see it?

It can be any number and combination, but I think two is easier because it's more common, maybe go for 4-5 to have some group dynamics, but much more than that is just weird and would turn into wives and concubines.

I just thought about using bad tropes and have a go at them with good writing, maybe subvert them a little. Some good fics are written by doing that.

Heck, you can even take that fandom created Indian!Harry(where did that one come from?) and run with it with him having being raised by his father to follow their culture.

** Rise of the Wizards is better than most, at least as far as the /reasoning/ behind the polygamy goes. (The initial marriage is for love, and the other two wives are in a relationship when married to Harry in order to secure a political alliance.) The wives are competitive with each other, and that's a very, very minor plot point.

Unfortunately, even without the typical tropes behind it, it still falls flat. The two secondary wives have little to do with the actual story and I'm pretty sure that the 'political alliance' one doesn't even have a line. It's more of a... let's give him three wives and then not actually /do/ anything with them kind of situation @.@ The competitive thing between Daphne and Ginny could've been easily cut, just like Ginny and Gabrielle themselves, and the story would've remained exactly the same.

...Except he would've had to tweak Hermione's nose a different way. There's that, I guess.

** I actually found a series like this! [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/160208][The Eyesight Series]] features a genderqueer, polyamorous Harry who deals with PTSD, cheating, parenthood and juggling multiple partners. The series is very real to the characters. It includes what parenthood means to a child when there are about 5 different parents. The way the characters come together are very real, and while sex does play a big part, the emotional connection between the characters is very well-explored. I really hope you give it a chance.

  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

  A real harem would realistically be chaos behind the scenes, and that's not counting on the wives'/girlfriends' individual personalities.
#+end_quote

That's kind of the whole point of this prompt.

#+begin_quote
  women are catty. Women are emotional. Women can be manipulative and cruel. it's part of their nature.
#+end_quote

I am just going to point out that can apply to both genders, it's just that women have more success with that because they tend to be more emotionally aware and are normally biologically equipped to read people better.

#+begin_quote
  The "everyone gets along and loves one another" trope is bullshit.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I know, I wrote that in the OP, but I do think that with time compromises and familiarity can come forward.

#+begin_quote
  But other girls? They wouldn't be "one of them" and I guarantee you they'd be power struggles, throat-to-throat emotional and mental spars -- even violence, as they try to monopolize Harry's attention.
#+end_quote

Obviously.

#+begin_quote
  And even then Ginny, for example, might try to put herself ahead of her "allies".
#+end_quote

I think that depends on who the "First" is, because that one would have Harry's support and brash tactics won't work.

#+begin_quote
  Really, the shit you see in Game of Thrones regarding mistresses trying to upstage the legitimate wife or other mistresses is pretty accurate to how harems were in real-life.
#+end_quote

Harems in real life tend to be secretive and involve far more politics than the situation I am trying to imply here. They also tend to be the place of much abuse.
