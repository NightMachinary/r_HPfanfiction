Slytherin is actually my favorite House, but I can't help but think they would do the poor kids a favor if they sorted them to one of the other houses.

Slytherin seems like a huge stigma in the books. In Philosopher's Stone, Hagrid makes it seem like a bad House. In the end we're supposed to be happy that Slytherin lost the House Cup because you know...they're painted as the mean ones.

In CS, things get even worse since we find out what Salazar Slytherin did. We learn that Slytherins are also the bigoted ones and Rowling confirms it when she said in an interview that not all Slytherins are pureblood supremacists but all pureblood supremacists are Slytherins.

Having a House that so actively promotes pureblood supremacy seems like a very bad idea. Even if some Slytherin students disagreed with the concept they would still get viewed as racists just because of their House.

Rowling only tried to add some complexity to the Slytherin House in the last two books, but I didn't think they were overall redeemed. All Slytherin students still seemed like nasty little prats,we never met a half-decent one. Snape arguably redeemed himself but he did it with an act of courage and Dumbledore made it even worse with saying that "you're really brave, perhaps we sort too soon" implying that Snape should have been in another House. We also have Slughorn, but honestly I don't think we were meant to view Slughorn in a very positive light. Sure fighting in the final battle was rather noble and courageous of him, but the man still hid important information about Voldemort and he also promoted some sort of nepotism that is viewed negatively by many.

I honestly think Rowling originally intended for Slytherins to be the bad guys, you know like the Orcs from LOTR that we're meant to hate no matter what, but the problem is that in the world of HP it makes no sense to have an "evil people House" because why the hell would they not disband the thing? Perhaps Rowling saw the problem too that's why she gave Slytherin a little more depth in the final two books.

The thing is I don't understand why she kept the Slytherin House in the end. It seems to promote really bad behaviors and attract all of the morally ambiguous people. If you put a bunch of ruthless kids together and encourage them to follow the footsteps of someone like Salazar Slytherin the psycho, you will get some very bad results and we do see that in the series. Why not get rid of the House or at least reform it?

I don't know about you guys but the Slytherin issue seemed like a bit of a plot hole to me. Why have house like that? Why did Rowling keep it?


** Jesus, ThatGreekLady, just how many threads on that topic have you posted in the last month? it's like you're just ignoring all the reasonable answers people give you.

Rowling answers your questions lengthily in [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm][this]] interview. Here's a relevant quote:

#+begin_quote
  JKR: But they're not all bad. They literally are not all bad. [Pause.] Well, the deeper answer, the non-flippant answer, would be that you have to embrace all of a person, you have to take them with their flaws, and everyone's got them. It's the same way with the student body. If only they could achieve perfect unity, you would have an absolute unstoppable force, and I suppose it's that craving for unity and wholeness that means that they keep that quarter of the school that maybe does not encapsulate the most generous and noble qualities, in the hope, in the very Dumbledore-esque hope that they will achieve union, and they will achieve harmony. Harmony is the word.

*** Much as I hate to agree (partially) with someone who appears to be this forum's stopped clock, I'm going to play devil's advocate a little... (Edit: As a disclaimer, I'll point out that I'm a strong proponent of 'Death of the Author', so I base this response almost entirely on what Rowling wrote, not what she said after she published it. Her opinions on her own work should not be viewed as sacred.)

This is crap. As in, Rowling's response is weak as hell, because she rarely presented them in this manner. She does this all the time, making statements about her writing in interviews that the writing itself does not, in my opinion, bear out. Or just plain makes stuff up after the fact to appease the fanbase, I guess, like the post-epilogue pairings she tossed out in interviews. If she had wanted to represent this interpretation in her books, she would have written that, not the vaguely-Calvinist cock and bull we got in Deathly Hallows. Slytherin and Gryffindor had their roles to play in the story, and Slytherin's one was to be the 'bully clique' up until maybe GoF time, which coincides nicely with the HP books' clumsy and inept transition into Young Adult novels. After that, some of them (read: Malfoy, Slughorn to a lesser extent) manage to become at the very least 2-dimensional, but the others mostly remain in that 'bully clique' role, with a side order of supporting the new world order. And that would be fine, for a childrens' book, where motives are simple and the bullies really don't have separate personalities beyond 'nasty person'. So I think the criticism that Slytherin as presented was fairly stereotypical (because houses are a (possibly unconscious) representation of teen stereotyping). And this applies to all the houses. It's just that, for the first few books at least, Slytherin's stereotype was to be the villain house where all of the nasty people come from, as befitting a child's perception of good/evil.

The problem is, of course, that this analysis of the problem doesn't go deep enough. This is yet another ugly result of the HP books trying to shift into writing for a young adult audience, which retroactively forces people to question earlier events in a new light. As in, in earlier books, Slytherin's role was to be the nasty house with the obvious bullies, and nobody was asking for them to be disbanded. They were just a house that existed for the petty villains of the HP world to belong to, and probably represent some of Rowling's noticeable underlying issues with the concept of 'ambition'. So when the books became serious enough to ask 'why are these people in power? (Fudge, Umbridge, etc)', someone was bound to wonder why these people who were portrayed as a uniformly nasty house of bullies were allowed to attend Hogwarts at all. So yes, I think this is a valid question, though not one that we will ever get a satisfactory answer to. Rowling's world was never particularly well thought out, and a lot of its messages were inadvertently quite poisonous as a result. It's just something that the fandom has to deal with, unfortunately.

She could have made the houses nuanced in the way that she claims, but in my opinion, she failed to actually show this in her writing. Fanfiction has managed much better in her stead.

*** IMO, JKR's answer is a cop out, just as the house system is flawed in and of itself.

Stories like Hogwarts Houses Divided and especially HPMOR explore the gradual fall of Slytherin House from its once prestigious vantage. The values it represents tend to foster conflict and isolate the house in the long term.

**** I don't think you should base your opinions concerning HP on fanfiction, since fanfiction almost always presents a very different and skewed view of the House system, and is by definition, not canon (particularly HPOMR, which was written by an author who didn't even /read/ the series).

I've also found both Hogwarts Houses Divided and HPMOR to have ridiculously bad premises (admittedly HHD slightly less so) and didn't continue reading, so I won't comment on how it explores the House's fall, but considering the shallowness and immoderation of the earlier chapters, I doubt it does a better job than the rest of the canon-mutilating fanfiction.

***** Yes and no. I do not base any "opinion" on fanfiction. When I say the house system is flawed, I base it on the fact that it inherently divides students based on arbitrary qualities which may not even be explicitly present in its members. Just through common sense, the house system is counterproductive to harmony.

In fact, the point of citing these fanfic examples is to draw attention to how Slytherin house was portrayed in canon and how the problems the house had in canon can plausibly develop as symptoms of a deeper sickness. Slytherin post-war will inevitably suffer even more from the stigma of being the "evil" house. If you call such a premise shallow, perhaps you simply haven't thought things through?

But from your responses (you criticize a lot but provide no basis for your criticism), I infer that you're one of those who end arguments with "not canon" so I'm not sure how effective my reasoning will be.

P.S. I don't know if HPMOR's author actually didn't read the series as it makes reference across many books, but it's ultimately irrelevant because I only cited it for its excellent exploration of Slytherin house's issues (firmly based on canon details).

See, that's the problem with what you're doing using fanfiction as example. Rowling specifically said that Slytherin's bad reputation dwindled after the war.

This is not the premise I called shallow. The plot of HHD seemed shallow to me because the House issue is too forced and heavy handed, and the characters don't act believeably. It felt like an attempt to force an aesop rather than an actual story.

First problem is [[http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/58996/do-the-harry-potter-books-ever-contradict-themselves][using Rowling's out-of-text word as canon]]. As I mentioned elsewhere, there is a whole ton of stuff Rowling says that just doesn't make rational sense. It's plausible that Slytherin's reputation eventually improves over the years/decades, but it's just not realistic to say that their reputation suddenly improved because the Death Eaters are dead. In what world is the house of basically every Death Eater and their sympathizers going to be met with any respect post-war?

#+end_quote

I agree that the characters are weak, but again, you're being vague. What House issue is forced? If the dynamics don't feel canon, perhaps that is because Rowling neglects to flesh out any other house except Gryffindor. Also, that is exactly what the story is: an allegory (did you mean fable?) for what harmony means between the houses post-war.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

What canonical conception of Slytherin. Slytherin house in canon is the most one-dimensional house (Hufflepuffs don't even exist). You do not need to read 7 books to understand Slytherin, because the house's issues remain the same in canon and in almost every fanfiction. BTW just curious, what are you basing these statements on? HPMOR is as un-canon as can be, but that doesn't mean it can't comment and provide insights on canon.

You are wrong, because we are not discussing canon. The question is why Rowling didn't disband Slytherin: all of this is discussion of what happens /outside/ the books. The question itself is loaded because it's based on those issues with Slytherin which are (again) present in all of canon. The whole point of this type of question/fanfiction is to explore what could happen while remaining canon-compliant (AKA using and not contradicting details in the books).

Perhaps in your opinion, but I believe it's realistic. A lot of blood-purists could have changed their ways after seeing what their beliefs had led to, Slughorn was probably a better influence to his charges than Snape was and taught them more open-mindedness, and as result and per word of god, the House's reputation got better by the time of the next generation. You know, just like Germany's reputation improved vastly since the Nazis were defeated.

#+begin_quote

The "division between Houses" issue, as if the title didn't make that obvious enough. The "promise me we'd be friends even if we're in different houses, even though I only know you for a couple of hours" issue. It's artificial conflict that didn't really exist in canon and was exaggerated beyond sense.

No, no it doesn't. Slytherin House is vastly different in fanfiction that it is in canon to the point that someone who only reads fanfiction has no accurate image of it. I can spend days talking about Slytherin House, its purpose, its characteristics and its standing. Fanon takes a much more simplistic, shallow and one-dimensional view to it.

It's common knowledge that Yudkowsky didn't read the books. And someone who hadn't read the books can't comment about them. Fanfiction is not the books, not even close.

Yes the writing is not perfect, but the House issue is not artificial conflict. Case in point: Lily and Snape. Being sorted to different houses is a significant impediment to inter-house harmony, which the fanfic illustrates. On one level, it's [[http://www.simplypsychology.org/robbers-cave.html][simple psychology]]. It's always informative to consider details from a different point of view.

Its purpose, characteristics and standing in canon? Canon Slytherin is horribly shallow and one-dimensional. Do you know why the OP's question exists in the first place? Because 99.9% of the antagonists are from Slytherin. It doesn't get more simplistically black and white than that.

It's also common knowledge Rowling contradicts herself, what's your point? You don't need to read the books to comment on the simple fact that 99.9% of the antagonists are from one group.

Your zealotry against fanfic authors is basically getting into ad-hominem territory; rather than argue using reason, you just lump things into stereotypes to dismiss them categorically. In your rush to skewer Yudkowsky, you happily ignore Inverarity who has clearly read the books. I never said to take fanfic as canon: they're most interesting when they develop canon details or make you think twice about why something's the way it is in canon.

You treat canon and Rowling's word as reality. You forget HP is a fictional world and that authors are as fallible as any person.

I certainly do not know better than Rowling. I'm merely pointing out inconsistencies and the fact that she /has/ contradicted herself in the past. P.S. Your fanaticism with thinking Rowling has to always be right is incredibly obsequious. She's a fantastic author but you need to know where to draw the line.

Regarding the question, by definition, it is considering what could have happened (not in the books). The question is not canon, period. I'll repeat myself: the whole point of this type of question/fanfiction is to explore what could happen while remaining canon-compliant (AKA using and not contradicting details in the books).

In the first place, I offered my /opinion/ ("IMO, JKR's answer is a cop out, just as the house system is flawed in and of itself.") on JKR's out-of-book answer. This opinion is not based on fanfiction, but on basic reasoning. I'm not sure why you felt the need to attack the fanfics (which are opinions/commentary also).

Repeating myself for the 3rd time since the previous 2 are just ignored: these hypothetical questions (not canon) exist to explore what could happen while remaining canon-compliant (AKA using and not contradicting details in the books). Rowling's answer is quite shallow, since it doesn't address the deeper association of Slytherin with evil. There will be some redeemed Slytherins, but some dead Death Eaters doesn't the root problem of why the question needs to be asked in the first place.

Anyone who read the books can tell you /not everyone/ from Slytherin is evil (i.e. few select members of the older generation). But the fact remains that 99% of antagonists are from this one house (something which you pointedly ignore in every response). Ignoring this fact is just a form of gross bias because you want Rowling's world to be perfect and you have no retort except to say Slytherin has a lot of /potential/.

#+end_quote

That example points out very clearly the way social circles are informed by House divisions. Read canon again. While not as inflated as HHD, it's clearly there.

You might also want to read up on human behavior and the history of ousted parties (e.g. Germany since you mention that). Conflict is inevitable.

************ The problem here is that you seem to think that your personal opinion is shared by others. /You/ see Slytherin as shallow, so you think that Rowling should provide an "excuse" for that. I don't care that 99% of antagonists come from this House, it doesn't matter in-universe. That's like saying, "99% of terrorist attacks are carried by Muslims, let's get rid of all the Muslims!".

And, lol, no, I don't want to think Rowling's world is perfect. God knows how many issues I've had with the books. It's just that what isn't perfect for /you/ is okay for others, and Rowling doesn't own excuses for any fan who thinks she didn't do things properly. She answered that question perfectly well.

Again, you might think that Snape and Lily's problems stemmed from House issues, I see it as a very minor influence in their "break-up". Both Lily and Snape were nasty pieces of work. They already had their disagreements prior to Hogwarts, and to be honest, Lily didn't seem to care about him so much, or to have a compatible personality. The way I see it, she befriended him because he was the only wizard around.

I think the House issue is bloated both in fanfiction and in the fandom. It's okay if you think otherwise, but don't say Rowling's answers are cop-outs just because she doesn't confirm to your personal opinion. It's entitled and vain. The same goes for this entire discussion - understand that what you think is the possible result, is not objective, and has no value for others, instead of trying to force your view.

No, I don't expect that at all. I'm pointing out that the antagonists are heavily skewed toward Slytherin. You want to deny that it's shallow to have all antagonists from a single background? If you don't care about that fact, then you're just being willfully ignorant. And yes it does matter in universe since the overwhelming association is evil => Death Eater => Slytherin.

Your analogy is completely wrong. Using your example, it would be "99% of terrorist attacks are carried out by Muslims, so therefore there is some deeper issue that puts Muslims in conflict with outsiders and many outsiders are likely prejudiced against Muslims for this reason."

  And, lol, no, I don't want to think Rowling's world is perfect. God knows how many issues I've had with the books. It's just that what isn't perfect for you is okay for others, and Rowling doesn't own excuses for any fan who thinks she didn't do things properly. She answered that question perfectly well.
#+end_quote

Are you changing your tune now? You basically stated Rowling knows best when she clearly isn't immune to mistakes. I don't expect her to make excuses or fix every little problem fans perceive, but discussion inherently allows reasoned criticism. My only problem is with fanatics defending her blindly without even thinking about the HP world.

#+begin_quote
  Again, you might think that Snape and Lily's problems stemmed from House issues, I see it as a very minor influence in their "break-up". Both Lily and Snape were nasty pieces of work. They already had their disagreements prior to Hogwarts, and to be honest, Lily didn't seem to care about him so much, or to have a compatible personality. The way I see it, she befriended him because he was the only wizard around.
#+end_quote

No, I wanted to bring attention to the details in their fight where you can see why there is conflict in the House dynamics and why the house system is innately /disharmonious/.

#+begin_quote
  It's okay if you think otherwise, but don't say Rowling's answers are cop-outs just because she doesn't confirm to your personal opinion. It's entitled and vain. The same goes for this entire discussion - understand that what you think is the possible result, is not objective, and has no value for others, instead of trying to force your view.
#+end_quote

Actually it's the reverse. Every person is entitled to an opinion, I made mine clear from the start, whereas you attacked me because it doesn't fit your perception of what canon is. It's honestly disturbing how stuck-up you are about people having opinions that criticize Rowling's world. You're free to categorically ignore opinions that you don't like, but no one cares if it doesn't have value for you.

I call it a cop-out because it is a cop-out. Her answer is just flowery language that answers the question superficially. Let me help you break it down:

#+begin_quote
  But they're not all bad. They literally are not all bad.
#+end_quote

Sure, nothing we didn't know already. But doesn't change the fact that 99% of bad guys are from that House.

#+begin_quote
  If only they could achieve perfect unity, you would have an absolute unstoppable force
#+end_quote

What does this even mean? Perfect unity is a Hogwarts without houses. Not sure if she even knows what she's saying here.

#+begin_quote
  I suppose it's that craving for unity and wholeness that means that they keep that quarter of the school that maybe does not encapsulate the most generous and noble qualities, in the hope, in the very Dumbledore-esque hope that they will achieve union, and they will achieve harmony. Harmony is the word.
#+end_quote

So basically she is saying that there is an evil house because bad qualities need to go somewhere. In some ideal Platonic world, Slytherins will be accepted for the qualities that incline them towards evil. But that doesn't change anything because evil wizards will still be overwhelmingly from that house.

It's just a typical answer for children (i.e. happily ever after).

You need to find a dictionary to review what the word 'opinion' means.

Likewise Rowling doesn't need you to go around as a guard dog to filter opinions based on your personal agenda.

#+begin_quote
  And you completely twisted Rowling's answer in your comment while admitting that you don't even understand it.

You're falling into your habit of calling things wrong without offering any constructive reason.

There are not that many ways to interpret Rowling's answer because it really is just a typical answer that neatly ties things up for children. It's like she was reading about Zen when she wrote it. I don't understand this line (ask any normal person to analyze this: "If only they could achieve perfect unity, you would have an absolute unstoppable force") because it just doesn't make sense at all. But hey thanks for generalizing.

** I think she was very intentional in her writing. It did come across as a little one dimensional, but we also saw them from Harry's perspective...and Harry (for most of the series) is a child. Children think in black and white terms a lot, and that broader grayscale thinking doesn't develop until you're older. So we saw Slytherin from the eyes of a growing person. We didn't see any of the good traits (Snape, Slughorn) until Harry finally saw it for himself. Also, the movies didn't do a very good job showing that depth either. I'm thinking of the fact that all Slytherins were escorted to the dungeons in the movie, while some actually stayed behind to fight and protect the castle in the book.

In a non-objective viewpoint, it is probably very likely that Slytherin in the 1990s was full of "bad" kids. For two reasons: a lot of them were the children of Death Eaters/prejudice elitists, and children are very susceptible to peer pressure. There was probably this polarization happening in the Slytherin house, and if you didn't conform to the most influential of the students, you'd probably get blacklisted. I'm sure things cleared up once Voldemort was gone, and prejudice views were finally frowned upon.

Should she have redeemed them more? Mmm, maybe, but I think she was more focused on redeeming certain characters (Snape). I will be VERY surprised indeed if there is NOT a Slytherin redemption arc in Cursed Child. Draco and Scorpius are both major characters it looks like, and of course, there are a lot of theories that Albus Severus got put into Slytherin anyway.

His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's giants: they ran at Grawp like bull elephants, making the earth quake.

***** I'm on mobile so I can't copy and paste things nicely.

About two pages before Voldemort's announcement for Harry Potter to be given up, everyone is in the Great Hall. McGonagall makes an announcement that a battle is coming and those of age may stay to fight while everyone else is sent home. Voldemort makes his demand for Harry, Pansy Parkinson spots Harry and calls for someone to grab him. The other houses stand up to protect Harry and McGonagall sends Slytherin house out with Filch. Below is how the tables empty:

"Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall's descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on their way."

No one stayed from Slytherin. Given the division between Slytherin and the other houses, I think it would have been made very clear that Slytherin students stayed to fight. It would have been a big turning point for the reputation of the house had any students remained.

Let it be known that I'm a Slytherin myself so this isn't anti-Slytherin bashing. To my knowledge, Slughorn is the only Slytherin who stays to fight.

*** You are right, Andromeda was a good Slytherin, albeit we really should have spent more time with her since he barely gets any lines. Yet we never get a half-decent Slytherin who was actually a student during the HP series.

The only half-decent Slytherins we get are adults like Slughorn and Andromeda, and to a lesser extent, Snape. Given that they are adults during the HP series as we view it, their houses are irrelevant seeing as that as adults, they would have changed and would be different from how they were as children. Andromeda's Hogwarts house is about as irrelevant as what primary school an adult went to as a kid. Especially given how Dumbledore was more fitting for Slytherin than any other Slytherin in the books except Voldemort. Even Percy was more appropriate for Slytherin than the majority of Slytherins, regardless of his redemption.

It is canon that all the Slytherin students sided with Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts. JKR could have explictly shown the Slytherin students coming back with Slughorn, but that didn't happen. Instead, Slughorn came back with Charlie and the Hogsmeade resisdents, all the while there isn't a single bit of canon evidence (meaning from the books) that contradicts Voldemort's statement of all the Slytherins siding with him. Even if Voldemort only meant all of the seventh year students, it still is telling that a bare minimum of 10 out of 70 Slytherins sided with Voldemort. But really, everything points to the Slytherins all siding with Voldemort. At best, 5-10 decided to evacuate.

Its not like Blaise Zabini, Pansy, Daphne Greengrass, Milicent Bulstrode or Tracey Davis have any excuses not to help Hogwarts. I call BS on the idea that every Slytherin has a parent who was a pureblood supremacist, Death Eater or other dark wizard. Besides, aren't Tracey and Millicent meant to be half-blood? Tracey probably was, Millicent might still be one, and Blaise's mother has been through so many men that he might even be a half-blood if the father is half-blood or even muggle-born. While Snape still joined up with Voldemort and was half-blood, you'd think that the Slytherins would have just evacuated rather than siding with Voldemort.

I think it REALLY says a lot about Slytherin that the likes of Snape is considered a good Slytherin. If Snape is a good Slytherin, that doesn't say much for the rest of them. I mean, I like Snape, he's one of my favourite characters in the series, but he was a jerk for almost the entire series and we don't see his remotely okay side until after he's dead. If Lily was never in danger and wasn't killed, Snape would have had no reason to feel regret seeing as his redemption happened because she died. He was okay with giving Voldemort the prophecy and went along with the idea of Voldemort murdering a baby and its parents, except when he found out Lily was involved, then he desperately tried to get Voldemort to spare her. The fact that Voldemort sparing her originally invoked the love protection was coincidence that Snape didn't know about. He wanted Lily spared because it was Lily.

#+begin_quote
  “If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, *like the rest of the Slytherins*. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?”
#+end_quote

The use of "like the rest of the Slytherins" suggests, if not confirms that they joined Voldemort. Now whether Voldemort means the rest of the Slytherins who were in Draco's year (10 Slytherins) or every single Slytherin student (about 70 Slytherisn) is your interpretation, since Voldemort never actually mentions specific names of the students or the number who just joined him. However its blatantly suggests that more Slytherins sided with Voldemort than just Draco, Crabbe and Goyle. "The rest" implies more than just three Slytherin students being recruited. At bare minimum, all the Slytherins in Harry's year (the then seventh year Slytherins), and perhaps some underage Slytherins with Death Eater parents (which, realistically, would be at least one underage Slytherin).

While Voldemort isn't exactly reliable of a source, nothing in canon actually contradicts him. When Slughorn returns, it is canon that he returns with Charlie and the residents of Hogsmeade. The Slytherins didn't side with Slughorn. Since the books always outweigh Pottermore/JKR's Twitter should a contradiction occur, that means that not a single Slytherin student sided with Hogwarts against the Death Eaters.

Taking Voldemort's word, it would mean that all the Slytherins sided with him. Even if one chooses to believe that Voldemort was exaggerating, we know no Slytherin student is on the good side fighting the Death Eaters, meaning either they joined Voldemort or they evacuated. But here is the thing: if the Slytherins actually exacuated, they would have been with Slughorn when he returned (at least some older Slytherin would have been). None were with Slughorn even though had they evacuated formally, they would have been with Slughorn.

The book doesn't explictly state "every single Slytherin student joined Voldemort", however it doesn't need to be explicit. The dots are there and when connected, it basically confirms it already. Voldemort's words and the lack of Slytherin students returning with Slughorn speaks for itself.

*TL;DR: Regardless of how you take Voldemort's words and the fact no Slytherin students returned with Slughorn, It is canon that no Slytherin student was on Hogwarts' side. Canon heavily implies that most (if not all) of the Slytherin students sided with Voldemort. At bare minimum, Voldemort would have been able to recruit all the ones in Harry's year, with maybe a dozen underage Slytherins joined him in addition to that.*

** Disbanding all houses is the only realistic way to do it. Disbanding just Slytherin tells the world that being cunning, being ambitious, they just lead to bad things. That rather than wanting to apply their knowledge for gain, the acquisition is good enough. Rather than evaluating situations for the best path, jumping in head first is best. Rather than seeing the grey in everything, the black and white of justice is better.

There's nothing wrong with being a Slytherin.

And it's no surprise that the "bad guys" came from a house of cunning and ambition. How many of our cartoons growing up had some "take over the world" feel to it? That's ambition at an extreme. Rowling has said that anyone who has blood prejudice was a Slytherin. Which I think was a really short sighted remark (though it does NOT say that all Slytherins were prejudiced). Considering the three wars we know about in this chunk of the world dealt /directly/ with blood prejudice, of course Slytherins are going to bear the unfair burden. Because bigots in this regard were going to be from that house.

However it is /exceptionally/ shitty that the only real non Slytherin "bad guy" we got was Pettigrew. It's shitty because people love to write about some understandable reason for him to betray his friends, giving him the pity party, but that same writer will go with the whole "ha ha Slytherins are evil" trope. Those authors don't like to give us good Slytherins. Redeemed Slytherins. Conflicted and confused Slytherins. Slytherins that /aspire/ to do good in the world.

Where are the evil ravenclaws? Conducting unethical spell testing and development, magical piracy, creative and undetectable forms of torture. Seriously, they're supposed to be the creative and intelligent group.

Where are the bad gryffindors? Strength and power and fearlessness, on the wrong side of the fight? Coercing others to join them because it's the "right thing to do" and because "don't be a coward". Malicious intent under the guise of being helpful.

Where are my horrible Hufflepuffs? Being "just" doesn't have to mean being "good". Theyre the ones doing the dirty work. You tell me loyalty and hard work, I think of them banding together with one or two people from the other houses. Slytherin gives them a goal, Ravenclaw provides the means, Gryffindor the brute strength, and Hufflepuff makes the plan actually work in the details and dirty nails. Need someone to dig down to a vault? Call the Hufflepuffs. Place an explosive at the end to get into it? That's what the Gryffindor is for.

Authors sometimes make exaggerated statements that don't make sense upon closer scrutiny. A lot of the HP world doesn't make sense when you think about it rationally.

However, HP is written as a bildungsroman and stories like those are easier to write and understand for its targeted audience when things are black and white.

That's why we have so much fanfiction to explore house dynamics!

**** Sure but that was because we only saw a select group of Slytherins and saw them through Harry's eyes.

But besides that point, the reason I thought the houses were to be disbanded had to do with the sorting hat, not how the houses individually acted (which let's be real they all had asshats in them), when the hat gave the warning in 1995:

#+begin_quote
  And never since the founders four were whittled down to three have the Houses been united as they once were meant to be.

  And now the Sorting Hat is here and you all know the score: I sort you into Houses because that is what I'm for.

  But this year I'll go further, listen closely to my song: though condemned I am to split you still I worry that it's wrong,

  Though I must fulfill my duty and must quarter every year still I wonder whether sorting may not bring the end I fear.

  Oh, know the perils, read the signs, the warning history shows, for our Hogwarts is in danger from external, deadly foes

  And we must unite inside her or we'll crumble from within I have told you, I have warned you... let the Sorting now begin.
#+end_quote

The hat itself fears that by sorting the houses it is bringing "the end it fears" and I took that to mean that the sorting was the real reason for everything being so divided. I mean after all, had Riddle come to Hogwarts and instead of being sorted to ambitious Slytherin been clumped together with a group of first years who all had different traits a lot could have changed.

So I thought Rowling was going to do away with the sorting and the houses at the end because it was so clearly stated that sorting might be the reason for the mess. And then to not even bother uniting the houses and redeeming Slytherin house as a whole, well that in my opinion is just lazy writing.

***** Well, Rowling obviously decided to keep the Houses probably for tradition reasons, but the concept of Slytherin still doesn't make sense. Surely the wizards themselves should realize it is a problem?

**** Because that's how she wrote it, and it was honestly kinda crappy. Slytherin is supposed to be ambition and cunning, not "backstabbing murder crazy."

You can be a Slytherin without aspiring to world domination, putting the fun in funeral, or being a literary equivalent mojo Jojo.

**** You could accredit that to Rowling simply wanting to have created a House to shove all the big-bads in the first few books, but later on she probably realized that the House she created was so one-dimensional that if fell flat on it's butt.

Personally, I find it extremely annoying that J.K Rowling chose to select one main place to put all the villains, but I can understand as to 'why' she did it.

It was, I believe, intended, for all rights and purposes, to be a general trait for all bad guys, but then half-way through she probably realized that this ain't the way you write a story.

** I have a few points to make.

1) Dumbledore, Quirrell, Percy, and Lockhart are all "morally ambiguous" characters and none of them were in Slytherin.

2) JK makes a very deliberate choice to have Peter Pettigrew in Gryffidor yet he betrays James and Lily. If JK truly wanted to paint Slytherin as the "bad' house, she could have incorporated a story line where Peter was a Slytherin but became besties with James, Sirius, and Remus anyway.

3) The time period we see of Slytherin is during the rise, fall, and resurgence of Voldemort. In the beginning, he gained followers who may not have realized how serious Voldemort was about cleansing wizard blood until it was too late for them to get out. They had the choice to default, be tortured or otherwise killed or risk their loved ones being harmed a punishment. That's a pretty shitty choice, if you ask me.\\
Then Voldemort "dies" and his followers do their best to save themselves by lying, paying bribes, or outing one another. The dust settles. All is well for over a decade. Oh wait, Voldemort returns and they face the same hard choices: return to their master or face dire consequences. They go back because either they support him or they don't want to die. It's pretty clear to me that Malfoys would rather run away than help Voldemort but that's not a real option so they do their best to survive.

4) We don't get to see what Hogwarts was really like before Tom Riddle showed up. When Salazar gets into his blood supremacy stuff, he's basically forced out of the school. The founders don't shut his house down then, probably because they were seeing students growing into great witches/wizards and felt it would be damaging to the school to shut it down.\\
The school, along with most of the wizarding world, probably goes through a huge restructuring of things to prevent a repeat of the past several decades. Eliminating the house and pretending it doesn't exist isn't going to fix anything. Changing how people think about the world around them is the real solution.

** If there were no Slytherin House, then all those bad seed children would be shuffled into the nice Houses, rotting them from within. Best to have a safety valve- an easy method to mark those who should be watched more carefully.

Wow, that's cruel.

Branding children as "bad seeds" just because they're ambitious and cunning? Do you really think that 11 year olds--even those sorted into Slytherin--are so inherently evil that they can "rot" an entire house? Because, wow...

Or, giving you the benefit of the doubt: rather than all Slytherins, branding only the children of Death Eaters as, again, inherently evil for the crime of having been indoctrinated by their parents. They're /children/.

I'm not even going to get into "nice Houses" and the (pretty gross, in my opinion) profiling and prejudice behind your comment...
