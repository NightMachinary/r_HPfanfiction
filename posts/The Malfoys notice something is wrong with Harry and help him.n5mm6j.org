  Narcissa M wants to join a magical high society league, to do so she is assigned 3 labors dealing with the Hearth, Home & Family as well as an apprentice, Hermione who wants to rescue Harry & free Sirius. Lucius just wants to support his wife, Draco wants to run away from home and Dumbledore, well he just wants his headache to go away. AD/MW bashed a pinch. Summer after POA.

** A really good story with the Malfoys helping Harry is 'Harry's Cousins'. Sadly it's now abandoned but there is enough of the story there to make a pretty complete read - there are 30 or so chapters.

  The Dursleys have never wanted Harry, so when he fortuitously stumbles across a book on Wizard Family Trees, he writes a letter, hoping to find another family to take him in, hopefully one that won't mind when he does 'freaky' stuff....
