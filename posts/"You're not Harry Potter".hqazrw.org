The wizarding world sometimes forgets that they don't have a monopoly on surnames. In September of 1991 two boys named Harry Potter get on the Hogwarts Express, one the muggle raised orphan and savior of the magical world, the other a muggleborn child to average parents.

Harry Potter - no not THE Harry Potter, just A Harry Potter - knew long before he even got his Hogwarts letter that his name was going to be an issue. He just hadn't been counting on the fact that THE Harry Potter would want to use this issue to prank the entire school. After all, why have just one Boy-Who-Lived? Might as well have two.
