Hi there, so I read this fantastic fic called Wand and Shield, unfortunately as amazing as it was it has been abandoned since 2017. I'm looking for similar fics. I want one where HP has already defeat Voldie and not one where Harry finds himself the long lost son of Tony Stark or any of the other Avengers. I want him to join them as an equal and not as a kid. Maybe as the Master of Death or just as a very talented Wizard that destroyed Voldie. Do you guys have any recommendations that fit the bill, like Wand and Shield? Thank you all in advance! Cheers!

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  For as long as Harry Potter could remember, he had only ever really needed---and wanted and longed for---one thing. Family.Family cared for one another, even at the expense of others that was not part of that family. In that, Harry could say that family is selfish and he was okay with it.And Death had always been a part of his life and he might as well hold on to what was left for him. It's that Harry Potter is Harley Keener AU nobody (including me) was looking for. HIATUS

  Harry Potter hated his fame, hated the way everyone compared him to his parents -- who he never got a chance to meet. Adults saw his parents in his hair or his eyes, whilst his ‘friends' saw a celebrity first and a person second. He just wanted to be a normal pre-teen. Who would have thought the combined powers of the Mirror of Erised -- a device that mirrored your greatest desire -- and the Philosopher's Stone -- an artifact to give one immortal life -- would team up to offer him a new start? Finding himself in a world not his own (repairing itself from a recent alien invasion of all things) Harry must survive the horrors of puberty, learn a whole different kind of magic, deal with sentient technology, oh, and maybe save the universe. Timeline: Harry from 11->14, The Avengers through to Age of Ultron.
