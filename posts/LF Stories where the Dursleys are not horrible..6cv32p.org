I'm looking for stories where the Dursleys treat Harry like family, or at least not like a slave. Stories where only some of the Dursleys mistreat him or where they were under a spell or potion that gets broken are acceptable

** linkffn(Patron) has good Dursley's.

linkffn(Proud by Summer Leigh Wind) +redeems+ focuses on a slightly different characterization of Vernon Dursley. One of the strengths of the fic is that Vernon still has some terrible aspects of his character, reflecting canon, yet he tries not to be overtly hateful or in opposition to Harry. And Dudley changes.

** Shifts by Ferwithy at the Sugar Quill has a great side plot in which Remus takes a job at Dudly's boarding school to protect him from death eaters. Dudly has some interesting character development.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10622306/1/The-Day-The-Dursleys-Came-To-Hogwarts]])

I've read this one recently. Petunia & Dudders are good, Vernon still an ass. Though be warned, the story is all over the place. Just coherent enough to be readable.

**** Why? It starts off with the typical Weasley and Dumbledore bashing, along with telling without showing.

***** Because the canon depictions of the Weasleys and Dumbledore are highly overrated. If you take a neutral look at what they did and what they achieved the Weasleys (and Dumbledore) suddenly don't look so good. Without going full potion Queen Molly you still have the fact that they knew about the abuse Harry suffered and did nothing but send him food. If your neighbour abusing children, holding them like slaves and you only give them food you are committing several crimes. You should inform the authorities and not send care packages.

The "conservative" Wizengamot would have the Dursleys kissed faster than you can say abuse if they knew that some muggles were torturing a wizard.

** The premise of the Tinkerer [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12461030/1/The-Tinkerer]] is that the Dursleys treat him as a human being and that changes everything.

** Hmm...[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2196609/1/An-Aunt-s-Love][An Aunt's Love]], Petunia is a bit late to the party, but does figure out that something's 'not quite right' in the Wizarding World and takes steps to do something about it.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2531438/1/A-Better-Man][A Better Man]] is another 'second chance'. Vernon gets the opportunity to try again and not be such an asswipe.\\
There's one more I can't find, but not to give away too much...Vernon gets a job as an accountant at a horse race track to support his family and comes in contact with Malfoy. I /thought/ it was by the same author that did An Aunt's Love, but it's not there, so I must be mistaken. Or they deleted it. Eh.\\
edit: Found it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7832676/1/Petunia-s-Boys][Petunia's Boys]]\\
edit edit: Oh! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4923158/1/3-Slytherin-Marauders][3 Slytherin Marauders]] could fit this as well (I knew that author had another story I liked). Vernon is, once again, abusive, so Petunia sends Harry and Dudley to find Snape, whom she remembers from childhood.

** /By Baker Street Station I Sat Down and Wept/ is possibly one of my favourite fics. With an amazing Petunia. A magical Dudley and possibly one of the worst Vernon's in fanfiction. And I have to say the best offstage portrayal of Lily Potter as well. We never meet her but she emerges as a character with an iron will, a towering intellect and the capability of doing just about anything in the pursuit of her goals. Not bad for a character who's never "onscreen".

** Bit late to the party, but

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11033616/1/You-re-my-Density]])

has good Dursley's, although two warnings: first, I don't remember how huge a part they played in the story and they may have been antagonistic a bit at the beginning, and two, it's by robst, and from what I've seen he's apparently a polarizing writer? I'm a fan of his stories, but I've seen him trashed hard.
