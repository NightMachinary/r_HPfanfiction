So many options to get character X to time Y, what is your favorite one?

There's the Paladeus fairie meddling and the similar Death and/or Fate(s) intervention. Basically an elder power gives the character another go.

I've seen various time turner shenanigans, often leading to accidental time travel. There's MoD and/or Veil things - again often with the accident element, which can be fun. There's always the complicated ritual, often requiring some kind of human sacrifice. Oh, from Delenda Est there's that magical artifact macguffin. There is also the closely related from-another-dimension and summoned involuntarily explanation. Am I missing some?

Just typing this out make me realize I kinda like the accidental time travel thing.


** Getting thrown back into a parallel dimension, but not aligned in time, is my favorite time travel mechanism:

1. No 'killing your grandfather' paradox

2. No limit on the range of time travel, memory/soul time travel still requires a body to go to, so that puts a limit how far back time travel can go.

3. Time travelers have maximum freedom of actions

4. The alternate universe may be slightly or significantly different, rendering some of traveler's knowledge useless or even counterproductive. This can introduce lots of suspense and mystery, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]], linkffn(12141684).

5. Multiverse theories are even supported by many scientists.

6. It allows easy Crossovers.

--------------

"Delenda Est" could also be interpreted as a dimensional time travel, since that's the main topic in its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(9754483). I even suspect the second Voldemort was from Harry Black's original dimension.

*** 1. "But how can I justify my super original cannon rehash + Harry harem fic now?!?!" /s

2. Personally I really dislike when a character arrives in their body in another dimension, I find it hard to root for a character who deceives everyone around them about who they are, often to the emotional detriment of those close to them...

3. This is a tricky one that I rarely see done well, not only does the author need to come up with an interesting difference to cannon, they also need to justify why this change took place.

4. I've said it before but mixing science with HP magic is something rarely done well if ever and will almost instantly take me out of the fic as I sit there and wonder why on earth Harry needs a mobile phone that is powered by magic and also scratches his ass.

Since you linked Delenda Est I agree that it is one of the best fics to deal with time travel, it's has its problems (all fics do) but I find them mostly negligible compared to the overall quality of the fic.

**** As to 4), it's very easy. There are many Points of Divergence in the Books, so minor changes at those points would lead to big changes in outcomes.

For examples:

- Ariana Dumbledore was killed by those Muggle kids. Thus, Albus hated Muggles and was fully committed with Grindelwald.
- Dumbledore decided not give Tom Riddle a second chance and neutralized him in his office in 1957.
- Snape insisted on being sorted into Gryffindor to join Lily, and became part of the Marauders instead of Peter.
- James didn't prevent Snape from going down to the Shrieking Shack. As a result, Remus ate Snape and was given to the Dementors, Sirius ended up in Azkaban, and Lily hated James forever after the truth came out. She would not be Harry Potter's mother if he were ever born.
- James and Lily were more paranoid and laid down some seriously nasty traps for Voldemort, they either escaped or got in a lucky shot on Voldemort.
- Sirius didn't chase down Wormtail, but contacted Dumbledore and the Order first; or Dumbledore showed more competence and insisted on interrogating Sirius personally. Harry therefore was raised by Sirius with the help of Tonkses, Dora might become his pseudo sister.
- Continuing from previous point, Dumbledore flexed his powers and forced Ministry to perform THOROUGH interrogations of ALL marked Death Eaters. Malfoy's secret stash of dark artifacts was uncovered, earning him a long vacation with Dementors. Lestranges admitted to more crimes and were sentenced to Dementor's Kiss. Both Diary and Cup ended up in Dumbledore's hands, then he and DoM began the Horcrux hunt.
- Or alternatively, Lucius showed more bravery and cunning. Instead of hastily claiming Imperius defense, he rallied the Death Eaters, faked Voldemort's survival, and delivered a fatal blow to Ministry's and Dumbledore's reputation. The latter was forced to flee the country with remaining Order members.
- Harry didn't run into Draco while shopping, but first on the train. Draco, under his father's direction, was friendly to him. Ron later showed up, seeing Harry with Draco together, insulted them. Consequently, Harry was sorted into Slytherin.
- Harry in Slytherin could have following consequences: Snape was more receptive to Harry and might have trained him better; Ron still insulted Hermione, but nobody came to her rescue and she was killed; nobody went to protect the Stone, so either Voldemort got trapped and neutralized, or he made off with the Stone and returned earlier.
- After CoS event, Dumbledore took the Basilisk a little more seriously. And there is already a fic exploring its potential fallout: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/][Petrification Proliferation]]
- If Remus took his Wolfbane potion, Wormtail would be captured, Sirius would be exonerated, Bertha Jorkins would be fine, Barty Jr would stay under his dad's control, Moody would serve up his one year contract, TWT would proceed normally, Umbridge would not turn up at Hogwarts, DA would not get formed, Death Eaters locked up in Azkaban would not be freed, and Voldemort would skulk in Albanian Forests for a long long time.

There are many many more PoDs, and all of them could be used to develop alternative scenarios. An author just needs to have the courage to dump the canon events and develop his/her own plot.

***** I agree that there are many possible divergences but I think the issue lies with authors who are unwilling to/ not original enough to put them into effect. It may be my recent reading colouring my views but divergences that butterfly effect into massive social/power changes are very rare and hardly ever occur before Harry comes into the picture, I can probably count on 1 hand the number of good fics that take the idea and run with it. (By run with it I mean it really effecting the plot, not just Sirius raises Harry so he's actually super hot now and is polite so all the ladies love him but it's still a cannon rehash.

****** This irritates me as well. If you're going to do a divergent story, things should not happen the same way they did in cannon. At first things might be recognizably similar, but at some point it should be so different that it no longer bears any resemblance to cannon save for the same actors on the stage. If Harry HAD been raised by Sirius Black, shouldn't it affect who Harry meets on the train (and hence who he becomes buds with)? Most of the time, it doesn't.

******* Even more than that should it also not mean that in the case of Sirius raising Harry he already have friends before he gets on the train? I can't think of a single reason Harry wouldn't have know at least Neville, if not also Susan Bones since both are from obviously allied families and Sirius would have known the longbottoms well judging by the small size of the cannon order.

******** It was possible that because Harry's delicate status, Sirius might have fled with him to a foreign country and trained hard themselves there. So in this scenario, not only wouldn't Harry have many friends, but he wouldn't even show up at Hogwarts, or at any public magical schools. However, the Tonkses might join him and Sirius, and Dora would be his pseudo big sister.

On the other hand, if Sirius and Dumbledore felt they could guarantee Harry's security in magical Britain, then he would have many friends, including Neville, Susan, Tonkses, and Weasleys, well before he went to Hogwarts.

** I like the 'character is thrown back in time and when they return they cause themselves to be thrown back in time'. One of my plots is about a character who is suddenly and bewilderingly executed by her rulers via getting thrown into a mysterious pool of magic that disintegrates people, is sent to and lives in the ancient past for a couple of years, and then unwittingly returns via the same pool, panics, causes huge destruction to the city and nearly kills her rulers, escapes, and discovers a few days later that her past self was just executed for her current self's destructive actions, sending her past self back in time. And later she figures out that the kid she left back in time was the famous orphan who founded the city and she was her own ancestor x3000 years ago. She collects ancient folktales about her own kid to feel closer to the toddler she left behind, it's all very angsty.

One thing this reminded me of, which I really loved, I don't remember which fic it was from, but on the invention of time turners, it went :

So this one guy is approached by a hooded figure, who gives him a wit-sharpening potion and then demonstrates how to make a time turner; gives the cloak and a wit sharpening potion to the guy, along with the time turner, who goes back and teaches himself how to make a time turner.

** I have always felt that time travel is made out to be harder than it really should be in the HP universe. Let's look at Apparation. You are physically teleporting yourself through space, so in theory, why could someone just apparate through time as well. Time and space are intrinsically linked, so what happens if you mess around with teleportation to try to time travel? And for that matter, is we assume Apparation is faster than light, then they should be able to time travel with the right reference frames, as they are faster than causality. It would be hellishly difficult, and would likely involve Apparation several light-years away and back, but in theory it would be possible.
