Okay, so Ginny is probably one of the most controversial HP characters out there. Some love her, and some absolutely loathe her, etc, so I'm wondering what you think of her and why (preferably for canon, not fanon reasons). Do you love/hate/pity/respect her? If you had a say in the way the books had ended, where would Ginny be in the epilogue; by Harry's side at King's Cross, or dead somewhere? Do you approve of Ginny as a partner for Harry? Why/why not? Any other thoughts on the youngest Weasley will be greatly appreciated!


** One of the reasons I have always like the Harry/Ginny pairing is that Ginny is a nice balance for Harry. Where he can be very inward-focused and brooding, Ginny is outgoing and can draw him out of himself -- case in point, in OotP when Harry is afraid he is being possessed, and Ginny snaps him out of it. Which leads to my second reason for liking their relationship: Ginny is the only other character who can truly understand what it is like to have Tom Riddle in your head and to be so directly influenced by him at a young age. Ron and Hermione were with Harry in a lot of his adventures, sure, but it's not the same as having Voldemort specifically target you and get inside your mind. Ginny knows what that's like, maybe not to the same extent, but more so than any other character.

** I read an anaylsis that argued Harry finds Ginny so attractive because they share a sense of humor, which is considered important in romantic attraction. First I was like "huh?" But the author brought many examples of times Ginny makes Harry laugh. In addition, I recently re-read books 5 and 6 paying attention to Ginny and she is actualy very active and present. So I don't think charcter development in the book is bad, which I believed before just because I heard it so many times.

However, I hated the epilogue, not because Harry ended up woth Ginny but because it was a predictable, overly fluffy, everyone paired up neatly piece. I also disliked movie Ginny - I have nothing against Bonnie Wright, and I think she is talented and pretty, but not how I imagined Ginny at all.

Finally, while I'm ok with fanfiction that pairs Harry with other charcter, please don't do it by making Ginny a cartoonish villian. She can be the antagonist, but raping Harry with love potion? being after the Potter fortune while cheating on Harry? Smearing Harry in the press? Really? That's so unlike the character it just went from ooc to whatever comes 300,000 steps later. And a cliche besides.

*** Potions Ginny is very easy to believe, with all the hints dropped in book 6. Doesn't mean she is evil even if she did, but to me it seems like that was the plan until someone pointed out to JKR it was kinda rapey.

That said, I hate that in most H/Hr pairings; the only way they can justify H/Hr is if Ginny is evil or a slut. Why can't the pairing just stand on its own? It has plenty of merit.

My penname is GinnyMyLove, so obviously I don't hate her....even if I've grown to think Hermione was more logical based on the canon.

** I think JKR does teenage romance quite well actually. She really captures the intense drama of it all, whilst keeping it relatively light-hearted, and it never really seemed to overtake the plot. Yeah she kept it quite child friendly, which kinda cuts down on the realism (they really all are very naive for teenagers, or there's stuff we aren't being shown), but all in all, it adds to the series rather than detracting from it I think.

Unfortunately, I feel that there is no winning the end game here. Either Harry ends up with his childhood sweetheart which is ridiculously unrealistic or he ends up alone/with someone we haven't met yet which is narratively unsatisfying.

The fact that it is Ginny though, does make it worse for me. She feels really flat as a character, and Harry never really seems to connect emotionally with her. In fact, both Hermione and Luna would have been much better choices - they are the only two people that I can remember Harry being emotionally vulnerable in front of.

I do like the arc that Ginny goes through in a lot of ways, from fangirl, to victim, to freedom fighter - I just think it would be a lot stronger if she had in fact really moved on and away from Harry. Making her part of /his/ story (oh woe is me, I must dump my girlfriend to save her, can I never know love? etc. etc.) again really takes away any impact her narrative arc might have had for me. It as if the "one big happy Weasley family" ending is Harry's reward for choosing love over power, and thus Ginny is just a trophy girlfriend/wife in the end.

So I don't love, but I don't hater either. And I both pity and respect her. If I had to write her ending - she joins the Holyhead Harpies and enjoys a long and successful career as a Chaser, fucking her way through the eligible bachelors of Wizarding Europe whilst on tour and loving every minute of it, and thoroughly annoying both her mother and her older brothers in the process :)

*** I actually disagree about Movie Ginny. I thought that Bonnie Wright's portrayal was bland and emotionless, when Ginny in the books is depicted as vivacious, bold, outgoing, and funny. She's kind of a mix between the twins and Bill in the books. In the movies she's the most boring character. I've always thought that Movie Ginny is what led to so many negative opinions about the character among fans.

**** I agree. In the novels, you see a lot more of an impish side to her. She is portrayed a smarter, wittier, and more outgoing and passionate than in the movies. She is also portrayed as more magically powerful in the novels. We get a few hints here or there in the films, but the books really explore her ability to create new and powerful spells (Bat-Bogey Hex).

I think that it was hard to cram everything into each film so they had to cut stuff. Unfortunately, Ginny-scenes most likely got axed so we could focus more on the Trio and Voldemort. A good example is OoTP, where we go through several chapters of Dumbledore's Army members slowly improving their abilities, whereas in the film we get a five-ten minute montage then Umbrige.

So because stuff got cut, we end up with this strange, foreign, bland, and boring Ginny that skewed the viewers' image of the character. Which sucks cause book-Ginny is baller.

** I posted this in [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] a while back, basically explaining why Ginny was the only real choice for Harry.

There are very subtle hints within the books. Harry begins noticing Ginny much more and he feels jealous when he sees her with other boys. And, to be fair, Harry really doesn't do much noticing of girls. He only really notices Cho because she's high profile. Ginny flies much more under the radar, even if he does spend a lot of his time at her home and with her brother. Harry seems to be much more occupied with Voldemort and defeating him, not to mention his ever-increasing course load on top of the drama that comes with each of Harry's years at Hogwarts. Harry really doesn't have much free time to go noticing girls. For example:

First year: He's 11. Come on. Not to mention he JUST got accepted to the most awesome school he could ever dream of attending, he's trying to prove himself as a wizard, and is more concerned about Snape helping Voldemort than he is about any girls.

Second year: He's 12, sure some people can say "I had my first crush when I was 12! Even before that!" but I think it's safe to say that as muggles, we live in a much more sexualized world than these kids do. They don't have the media going HEY YOU NEED A BOY FRIEND or WOW LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE GETTING MARRIED. They don't have movies and television telling them that they need a significant other to be worth anything. Also, Harry becomes a bit of a pariah in this book. HEIR OF SLYTHERIN OVER HERE GUYS LOOK OUT. He's hearing things, voices in the walls, he got stuck outside the barrier at platform 9 3/4 and then flew to Hogwarts, nearly got expelled, crashed into a tree that tried to kill him, loses the bones in his arm after a bludger tried to kill him, there's strange messages on the walls, and BANG! His best friend's sister goes missing and his other best friend is petrified! He then has to go after his best friend's sister and almost dies. Safe to say, he was occupied that year.

Third year: Alright, you could argue that 13 is a valid age for guys to start taking interest in girls. Unfortunately for Harry, he attracts trouble. He's a friggin Dementor magnet, not to mention the fact that the man he believes to be his parents killer escapes from prison and seems to have a vendetta against him. Then his favorite teacher is a werewolf and his friend's rat killed his parents, ON TOP of another teacher telling him EVERYDAY that he's in mortal peril! Wow, one hell of a year if you ask me.

Year 4: This would definitely be a year when any boy would start noticing girls. Unless you're Harry Potter. Triwizard Tournament, Voldemort coming back, Cedric dying. I think he was busy. Granted he did notice Cho, but like I said, she was much more high profile than Ginny.

Year 5: Angst, angst, angst. Dementors attack, he gets expelled, then he doesn't, then he has a hearing and the Ministry is out to get him. Cho likes him but she's conflicted about Cedric and it's just a big mess. Most of the wizarding world hates him and thinks he's a liar. He's angry all the time because Voldemort's inside his head. No one will tell him anything and Dumbledore's avoiding him, and he's got a psycho teacher that takes over the school and forces him to write in his own blood. On top of that, he's leading a band of mis-fits and teaching them how to fight! Then his godfather dies and it's his fault and everyone believes him that Voldemort's back but now everyone is scared. I think Harry had a lot more on his mind than girls. However, the trip to the Ministry was probably when he really started taking notice of Ginny.

Sixth year: Not everyone hates him, but Harry is obsessed with proving Draco is a Death Eater. Dumbledore is giving him private lessons and trying to teach him how to kill Voldemort. Plus he's got a textbook that knows more about potions and spells than an average student should. But Harry does see some more of Cho, and it just ends badly. And we slowly see more and more of Ginny and of Harry's feelings towards her. Then they ARE together and then Dumbledore's dead and Harry leaves her to protect her and the book is over.

Seventh year: Three words: extended camping trip.

But then they're alive and Harry loves Ginny and it's all hunky dorey and it's okay. It's okay because Hermione and Ron are together and there's really no one else for Harry. And Hermione and Ron work because opposites attract and love works in mysterious ways. In the end, they're happy with who they're with, so it really doesn't matter what we think.

*** Hermione/Ron is what always has bothered me though. I don't remember where I read it, but someone said "Though Hermione and Ron fight like a married couple, everyone seems to forget that couples who always fight get a divorce." And that is exactly my problem with that pairing. Now I know that JK has dropped all those hints, but still, they don't work in my opinion. Ron has a lot of good traits, but his lack of interest in other things than Quidditch would eventually frustrate Hermione. Apparently JK said somewhere in an interview that she had thought that Hermione and Fred would end up together and I can see that much easier, also because Hermione needs someone who's made it his life-purpose to make people laugh.

EDIT: Just after I posted this, I realised I completely ignored the subject of this thread and I apologise for this. I got a little carried away

**** I actually like Ginny as a potential character, especially after the buildup in CoS. That could have gone great places. It didn't, mostly I think because the logical Fourth Book low-key budding romance stuff simply didn't happen for... reasons? I don't think anyone, even- no, /especially/ tweens, should be expected to care about a character who doesn't appear in plot for basically /three books/. I'll get back to that later.

Though I totally agree with your opinion of the other primary canon relationship (and it being slightly off topic), do you want to know the worst thing about Hermione/Ron? Well, first of all, Hermione is an obvious and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling][admitted author self-insert]]:

#+begin_quote
  Rowling said of her adolescence, "Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all Harry Potter character] is loosely based on me. She's a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud of."
#+end_quote

Seems to fit to me. And then you realize that the JKR-insert ends up with the "brave" and "loyal," but also previously near fatally immature, mostly emotionally abusive, major slacker and arguable loser (who hopefully grows into a better human being during the timeskip at the end... right?), whereas the hero of the story gets together with the sporty girl who is classically pretty and emotionally aggressive.

Yeah. That points to issues right there, especially considering JKR's personal context while she was writing the books, /especially/ the initial book and the designing of the series' overarching plot. But that was her story, so obviously it was her choice. The context of those choices is decidedly odd, though, as is the publication gap after GoF. Again, more on that later. Yes, yes, I ship Harry/Hermione sometimes, but it isn't my bloodstained OTP flag flying from that ship. Yet.

So, back to the topic: I've got my whole paranoid theory about the late, late Ginny hookup, her characterization, and what I'm almost sure was a moderately large fourth book onward plot rewrite concerning Ginny [[http://www.fanfiction.net/topic/127267/82551281/1/#92625778][here on my FFN forums]].

An excerpt from that post:

#+begin_quote
  I've got my own little charts and diagrams (no, I don't really [...I might]) that show how JKR was really planning on Harry/Hermione in the first three books. This theory (it isn't technically a conspiracy theory, as I think JKR did everything here by herself) has Ginny being the "other girl" who causes romantic drama and later becomes like his sister, and has Ron being a jealous prat who he almost loses as a brother but then resolves things with, causing them to become even stronger friends. Take GoF. GoF is weird, especially for Ron. It would have made a lot more sense for Ron to be mad at Harry (especially mad at him that much) if he had something else serious to be mad about on top of the Goblet. Maybe if he found out about Harry getting closer to Hermione in addition to the whole Goblet thing. Ron would have been worried about the trio breaking up, losing his crush (Hermione) to the guy he's jealous of (Harry) for a lot of valid if petty reasons, and to top it off, his sister is also sniffing around Harry. It would both emotionally and logically make a lot of sense.
#+end_quote

To finish off my paranoid rant, consider this bit, also from the Wikipedia page on JKR:

#+begin_quote
  Rowling admitted that she had had a moment of crisis while writing the novel; "Halfway through writing Four, I realised there was a serious fault with the plot ... I've had some of my blackest moments with this book ... One chapter I rewrote 13 times, though no-one who has read it can spot which one or know the pain it caused me."

** It's difficult to hate Ginny for canon reasons because we weren't given enough exposure to her character to form an opinion either way. Really, the only reason for Ginny-hate is a mountain of bad, sappy, H/G fanon predicated on some bad, sappy, "monster in the chest" writing by JKR in Book 6, which was more a reflection on Harry's character than Ginny's. I don't mind reading or writing fanfiction with her as a principal character or that pairs her with Harry.

Had I had a choice, if JKR had (as she claimed) planned from early on for Harry to hook up with Ginny, then I'd rather have seen her developed more throughout the books. This would have removed the second-worst objection to the Epilogue (the worst being that Ron and Hermione had zero chemistry as a couple in the books). /Goblet of Fire/ had many spots where she could have stepped in, particularly after Ron stepped out.

**** My problem with the "monster in the chest" stuff is that I felt that it came out of nowhere. Harry seemed to either have deluded himself into thinking he didn't have a crush on Ginny before the "monster" shit or he spontaneously began liking her. Spontaneously liking someone does happen in real life but it didn't translate well onto the page in this case. It didn't take me by surprise but it felt like a lazily written "oh, by the way, he and Ginny are totally a thing now, isn't that sweet?"

***** While I agree it seemed rather sudden I think if you try to look at how Ginny is described more than just how Harry views her, you'll see that she is becoming a progressively larger part of the story as the books progress. Suddenly she opens up and we hear about her, and she is there for Harry when he just needs someone there. And not only that, but she seems to be the one to come up with small jokes and jests to make the people around her, including Harry, laugh. I think the whole thing about it being sudden, is because it is hidden between the words, whereas many authors use lines upon lines to describe how the character thinks and feels about everything around them.

[We can't figure out what Emerson actually said here.] JKR: Well, no, not really, because the plan was, which I really hope I fulfilled, is that the reader, like Harry, would gradually discover Ginny as pretty much the ideal girl for Harry. She's tough, not in an unpleasant way, but she's gutsy. He needs to be with someone who can stand the demands of being with Harry Potter, because he's a scary boyfriend in a lot of ways. He's a marked man. I think she's funny, and I think that she's very warm and compassionate. These are all things that Harry requires in his ideal woman. But, I felt - and I'm talking years ago when all this was planned - initially, she's terrified by his image. I mean, he's a bit of a rock god to her when she sees him first at 10 or 11, and he's this famous boy. So Ginny had to go through a journey as well. And rather like with Ron, I didn't want Ginny to be the first girl that Harry ever kissed. That's something I meant to say, and it's kind of tied in. One of the ways in which I tried to show that Harry has done a lot of growing up - in Phoenix, remember when Cho comes into the compartment, and he thinks, "I wish I could have been discovered sitting with better people," basically? He's with Luna and Neville. So literally the identical thing happens in Prince, and he's with Luna and Neville again, but this time, he has grown up, and as far as he's concerned he is with two of the coolest people on the train. They may not look that cool. Harry has really grown. And I feel that Ginny and Harry, in this book, they are total equals. They are worthy of each other. They've both gone through a big emotional journey, and they've really got over a lot of delusions, to use your word, together. So, I enjoyed writing that. I really like Ginny as a character."

She is a bad character because she is elevated to a position of importance, that of romantic interest, but she has no depth.

Plus, she comes off as a Mary Sue, with absolutely no short comings. Pretty much every boy in Hogwarts lusts after her, even the Slytherins. Her bat bogey hex is so impressive it caused Slughorn to invite her to his parties. She has a short temper, but this is shown as a positive quality, suggesting that she is "fiery". She did fall for Voldermort's trap in the second book, but she was eleven at the time, and everyone agreed it wasn't her fault at all.

The most memorable moments for her after the second book don't speak well of her best qualities; she's catty to Fleur, Slughorn grabbed her for the Slug-club when she smacked Zacharias Smith with a Bat-bogey hex, she says something really shallow when Harry declared that they had to break up, when George/Ron catches them mid-snog she acts embarrassed (when she could've shown her legendary passion and humor by telling them to sod off and then finish what they started), and when they return to Hogwarts for the last battle, she's shunted into the Room of Requirement by her mother- no speech or defiant 'I've been running a bloody resistance cell, so you can sod off about me staying behind'; instead she grumps and then defies instruction, throwing herself into the battle for no particular purpose.

Basically, every chance to make Ginny worthy of Harry's attention was ditched for some reason. The best possible moment that should have been Ginny's (sympathizing with Harry's situation) ended up handled by Luna.

** I hate how formulaic and "easy" the whole "one big happy weasley family" ending is. I hate the lack of development for Ginny in most of the books; she should have become the fourth member of the Golden Trio. She should have gone camping with them. There was really no reason for Ron to storm off, less reason if Ginny were there; other than because it was perfectly in character for Ron to abandon his friends. Was he even wearing the horcrux at the time? Or just still recovering from getting splinched?

I like Ginny's character, I wish it had been more fleshed out before she became the main love interest. I prefer Hermione based only on the books, but my penname is GinnyMyLove so obviously I thought she was great at one point, and I still don't hate her.

Honestly, I could have done without any epilogue at all. I feel like it was more an attempt on JKR's part to smash any rumors of a continuing HP series. "Adventures of Harry Potter" or something, with him as an Auror investigating dark wizards and going on Indiana Jones type adventures with Bill Weasley.

I liked book Ginny much more than Movie Ginny, I liked young Bonnie, as she seemed to fit my idea of GW perfectly. But as she grew up she was less and less what I saw in my head. I didn't find her to be an amazing beauty, or an amazing actress. Nothing in her acting or character portrayal made me think she belonged with Harry.

I also subscribe to the idea that Ginny was originally supposed to be using love potion on Harry, but that someone pointed out to JKR that it was kinda rapey. The stuff about Merope using it on TR Sr might have already been there, or might have been added afterward to use the preexisting references to Amortentia. The whole arc about Ron and the Love Potion seemed out of place to me too. And Harry felt the monster in his chest, but was able to fight it off...the same way he could fight off Imperious, and Veela Allure.

That wouldn't make Ginny evil necessarily...Molly though...

*** Ginny would've still had the trace on her. That's a good reason for her not to go camping with them.

**** I guess...but be honest, the trace is about as dumb an idea as putting a taboo on the name Voldemort. If you can put a taboo on words, why not the incantations for the unforgiveables?

But in any case....good show... I can think of ways to make it canon compliant with some small changes, so I'm sure JKR could have. It was just easier to tuck her "safely" away at Hogwarts and out of most of the story.

*** You know, a missing love potions plot bit that /doesn't/ end up supporting a final Harry/Ginny relationship in the end would actually make even more sense. That would make removing parts of it logical during a rewrite if One Big Weasly Family /wasn't/ the final romantic pairing she initially had in mind when she wrote those scenes, which could certainly have left the whole thing seeming a little patchwork. See my [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1likq4/lets_talk_about_ginny_weasley/cc05v3f][large rant elsewhere in this topic]] about Ginny and secret plot rewrites for details of my madness.

That would also color a theoretically missing Ginny love potions subplot as something that /wasn't/ positive, which would make more sense from a moral standpoint. This would make Ginny more of a classically flawed character and give her a little more depth. I've also got my own theory about /Hermione Granger and the Horcrux Camping Trip/ and how Ginny would have logically fit into a parallel plot line about her organizing the resistance back in occupied +France+ Hogwarts with Neville (and her feelings about that and him), but that is a story about a story for another time and another topic.

**** I agree with you for the most part... especially if it was NOT some editor or friend that pointed it out to her, be she wrote the story the way it had grown organically.

Only to end up with H/Hr, Ron and Ginny estranged, and no big happy ending. She obviously intended it to be H/G all along, and she might have realized towards the end of writing DH that she had screwed that up somehow, and had to "fix" it.

Of course...there is also the idea I have; She didn't even write the last two books, she gave all her notes to a ghost writer because she was sick of Harry Potter.

** i liked here when i was young and naive and felt the same about life as such young peopel are wont to. Every pretty girl was a possible wife and if she wasnt available i was instantly in love.

Now ive grown and become jaded in life im not a big fan of her being the ending love unless se went through a lot of growing behind the scenes as it were.

** For some reason, I simply can't read H/G romance story. I like when they maintain friendship/partnership/trust in each other, but I have an aversion to their romance. My main issue is probably the fact, that JKR introduced romance and relationships a bit forcefully (just my opinion) and their interactions just weird me out somehow, plus her character is underdeveloped - we see her first as a ''rabid fangirl'' and two books later, instant transition to the start of romance. Also, can't stand true love/soul mate thingy.

EDIT for spelling.
