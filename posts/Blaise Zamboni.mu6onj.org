The students walked out on the ice of the black lake, their nervous chatter cut across the quiet of the snowy landscape. Today would be the day that the 8th years would complete their animagus transformations, a feat that all of the returning students decided to partake in. Blaise watched as Harry Potter turned into a huge moose, hooves skittering for balance on the reflective ice. Draco turned into a Komodo dragon, Hermione into an owl, and Ron into a brown bear. As more and more animals began frolicking on the ice, scratching it with claws and hooves, the nervousness set in. Blaise had an inkling as to his spirit animal, and it wasn't an animal at all. He didn't want to transform in front of all the others, but looking at the scratched and now unpolished ice set an almost unbearable itching across his body. how dare they scuff HIS ice. With a final whimper of reluctance he succumbed to his transformation.

Seamous watched the lake, his orangutang arms molded back into human ones. A large muggle machine swept swaths of ice on the black lake, clearing imperfections and leaving a glossy finish. "Blaise Zamboni" he whispered in awe.

** I wonder if somewhere in the multiverse there is a version of Harry Potter where people learn to become inanimagus? Sirius Black becomes a shrub, Peter Pettigrew becomes a length of rope, and James becomes a hot tub.
