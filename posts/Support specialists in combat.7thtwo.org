This seems like it could be done interestingly. Is anyone aware of any good stories where there are people in secondary positions helping the main fighters in combat, whether by acting as medics, or force multipliers, or technical specialists?

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** linkffn(Second Chances by zaxaurus)

This is a trilogy with HP/DG NL/HG; the latter two contain more of what you are saying. Basically Neville, Hermione, and Daphne support, and Harry attacks. They also represent elements Harry/Fire, Daphne/Air, Hermione/Water, and Neville/Earth.

So Neville and Hermione or maybe Neville and Daphne are mostly focused on defense while either Hermione or Daphne attack with Harry.

This fic has a couple problems, Daphne is basically a prettier Hermione in the first few chapters but the author fixes that later. It also has very heavy Dumbledore, Ron and Molly bashing. Ginny gets redeemed and all the other Weasleys are good.

It focuses more on HG/NL physical relationship and HP/DG emotional relationship, so if you want HP/DG smut you prob aren't going to get any.

If you don't already know:

Neville Longbottom: NL

Daphne Greengrass: DG

Hermione Granger: HG

Harry Potter: HP
