I don't know about anyone else, but when I was 11 years old I thought that relationships were disturbing. I definitely didn't have any crushes when I was 11 at least. So why do we have our 11 year old Harry Potter's meeting Draco and crushing on him immediately? And why does Draco crush on Harry after *literal* minutes? They. Are. 11! There is a reason that Harry doesn't notice Cho until 4th year. Heck, even 3rd is acceptable, but when they are 11 years old they are oblivious to romance, so let's stop with the romanticizing of 11 year olds.

That's the end of that rant, have a wonderful day!


** Hmm I had crushes as young as like 7 years old, but it was very generic and like ‚ÄúOh they're cute. I'd like to be friends.‚Äù Once I was like 12, then I started to feel upset about how my friends were dating people and I wasn't even though I didn't feel ready to date myself. I felt ready to date at 16 but purely in an innocent, affectionate way, with no desire for hooking up, despite the fact many of my peers were getting physical with each other. I didn't even want any sort of physical intimacy (outside of innocent affection) in a relationship until I was in my early 20s.

In short, I think it varies depending on the person. There are certain actions people have HP characters take in their early or late teens that disturb me but actually do happen among some in their early and late teens. I just avoid those stories.

** I think it's fine to sort of plant the seeds for a relationship early on. But not in any weirdly romantic way.

[[https://youtu.be/VR8hlvLghrs][I think one of the best examples of how to portray a healthy romance that starts as kids is Ellie and Carl from Up]] --- (spoilers for Up if you somehow haven't seen it yet)

Naturally, I think you shouldn't have eleven year olds smooching each other in fics (or other...unsavoury things) but I think it can be a cute starting point for a future relationship if its developed correctly.

Even though it wasn't anything remotely sexual I distinctly remember having little puppy crushes on my classmates towards the end of elementary school.

Ultimately, I think if your ship meets in first year authors should focus on developing their friendship dynamic/platonic relationship and letting it gradually become something more as they age appropriately.

Personally, I'm very uncomfortable reading any smut before characters are at least 18 (or preferably at least early 20's) But I think some PG-13 handholding and smooching isn't so bad once fifth year hits, provided it's not a weirdly vivid/gropey makeout session.

*** That last line, Lmao. Yeah, I'm all for relationships and ship building but I think that, overall, fanfiction authors typically struggle with a relationship ark, they try for the relationship at 11 that would only be a realistic at... 13 or 14. I understand innocent crushes were very common for most people, and I'm not saying that that is abnormal, I'm saying that the romance of the 11 year old relationship is unrealistic at best. This also goes back to character building too, you rarely see proper character growth in a lot of fanfiction. Case and point, Sirius dying in canon truly shocks Harry into the mindset of 'this is war' and we see a revival of Harry's growth after he was a pessimistic lil shit for a year. We rarely see that type of growth in fanfiction, even on the small scale.

**** My theory concerning all the stories with very precocious eleven year olds is that if authors are writing a fic that takes place during their Hogwarts years, they typically want to write it from the very beginning, meaning first year.

Problem is, a lot of authors are also eager to jump RIGHT into the meat of their plot and RIGHT into the ship, so you end up with the aforementioned eleven year olds winking suggestively and entering politics.

People need to learn that you can START a fic in the protag's last year of school

***** What I don't get is why these authors don't do, like, a minimal amount of legwork to shift a bit of canon around so first years are 16 or 18 or even 20 or whatever. If you want to write about adult romance, why not write /adults?/

It seems infinitely simpler to age up the characters and make Hogwarts into a university-style institution attended after muggle education rather than trying to justify whatever the hell else they always do.

I'd honestly prefer this overall - I like characters with agency over their own lives.

** Just because you didn't have any crushes at age 11 it doesn't mean no one else did. This is fairly common. It is not the same type of crush one has at 14 or 17, but many people start developing the notion of romance at this age.

For example, I had crushes but was too much of a potato head to act on them. They were mostly on older boys who wouldn't pay attention to me anyway or on celebrities. When we were 12, my friend also had a crush, but on a boy a year younger and they "dated" for a month. They basically kissed and held hands, and broke up for some random reason I don't remember anymore.

Also, IIRC Ginny had a crush on Harry at the age of 10/11 when Ron and the twins took him to The Burrow before their second year.

** When I was about 11, a boy slipped me a Valentine conversation heart that said "be mine." Still think it was sweet and romantic. We said we were BF & GF, went to a couple of movies (I think; it's been a long time since I was 11/12), hung out together in and out of school, and he kissed me good bye when I moved away. Previous to that, I know there were boys I considered my boyfriend at the time (and they agreed), but obviously we would have done even less. Kiss on the cheek at most--and didn't we feel oh so daring!

Crushes aside, I wouldn't expect 11yos to be much more advanced than that for the most part, especially Muggle-raised ones and Weasleys. You could maybe make a case for some of the pureblood, since I think some of them were raised in such a hothouse atmosphere. So Draco might do the winking thing, but probably not Harry, Hermione, or Dean (to name a few).

** Crushes are fine. 11 year olds definitely have crushes, on celebrities, on the handsome older kid who's on the sports teams, on classmates and so on.

What 11 year olds don't have, normally, are adult relationships. They're awkward children. They don't "flirt" the way adults and older teens do. Remembering being 11 (and it's a long time ago so maybe I'm off base but whatever!) if you "fancied" someone as we call it in the UK, you wouldn't flirt or wink or march up to them and ask them out. You'd do weird stuff like make an excuse to be where you know they are, then hide when you saw them! You'd never approach them directly, you'd send your best mate to give /their best mate/ a note asking if they liked you- and if they didn't like you? You pretend it's all a joke and actually you think they're ugly!

So yeah, writing kids with crushes and being awkward and ridiculous about it (much like Ginny is in canon tbh) is fine. What's not fine is having them being all suave about it and acting like they're a confident 25 year old who knows how to ask someone out.

Also, some fics, there's a level of sexual stuff between young characters (and I have seen this in fics where they're in first/second year, usually with the /soulmate/ excuse and that's why I now avoid soulmate fics), which is a) no and b) FUCK NO. Any physical contact in a "relationship" between 11 or 12 year olds would be limited to hand holding, kiss on the cheek, maybe a really awkward peck on the lips. 13, 14, 15 would snog and would notice boobs on girls, fit upper body on boys and so on, but again most people aren't ready for sex at that young age and additionally, most people /don't want to read underage sex./ Between 16-18 the lines get blurred, because the age of consent in the UK is 16, so if Harry is 17 and Ginny is 16, it would be perfectly legal for them to have sex, but again I wouldn't go into great detail about it- if you're writing smut and your intention is to arouse, make your characters at the very least 18+.

You can mention that 16 year old characters have sex, in a way that isn't designed to titillate, if it is needed for plot. But if you want to write what's basically porn, please remember that in the majority of the world, pornographic depictions of under 18s are illegal, for good reason. I know this really applies to visual media, but the majority of people would be uncomfortable/grossed out reading it, never mind seeing it. There's a huge fic audience of the "original" potterheads who are in our 20s and 30s now, and grown adults tend to not want to read about schoolkids having sex, even if they are of age.

I mean, maybe we really do use langauge differently but there's an incredible, vast amount, of difference between "apathy" and "finding something disturbing".

I wouldn't have argued against apathy. It's not even in the same ballpark.

Also age 11-12 is exactly the age where "cooties" starts to change. There's definitely some hand holding and as others have called it "puppy love" starting there.

** Eh, I had massive crushes on people at 11/12. Never did anything about ‚Äòem, I but wrote a lot about them in my journals üòé

However, I don't want anyone that age...actually not younger than 16 or so to be making out...not even, like, intensely kissing.

I will say, it was common knowledge that one couple in my 7th grade class had oral sex. That was very unusual, of course. Not to say I want it portrayed in stories I read, because I would probably set it down if I saw anything like that, but I do acknowledge it happens on occasion.

** ...I now want to see a story where an 11 year old Harry develops a crush on Daphne. They hang out, be friendly, awkwardly do the things kids do such as sneak glances at one another and awkwardly try to make moves to hold hands, despite the social pressures of Gryffindor/Slytherin (although the older girls in both houses going "awww" at the puppy love would be hilarious).

He goes for the plunge and kisses her on the cheek one day.

Bewildered, and a little freaked out, she responds by slapping him and sending him crashing to the floor.

You know like that Simpsons episode where Bart kisses that girl his age and she freaks out? Yeah. XD

A few years later, they're dating properly, and he'll never let her live that down.

** So just because Harry didn't pay attention to opposite (or the same) sex, in that way until 4 year in canon he can't do so in fanfics?

Or just because Harry and Draco didn't instantly fall desperately in love with each other at first look in canon they can't do so in fanfics?

Why do you have a growing dislike towards AU and more original stories?

*** Alright, I understand you being frustrated about something being criticized that you like, I get it, k? I didnt say I dislike au's, in fact, I quite enjoy soulmate au's from time to time. I also like original story's, I think they can be very creative and, as the claimed title, original. I'm ranting about the romatization of 11 year olds falling in love at first sight in the canon verse. This include grossly exaggerated flirting before they get sorted in the great hall. If this was a soul mate au and they toned down the flirting then absolutely, they can fall in love or crush very heavily while they are 11, tho most soulmate au's dont have that happen.

Your assumption that I'm using the idea of Cho and Harry as a baseline for how romance should happen in the potter universe is also incorrect. I'm using that to show about the time that more serious relationships begin to form. Let's be honest, at 11 did you think about heavily making out with a person? As most people have commented, no, they had innocent crushes or very light relationships ie: holding hands and 'kissing'. As I read the rest of the chapter of the fanfiction that started this post, it became very obvious that this was not a innocent crush and slowly started to look like Harry was... for lack of a better term, 'lusting' after Draco. He repeatedly invaded Draco's space and made 4 innuendos followed by winking at Draco in an attempt to, and I quote, 'see him blush'

Not innocent, leave the 11 year olds alone, I have since stopped reading the fanfiction.

Tl:dr: some stuff that was assumed was wrong, 11 year olds should be left alone because no, haven't even become teens yet

I will concede that some fanfic authors go overboard in their stories and portray a romantic side that is a few years too old for the kids.

** When I was 11 I definitely was thinking about boys, and boys definitely took notice I wasn't as flat as I used to be. I definitely was precocious. For that matter, I was definitely french kissing and heavily petting by the time I was 12.

But if you grew up with Harry Potter like I did, you are probably around your thirties by now. Why do you even bother reading the fics that follow an 11 year olds point of view? There are plenty of fics where Harry & friends are adults and worry about adult stuff. Have you tried reading those?
