** My guess? You didn't specify no minors and even said "Really fucked up stuff is ok too." That I feel can include minors. And in the post's comments fics which include the sexualization of minors were posted.

Deleted post for those who don't wish to recover it: "No dramione or snamione. Slash, slavery, all of that is fine. Really fucked up stuff is ok too."
