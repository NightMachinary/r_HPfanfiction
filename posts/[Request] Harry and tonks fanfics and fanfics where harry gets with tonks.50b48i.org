looking for Harry and tonks fanfics and fanfics where harry gets with tonks


** linkffn(6740130) (anything by that author really)

linkffn(11364705) One of my favorite's for unique ideas and talents

linkffn(10516162) This one is Metamorph!Harry running away to the US

linkffn(8175132) my all time favorite time/dimension travel fic (also fem!Harry)

linkffn(8295633) Tonks is slightly younger than in canon. Liked it in the beginning, not a big fan of the ending but still worth reading.

linkffn(2008185) This is young!Tonks and pretty much canon rehash with different Trio. I never finished the series but i've been told that it branches out from canon after book 4.

There are quite a few others but these are the one's i've read myself and (mostly) liked.

Edit: Almost forgot, there's quite a bit of Harry/Tonks in 'The Merging' which is a great fic even if they don't end up together (which they won't). Tonks' path in that story takes a bit of a darker turn in the latest chapters but she does play a pretty big role and it's definitely worth reading.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  "That date was the reason I was shocked to death when I saw that troll. Of course my hero Harry then came to save me and defeat the big bad troll." Tonks ended dramatically, placing a sloppy kiss on Harry's red cheek. He would die before he admitted this to her, but when she said that, he felt rather proud of himself.

  When Tonks & Harry meet, they quickly become friends. When tragedy brings them together again, it develops into more. Age, school, & war are only some of the obstacles in their way. Mix of canon & A/U. Rating mostly for language.

But then he discovers an ability that he needs help with and only one person can provide that-Tonks. They bring the fight to the DEs in their own way so that the war will finally end.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

#+begin_quote
  In the summer prior to fifth year, Andromeda Tonks finds out her daughter Nymphadora has set her sights on Remus Lupin. She's not happy with this, and tricks Tonks into going for Harry Potter instead. What starts out as a way to "get back" at her parents, turns into an uncommon romance... Canon until the start of Book 5 'Order of the Phoenix', mild lemons. NOT ABANDONED
