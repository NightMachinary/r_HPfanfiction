I've heard this is an amazing FF covering the time between the last chapter of Deathly Hallows and the Epilogue, based on everything available such as Pottermore, things JKR has said or tweeted, etc.

The only problem is that it's in French, and I don't speak a word of it. I tried to do it using [[https://www.deepl.com/translator][DeepL]]. I fed the entire manuscript (over 500 pages) through it, and it produced a decent result, at least as a starting point. I've spent many days making corrections, additions, rephrasings, including english idioms, edits, Potter specific translations using the Fandom wiki (looking for the french page then switching to english), but i'm not sure it's worthwhile, because I've found my progress has been quite slow, and the writing still doesn't seem like it was written by an english speaker, and I think it would take me several weeks to complete.

Anyway, *what I should have just done was asked if one exists*, but I figured it would have been linked by the author somewhere if it did. Anyway, couldn't hurt to ask.

Otherwise, I guess it's just a fun project I can keep doing in the background. Though I can't help but feel it's kind of stupid for someone like me to do it, who doesn't actually speak french...


** Read through your post and thought about translating it.

*** Yeah, that's one reason I really want to read it. It'd be like an 8th book if it lives up to the reviews. Have you read it?

** I don't think it exists, never seen it anyway. I have fond memories of it and its sequels, it's one of the fics that got me into fanfiction, first in French and now in English :)

** It's a great series. Amongst the first I read (not the first though) before going to english. I don't think there is any existing translation.

If you need help of something I would be happy to. I don't have the time to do it in full alone but I could help a bit.
