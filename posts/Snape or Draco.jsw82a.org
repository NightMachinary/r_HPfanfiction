So I see alot of fics where one or both of these two are made more sympathetic and/or good than they were in canon. Many even prefer fanon versions of these characters to canon ( and to be fair people prefer many fanon things to canon not just Snape and Draco but these two I see alot).

So which fanonized character do you prefer Snape or Draco?

Do you prefer if someone finds a way to make a more sympathetic Snape story? Or a more sympathetic Draco story? Or is it about the same ?

And what is the appealing part for the one you prefer?

If you like neither and like more sympathetic narratives with neither then who would you pick between the two if you had to?

edit: I just realized there might be a few variations to more sympathetic or good versions of both characters so like please specify which version/depiction you prefer.


** I think draco is far more sympathetic because at the end of the day

he is just a kid who was raised in a toxic enviroment and as soon as things got real he couldnt handle it.

snape was a grown man who joined the wizard nazi's and only left because a girl he liked was in danger

** I never saw how anyone could see canon Draco or Snape as sympathetic. I have read a few fics where fanon Draco or Snape could be. Since I'm not a fan of canon Snape and canon Draco I don't have many fics where either play that major of a character or are redeemed. But there have been a few.

If they are well written there are ways to redeem both though in some cases time travel is needed. In the story The Real Us by Seel'vor everything you thought you knew concerning canon events and Snape was wrong and Snape is one of the good guys.

Linkffn(4605681)

In the Time Travel Fic Reboot by Kassien Snape, Harry and Hermione go back in time where Snape makes much better choices in his life this time around.

Linkffn(9552519)

In the story Better Be Ravenclaw by Ares.Granger Draco is confronted with logic and later removed from his Dad's influence. Getting introduced to normal kid stuff and affection instead of Pure blood supremacy, having to think things through himself, and having his father gone changes Draco.

Linkffn(9873249)

So if I had to choose I would say Draco would be easier to change to be sympathetic. The simple reason is he's an 11 year old boy and has not really done anything evil when we first meet him so there are many ways he could be changed.

Snape would be much harder as he has spent many more years being evil and has done true evil by the time we first meet him.

*** Thanks for the recs!

I don't think many find canon Draco sympathetic or likable ( canon Snape tho I know many do partly cuz of the movies partly cuz of the bullying).

But I think people like entertaining both as a what if things had been different. And since HP fandom is pretty different people might like playing with what if set up and very different alternatives more than they used to and care less bout canon based than before.

For me personally it easy to just be like this is fanon diff story easy to separate from canon and like as its own thing . And so it's more the kinds of fics I come across that kinda influence me. So I've come across more good Snape fics that have the things I dislike than good Draco fics. So I personally dislike good Snape fics more even though I do usually like Snape in those fics so kinda a bummer.

**** One reason you might find more good Snape fics than good Draco is more people liked Alan Rickman than Tom Feldman. So they are more inclined to develop fics for Snape. Plus Harry already has one adult nemesis in Tom so if you want him to have a nemesis his own age Draco is the #1 choice leaving room to make Snape nicer.

***** I've come across alot for both but I come across alot more good Snape fics that make it so the Marauders are 1 dimensional generic bully characters or like a Lilly should have ended up with Snape ( or does) not James who more a dumb jock archetype.

And im kinda really tired of that plot line and disliked the dumb jock generic bully archetype to begin with. Especially hate it more when it kinda takes away from the alternative which had more nuance i think.

While Draco I come across more where he either good from the start or has to redeem himself since he didn't in any way really in canon and may hold him responsible for being awful pre redemption. And I more ok with those types of stories. And kinda does the opposite than canon where Draco more generic imo.

I do see the all Griffindors generic assholes or straight up evil stories while Slytherin are smart and charismatic and I dislike those just as much. And I do see that for good Draco stories.

But I see them for good Snape stories too and I see that more as a effect of good Slytherin bad Griffindor fics or light evil dark good fics. So the good Snape and Good Draco kinda caused by that but id consider it like a separate category.

** So I have a slight issue with this because I think canon Draco is already sympathetic, given how he goes from a bully in the first book to a crying mess in the bathroom in the sixth book because he was sent on what is essentially a suicide mission (a 16 year old who isn't even that good at dueling killing one of the greatest wizards of all time). Damned if he does it because he likely won't survive, damned if he doesn't because he and his family will die. That's why his mission was a punishment for Lucius' failures. He was a kid raised by toxic people who couldn't live that way.

Since he already has a sympathetic base in my mind, I love a redemption arc for Draco in fanfic. Without him actively shunning blood purity/treating people better, I can't get on board with him as a good guy. Though in well written fics, he will never be a good guy in the way Harry or Ron are. I like when he is still flawed, but trying to be better. It feels more real. That said, I have read some good fics where he is slimy and very morally gray and I really enjoy that too.

Snape is a hard no for me. I don't find him redeemable because if Lily wasn't murdered, he would still be a Death Eater. It just doesn't work for me.

I mean, he can cry sometimes and have moods, or help others occasionally, but if he is super kind all the time, ugh.

Draco on the other hand, I hate in canon. for him I would prefer he is made a bit more pitifully, where he just needs a hug. I do like him in fics where he is lovable and nice. I really liked him in AVPM.

** I haven't read any Snape fics (though might have a look at these recs) i do like, read and have written redeemed Draco however.

Draco was sixteen and obviously terrified by what he'd got himself into. If he'd died in canon we'd probably have ended up viewing him like Regulus. I think there is a lot of interesting content to be generated from his change in perspective.

That said it can be done really, really badly. I ended up writing my own after reading one too many Dramione fics where Draco basically says 'sorry about that, newly hot girl' and Hermione swoons for him.

** I prefer redeemed Snape, but I think both can redeem themselves with work. The main reason I prefer redeemed Snape is likely a result of me reading a series of Marauder-era fics where he makes less crappy choices and turns his life around, which in turn eventually made me look more at canon-era/postwar Snape fics. There's also the fact that while Snape was an awful teacher and awful to kids, at least he was consistently on the good side after the Potters died. Draco meanwhile just seems to have taken an opportunity when he saw it. I always concluded that Draco had plenty to go for redemption, while Snape already was. Just force him to stay away from kids.

I will say however that I generally prefer the personality of movie Snape, who is consistently shown to at least be repenting, while book Snape goes too far a lot of the time with kids.

Or redeemed by loving Lilly which is a trope I really dislike. So that made me dislike good Snape fics.

While good Draco fics I've had better luck with.

If it was the other way around and I found better good Snape fics then I'd probably feel differently 😆

*** I actually like reading good snape fics even though they are not too common. I absolutely hate good draco though. Once in a while I come across one I don't mind, but for the most part I hate good draco.

The canon rewrite I'm doing actually has good snape as Harry's mentor (yeah he gets sorted into slytherin haha) but that's because in my rewrite snape fully abandoned the death eaters and voldy rather than played spy. I had snape help sirius whisk harry away from potter cottage after voldemorts attack so sirius could raise him away from the dursleys since dumbledore intended to ignore the potters wishes for harry to be raised by sirius in the event of their death.

This dumbledore isn't a bad manipulative dumbledore, he's still good dumbledore, I'm just focusing more on his canon superiority complex where he always thinks his greater good is best and that he knows better than everyone else.

***** That part hasn't been explained in book yet, but it will be. The gist is, snape wasn't the one to hear the prophesy told to dumbledore by trewalny. Instead, he was in attendance when another death eater began to relay the prophesy to voldy (at this time he was already playing spy). Before the death eater relayed the full prophesy, snape took his head with a sectumsempra and apparated away to tell the potters and dumbledore while at the same time fully abandoning the death eaters all together since his cover was now blown.

The back story of this is lily eventually learned to look past his mudblood comment snape made when they were at school, and before their deaths lily was the one to convince him to turn spy, and he became a sort of friend to the potters before their death. Knowing dumbledore wanted harry to go to the dursleys inspite of sirius being the godfather, since he was still in the headmasters confidences with the knowledge he was able to provide of death eater operations, lily him and sirius set up their own ward on the cottage that dumbledore didn't know about, which alerted snape to voldemorts attack before dumbledore was aware. He used this preemptive knowledge to floo sirius after the attack to get him to take harry before hagrid could show up to take him from the cottage.

************* The way I have it described in my notes for this fic, lilly approached severus at spinners end about a year after school at the request of dumbledore. He needed a spy in voldemorts organization. She called on him at home and set to talking to him about how he was wrong in those views, mainly in pointing out how he had been best friends with a muggleborn for many years, if they were so bad how could she have ever been his best friend. Since he had always loved her, even though she didn't know that, he couldn't really refute her points. That's how she convinced him to turn and spy on voldemort for the order. She didn't clear away all her biases. What she did was curb them enough that it became less of bigotry and more of a difference of opinion in terms of weight.

Severus won't be a muggle lover in this book, and he will still be an asshole towards anyone that isn't slytherin in my rewrite, but it will come more from him just being an asshole rather than a bigoted asshole.

Sure he is still an asshole and lead to Harry being orphaned but at least he attempts to change. Draco however is depicted as Spoiled and evil and books dont give us a solid evidence of him changing.

Draco is a bigoted kid who never grows up and learns his beliefs were wrong. He not killing Dumbledore or not ratting out Harry when he is in Malfoy mannor is cowardice. There is nothing that suggests Draco reforms after the war.

Snape did not start as a bigot as we see his childhood friendship with Lily. He falls victim to peer pressure and decides to join Voldemort after their fallout in wich admitedly he has more fault but being an asshole does not make you evil. He does call her a mudblood because chances are if he does not, his housemates will make him pay for it. He defects to Dumbledores side and fucking dies while fighting against Voldemort.

imagine if you where black and someone you where friends with killed you a filthy nigger and not only that they have been calling every other black person apart from you that for a while.

that is what snape did, and then when he finished school who joined up with the person whose mission statement is killing everyone just like his friend

********* This is where you seem to not understand. Snape did not join out of his belief in blood superiority. He joined because as a Slytherin he has no other choice. It is called peer pressure. Lily probably does not understand it considering they are in different houses. She most likely thought Snape was doing all these things on his own volition while in reality he was most likely coerced or even forced to act in such a manner.

************* He does not look down on Petunia for being a muggle. When he informs Lily that she is a witch, Petunia insults him for his clothes and later when he catches her spying on him and Lily, she insults him again when she is in the wrong. He does dismiss her as a muggle but that is not a junior Death Eater characteristic considering majority of the magical peoples dismiss muggles as unimportant including some definetly not evil characters.

He did not leave school as a death eater. He was a Death Eater for 18 months according to cannon(12 of which as a spy, meaning he was only unrependant for 6 months.) and that ended when he was 21 years old when Voldemort was defeated by a baby Harry, meaning he joined when he was 19 years old, a year and a half after graduating. Only evidence we have of him wanting to join Death Eaters is Lily accusing him of it however this is not confirmed or denied in the books. His silence in the face of the accusation can be interpreted as him accepting it but it is also possible he was simply staying quiet hoping she would calm down and not wanting to make her angrier. Besides even if he had denied it she wouldn't believe him considering books state Lily has an explosive temper. It's more likely he was approached sometime after he turned 19 and we all know it was join or die.

Also Alan Rickman does not get me excited considering i have not watched any of the movies.

** I can handle fanon Draco if he actually undergoes a redemption arc. The story starts with him as a little kid, so I think it is believable that he changes as he grows up.

Snape, on the other hand, is irredeemable. No matter how he is written, he is still the guy who put a hit on a toddler and a good man because desired a woman that didn't him. He is the poster boy of incels everywhere.

*** Ya I mean I'm all for fanon rewriting Snape because I dont really like him canon especially considering the framing he got. But alot of the stuff I come across for fanon Snape is why Snape>James or why Lilly should have been with Snape and that makes me dislike fanon Snape stories even if I like characterization of fanon Snape in those stories.

*** He didn't put a hit on anyone.\\
He relayed an overheard prophecy, it wasn't until after telling Voldemort that he actually realised what it meant or who would be targeted.\\
He was already falling in with the death eaters when he was still friends with Lily, it's not some incel reaction to not getting her, though I guess he probably wouldn't have joined up if she had chosen him, a muggleborn girlfriend would not go over well with them.

*** oh sorry I worded that wrong I meant who would you pick between the two if you had to my bad 😅

and ya Bella definitely more uncommon i feel like it harder to do because you see her more unhinged and never see her have any doubts or like turn traitor. I swear I've seen more good Lucius than good Bellatrix. Personally I kinda love unhinged villains so I usually like keeping her a villain but her on say Harry's side but being equally unhinged and morally ambigous would be entertaining.

but Draco and Snape i feel people have stronger feelings towards seeing them in a more sympathetic light. And in my experience I feel like I see more who prefer one to the other rather than like both in fanon so I wanted to see why they preferred one ( thats just my experience tho there are probably loads who like sympathetic narratives with both equally).

** I feel like a redeemed Snape wouldn't be too hard, all he really needs to do is go from bullying children to merely being a miserable and strict teacher, that could conceivably happen with as small a change as Dumbledore deciding that the whole keeping up appearences excusde doesn't make sense if Snape is meant to be pulling the wool over his eyes.

Fact is that while Canon Snape never quite redeems himself, he was at least on the right track, he's solidly on the right side, he just needs to stop being so petty.

** I'd go with Snape because he's more of a good man ruined by his own choices than Draco, who is just a cowardly bI got who really isn't very bright.

Snape is an appalling human being who bullies children but he has courage, brains and he keeps his word.

Personally, I prefer if I had my druthers I'd rather not have either of them excused. I stay well away from any suggestion of romance with either.

”Oh Draco, you're a coward a bigot and a bully. You're also as thick as two short planks and tried to murder me and my friends - now get 'em off!”

”Oh Severus, you're literally old enough to be my father, had a creepy obsession with my mother and then betrayed her to wizard Hitler. Give us a kiss!”

** In my opinion, Snape and Draco appear as shitty people because we view them through Harry's eyes. I honestly do think that Draco is a spoiled brat who only realizes what basic decency is when his family is in danger. However, I kind of always felt sympathetic for Snape because, despite all his faults, I always felt he was so alone carrying the burden of his choices. Hated by both sides and yet still fighting for what he thought was right. He also majorly fucked up with Lily but then spent an entire life atoning for that mistake.

**** And how is it relevant? How is trying to excuse a pureblood racist different from a Nazi racist? Yes, I know, I went straight to the Godwin's Law, but the parallel between Voldemortism and Nazism is too obvious to ignore (and I am certainly not saying that /you/ are a Nazi), and the drooling over Draco/Snape really makes me sick.

****** I don't care about Draco and Snape changing (although [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/how-redeemable-is-canon-draco-malfoy.html][persuasive redemption stories]] are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/e7hp1z/how_redeemable_is_canon_draco_malfoy/fa3isp1/][quite rare as well]]), but I do care when Draco tells to some distraught victim of Voldemort's terror how terrible was life living in the Malfoy Manor with Voldemort in the next room. Yes, Klaus Heydrich, it was unpleasant to listen to your father planning destruction of Jewry in Europe, but no, you still grew up on the wrong side of the conflict and you are not on the same level as great-grandparents of my children who lost both their families in Auschwitz. And yes, I know, the one of the Nazi leaders' son was the Roman-Catholic priest who honestly asked for forgiveness, so of course, I believe a redemption is possible.
