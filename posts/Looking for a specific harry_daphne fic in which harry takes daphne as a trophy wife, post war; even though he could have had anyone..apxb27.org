*** Ah, nope, not that one. In the fic I'm looking for harry is the one that set up the marriage, so he definitely wanted it. Daphne was a bit miffed as you could imagine, but there was nothing she could do about it, given who postwar harry was to the world.

**** That's literally the same plot as the one I mentioned. You've gotta give more details then that, can you remember any side plots? Most of the Harry/Daphne fics follow that theme.

***** Hmm. In Contractual Invalidation, if I remember correctly, harry finds out about a contract between himself and daphne from daphne, that needs both their agreement to dispell. Harry desided that he's single and he wants to give the relationship an attempt dispite daphnes want to do away with it, and forces her into a few dates, some wizarding and some muggle.

I don't remember how it ends, but Harry didn't make the contract, his parents did. In the fic I'm looking for (I believe) harry bails the Greengrass' out of some financial troubles in exchange for daphnes hand in marriage, and daphne doesn't get a say at all. It's a partial smut fic, and it's relatively short, but it had a good story in my opinion.

I don't remember much else, it's been a year (give or take) since I read it. And I couldn't find it again.

*** Not really. Sorry for the vagueness, I feel like I read a fic on this premose in the past, but I can't really narrow it down. Daphne was ‘not' happy about being made a trophy, but harry wanted her, perhaps? It was in a post war future where harry got everything he wanted ‘cus he won the war, I don't remember any real details tho.

**** It's one of those stories that occasionally makes the rounds on FFN when someone plagiarizes it. The actual author should just post it to their own FFN account once and for all rather than just have it on an obscure part of DLP under an alt account.
