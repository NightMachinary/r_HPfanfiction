Yes it's the wizarding world, but it's also the 20th century. Muggles tools and tricks might be mostly looked down upon but not by one long-bearded headmaster... Together with Arthur Weasley and Madam Hooch he decided to establish sports at hogwarts, also featuring self defense and yoga, which he found himself to enjoy. Alternatively the DA also could have decided that they might get some use out of training physical combat. So for example in the department of mysteries: Lucius: It's over weâ€˜ve captured- Holy oh my, did that weasly boy just kick rookwood in the balls?

Or in deathly hallows: Bellatrix: /holding knife to Hermiones throat/ Drop your wands! Hermione: /grabs wrist, slams head backwards, kicks leg, wiggles out of grip/ Bellatrix:... Narcissa:... Draco:... Dobby: Still need that chandelier?

To sum it up:

Voldemort: My loyal death eaters, I am devastated to inform you that the order has acquired the most gruesome weapon, it's called...kick balls.


** Interesting prompt, though I am curious - do 'self-defence' and 'yoga' really count as 'sports'?

*** I think they are. Martial arts is basically self defence which is a sport. And apparently Yoga is also a sport. There is this thing called competitive Yoga. No I have no idea how that is even supposed to work

**** Fair. I'll give you the martial arts one, at least. Competitive Yoga is too ridiculous for words though. I half imagine it with a Harry Hill style gladiatorial announcer:

"In one corner, we have Downward Dog! And in the other, we have the Lotus! But which is better? There's only one way to find out! Let's get ready to Ommmm!"

***** Lol but yeah. Apparently competitive Yoga is pretty controversial though so there is that

****** Indeed. At least there's that. :)

My only real note on this is that I don't think it would really make much difference. The people who fought already were decent at fighting, and equipping the people who didn't probably wouldn't make them any more likely to do so. Canonically, most of the Ministry can't even cast a shield charm (hence why the Hats sold by the Weasleys were so successful) or a Patronus (which the DA learned pretty easily, implying that the other Wizards just never bothered to put that level of effort in) so I highly doubt the vaguely indolent Wizards would put all that much effort into learning martial arts either.

** I agree that more physical elements would make magical duel more realistic and interesting. You can make it even easier to introduce. There is almost certainly someone in the Order who knew physical self-defence techniques, and it was taught to the children during the holidays to keep them busy and tire them out as much as anything else. I would be careful though of making it a 'wonder power' that solves all problems. Given the usefulness of dodging spells, werewolves and possibly other 'dark creatures' needing to get close and Godric Gryffindor being famous for wielding a sword that those trained to fight, i.e. Aurors and elite Death Eaters, are used to these tactics. Given the fact that Harry and co. even by book 7 are not fully physically developed, it adds a new dimension to the fighting without being a superpower. Unless they take their opponent completely by surprise, so in your examples possibly if they are not expecting resistance, or they are utterly incompetent like the snatchers.

** I recommend Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li. It focuses on fighting techniques. Good read!

** The Golden Trio definitely learn physical self defence (and computer hacking, and a bunch of other skills) in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822-1/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. Instead of a magic school, "Harworts" is training the next generation of MI-6 agents, who are noticeably smarter and sneakier than canon as a result. But "Lord Deathstrike" has gotten his hands on a cache of unusual technology, and is working to take over the Ministry; they're going to have to track down all of his memory backups before he'll be gone for good.

It's a complete rewrite of canon with magic being neatly replaced by Bond-style technology, set in a larger multiversal crossover (but this one's a prequel, so it works fine as a stand-alone story).
