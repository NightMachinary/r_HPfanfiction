** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9097983/1/Without-Thorn-the-Rose][Without Thorn the Rose]] by Threadbare Threnody. This is a pretty dark story. Complete, with a WIP sequel.

#+begin_quote
  Lily died, and left James to raise a stranger's son alone. In the shadows of Azkaban, Harry learns from Dementors and Death Eaters, while in the caverns of the sea a mysterious power awaits the chance to steal his soul. Warnings inside.

** Well, slytherin-nettes [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8519173/1/Harriet-Potter-and-the-Minister-of-Magic][Harriet Potter and the Minister of Magic]] fits the bill if you're not opposed to fem!harry (or HP/DM). I like it personally. I assumed that only James out of James and Lily surviving was what you were going for, if you're looking for Harry being dead as well then disregard this one.

** Welllllllll this is certainly an interesting take on it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder]]

Longish one-shot. James and little Harry survive. The mauraders seek vengeance.
