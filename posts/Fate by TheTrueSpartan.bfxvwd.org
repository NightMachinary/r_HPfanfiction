I truly believe that this story could be THE Ron-centric story, sort of like The Arithmancer is for Hermione. It definitely takes some inspiration from The Red Knight and Choices, which the author does state. Based on that, it is a Slytherin Ron story and he does have some sort of Sight. But as the story continues, it does a nice job of creating its own identity.

*Pros:*

Ron is a strong and capable protagonist without being overpowered.

None of the characters feel like caricatures. They all have their own motivations and seem fleshed out.

His posting schedule is likely the best I've ever seen. Early on, Spartan was posting 10k+ word chapters DAILY. Since going back to school, he posts every Sunday and Wednesday consistently.

None of the characters are perfect, not even Ron. There are disputes between characters where neither is the 'bad guy'. Both have their points and the story does a good job of representing that.

ADULTS ARE ACTUALLY USEFUL. I didn't realize how rare this was until I read this.

Slytherin dynamics are unique without getting to absurd about it. There are no child politicians, but they're certainly not like canon Gryffindors are.

*Cons:*

Ron isn't perfect like I stated, but characters seem to pat him on the back a little more frequently than my liking.

Spartan has a lot of different subplots playing out at once. Most times it all runs well, but there are times were you straight up forget one of them because you haven't read about it in several chapters.

It. is. LONG. There are over 700k+ words and third year hasn't started yet.

â€‹

All in all, I would recommend this fic to anyone who doesn't hate Ron. If you're indifferent about him, you still might like it
