I read this fic a little while ago and can't find it again. James and Lily had dated at Hogwarts, but broke up after graduation. Lily knows about the Order, but James doesn't and she gets partnered with his dad. If anyone can help me find it I'd really appreciate it!


** Shit I've read this too. It's /probably/ on my favorites list (FFN username magicalmalady), I'll look through tomorrow night if nobody else has identified it by then :)

*** THANK YOU!! I found it in your favorites list and it's called "Chasing Fire". When I was looking for it I assumed it was rated M and filtered it that way, but it's actually T.

  It's recounted as a great love story. Fierce hatred turned to passionate love. But the path to great love is hardly smooth. When a marriage proposal fails and the world is on the brink of war, how can love shine through? COMPLETE

**** I'm so glad you were able to find it! I started using my favorites list as more of an archive of things I liked, would recommend, or might just reread in the future, so it comes in handy sometimes!
