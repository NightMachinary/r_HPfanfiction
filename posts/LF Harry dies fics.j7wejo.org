Maybe morbid but I'm looking for fics in which Harry dies, can be pre-hogwarts, in any of his hogwarts years or at the final battle. Fic should still be about Harry, how people deal with his death and the tragedy of it, maybe also in terms of the prophecy or how wizards experience death. Ghost!Harry is also great, Harry as a portrait or things like that are also fine.

I'm not really interested in any pairings and I'm not really looking for a pairing-centric fic, it should still be about Harry

  ...Signifies a new beginning. Harry dies in the Final Battle. Dudley attends his cousin's funeral, quickly discovering that there was much more to Harry's life than he ever dreamed. Can regret give way to a fresh start? Canon, aside from Harry's death.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]: At least the Harry as we know it is not alive, because this dude thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, and has the power of Voldemort. But he's fine pretending to be Harry Potter.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9541467/1/The-Heir-Of][The Heir of]]: Harry is killed in the Graveyard, and the Horcrux wakes up. He and Voldemort Prime agree to work together, for now.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]]: The Hallows are dangerous.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]]: He tries to kill Tom Riddle at Hogwarts.

  They never thought he would live after they killed him. They never thought ghosts were real, but Harry has never let that stop him from haunting them. Please Review! Warning: Abused!Harry Beware of unhappy ending.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4086213]] - {Lost Hope} includes ghost Harry and has a sequel too {Black Hope}. Green Harry, he is called (at least during the sequel).

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3503388]] - {Birth of a Phoenix} might fit. Without spoiling it, I won't say if he actually dies or not by the end of the fanfic, but it does deal with how people are dealing with it as Harry progressively gets weaker and weaker. If you truly want to know whether he dies or not, I'll message you, but it would be a massive spoiler.
