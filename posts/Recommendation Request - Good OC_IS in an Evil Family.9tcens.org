I like reading fanfiction about Harry Potter. One of my favorite types is the "Self Insert", especially the "Reincarnated/Transferred from Out World" since I like seeing how they work with the foreknowledge of the books.

However, it is very rare for these characters to be put into the story from the "Evil Side". The only one I ever really found was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][In Bad Faith]] by Slayer Anderson (it's about someone who ends up reincarnated as Draco Malfoy's younger sister). I quite enjoyed it but the author has dropped it a "year" or so before she went to Hogwarts. I was really interested in the concept though; /if you end up as the child of a Death Eater, what would you do?/ It's so much easier to "decide to help Harry" if you're not born into a family that expects you to work for Voldemort.

*Now, I was wondering if anyone here knows any other fanfics (preferably long and completed, but I won't be picky) of similar nature. Please link to any such fanfics if you can. Thank you very much!*


** Have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847/chapters/18163144][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt? It isn't a self-insert... exactly, but I think it's kind of close enough. Hermione reincarnates as a Rosier. There isn't a ton of /family/ stuff, but she's pretty well forced into dealing with all the Death Eaters and such, so I'd say it counts as "Evil Side". It's also completed (185k words). I personally wasn't super fond of the ending tbh, but I still really enjoyed it overall.

*** To me it's left unfinished. Not an ending.

**** Yeah, I agree. I think in the comments Seselt said that they intentionally left it a bit up in the air but I don't think I'd even give it that. If I didn't know it was the last chapter I'd assume it was unfinished. But they said they were considering a sequel a few times so... we shall see.

** Linkffn(Scourgify) (might not link the right one) is about someone who reincarnate into the body of Crabbe's younger sister. Very nice while it lasts, but they never get to hogwarts I think, and it's been abandoned.

Such a shame that the Isekai genre and HP fanfic era didn't coincide more, just a few years apart but we've got hardly any good SI or reincarnation fics.

Edit: linked the right novel, dive in neighbournino

  The words be careful what you wish for had never rung truer. "Wait... what did she just call my father? Oh, oh god no, anyone but them! Please god no! I'd rather scourgify my own blood then have them for a family! I would take the Malfoys- no, even Voldemort over them! Anyone but...!" SI-OC. Pairings undecided. Not an SI you've read before, according to reviewers.

*** transmigration novels have been a thing for decades.. even Japanese fiction (which doesn't matter here but it seems to be where u are drawing your conclusion from) had examples of it for decades, so I don't really get why you think it is only a thing now.

**** Ohh yeah, it's existed for ages, but in the past 6-7 years it suddenly had a surge of popularity in the LN scene, which is being reflected in the anime scene too now, since a couple years back with SAO (which is a transmig with a game instead of a world, let's be honest)
