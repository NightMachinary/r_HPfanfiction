So I just had one of those ideas that pops into your head at midnight and never goes away. It could be incredible... or incredibly dumb. Honestly I just had to write about it so I could get it out of my brain!

Metamorphmagus Harry (Stick with me please). But because of the Dursleys being, well, the Dursleys, Harry has to learn to control the changes very early on. (Like how it's easier to teach a kid a new language than an adult type situation. He's not super-harry). Nobody but the Dursleys, Parent Potters and Sirius know about Harry's gift. When he gets to Hogwarts he gets sorted into Slytherin because the hat thought Harry's mastery, and subsequent secrecy, of his gift was quite clever and cunning. HP befriends some of the slytherins and they basically take him under their wing and teach him all about the wizarding world.

Fastforward to Harry using his Slytherin cunning and secret metamorph gift to spy on dumbledore/voldemort/teachers/ministry/whoever is needed. Harry's gift plays a major role in the defeat of Voldemort. It's all very sneaky and underhanded.

Thank you for indulging in my ramblings. I hope my plot-bunny inspired someone. I would totally write this if I had any patience at all for writing more than an hour a month.


** "Fastforward to Harry using his Slytherin cunning and secret metamorph gift."

*** I don't see any need to give Harry the metamorph ability. Optimizing Tonks' use is more than enough.

  A "tragic" accident leaves young Harry in the care of a relative that nobody knew existed. It seems Lily Evans had an Uncle named Edmund Bond who had a son he called James.
