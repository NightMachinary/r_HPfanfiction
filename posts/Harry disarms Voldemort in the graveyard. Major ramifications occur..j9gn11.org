Some possible results in order of likelihood;

1. The Ministry has proof that the Dark Lord is still around. Fudge still buries his head in the sand, but Madam Bones works around him to prepare. The Daily Prophet slander campaign against Harry goes ahead, but people are more divided on its accuracy.

2. Harry has a wand that is registered to an adult wizard, thus bypassing the Trace.

3. The Ministry tries to frame Harry for Cedric's murder, since he has the murder weapon in hand.


** I don't know why, but I imagined Harry bringing back Voldemort's severed arm along with the wand.

*** Harry dove behind a tombstone, dodging another killing curse as he went. "This is not a game of hide-and-seek, Harry! Be a dear and die, won't you?" Voldemort called out impishly. Harry thought furiously as his nemesis continued to taunt him. His schoolboy spells were having no effect against the experienced creature. He needed to step it up a notch, and start using spells he wouldn't normally be caught dead using; several came to mind, Dark curses he'd read about during his preparation for the Tri-Wizard Tournament that had led him to this trap.

Harry breathed deeply, waiting for an opportunity, trying to decide which dark curse he'd try; he knew he'd only get one shot at this. Voldemort, tiring of taunting him, stalked forward, intent on flushing the boy from hiding. He kept his wand at the ready; he would not underestimate his young opponent again. He strode closer to the grave; his outstretched arm proceeded him beyond it...

"Sectumsempra!" Harry screamed, catching both of them by surprise; Harry by the darkness of the spell his subconscious had chosen, and Voldemort by the shout. As if in slow motion, both wizards tracked the curse towards its target. The Dark Lord tried to pull his arm back, but it was too late. With a flash of spellfire and a sickening spurt of blood, the limb was severed cleanly just below the elbow. It flopped uselessly to the ground as they watched in horror.

Harry recovered from the shock first, as Voldemort was staring at his stump. With a Petrification Hex and an Incarcerous, The Greatest Dark Lord in British History was bound, bleeding, and helpless at a injured teenager's feet. His followers could only stare on in horror and shock (and not a little fear) as their newly reborn master laid prostrate. Harry, struck by a sudden impulse, seized the severed limb and began to run. The Death Eaters broke out of their shock and began firing hexes and curses as he sprinted for the Cup and Cedric's body.

Pausing only to duck a nasty-looking purple curse from Lucius Malfoy, Harry tucked Voldemort's arm under his own, grabbed Cedric, and pointed his wand at the Cup. "Accio!" Harry cried, grasping the object as it flew towards him. With a flash of light, he was gone.

**** Not bad, but I have a couple of thoughts about that.

1. How did Harry learn Sectumsempra? To my knowledge, the only book with that spell in it is located in the Potions Classroom, in the form of Severus Snape's old NEWT Potions textbook.

2. He should've taken the arm off at the shoulder, because it's funnier, and more of a pain to deal with attaching a replacement.

***** 1. A book in the Restricted Section (thank you, Cloak of Invisibility). Snape claims to have invented it, but he also claims to be a loyal Death Eater when he's anything but. I'm just saying, dude's credibility is shoddy as hell when it comes to stuff like that.

2. He was aiming for whatever he had a clean target for; in this case, he had a clean shot at the arm below the elbow. Don't really see how it would be funnier to take the whole thing.

**** Plot-hole, simple as that. Harry also cast spells that night in the graveyard, but it couldn't be put on Harry's record because the Trace doesn't record who did magic, only that it was performed around an underage witch or wizard. Also, the Riddle's estate has been Voldemort's hideout for a year, now. It's reasonable to assume he or Pettigrew or Crouch Jr protected it in some way so they would be undetected (certainly after the Frank Bryce incident).

*** It is keyed to wands. That's how they know when magic goes around underage wizards. The trace in a wand does not track only the magic on the wand, but all surrounding magic (hence dobby).

Having Voldemort's wand would still be useless for that as Harry's wand would detect magic from Voldemort's wand nearby

** 1. Harry's reputation is even more inflated, but its actually deserved because probably not even Dumbledore could have disarmed the Dark Lord at 14 in a fair fight.

2. Voldemort's aura of invincibility is seriously dented.

Of course this assumes Harry gets out of the graveyard without being hit by every single Death Eater there.

Granted, Riddle is probably dumb enough to order them not to kill Harry because he wants to best him personally, but he probably will order them to prevent Harry from escaping. Harry's good at dodging, but /that/ good?

I don't know, maybe all the Death Eaters are too shocked by what happened to act for the few seconds it takes Harry to reach the Portkey.

Still, the graveyard is probably one of the better places to try to dodge multiple wizards trying to curse you. Its dark, and there's lots of cover, and he only has to evade for a few seconds.
