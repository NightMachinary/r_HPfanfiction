So, in the wide world of HP fan fics, characterizations range from "Holy Mage Blessed By Merlin Himself" to "Will Set The World On Fire If Its For The Greater Good". And authors will usually stick to one version and run with it for the length of the story. That is, Harry will quickly figure out that Dumbledore is responsible for the shit-show that is his childhood and will accept that he is just a man and is capable of making mistakes just like anyone else, or will hate him for the rest of the story, etc etc.

Now, the request. Are there stories where Harry starts out with a positive opinion of Dumbledore, but then as his mistakes (or schemes if thats how you like it) comoe to light, Harry beggins to trust him less and less unil he's finally just done?

Example:

- Bk1) A man can make mistakes

- Bk2) Petrifications of students, why no police involvement?

- Bk3) Ok wait, my godfather never got a trial? REALLY?

- Bk4) Why the hell is NONE of the staff even attempting to curb the shit Im getting for being stuck in a death contest?

- Bk5) Your idea of training me in occlumency is have the most peety and vindictive person you know teach me? The man who hates my guts?

- Bk6) You've know about Tom's Horcruxes for the past 16 and you're JUST NOW starting to look for them?!?!

- Bk7) Ooooh, great. Im a horcrux too. Guess that means I gotta die. Congratulations. You played me like a fiddle. Snape's memories were very enlightening. Fucker.

TL;DR Narrator starts with an optimistic view of Dumbledore, but by the end has become disillusioned with Dumbledore's bullshit


** I'm ok with Dumbledore being a mean manipulative bastard, but at least he should be manipulating for the win, weakening his enemies, and not always sacrificing his own people! Most manipulative!Dumbledore fics just had him out for Harry for some vague 'Greater Good'.

The only fic I found so far that handled this really well is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. The kids figured out sometime during Year 6 what his game was, and were less than pleased. But they also had to keep playing along because his plan was effective and sound.

** There's a pretty good fic, written pre-DH. We see the ugly side of Dumbledore and how he wasn't quite the saint the books made him out to be. It tries to redeem Snape though, so YMMV. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows).

Just a word of warning, Harry kind of acts his age here, so the Dumbledore-bashing is a bit more nuanced and realistic than in most fics. Also, the author ships Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione, which might not be your thing. DLDR

  Harry potter thought that now he'd destroyed voldemort, he'd live happily ever after in an isolation from everyone. However, a new prophecy and then a mysterious incident leads him to the world of WESTEROS after earth's destruction. How will he cope in this world which is itself rife with corruption, treachery and manipulation? MoD, lil-selfish, rich harry. Harry/Daenerys pairing.

** Albus doesn't do things for "The Greater Good". He was interested in that as a teen, but was horrified by what that brought about. That's all Fanon garbage.

Also, the reasons for the massive mistakes are that the first three books are supposed to be childrens fairy tales. The later books became more serious. If the former books had been written in the latter style, these plot holes would have been covered.

Then again, at least part of the whole cupboard under the stairs and intermittent starvation is for Rowling to give Harry a cinderella-like feel in book 1. I don't quite think she thought through the consequences of the abuse, nor the sustainability of it (why didn't anybody report him, etc).

** linkffn(3000137)

There's a lot I love about this fic, in that it has so many interesting concepts. Harry starts out firmly as a Dumbledore guy, but details come to light, and while information he receives isn't technically wrong, it's still manipulative because of the "history is written by the victor" mentality. Eventually, he becomes conflicted because he's just not sure who is right anymore, and he doesn't want to be caught in the middle. There is a turning point as well where Harry (and others) finally say fuck it, its too much, but I won't spoil it.

***** He should have made Harry learn stuff so that his search wasn't so dependent on luck and happenstance. Not facts that he couldn't have known, but magic. Harry was way too dependent on others, specially Hermione. Remove her from the equation and the situation goes from 'have some chance' to 'snowballs chance in a dragonpit'.

Telling Harry that he was a horcrux would probably have been a bad idea yes. But he manipulated too much and left knowledge and resources in bits and pieces like a scavenger hunt. He planned his manipulations to continue after his death, when he couldn't even control the situation besides giving advice to people via portrait.

For Harry to survive the AK, he was needed to tank it full well intending to die knowing he was a Horcrux. What if he hadn't found out? What if Snape died sooner or Harry wasn't there. It was just way to chance-y for my tastes.
