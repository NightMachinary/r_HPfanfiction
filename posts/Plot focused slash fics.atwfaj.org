Since my meta post got a huge response, I thought I should make this thread as fast as I can to get some recs.

So, on that thread I have gotten many replies saying they have enjoyed some slash fics here and there, that are more focused on the plot, and even though I generally prefer romance, I would really love to read some just as long there isn't any bashing and aren't protoganists/antagonistsships, so no drarrry, snarry, tomarry and the like.

Also, Harry/Cedric is my favourite pairing, and I really like Harry/Cedric/Cho, though I have probably read most of the former, and all of the latter. I really don't mind harem fics either, so maybe keep that in mind, thanks. :)


** Saving Connor and the 3.2m word masterpiece, the Sacrifices Arc by "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]]" is nothing short of incredible. Best slash fic I've ever read.

*** Yeah, I read it when I first started reading fanfics, but I didn't like how most of the characters behaved in it, especially LIly and Dumbledore, felt very out of character, and I have grown to really dislike drarry since then, so even if the plot is great, I tend to avoid fics with certain pairings. It does mean that I'm not reading some well written fics, and my reading list is short, but if a pairing is repulsive to me, I will take bad fics over it.

** I prefer longer fics, including slash, that focus on the plot, but my favourites are all drarry and snarry (the former has the best case fics, though)

Anyway, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2352896][Gelosaþ in Écnesse]] linkao3(2352896) is a great Harry/Salazar Slythering time travel fic. Salazar is not a dark wizard or a blood purist here, so it's not an antagonistic ship.

** I read mostly Drarry, so I don't have much I can rec if you don't want to read that pairing. (I'm also assuming you wouldn't want to read Ginny/Draco/Blaise?)

But if you haven't read Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water, it's a Harry/Ron/Hermione fic that is heavily focused on plot. linkffn(12076771)

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** Check out linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) It is a slow burn but the author does some fantastic imagery and plot development. If I remember right they use present tense and it takes a bit to get used to, but once you get beyond that it is very good.
