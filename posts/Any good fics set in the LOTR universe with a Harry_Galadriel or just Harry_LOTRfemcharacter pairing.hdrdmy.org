I've read a couple of fics recently that managed to feel like a (slightly watered-down but still great) Tolkien. I know that in LOTR the focus is more on the characters, plot, and world itself so I'm curious if there are any fics that manage to believably pair up Harry with any female character and at the same time still feel like LOTR with a dash of HPfanfic?


** Both of Steelbadgers fics (linkffn(The Power He Knows Not;The Shadow of Angmar)) are arguably the best LOTR crossover fics, with the first one having a Harry/Eowyn pairing and the second not really having a pairing at all (yet).

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
