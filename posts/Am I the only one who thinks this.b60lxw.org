Richard Harris played Dumbledore in Book 1 and Two. With Micheal Gambon playing Dumbledore in the rest of the series.

When ever I read Manipulative/Evil Dumbledore it's always Micheal Gambons version? With Richard Harris always in the nice Dumbledore did the best he could find in other fics?

Am I the only one who separates the two actors?


** Frankly, I don't think of a lot of the actors when I'm picturing fanfic characters. My headcanon Harry/Hermione/Ron/Dumbledore/Snape (and on and on) are all pretty different from what we got in the movie.

This isn't shitting on the movies, it's just a totally different medium. There's a lot of fanart that's probably closer to how I imagine Albus, rather than the movie version.

**** Yes but most fanfic authors seem to write this Dumbledore as if he gets off on those facts. Like he loves the fact that he's hurting Harry and he's only doing it as a way to keep power. I truly believe that Dumbledore hated the fact that he had to do these things and always felt incredibly guilty about them, but truly thought it was the only way. It doesnt make it right but there is a significant difference between the two. One is misguided and the other is what I would categorize as evil.

***** Exactly!

Dumbledore being manipulative =/= Manipulative!Dumbledore.

The former is the chessmaster figure of the books. The latter (aka "evil Dumbledore") is the fanon archetype taken to its utmost extreme. Fanon Dumbledore doesn't send Harry to the Dursleys knowing that it's the best out of a set of bad choices. He does it because he wants to isolate Harry, so he latches onto to the first person to be kind to him, the first people to introduce him to the magical world... Hagrid and the Weasleys. One of them is brainwashed into loyalty to Dumbles, and the other tempted into falling in with the plan because of the potentinal payout from the Potter Vault, and for Mrs. Weasley, a chance to make Ginny the future Mrs. Potter.

There's a difference between the two. A very, very big difference.

******* So instead of raising Harry for certain death, he instead raised Harry for almost certain death. After-all Voldemort, the most feared dark lord in recent history, so powerful he only feared Dumbledore, is going to definetly lose to Harry. Don't forget that he did actually plan out Harry's death at least in the later books with the whole sharing his mothers sacrafice thing. Again he is at the least a bad man with noble intentions. Even evil people can convince themselves that what their doing is right.

Dumbledore is manipulative, thinks of the larger picture instead of the individual brush strokes, and condemned Harry to a hard younger life knowingly. These are all actions that would label anyone as either a misguided, incompetant fool, or a bad person. Just because it worked out in the end doesn't change the fact that it was not the morally right thing to do. To say otherwise makes you either a hard core Dumbledore fan, or a fool.

In the end it was luck that Harry lived. Dumbledore was a very secretive man(as most manipulative people are), he didn't fully trust anyone, and because of that he truly believes he knows best. Sadly that is why i'd put him in the "bad guy" column. When people who believe they know best actually start manipulating other people into these situations to further their goal is when they go from good intentioned to bad guy.

******** I disagree with pretty much all of your post, but I am not trying to change your opinion, just want to leave mine here.

Basically I agree, it was luck that Harry lived. Harry was meant to die as one year old, like all the other people who died during the first war. There was never really a good life option for Harry Potter after Voldemort heard that prophecy. He miraculously survived (Lily's sacrifice and Voldemort's mistake). But now he had a horcrux in him (un-extractable as far as we know and no one knew about it), a prophecy about him, a target for revenge by Voldemort and his followers and people wanting to use him. He was doomed and none of it was Dumbledore's fault.

Yet he lived to have 2.5 kids and happy ending. Sure his life was hard but it wasn't bad, but he survived, had friends, avenged his parents. All thanks to his own luck/courage and people who were willing to what they could to defeat DL: including Snape, his friends, Order, and most of all Dumbledore shielding him from DL for a time and making some very risky hard calls.

Most of the arguments against Dumblerdore seem to relay on hindsight knowledge or existence of some unproven "better choices", but I found non of them very convincing yet. I don't really wanna go into details though, it was done so many times here.

********* I also think that, considering the informations he had at hands, Dumbledore did for the best.\\
Dumbledore, while he probably had some suspicions (there can be only so many ways to not die in their world), only confirmed the existence of Horcruxes at the end of Harry's 2nd year.

As for Harry himself, I don't think he confirmed it before Harry's 4th year at the earliest, more likely end of 5th.

By this time, the 2nd war had already started, and Harry had a big target on his back, not only from the prophecy but from the several times he had bested Voldemort.

From Dumbledore point of view, without all the personal feeling (he seemed to really appreciate him), Harry was :\\
- Someone he could trust to not join Voldemort (already proved his character and easier to trust when you know the bad guy would never accept him in his ranks).\\
- Someone who could not escape the war (Voldemort made sure of that).\\
- Someone who proved he was talented to stay alive, and yet seemed condemned by his scar.

Might as well use him to the war since he will likely have to die for the enemy to fall, and if by doing so you can grant him a tiny chance to survive and live long after, might as well do it.

********* You seem to be forgetting the most important parts. You can hand wave as much as you want, but the fact remains that Dumbledore truly believe he thought he knew best, therefore he never shared his knowledge fully, but used it to manipulate others. He truly believed he knew best, and therefore he should be the only one that knows the full picture, and will only release information when he wishes too. Hocruxes for example are something he could have at least shared with his closet friends, and allies with the hope that they could help woth it's destruction, but no he left it in the hands of Harry. Yes Harry is meant to defeat Voldemort, but why couldn't Dumbledore have at least helped with the Hocruxes.

How about Dumbledore not telling Harry about the prophecy until Sirius died, Arthur was injured, and Hermione, and co got greatly injured. No he kept it a secret, because he thought he knew best. Let's not forget about how stupid it was to have bait(Philosophers stone) for the Dark Lord, or his Death Eaters in a school full of children. That is just plain incompetent, or manipulative(after-all why did he do it on the very first year Harry attended Hogwarts). I'm pretty sure Dumbledore said somewhere that he was letting Harry try his strength.

Over-all you can believe what you want, but the evidence is strong that Dumbledore is a manipulator who truly believes he knows best. Did he, well we will never know. The fact remains though is that he treated everyone as chess pieces. Maybe he truly did care for them, and such, but that doesn't change the way he essentialy used people.

********** I didn't forget anything trust me. Used people for what? Money, power? What did he get from it all besides grisly death? You say like Voldemort was his personal problem. He fought for what he thought was right, along with the people who willingly joined him. They weren't all easily manipulated idiots, they understood the need to know basis.

Dumbledore had all the information because he is one who figured/found it out, so obviously, it was up to him to decide whom to give it and how much. If he gets it wrong, the war could be lost. Ever hear of security clearance? What is the point of Arthur knowing the prophecy? What if he got caught on assignment? In the world with legilimency, imperius and veritaserum it's basically guaranteed he would spill it. And Harry is no different, but with a direct link to Voldemort's mind and no desire to defend against it.

Dumbledore was finding out about Horcruxes during the fifth year, he didn't want Voldemort to get wind of it, so he stayed away. If Voldemort would move them, all is lost. And even so, Harry, Ron and Hermione knew, Snape knew at least some of it, Slughorn too. Hardly no one. And none of them told anyone else even after Dumbledore's death.

And what do you mean he didn't help with them? He figured out what they are, how to destroy them, where to look. He basically gave Harry a list and said: "go". He took out two of them and died in the process, otherwise he would have certainly went after the rest. No one has done more, besides maybe Harry.

Philosophers stone was moved because Quirell was about to break into Gringotts where it was kept, into the safest place besides Hogwarts, not because he wanted to. It was a year Voldemort decided to make his move. So it was moved to Hogwarts. Then Dumbledore got an idea to set a trap to get Voldemort while he is weak, if it succeeded the war would have be over to the best of anyone's knowledge at the time and Harry would live a safe life. Also Voldemort couldn't actually harm Harry then.

IIRC, Gambon had not and did not read the books before acting the part, and pretty much just did whatever the hell he wanted, which is how we ended up with */"DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE?! DID YOU??!!!!"/*

He gets marginally better in the last couple of movies, but he still feels /off/ to me when I compare Gambon to the mental image of Dumbledore I get from reading the books.
