A History of Magic research task leads the Golden Trio (more specifically Harry and Hermione) to a shocking realisation about their world. The concept of "victimless crimes" and how no laws existed in regards to them, leaving the wizarding world free to take and distribute drugs, take part in forgery, prostitution, bribery, forgery etc. A world where even if it was frowned upon and considered morally wrong, the Ministry would never dream of stopping "a crime where none suffered."

Understandable, Hermione thought, with everything so easy for wizards and witches (reality bending itself a wand swish away), it made sense that the concept of drugs and debauchery never became mainstream enough to warrant laws to stop them. Additionally, it would explain how many of the purebloods got off at the end of the previous war.

Ludicrous but fascinating, Harry thought, furhter invested in looking up what went on in regards to drugs and intoxicants. Memories of his sloshed Uncle and pot smoking cousin coming to mind; Harry further stunned to find no indication that anything beyond Firewhisky existed in this world that constituted "drugs". A dull idea about a "gap in the market" ringing away in the back of his mind.

Ron, not really understanding his friends fascination with this weird bit of boring legal trivia and wanting to get out of the library and go flying already!

Until Ronald Weasley was made aware of how lucrative these "cartel" thingies could get in the Muggle world (where they had to deal in the shadows), deciding he needed in on it.

Years on, he'd wonder how he successfully talked the two pure hearted Gryffindor's into masterminding an empire of narcotics, forgery, rackeetering and other such sinful activity... all whilst still managing to: beat Voldemort, outmanoeuvre Dumbledore and the Ministry, keep their families in the dark AND get all their homework in on time...

**** Bah! If it was so much fun writing it, why didn't you write more of it? :P

***** Because darker and edgier storylines like those need a ridiculous amount of TLC not to jump the shark.

The characters need to make believable choices and decisions that result in them becoming what they are. They need to stay one step ahead of those investigating their activities-and there would be a lot of people doing so. They need to actually adopt patterns of behavior and thinking that aren't alien to their canon counterparts. They need to actually be able to do what you want them to do, which involves sourcing a lot of materiel and manpower to continue expanding their operations.

And, given the tone of the story, they absolutely cannot be seen as having plot armour. They need to be seen to pay for mistakes, which is really damn hard to balance correctly.

All this culminates in an end result that should put them in a position to win that's logical, feasible and immersive in the context of the story.

Why, you ask? Well, how else would you justify deploying close to a thousand WW2-era artillery pieces with inferi crews, an AA umbrella and a company-sized Armored Cavalry force to Hogwarts in time for the battle ;p? The trick is to lead everyone along so that they don't cry bullshit when the Forbidden Forest turns into the Battle of the Bulge 2-Wizarding Boogaloo.

Otherwise, you've just written some high-grade chaotic evil crack.

Better to come up with a less trying project, no :p?

******* IRL, yeah. A lot has happened in the 7 years since I wrote this.

In fictionland, I discovered Worm in 2014 and have been getting involved in writing Omakes on Spacebattles while I work on a couple of fan fiction projects.

The one I am working on now is a Nanoha cross- a Female Harry Potter ends up displaced into the distant past on another planet just as the Belkan Empire starts to expand. I have the mechanics and end resolution down, but the tone and events getting there are still up in the air.
