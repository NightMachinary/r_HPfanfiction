And so while trying to teach occlumency to Harry Snape not only falls spectacularly but also manages to make Harry develop the ability to draw Voldemort in his head and lock him there. Dumbledore, the order, Voldemort, Harry and Snape himself are still unsure if it is or not a good thing.


** The stifling, heavy silence hung in the Headmaster of Hogwarts office. In the middle of the room sat Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore. Snape loomed on the sidelines. Fawkes moved from foot to foot, looking pained.

Dumbledore shuffled his hands restlessly, not knowing what to do with them. "Well, Harry..."

Harry cleared his throat, looking pointedly. Awkward silence resumed. The sorting Hat shuffled on his shelf.

"Ah, well, Harry-Mort?" tried Dumbledore.

Newly dubbed Harrymort looked on in disbelief. From Snape mouth tore out a pained sound as he hide his face in his hands.

It was a catastrophe.

** Didn't that happen in canon? I seem to remember Snape's Occlumency lessons doing more harm than good in the original books.

*** It's up to discussion because we were never really told much of how occlumency works or about how one should go about learning it.

While we do see the visions gettin more frequent it could easily be an effect of Voldemort getting better at exploring it, Harry's emotions making it progressively harder to resist it, the bond getting stronger with time...

And about occlumency it could be that Snape was doing it right but didn't have enough time, he could have decided that Harry was a lost cause and focused on having fun by torturing him, occlumency could be a shot in the dark that just didn't have an effect at all, this could have been one of many possible ways of learning occlumency (maybe the most or less pleasant, or the quickest, the more or less throughly...), Snape could instead of teach occlumency be performing a exam on Harry's mind and/or the connection, or even trying to ‚Äòaccidentally' stumble on Voldemort's mind to learn some secret to defeat him (the ring?), or even Snape could have been trying to gain Voldemort's trust by widening his connection with Harry.

Really, the whole thing was so open-ended it could be played off thousands of different ways.
