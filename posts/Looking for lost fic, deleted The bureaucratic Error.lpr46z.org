:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Its called the bureaucratic error by iniga, and the story was just deleted this morning. I was rereading the story because I love it so much, so I was wondering if any one has a copy I can read? Its about remus going back in time to fix everything starting third year.

According to the author:-

#+begin_quote
  The constant "constructive" criticism was too much for me. I felt like I was collapsing under its weight, and every time I attempted to ask out of it I received many messages telling me that it was my obligation to take criticism and that the reviewers were not going to stop. As many of you said, I don't have the temperament to be a writer, and this site removing the loophole that let me delete reviews that swirled in my head and taunted me for days was the final sign that I needed to leave.

*** Thank you for the download link. How sad that the author felt compelled to take down a fic so many people have enjoyed.

This really says a lot about the culture on FFN, unfortunately.

**** Good site, bad community.

Which kinda stings considering I exclusively use FFN.

***** Yeah, like I literally wrote a story and I put in the description that it would be ron/hermione, and Harry/Hermione fans started coming at me, and I'm like, it you hate the pairing, you should've read the description and not wasted your time on a story with a pairng you dont like. Ended up deleting the story because the rudeness got to me

**** They unfortunately turned off their PMs :( they had replied to some reviews I left on older chapters, and I never got to review the last few chapters, so I went back to see if I could privately message them to tell them how much I loved the fic but there unfortunately does not seem to be any way to. I wish I could thank them for their work, this is one of my all time favorite fanfics and it's so sad that they put so much work into it only to be bullied off the site.

**** I was only copying/pasting what was on their profile [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/49515/Iniga][page]]. I guess you could still send a private message but they might be ignoring them.

*** If only there was a filter to separate the terrible from the non-terrible... in real life, Malfoys aren't so forthcoming about their shit psychology.

*** Oh to the author, I'm so sorry. But fair play for them for stepping away from the negativity. But screw all the people who felt the need to be negative. I'm sad ðŸ˜Š

** Don't you know how can I text Iniga? I liked bureaucratic error and want to ask her permission to translate fic into Russian. She closed comments on AO3 and PM on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and I can't find any opportunity to contact with her.
