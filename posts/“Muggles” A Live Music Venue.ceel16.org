Until recently, the Leaky Cauldron was the only entrance to Diagon Alley, but now there's a new venue open to wizards and muggles alike. Every night, this club (appropriately called “Muggles”) has live performances of popular muggle music. To the utter frustration of the M.o.M the owners seem to keep finding loopholes to get around the Statute of Secrecy.


** I'm picturing some sort of vaudevillian showhouse with wizards performing muggle toons while dressed as muggles (aka the Wizarding World equivalent of performing in blackface). Your take on the idea is more uplifting of course.

*** Yeah, I was picturing something like a jazz club that was mostly patronized by muggle born and halfblood wizards and witches that maybe wanted to keep a foot in both worlds
