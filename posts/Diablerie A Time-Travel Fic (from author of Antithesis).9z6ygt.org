Hello! So many people told me to keep them updated I lost track. Anyways, here is the first chapter of Diablerie: a Time-Travel fic where Tom comes to the future instead of vice versa. The premise is that Tom finds himself suddenly in the future and needs to cope with having all of his plans ruined, no allies, no information, all the while struggling with severe mental trauma due to the London Blitz and other WW2 related incidents. Medical issues such as Scarlet fever and other pathogens will be addressed, as well as basic psychological aid of the time period compared to now.

** Really cool idea. Makes me wonder why ‚Tom travelling to the future‘ isnt a more popular concept

edit: i saw a few typos but i find harry's trauma symptoms really interesting and Tom is pretty much exactly like i imagine him. I am looking forward to the next chapter :)
