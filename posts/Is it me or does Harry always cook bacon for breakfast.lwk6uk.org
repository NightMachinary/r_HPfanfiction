It seems like every fic I read where Harry gets up early or wants to treat someone he goes to make breakfast and he ALWAYS makes bacon. Staying with Tonks? Bacon. Cooking for Cho in Grimmauld? Bacon. Dursleys? Bacon. Amelia Bones? Bacon.

I have nothing against bacon per se but why can he never have cereal or toast and marmalade? This seems like some kind of creativity void that all authors just happen to fall into.

Or am I going mad and this isn't a thing at all?

***** No we do eat crumpets, although I'd never have a poached egg with one. I live in the North-West of England and although I don't eat it super often, if I feel like having a cooked breakfast I'd probably have poached egg or scrambled egg with a muffin. It might be a Northern thing, or just an area thing because I know alot of my friends have them too.

Crumpets are more like a toast? You eat it with butter or spreads you'd put on toast... But we have toast too (obviously).

I've never had a muffin with spread, but I might try that next time. Toasted muffin and jam (jelly?) sounds nice... now I'm hungry 😂

Personally I always eat my eggs (poached or fried) with Tabasco and toast, and boiled eggs with bread with some ham, mayo and parsley. That could be my Scandinavian and American backgrounds coming throughnwhich meant I never saw the muffins. When I ate with local company it was normally a sausages and beans breakfast, or fresh fruit.

I think I mentioned chicken and rice on another comment, but I grew up with a friend from Malaysia and it was something they had quite often for breakfast so I'd eat it too. Didn't even cross my mind that A) they were from Malaysia so of course their traditions weren't British and B) rice isn't even from Britain, until someone asked what the heck i was making for breakfast when I was at Uni...

** Ah, its partly because harry is used to "cooking" perhaps even liking it. But mostly because Cereal/toast doesn't really require effort, and as such a scene with harry just putting things on a table /roasting bread is a bit boring when you can have him litterally stand and fry bacon and eggs making delicious smells waft through the house.

It really just makes for a more interresting scene to write, and can also work as a way to talk about Harry's childhood.

** Bacon is the traditional "treat" breakfast in the UK. It's the main part of a full English.

Having him forced to cook bacon for the Dursleys is about how Vernon and Dudley are fat and unhealthy- they have every day what most people have once a week max.

Harry cooking bacon for people he likes is about him showing his gratitude- if you make someone breakfast as a treat or gesture, you'll make them a full English or at the least a bacon butty.

At Hogwarts it seems like the breakfast is buffet style, just take what you want off the table. All buffet breakfast in the UK involves bacon, unless it's clearly stated it's a continental breakfast.

Other very British breakfast items that a writer could consider having him eat are: sausages (on own or in a sandwich), beans on toast, tomatoes on toast, eggs (boiled with toast soldiers). A full English (bacon, eggs (fried), sausages, toast, beans. You can add tomatoes, mushroom, black pudding too). Egg butty. Egg and bacon or egg and sausage butty. Bacon and sausage butty. Our cereals tend to be either cornflakes, or ridiculously sugary stuff that's somehow still allowed to be marketed to kids (cocoa pops are probably the best one if you're writing young Harry. Kids like chocolate). Porridge definitely, but we don't really have oatmeal here. Toast and jam/marmalade. Crumpets, also with jam. Bread product with jam is about as sweet as breakfast gets in Britain, unless you go for chocolate cereal. Museli is kind of a joke, less so now but if you're writing canon timeline so anything between 1980-97, if someone was eating museli that's probably an indicator they're some sort of hippy or on a strict diet. Petunia /may/ have eaten museli, but more likely to have had toast and some fruit. Grapefruit is the traditional "breakfast fruit" but any fruit is fine.

Breakfast items that wouldn't have been eaten in the UK in the 1980s/90s include: pancakes, waffles, anything with whipped cream or sugar. If we have syrup, it's Golden Syrup not usually maple. Even now if we want breakfast pancakes we have to go and find a specifically American or Canadian themed cafe. They aren't a typical breakfast product here at all and you have to hunt them down.

*** Thank you for your detailed description of breakfast foods. However, having lived in the UK my whole life I've had cooked breakfast at home maybe half a dozen times. I know very few people who regularly have cooked breakfast as it is so stodgy. I'd say a full English is probably more of a food for eating out at a greasy spoon or something.

More to the point though why does Harry never cook something interesting to show off his "incredible" culinary skills? I can do decent bacon on a camping stove with solid fuel it's hardly difficult.

I also cannot remember the last time I had a full English, probably before lockdown because as you say it is going out food. But if you're looking to impress someone or show gratitude by making breakfast, the default for a Brit would be something bacon based.

Yeah agree. I mean, in canon he actually doesn't cook as much as fanon thinks. Petunia has him stirring, or chopping, or checking something doesn't burn, but the implication is that she cooks, he helps. He does all the cleaning up after, but it's her food. So if you're using canon Harry as your base character, "can cook a full English quite well, not much else though" checks out. If people are using the "culinary genius" fanon Harry, I absolutely agree they need to make him cook better food and at times other than breakfast!

** I always assumed it was a nod to owls, or Hedwig in particular, who routinely stole pieces of bacon when they made their deliveries. Best to have some handy. Might be fanon rather than canon, of course.

*** Though eating bacon, especially cooked bacon, would prove harmful and potentially fatal to owls. JKR acknowledged that lack of research at one point if I recall correctly.

***** Are post owls related to dragons or Abraxans then?

Dragons because being born out of eggs and needing alcohol in their diet.

And Abraxans because they also drink whiskey and have wings.

Which is more likely?

Though I do know that there is at least one fic where Harry(?) breeds miniature dragons to use for postal services. But I can't remember the name so I'd be grateful if anyone knows the story and links it.

*** Yes. Traditionally in Honks fics they share breakfast in Chapter 14 regardless of fic. Here we have linkffn(The Life He Leads by WardenInTheNorth) where they have the standard bacon as opposed to linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) in which, as a fic famous for inverting tropes, they just share a non-specific breakfast.

  When the dementor attack presents Harry with an opportunity to begin to fight back he gladly sets himself on the path to have a hand in his future. But as time goes on, it's clear that not all is the same as it once was. Why has his scar stopped hurting? What are these seemingly random objects he's drawn to? How deep does the connection between him and Voldemort truly run? Post GoF

The bacon somewhat makes sense because we see him cooking it in the first book. The corn flakes are just confusing. Surely England has other types of cereal.

*** We don't have the same variety you have in the US. Cornflakes is realistic. However he might have wheetabix, fruit'n'fibre (bran flakes with dried fruit), bran flakes, porridge (never oatmeal), shredded wheat or muesli. They'd typically be served either with fresh or dried fruit and a cup of tea.

If Harry is a child, you might get shreddies, rice krispies, coco pops or cheerios. As a child, coco pops were a treat. They weren't an every day thing. We don't have the same ridiculously high sugar cereals you do in the US.
