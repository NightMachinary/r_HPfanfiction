I've been trying to find this fic for years. I'm hoping someone in this reddit can help (especially since help!I'm looking for is dead).

I remember:

*Harry self harms via cutting

*Snape has to teach Harry occlumancy in 6th year

*Harry successfully blocks Snape from entering his mind via the imagery of blood poring down walls; Snape warns Harry all methods of concealment are not equal

*Harry finds a black book in Knockturn Alley that teaches him self harm spells

*the book turns out to be a primer of sorts for dark magic

*Snape discovers Harry cutting after Harry enchants a blood quill but mistakes where the cuts are located

*Harry tries to hide his cuts with Quidditch gloves

*Snape has a family and a son that live in a slave(?) village

Honestly, I'm usually capable of finding my own lost fanfics over the decade plus of fandoms, but this one is just been impossible. Please, please help.
