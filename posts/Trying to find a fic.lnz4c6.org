:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fanfic about an abandoned Harry time traveling back to before his first year. Became lord slytherin through right of conquest I believe. Has a brother that was thought to be bwl. I remember a scene specifically where he tutors Hermione and introduces her to magic via Alice in wonderland. He ends up leading the grey if I remember correctly.
