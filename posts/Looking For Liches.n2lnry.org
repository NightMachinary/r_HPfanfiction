Horcruxes are old hat, and have side effects besides. How come there aren't any stories where a character goes full, classical lich, with a single phylactery? Surely they're out there, but I've found a grand total of none. Voldemort can't be the only immortal. Right?


** I've seen a few in fics, I'm trying to think of where. I think the general response of them in the stories to Voldie is like ‘why?' And ‘now you've overdone it' which is amusing and probably valid

Can I ask, are liches from like one game/story, or are they general monsters? I've seen them mentioned a lot in fandom spaces but not in any source material so I don't really know much about their mythology

Originally, a lich was just another word for a dead body. Then in fiction it became a name for mages who found a way to defeat death, usually at the cost of their bodies withering away and looking like corpses even while they still functioned. It was I believe D&D that solidified the dominant idea of what a lich was in the mainstream; that is, someone who used magic to store their soul in a phylactery and remotely pilots a skeleton that they can reform at their phylactery whenever it's ‘killed'. Given that they're immortal, older liches are generally portrayed as extremely knowledgeable. The best lich I've seen in fiction is probably the one from [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Mother of Learning]].

**** Oh my god thanks so much for the in death description!

I do very much enjoy the idea that Tom was a naive and arrogant youth who thinks he's the only one to have, what does he say, that's he's taken magic the furthest or something? And all these really old people are like ‘dude lmao. You're seventy years old'

The only fic I'm certain of is there's a lich in No Competition. And I have the distinct memory of another that has Sanguini the vampire having a lich in his poker group, but I don't know if that's the same story or another one.

Hah, same. I imagine other countries have other magical practices, some more likely to lead to immortality than others. Like, China might have mages who perform a sort of cultivation that provides way less utility than wands but results in a lot of 500 year old wise old master type folks.

No Competition is this one, I assume? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11126195/1/No-Competition]]

*** Lich is an old English word for corpse. In fact the gate where the coffin and funeral procession would commonly enter was called the lich gate.

It's a very specific /kind/ of churchyard gate, with a roof over it and often seats at either side under the roof for the pallbearers to stop and rest on before taking the deceased into the church for the funeral service - most of 'em were built before hearses were invented when you'd to shift the deceased from their home to the church by britches' arsepower. The usual spelling is 'lych gate', btw. There's a wikipedia article with several plain and boring specimens pictured on it, a lot of older churchyards have quite fancy ones with all kinds of amenities built in.

** There was a story I read a long time ago where Harry saved Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets but died in the process, and Dumbledore was forced to bring him back from the dead several years later as a heavily modified sentient inferi that could cast magic, because it turns out the prophecy was absolutely real and Harry is literally the only person who can stop Voldemort from taking over the world.

Dumbledore was not manipulative in that story, and was not only emotionally destroyed by Harry's death, but felt he was no better than Grindelwald for having to resort to raising Harry's corpse as an undead to help win the war.

Harry was essentially a lich that had to obey Dumbledore's orders in that story. It was actually a pretty enjoyable story. No clue who wrote it though, but I think that's the closest I've ever seen to a true D&D style lich in a Harry Potter story.

He also eventually got better at the very end, because erstatz phoenix magic whargarble power of love.

Not a lich, but there's a revenant (reanimated corpse) in the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle series]] by Flamethrower. (very long, main pairing is slash, still in progress) He's called The Gaunt and he taught at Hogwarts (obviously, nobody recognized he was a revenant at the time). Guess which family he founded? First part linkao3(11284494). The revenant is mostly in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12339951][Part 4]] but you really can't just leap into the story at that point.

** Maybe Herpo the Foul is one. He created horcruxs. Maybe instead of creating one he decided to keep going and make a better way of immortality.

Hmm. Prompt: Herpo the foul was a terrible dark lord but no one knows who killed him. Maybe because he didn't ever die.\\
He created horcruxs and allowed that knowledge to go public do other rivals would create them. Maybe horcruxs are a red herring and trap in one. Dark lords who might end up rivaling Herpo create them and end up cutting their potential down by via insanity/magical core decreasing. Hell maybe horcruxs work by being a get out of death free card. Instead of dying a horcrux burns away. So if Voldemort created 7 of them all it would take is 8 killing curses and he would get put down fast. With each one used up the wizard would lose more and more of his/her power and intellect to the point where at 7 being used up Voldemort is brain dead comatose.\\
Now onto the lich idea. Herpo created a true immortality since no one can find his phylatry.(?). So he only has to worry about body rot which he can overcome by possessing other wizards and absorbing their magical power. Growing stronger with each jump. Maybe Merlin became famous because he sealed Herpo away. And created the deathly hallows by breaking the key in 3 pieces. Cursing them so they can never be united and used to unlock Herpos prison. Merlin never let the truth get out so no one would ever try to become a second coming of Herpo or try releasing him. The 3 brothers could have been his students and used their own deaths to further curse the objects realizing that it was a cause worth dying for.\\
Story can go 3 ways.\\
1- when Harry unites them he gets possessed by Herpo and the wizarding world have to work with the muggles to stop Herpo 2- Herpo is broken out by some one who gets ahold of the hallows after Harry is murdered. And Herpo takes over the world. Harry's children lead a gorilla tactics battle against the regime while following the clues left by Merlin around the world.

3 perhaps a part of Herpo escapes and possesses some child and works to gain his power back and gain enough strength to get his hands on all 3 hallows. Taking on dumbledore is bad but also over coming the curses on the hallows is also difficult. Perhaps they can't be wielded by evil.

I imagine Herpo to be like Darth Viciate.

  “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?” Dumbledore's voice had finally turned cold.“No, I'm saying you're responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”“I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. “I just think... maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don't have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.”“You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn't sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done --”“Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.”“You are suggesting that we use Voldemort's first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.
