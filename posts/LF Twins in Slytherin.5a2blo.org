Saw a fb post recently wondering how different the books would be if the twins were slytherins (Gred and Forge obviously) Anyway just wondering if anyone has seen a doc with this because I never have and I think it could be really cool. Whether they are the main focus or if it's just part of a fic.


** Er... they both end up in Slyrherin in this fic but it's a pile of crap linkffn(the weasley twins versus the sorting hat)

  ONE-SHOT. The Sorting Hat places Fred and George in different Houses, and they don't really like it... Involvs the twins, some kind of mischief, Dumbledore, lemon drops, Snape, Pomfrey, Charlie, Fawkes and the Hat. Completely AU, partly injured!twins
