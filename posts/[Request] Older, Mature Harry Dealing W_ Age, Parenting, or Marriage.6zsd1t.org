Title sums it up. Looking for some lengthy, complete fics where Harry is an older adult, dealing with things like marital issues, parenting, etc.


** *Grow Young With Me* - Taliesin19 linkffn(11111990) - Seems to be everyone's favorite fluff. Dead Ginny. Single-dad Harry meets an adorable muggle woman.

*Questions and Answers* - little0bird linkffn(3954448) - Harry/Ginny post-war. Slice of Life, probably the best one in the fandom.

*You and I* - emilyherself - linkffn(6186581) - Ginny and Harry got divorced. Harry meets a healer at St. Mungos and asks her out. There's some drama here. Harry struggles to raise 3 kids + Teddy on his own(with the youngest girl suffering from epilepsy) because Ginny practically dumped the kids on him to have more babies with Dean. Meanwhile, healer-woman attempts make herself a part of Harry's family. Not the best, but very readable.

  Post- DH/ AU. Healer Sadie Lewis never knew that fixing Al Potter's broken leg would lead to such a profound romance with his father. Harry/OC, Ginny/Dean, all other canon intact. Rated M for later chapters. All reviews appreciated!

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian)... and the other 80+ stories he's written that cover expanded canon-compliant ideas into the next generation and amid the corners of the original books. The listed one is all about family and living with muggle neighbors, but mostly from the muggles' point of view.

#+begin_quote
  HPDM slash, epilogue compliant. Harry's life has become an endurance run, through the remnants of his stressful divorce, his strained relationships with his children, and his increasingly complicated job. But what might make things more complicated than the rest of it is what happens when he saves Scorpius Malfoy's life, and Draco Malfoy insists on assuming the life debt. COMPLETE.
