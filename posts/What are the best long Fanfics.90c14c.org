I was wondering what the Fanfics are that are hailed as the absolute best. In a community like this, I'm pretty sure that some names come up quite a bit more often than others.

However, I would like to add one search parameter: length. I was thinking 200k words bare minimum, 400-800k are much better, and anything above that is spectacular! Anyway, I guess I'm requesting some recommendations?


** I think this is the second time I've recced this in three days, but well: linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb)

This fic and its two sequels probably total up to 200-300k in length.

** I'm not sure about absolute best but I'll give you a few well done longer works.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom although abandoned what is there is nothing short of a masterpiece. 1m+ words. Voldemort won AU. Closest to what you wanted in terms of absolute best.

Sacrifices Arc, all of which comprises a whopping 2.6m words. Best of all? It's actually pretty damn good. Look up Lightning on the Wave on FFN, Saving Connor is the first in the series. Completed and written before DH.

The Legacy is a unique take on the marriage contract trope, the realistic way they come together is very well done. However it is abandoned and a bit wordy at times. Still worth a read.

** Here are some of the longer fics I have read and enjoyed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always]] 287,429 words: Ron, Harry, Ginny Travel back in time to prevent disaster. Has a couple smaller parts after as well bringing it all together to be just shy of 400,000 words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]] 419,605 words: One of the most popular stories on the site. +Abandoned+ On hiatus unfortunately. Harry travels back in time to prevent the death of everyone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads]] 376,980 words: Harry, after begin beaten mostly to death (Dursley's end up not being bad later, their actions get explained), heals his body and mind with magic. Goes from very strong to Godlike over the course of the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Game]] 351,478 words: Harry is granted powers that makes his life and abilities progress much like a game. Very fun story that is regularly updated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]] 229,389 words: first year of a female Harry Potter attending Hogwarts pretending to be her male cousin in order to attend. Very good story. Years 2 (338,096 words) and 3 (388,266 words) are also completed. Year 4 hasn't been updated in a year is at 132,561 words.

** personally, I recommend Something Wicked This Way Comes by The Mad Mad Reviewer !linkffn(5501817)

It is one of the more excellently written fanfics on ff.net. excellent dialouge, that manages to both be witty, horrifying and heartwarming all at the same time. It also features some of the best characterisation in HP fandom.

Not much in th way of spoilers, but basically Harry and Co decide that winning the war on voldemort is going to be tougher then expected, and so logically decided that the solution is to summon a demoness for help!

Now technically it is a crossover fic, but you really don't need to have any knowledge of the cross over series, essentially borrowing the name of a character from the series for the summoned demon.

It is really an awesome read, and I hope everyone here gives it a try

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
