Hey,

I'm looking for a story I read a LONG while ago. What I remember is that Harry is a doctor seeing patients. Draco has seen everybody in the wizarding world about his son who is sick. I'm fairly positive Harry had changed his name so when Draco had visited, he didn't realize it was Harry he was seeing. I'm like 99% positive it was slash, but from what I remember, not like hard core slash

Spoiler below is a plot line that would ruin it if somebody wants to read it for the first time.

[[/spoiler][What I remember is Draco's son had cancer]]

Adding some more info: It's not a cross over and i'm like 99.9999% sure it was completed, and trying to use FFN for search, even when excluding crossovers, still comes up with cross overs.

  SORRY I ACCIDENTLY DELETED SOME CHAPTERS, I HAVE RE-POSTED THEM - ALL BACK TO NORMAL. Harry lives and works in the muggle world, wanting to have a break from the wizarding world after the war. He sees his old school rival and his world is turned upside down. Rated M for language and sexual content later on.
