*** I don't know for sure, but my guess is that Astoria was worrying-fearing that little Lily was going to follow in her mother's footsteps.

** I figured out the first twist before the conversation with Hermione in the Library, but I admit, I did not figure on the finale.

** I like the plot twist but the execution...sometimes it got a little obsessed with itself. Flowery paragraphs that meant nothing, loving descriptions of things we already knew about. The first thousand words could have been cut (or at least viciously trimmed) without hurting the story. I almost stopped reading because of that problem.

Once it actually started moving, it was good. Original, emotional without pushing too hard, striking characterizations -- good stuff. I just wish that first bit had gotten another trim in editing. I'll mention as much in my overall positive review.

** Spoiler

Spoiler really I'm on my phone and can't do a descent Spoiler tag thingy...

Spoiler ahead

I'm at the point where Ginny and Astoria are about to duel. Is she Daphne and Harry's child? Come back from the future and possessing her aunt in some way?

Edit: forgot to mention the reasoning behind it: the eyes of course.

The fact that she claims she was trained by the best dueller of the age.

Her first spell being the trade mark spell of said dueller.

Huge amount of detail she has about Harry.

Edit 2: that was weirdly disturbing. I mean in the first scene when Astoria says she is going to set Harry up I had a vague idea that they'd end up together but after a while I dismissed it for obvious reasons but, damn.

** Liked it a lot, but was so disturbed at the same time, the twist kinda made me feel sick and ruined any nice fluffy feeling romance is supposed to give you. Because of that i also hated it.

** I liked it. Was quite sweet, even if I did recognize the coming plot twist well ahead of time. The last paragraph IS kind of confusing, but I think Astoria was still subconsciously expecting HERSELF as the daughter. Or a daughter that was a clone of her.

I have no issue with the incest. I'm sure magic can take care of that somehow, it is after all fairly common for close relatives to get together considering pure blood populations. Not to mention a single generation of inbreeding won't cause much problems anyways.

I would have loved to see something after the epilogue of Dumbledores/Mcgongagals thoughts on the situation, since they knew the story.

** That was actually pretty awesome. It wasn't very surprising, though. I had it all figured out by the talk with Daphne when she comforts Astoria after confronting her. The premise was great, though.

** (spoilers)

I've seen one too many of Marty Mcfly's adventures and read as much time travel fics to not recognise the “twist” by the middle of the story, desu.
