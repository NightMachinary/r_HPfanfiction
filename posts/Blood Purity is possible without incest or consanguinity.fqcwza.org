I know Hagrid and Ron said no one in the British Isles were truly pure-blood, that every witch or wizard at some point had a Muggle ancestor, and I'm not disputing that. But the fact is that the wizarding United Kingdom is very isolationist, and that hinders pure-bloods... well staying put-blood. For info, the definition of pure-blood is from /Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy/ and the criteria to be pure-blood is to have four grandparents that aren't either Muggle, Muggle-born or (possibly) Squib. This means that you could have eight Muggle-born great-grandparents (as two Muggle-borns form a half-blood if the child is magical), but statistically you wouldn't be pure-blood with this set of great-grandparents unless you were part of a frighteningly strange experience.

Going back to the subject, it's not hard for a determined family to stay pure-blood. The British Isles have the default of being... well islands, and completely sovereign. The wizarding communities on the continent would most likely be more connected with their neighbours because of the land connections and apparently there are some countries like Luxembourg and Liechtenstein who don't really track international Apparition and can be used for illegal border crossing (unless that is pure Fanon and wizarding countries don't bother tracking international apparition or entering a country by broom). So, want it or not, the continental nations are closer between each other than the UK is with the rest of the world just by factor of being connected by land.

That got me thinking that for every generation you could ensure that your children marry other pure-bloods from a different country so as to shake up the genealogical pool and would prevent the line from weakening with every passing incestuous/consanguineous generation and greatly diminish of not completely prevent the existence of Squibs if we are to follow the theory that Squibs are caused by the accumulation of incest as can be seen with the case of the Gaunts and Tom Riddle Jr. Lastly, and I know this doesn't mean much, but I'd like to remember everyone that the two most powerful wizards of the twentieth century in Great Britain are two half-bloods (meaning the radical and sudden change in half of the genes could have very well boosted them) and that the most powerful from the continent we know of is very most likely pure-blood. Coincidence? I think not.
