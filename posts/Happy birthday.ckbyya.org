Happy birthday to Harry James Potter he turned 39 years old


** 39 years old and people are trying to rewrite his teenage years. I wonder if he gets visions. Those make out and sex sessions with his mother, Sirius, Dumbledore, Snape, Draco, and Voldemort must be extra hell for him. And "Who the hell is Daphne Greengrass?" has to be a frequent question on his mind.

Happy Birthday, Harry!!!

*** "Dammit, Hermione is hot in these visions, but she's so fucking annoying."

"The Ice Queen? Didn't I see her in a movie in 2013?"

"Dammit, I shouldn't have to think my mom is hot."

"That's it, I'm renaming Albus Severus to Arthur Sirius."

"Draco is still a douche."

"Ugh, the snake entrendres are killing me."
