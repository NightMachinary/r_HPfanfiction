The reason a lot of Death Eaters got away with their actions in the first war was because of the imperius defence. The reason they got away with the excuse was because there actually were a lot of people that did horrible things under the imperius curse. I would love to see a fic where Harry goes all: the order doesn't kill. Takes matters in his own hand and later finds out he murdered a ton of brainwashed Muggleborn. And than has to live with the guilt. (I'm aware that a lot of the order doesn't have qualms killing death eaters, but it's such a common trope in fanfiction that it would be a good way to turn the trope on it's head. That no; no mather how powerful, an 15 year old that read one paragraph about the war in a history book doesn't know more about war than actual veterans.)

Any other interesting ways you could see the imperius curse used in fanfiction that you haven't seen before?


** I really like the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] (on its face it is Dudley-has-a-magical-daughter story, but it is a way different from anything you read in the post-war world), and it has very creative way of using the Imperius curse and make it sufficiently disgusting (no, don't worry, no sexploitation).
