I am looking for a fix where Ginny helps the Order get into Tom's head and understand the way he thinks. She remembers Tom's thought process from when he possessed her in her first year. I am hoping to find one that either starts during the summer after The Goblet of Fire or maybe after the Ministry finds out that Voldemort is back. I am also hoping that Ginny is powerful or just generally competent and smart. I think it's an interesting idea and I want to see it explored so let me know if you know of any fics like that.
