If a witch or wizard takes Polyjuice Potion with a Muggle's hair can they still do magic?

If a Muggle is given Polyjuice Potion to disguise themself as a witch or wizard can they do magic?

Does the person taking Polyjuice have better control over their magic with the wand of the person they're disguised as?


** It changes your appearance and voice, that's all.

*** It changes your eyesight, which is probably genetic, and magic is a gene too according to a 2007 interview, so it may actually turn a muggle into a wizard.

**** Not really genetic, it just physically duplicates their eyes.

** It has no influence on one's magic: Harry and Ron polyjuiced as Crabbe and Goyle were still Harry and Ron in terms of magic (and their knowledges about it). Ditto in the Battle of Seven Potters: Fleur polyjuiced as Harry was still Fleur in terms of anything else than her appearance and voice. So polyjuiced Muggle would still have no magical power, and contrary Fleur polyjuiced as a Muggle (what a pitty!) would be still a full-powered witch.
