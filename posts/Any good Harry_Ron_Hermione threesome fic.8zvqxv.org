I'm not sure how but I have a sudden craving for fics featuring this threesome. Turns out that the good ones are harder to find than I had expected. I'd prefer ones that don't focus on smut but rather on either plot or romance, but a bit of smut here and there isn't a turn-off for me, thanks.


** They're a threesome in my AU story "Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water". No smut though, and the relationship is established at the start of the story.

** I offer [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8sk8m4/lf_fics_with_good_polyamory/e13e9ey/][this]] reply i made in a thread asking for good poly fiction.

I wonder where exactly you have been digging around. Has this [[https://blaze-faula.livejournal.com/26062.html][list]] popped up in your search?

The thing about Harry/Ron/Hermione or Trioship is that its heyday is past gone. A lot of work was done on alternative fansites that have since shut down or on Livejournals, where there is not one central database. I sincerely hope that you get to enjoy as many Triofics as possible and see how Harry/Hermione/Ron complement each other
