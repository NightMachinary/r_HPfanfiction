I've trawled through a number of fics, but the only one of any real quality is Little0bird's fantastic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day.]]

I'll take any sort of mood: fluffy, angsty or anything in between so long as it is actually well written.


** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129968][These Cuts I Have]] by Melindaleo is pretty good. It gets a bit silly towards the end, as I think most of these fics end up doing in order to create a plot, but certainly the first half I think is brilliant. Ron's characterisation in particular is spot on.

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

  Healing takes time. “You've been the Boy Who Lived your whole life.” said Hermione gently. “And you've never enjoyed it. You can finally relax, now, Harry. You can be whoever you want Harry Potter to be.”“Where the hell am I supposed to go from here?”“We'll figure it out.” said Ron. “That's kinda our thing.”(post deathly hallows. canon compliant)

** linkffn(5486257) Grave days by Northumbrian. All of his stories are set in the same universe and they are pretty good. Grave Days starts the morning after the battle.

  The Battle of Hogwarts is over. The following day Harry wakes to a changed world, to a future he did not think he would have. This is a story about those first days after the battle. Days of mourning and funerals. Grave Days.
