I've seen so many people swear by this fic, it's like the Holy Grail of fics in certain circles, and I'm curious why that's the case. I tried to read it once and it didn't seem like something I'd be interested in so I gave up, and in any other case I'd forget about it but I keep seeing it get recommended.

I guess my question is, what's the reason it's so popular, and should I try once again to read it? Would it be worth it?


** It's definitely not for everyone. I appreciate you giving it a try, though ðŸ˜Š

** You know how everyone complains that media is silly love stories and there isn't enough wholesome friendship? Well, here's some wholesome friendship, 715,000 words of it.

** Good world building, and a fantastic 3 or 4 act arc.

It's one of those stories that I skip the smut to get more plot.

One of the most important parts is the fact that it's an epic story that is fully finished and resolved as well.

** It's a Hermione-centric fic that has some writing style, romance, and a big storyline that ties up well (and you sort of know how it ends the whole time). You also get to see great relationship building with the Marauders. And it has decent smut. And a slow burn. And time travel. All of those are like hitting bingo in HP fanfic haha

I enjoyed the fic once I got past the beginning, but not as much as others because Hermione and Remus' relationship felt more natural and like they had a better connection to me, so by the time she and Sirius got together, I wasn't into it.

** Cohesive and detailed romance and plenty of people love reading about the Maraudrs era. Also impressive because it's finsihed and the ending is good (although expected). I've always wondered if it might be best enjoyed by Hermione fans (or general female protagonist fans) as both Remus and Sirius are a bit strange in my opinion, more like characters from an edgy werewolfy romcom than from Harry Potter in this fic. Sirius in particular comes off as quite unreasonable/unliekable at times, so might not be the best fic if you're a fan of him.

** Oh gosh it's been a while since I read Debt of Time. I think it checks off a lot of the right boxes for some people. Time travelling, romance, Hermione-centric, Marauder era, Hermione/Sirius, great world building.

It's also well written, long and complete.

** I tried reading this, gave up after I read about Hermione's decisions. It's so utterly bizarre and OOC, not to mention retarded that I couldn't continue.

The dynamics of the relationship between Hermione, Sirius and Remus is a completely different clusterfuck. The author has very little idea how teenage boys think and behave. From the looks of it, the audience doesn't have much of an idea either.
