Seeing as there is some conversation on the topic, I will give you my /very/ brief explanation, as a... dabbler in sports science. And I like taking things too seriously.

Some Vocab:

Hypertrophy is the expansion of an organ. Used here, it will indicate the muscle belly expanding, or new fibers being created.

Toning is just the ratio of muscle to fat. Leaner? More toned. Less lean? Less toned. It's a body composition term. You don't have toned muscles, you have a toned body. Doing more repetitions will not make toned muscles.

Isometric contractions are where the muscle is contracting, but the muscle fibre stays the same length. Carrying a box for example. Your biceps are contracting, but they maintain the same level of contraction, rather than going through a full range of motion.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I will be addressing the issue under the theory that you have to actively hold onto your broom, but extra force for turning is not needed. We're told Harry thinks to turn, and from a physics perspective, this makes more sense than pulling on a stick to go in a different direction. In a plane, pulling on a stick changes the shape of the wings, which gives leverage, which changes the direction. On a broom, you'd be pulling a straight stick. Additionally, the brooms will be the brooms from the movies, which have a seat and stirrups.

We'd expect to see Quidditch players to have physiques most similar to race car drivers. In both sports, you want to keep your body capable of taking constant g-forces. They'd also try to keep as light as possible, as reducing weight allows for quicker turning and better control on a broom, and in a car, does lots of technical things other people can explain better than I. They also have a lot in common with motorcycle racing, as their body positioning more closely resembles it. The two sports don't differ in their physical requirements though. However, as we don't know the speeds reached during the average Quidditch match, we can't be certain about the Gs encountered, though it seems likely that it's less than in Formula 1. Just to note, a seeker's build is small. Small is good as they are required to be the most aerodynamic. Harry is short.

The actual riding of the broom would not have that much of an effect on their physique. We'd mostly see some isometric work on the muscles responsible for keeping the body in position. The throwing, hitting, and catching would likely cause much more of an impact on the upper body. The kinetic chain involved in throwing and batting heavily involves the shoulder and obliques initiating the rotation, so we might see more development there. For seekers there would be little of this development, keepers and chasers would have about the same, and beaters would need to produce the most force.

Racers do not have that much of an impact on their physique from driving alone. What causes their physique is outside training. In professional-level Quidditch, with outside training, I think we'd see a physique very similar to most Formula 1 competitors, with a bit more development in the shoulder musculature, bearing similarity to a pitcher. For an average height player, about 77.2kg(about 170lb), which is the average weight for most football players, and they'd body fat ranging from 8-12%, which is an approximation of the body fat of formula 1 drivers.

On a school level player, who we have no indication of engaging in outside training, we would see very little of the whole body development that comes from the additional resistance training, and see more of a build-up in the arm musculature as well as the core. If we imagine them all taking it seriously, we'd likely also see some level of weight manipulation, so they'd likely keep a lower body fat level. Probably less leg development, but that's what the stairs are for. This has been my Ted Talk. We will now open to a Q&A.

Quick note: Harry does lots of manual labor, which might very well give him more muscular development. With his low level of food, he might keep a more ripped physique.

Harry's a bit scrawny in first year, but later on, after he's hit puberty, he's roughly the same height as his dad was at the same age (pensive memories), and James is noted as being "tall" by several people.

*** Another height comparison-- in GoF Narcissa Malfoy is described as "tall"... by HBP Harry e is "as tall as she" is in the clothes shop scene. For a woman to be described as noticeably tall offhand, I'd guess over 5'9", so my estimate is that Harry is at least this height at 16. Approaching 6ft by adulthood seems plausible.

So Ginny wasn't one of the Potters like I thought she was (though I am pretty sure there are other quotes that show that she is shorter than Harry). But since everyone's height changes were mentioned except for Fleur's and her hair changes were still mentioned, I think it's still safe to say that she's about the same height as Harry.

****** I was looking up if malnutrition stunts growth for a fic I was writing a long time back and I remember coming across a medical paper that said that height and bone density and all that could still be fixed in a chronically malnourished child as long as they began receiving proper nutrition before the age of 10 or 12. So given that Harry is well fed 9 months out of the year after age 11, it probably actually works out that he grows to the proper height. The starvation periods when he's at the Dursley's would almost certainly give him stomach and digestion issues, though.

******* The reason for being able to fix those issues in a malnourished child is that they've yet to hit the initial growth spurt. Those instances of growth require material and do not repeat themselves. If Harry wasn't being properly fed until he was 10, he would not go through the proper growth phase.

We are looking at a period of time between the year before he went to Hogwarts, and the summer before his second year. Before Hogwarts, he was not getting proper nutrition to sustain a growth phase. During Hogwarts, he might be able to get the appropriate levels of nutrition to grow, but he was an eleven-year-old eating when he was finally able to. Having a higher caloric intake doesn't necessarily curb the effects of malnutrition. He'd still be fighting against a body used to sustaining itself on as little as possible, and he'd have to fix the malnourishment first. Given that in /optimal/ circumstances, we can expect a recovery time of about a month, with full care, it would be expected that a kid trying to fix the effects on his own would see a time closer to a few months. If we're /lucky,/ because it's just as likely that there would be no progress.

Remember, Harry is eating like a normal child, and Hogwarts food isn't exactly the healthiest. We're not getting optimal recovery conditions. If he managed to start the growth cycle properly though, he'd still have to deal with the second year. We're told he was given two cans of chicken soup a day. Campbell's homestyle chicken soup has 87 calories per can, and he was splitting those with Hedwig. 90 calories a day is not enough to sustain a child going through a growth spurt. That he survived the summer without any /serious/ issues is probably due to the Weasley's intervention and plot armor.

By the time he's twelve, most of the damage has already been done. After the second year, he maintains much more normal eating habits so he'd probably return to a normal growth pattern for the rest of his life. But that initial damage will have prevented him from reaching his maximum possible height. There you go. Now please, I wrote five hundred words on the physical development of Quidditch players. Read them, you're hurting my feelings guys.

******** Sorry, I apparently misrepresented the article and the age mentioned and then fell asleep.

[[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8005092/]]

TLDR for the article: malnourishment slows bone maturation, meaning growth spurts can occur later than normal. If a child from a developing world, or with Celiac's disease are adopted or are suddenly nourished, even after age 18, to about the mid twenties, they can experience complete catch-up growth and reach their full height potential, although it is also likely that they will be a bit shorter than they could have been because of something called epigenetic conditioning which is limitations set on gene expression by environmental impacts.

Harry's period of imprisonment and starvation is apparently "only" 3 days in Chamber of Secrets between his birthday and his rescue by the Weasleys very late at night on August 3 or very early in the morning of August 4 (I didn't realize it was that short a period). The last true period of starvation he endured before the events DH was the summer before Fourth year when he was only being fed a "small" quarter of a grapefruit at breakfast, although he had the foresight to write to friends and ask for food, so was at least getting some calories by eating the cakes he had received.

Camping and starving in DH likely did him no good, but starting the summer before his fifth year, he was really only spending the requisite couple of weeks with the Dursley's and was being fed by Hogwarts and Molly.

Ultimately, Harry probably would have been mostly okay and would have hit very close to his optimal height.

Also, I did read your essay on Quidditch muscles. It's a very good defense of Quidditch as as an actually physical activity and probably brings up factors, such as being able to resist the g-forces of high speed maneuvering, that people probably wouldn't have thought of.

I wanted to add that while Seekers wouldn't have a lot of the upper body strength of Beaters and Chasers, their entire gameplay centers around high-speed sprints and maneuvering, so while most of their time is spent scouting the arena for the Snitch, they probably experience the highest acceleration-, deceleration-, and g-forces of any team member during the chase for the Snitch. This means they would likely have tremendous core and grip strength.

********* The main growth phase for boys occurs between the ages 10-16. After that, it's mostly muscular and hormonal development, rather than bone growth. The summer before fourth year is really not that much of an issue compared to the period between ages 10 and 12. Overall, he'd likely return to an average growth cycle when he's fifteen, but he would lose some height from the malnutrition in his youth. Remember malnutrition is more than just calories. There are massively obese individuals who suffer from malnutrition.

Sorry, I was joking. It just seems that everyone cares about the Harry being short comment. I spent way too much time on this post, so I was losing my mind a bit.

Epigenetic conditioning is essentially all that we're describing here. Epigenetics is about the expression of genes due to the environment. People used to believe that you passed down epigenetic traits, but we moved away from that.

** But we do have some speeds on the Quidditch game!

Book 3, Chapter: /The Leaky Cauldron/: "The Firebolt has an acceleration of 150 miles an hour in 10 seconds"

Now, this /is/ still guesswork, mind you. 150 mp/h = ~241 km/h. That is insane in a regular car, although I assume your German upper tier wagons could handle it. I can further confirm this insanity by consulting a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_race_records][list of F1 records]]. The highest average race speed (winner) was at 247.586 km/h (or 153.843 mph) in the 2003 Italian Grand Prix (set by Schumacher for Ferrari). The racetrack is 5.7km long, and for the most part very straight which makes it possible to get these high averages.

It is known that the Quidditch pitch is a lot smaller than an F1 racetrack with a different objective, which means that a Seeker would likely search the field in a grid of sorts, meaning a lot of turns, stops and curves. I find it reasonable to assume that on a practical level 150 mp/h is a top speed, but not one sustainable for a match.

As for chasers: I'd argue that we could likely compare speeds of a polo (yes, golf x soccer on horses polo) match due to the coordination aspect. You don't want to get hit by other players (bludgers and opposing chasers), but progress across the field as part of a group formation. A quick [[http://www.terryconway.net/cms/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=83:polo-ponies-hardest-working-athletes-in-equine-world&catid=14:racing-columns&Itemid=10][google search]] lists the speeds at 30 mp/h, even adding 10-20 extra mp/h on that should give us a reasonable approximation.

There is also repeated mention of Harry literally pulling out of a dive or jerking his broom back upwards, so there is clearly an aspect of strain involved. Likely, due to broom anatomy flying on the same height likely poses the smallest amount of effort, but as soon as you sharpen your dives/ascents you're going to feel gravity take over (think of a roller coaster!) and the footstays and such will only have limited usefulness, which is when we're going to have that sweet sweet g-force impact.

In terms of physique I'd wager the following:

- Seekers: small, compact, slim. Built to cut down on resistance during rapid acceleration
- Chasers: Somewhat heavier, strong arms and shoulders due to quaffle handling. A good chasing formation would account for all 3 dimensions quidditch, so you should see bursts of speed and height throughout.
- Beaters: Best upper body strength & core stability considering they're swinging reinforced bats around against very fast balls. They have to have a really secure seating on their broom (and ideally, a less jerky broom too. Imagine twisting your body for a nice swing only for your broom to go "oh, you wanted to go left?")
- Keepers: well, it's the Cormac/Ron discussion isn't it? Either someone really broad who just covers mass, someone long/tall, or someone who's just extremely quick. Considering the Keeper's rather static position, I'd imagine that either or would work for the express task of covering the hoops.

** Interesting! Any thoughts on how Cardiovascular/endurance might be needed? I've seen fics where Harry starts a quidditch running club as cover for the DA's physical training. But from what you've shown here it sounds like it is mostly the upper body strength needed. I've always assumed that riding a broom also takes balance, so I wonder if pros would also do core work. Would that also be necessary for something like a [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/sloth-grip-roll/][sloth grip roll]]?

*** Generally, in racing sports, there is cardiovascular training present, but it's mainly because it's efficient for weight control. The ability to change the variables so consistently allows for better calorie calculations. Additionally, having a stronger heart is good when dealing with those levels of g-forces. It keeps blood flow more consistent. Upper body power isn't mutually exclusive from endurance, but it would likely take precedence, due to the throwing aspects of the sport. Riding a broom wouldn't require balance so much as proprioception, which is having awareness of your body's position in space. The sloth grip roll would likely require grip strength, as you're turning upside down momentarily. It's a common misconception that balance and the core are closely related, they really aren't that related. But you would certainly see core training for pros. If they are training their whole body, then core training is important for the goal of protecting oneself from the forces at play, with how core training can help protect the spine. I hope that answers the questions in an understandable way.

Zumba would be a much better cover for the DA anyhow.
