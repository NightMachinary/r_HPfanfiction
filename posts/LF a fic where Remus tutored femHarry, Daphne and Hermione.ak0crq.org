This was a fic I read a while ago, maybe in 2015/2016. Fem!Harry ran away from home and eventually meets up with Hermione and Daphne, and Remus tutors them in magic before Hogwarts. They use a little known clause in some obscure education book that allows them to skip two years worth of grades before they are Sorted. Harry and Daphne go to Slytherin and Hermione to Gryffindor as 3rd years. That's as much as I can remember, I can't find it anywhere anymore (not for the lack of searching) and I didn't have it saved.


** The fic you're looking for is Serpent Tongue by Shini-Amaryllis, but according to the author's bio page it's been taken down.
