American Dad has an episode where Stan and Francine had 'backups' for a husband/wife if either died.

It got me thinking about crack /glorious/ crack.

In Hogwarts, Harry and his close-knit friend group decide that, should the worst occur due to the inevitable War, they look after others' significant others if they die.

While Ron asks Harry to look after Hermione, that sort-of squicks them out: they see each other as a brother and sister, so to Harry it'd be like asking Ron to look after Ginny. Quickly understanding, they begin to make arrangements.

Incidentally, Malfoy and his friends overhear and make the same plan (Slytherins aren't stupid), as do some of the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs.

Unfortunately, things quickly spiral out of control as complicated webs and chains are weaved.

Some people are happy: others, jealous of not being the 'backups' of blokes/birds they fancy, try to nudge things on with both too, by either trying to cause breakups or 'accidents' .

In some, it causes them to realize the better attributes of their objective's/current paramour's friends and they switch targets (such as Lavender going for Harry) -- this also causes others to come to their friends' defense (and encourage said friends to look at others, like Hermione encouraging Harry to ask Katie Bell or even Luna or something to be his 'backup') while perusing their own 'targets', which antagonizes the ones after them, et cetera.

Chaos!

It spreads, with people thinking it's all a good idea, first through Hogsmeade, the Order, the Death-Eaters, and then Diagon.

When Remus comes to Harry, asking him to look after Tonks if he were to die, it dawns on our hero that he's unleashed a problem on Magical Britain... especially when various older politicians pretty much push through such claims as though they were legal.

Eventually it all devolves into a clusterfuck that baffles even the teachers and Voldemort -- the latter is confused why his own followers are buying into this, and why Bellatrix is looking at other Death-Eaters speculatively...


** I would read this. Purely for the Chaotic Comedy Crack factor.

I can see Harry walking around with a marble notebook, with each line being comprised of two names. Some teacher catching someone running up to him whispering at him, he whips it out and writes down a line and closes it. Then the questioning.

If we want to get really morbid, you could call it God Husband/Wife. Like God Parents, but weirder. And awkward.

** I'd go one step further for the /extra/ crack. Like, if Ron dies Harry has to look after Hermione, but if Harry /also/ dies then Neville has to. And so on and so forth.

Leads to lots of flowcharts about who's looking after who in the event of people being dead.

Hermione: "Okay, according to this, if Ron, Harry, Neville, Dean, Luna, [...goes on for a bit...], are all dead, then Ginny is looked after by... Ginny. I think we need to rework this a bit."

** "Wow, Harry, you sure scared us when you were pretending to be dead."

"Actually, I did die, for a little bit."

"...So wait, I think that means your backup clause goes into effect. But that means that Ginny is with..."

After several hours, four duels, nine on-the-spot marriages and eight and a half divorces, Harry is engaged to McGonnagal, Hermione is engaged to Peeves, Ron is engaged to Petunia Dursley, and Ginny is engaged to the Sorting Hat. Neville may or may not be engaged to the entirety of Slytherin House, Luna is engaged to Cho (but only her left side - her right is also engaged to Neville), and due to a hidden Time Turner in the Room of Requirement the Grey Lady was engaged to Flitwick for four years /before/ Voldemort's rise to power. Somehow Draco is insisting that he got it the worst of anyone. He's engaged to Pansy.

At that point, a Ministry official arrives to remind everyone that marriage contracts don't actually exist in modern Magical Britain.

**** "You mean, they DIDN'T." said Sally-Anne Perks, causing everyone present to look at her. "What? I'm muggleborn! With how little representation I have in the government and not nearly enough galleons to buy my way out if I misstep. Of course I keep up with the laws on the books."

"While I am sure you all had your own problems and stuff, there were quite a few geezers on the Wizengamot that saw the opportunity to ensure that no matter which side wins, they keep the power. And this...? The moment the first one of you died, you became cntractually obliged to be excellent to each other!"

"Think they bought it?" came from her earpiece. Sally-Anne looked behind her at the crowd of witches and wizards looking around wih fixed smiles and desperately trying to be friendly "Pretty sure they did!"

Sally-Anne smiled. She might have spent much time looking up the laws, but this? This proved she was the only one.

** This is glorious. Both the idea and the prompt.

I've once read that a trick to writing the succesful crack fiction is to take one main event, quality or universal law and adopt it as the new normal. It's fine if it spirals out of control as a web of interactions grows, as long as no one questions the initial premise. I think the trainwreck you described fits in there pretty well.

Between people genuinely trying to protect their loved ones, the politicians, the schemers, and an army of impulsive, hormonal teenagers... Yessss.....

This looks tasty, and I'd absolutely read this. Gosh darn, I'd write the heck out of this if I thought I could do it justice.
