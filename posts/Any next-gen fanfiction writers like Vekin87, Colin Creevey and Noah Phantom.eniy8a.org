** Unfortunately I've been trying to find a great next-gen series on the lines of Vekin87's or NoahPhantom's for three years now (they're both still in my top 10 overall fics) and haven't succeeded. I got through book 5 of Colin Creevey's series but if the ending is satisfying I'll pick it up again. Lippert never really appealed to me.

But since I've wasted away hours of my life trying to find the Next Great Next-Gen series, I can point you to a couple others that I liked: Slide's Ignite is a great read, there are 2 sequels which I haven't read but I'm sure they are great. A little darker than either Vekin or Noah, the characters tend towards the cartoonishness of Noah's but all of them are interesting takes compared to what people usually write.

Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity (also wrote Alexandra Quick) is recommended a lot here, pretty much the best-known and well-renowned next-gen fic there is. Not a series but really fantastic writing. For some reason I didn't really like it as much as some other people do.

There are two fics that have almost no reviews or reputation that I enjoyed a lot: Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake by sheriff1985 and The Chronicle of Halo Wiggins by Benedict Dragonpatch. The former is an extravagantly British-flavored fic which follows a Muggleborn who enters Slytherin shortly after the war; there is a sequel where he becomes a professor at Hogwarts and features Albus and co. The other one is a quite slow-moving work involving an OC who enters Hogwarts in the same class as Albus. It has great characters and towards the end it gets quite intense. There's a sequel that has six chapters before it was abandoned early last year, but those six chapters are pretty amazing.

There's an ongoing (but somewhat slowly updating) fic called the Belmont Legacy (don't have the author on my spreadsheet) which is quite nicely written. Can't remember the details but it cracked my top 20.

After this we start getting into mediocre fics, so I'll just list the ones that I've finished and thought were decent:

Nimbus Albacore: The Curse of Blood by Malkon05 - it features Filch's grandson!

House of Cards by Aebbe - there are 3 or 4 books here, largely soap-opera-esque

Betrayed by kateydidnt - super weird but kind of a must read, don't know if there's anything out there like this.

Dudley's Dilemma by kakistocrat - not great writing but I think the story was ok?

Hogwarts and the New Headmaster by ChemistKen - this was a fun read, IIRC?

The Divide by Beedle - this one's updating and kind of cute, about two twin sisters, a witch and a squib.

Dursley's Daughter by writerer - this is absolutely, insanely, the greatest "fanfic" I've ever read. It's so bad, tropey, cliched, and I had a blast of a time reading it.

I'm reviewing this and I'm pretty embarrassed at how much next gen I've read, but hopefully this helps you out and gives you some new material!

** The Stygian trilogy is excellent, not just as a next-gen fic, but as a fic in general. It's also completed.

This is the first one linkffn(8255131)

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
