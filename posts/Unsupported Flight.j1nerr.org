How do you think Unsupported flight works? Transfiguration, Charm, Jinx? Or just willing your magic?

I'm writing a fanfiction in which a reincarnated Harry will try to recreate it, so I'm trying to determine the mechanics of it.

  I'd say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven't got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall . . . unless you're supposed to put the spell on yourself ? *Maybe to give yourself extra powers?* But they're not simple spells, I mean, we haven't done any of those in class, I only know about them because I've been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . ."

  And then Harry saw him. *Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind*, without broomstick or Thestral to hold him, his snakelike face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again --

I always liked the idea that it was a self-transfiguration. Powers usually refer to something superhuman/magical and it's how the wizarding world website uses the term. Because of the description of Voldemort's flight and the hints from GoF, I think it's a self-transfiguration of a sort.

** When JK describes Voldemort as flying like smoke in the air, I always imagine that he is doing some sort of transfiguration where he changes his body into something lighter than air and then uses charms to stir himself in the desired direction. Sort of like a slower apparition.

** I like how linkffn(The Imposter Complex) does it, having it be an ancient ritual Voldemort rediscovered.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.
