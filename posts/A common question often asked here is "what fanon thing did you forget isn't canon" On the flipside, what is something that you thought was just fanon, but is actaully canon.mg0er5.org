** Most everything regarding being an Animagus. Mostly the process (the Marauders had to keep a leaf in their mouth for 30 days and nobody noticed?) but also the 'you don't get to pick what animal you turn into' aspect. Given how conveniently useful the forms both the Marauders (two to keep Lupin in check, one small and agile enough to stop the Whomping Willow) and Rita had, I'd really thought you got to pick.

*** I don't accept the Pottermore explanation of the Animagus process because it's more potions and ritual based when it's /supposed/ to be achieved by very in-depth study of transfiguration. There's one spell that's needed, but it doesn't seem like something that would highlight McGonagall's mastery of the subject.

**** If you've ever tried making corn masa from a recipe, you'll remember that the recipes are ludicrously paranoid about the hydrated lime you use to process the corn. They act like it's going to jump up and chew off your face. It's not. Hydrated lime would be bad to get in your eyes, but heck, I wouldn't want to get dried corn in my eyes either.

If you've talked to people who preserve food by canning it and learned how from parents, especially when the people live outside the US, they often use canning processes way less careful than what the USDA recommends. People used to seal jam jars by pouring melted paraffin wax on top of hot jam in a jar, and in some places, people still do. And they hardly ever die. The USDA recommendations are written so an idiot making a halfhearted attempt at following the recipe will still be fine.

And if you've ever compared lab safety guidelines to a Cody's Lab video, you'll know that an expert can often substitute skill for the precautions that guidelines recommend.

I wouldn't be shocked if the official method for becoming an Animagus has a lot of idiot-proofing and ass-covering, and a person who knows what they're doing (or is willing to accept some risk) can skip most of the difficult and time-consuming steps.

******* Further to MajinCloud's explanation Nagini is a /Maledictus/ (literally 'cursed' in Latin?). She carries a bloodline curse. She can turn into a snake, but she can only turn back into a human a certain (unknown) number of times. One day she will turn into a snake and not be able to turn back.

As an audience we don't know whether she will keep her human mind once the curse is fully realised.

Unfortunately for her, when we first meet her she is trapped in a magical circus/freakshow and is being forced to turn into a snake by the ringmaster.

One of my favourite Keira Marcos stories incorporates Nagini's story, in a tiny way, to touching effect.

People were laughing and Harry guessed that snape most be unpopular. And the twins are well liked for there pranks too. So the only people I can think of that would vote definitely no is Lily. Slytherins maybe but it depends if they liked snape or not(and maybe some pure blood/half blood bull). As far as I know he never harassed and specific Hufflepuff or Ravenclaws. And he was well liked in Gryffindor. So I mean it's technically possible.

I just keep thinking back to my 10th grade. There was this small group of popular boys in their final year. Pretty typical Football (🏈)players. They're first week they decided to haze us 10th graders. They'd grab people's binders and stomp and break them. One of these asshats was in my math class because he kept failing the courses. And even though I hated him (I can be a real Type A of person) he was still really funny, and I often would be laughing at his class clown antics.

Now before Christmas break they decided to tie up 10th years and drag them around the school. I was spared because my best friend was in the 11th grade. She was very attractive and popular herself, thus they loudly deducted I must be an 11th grade as well. I even saw them trying to hide the evidence behind a potted plant in the office. But they were barely yelled at and they got like a single detention and that was it. So idk 🤷‍♀️ for me it's a maybe

**** That is something funny. I was really surprised when I found out James had been Headboy. Because in my native language (in which I read the books for the first times), Headboy translates to something like "Head Prefect". You have Prefect, which translates to "Monitor" and the Headboy/Headgirl which translatea to '"Monitor Chefe" (and it is not a cooking lizard). So I always assumed that a Headboy/Headgirl was an outstanding Prefect. But when I found out about James, and I already knew he hadnt been a prefect I assumed otherwise. That it's like that (British?) school culture of Headboys/Headgirls being popular students or something to that effect.

Edit: grammar.

***** It's sometimes hard to translate, especially if a country does not have a school system resembling English one. In Slovenian, prefects are translated as "Student representative" which would be similar to class president and a member of student council while Head boy/Girl is translated as President/Head of student council (They are the ones that have regular meeting with headmaster, head of faculty and head of parent council).

***** There was a problem also with the translation to my native language. In /the Philosopher's Stone/ it is never told what a Head Boy/Girl actually is. As a result, the translation was "the best boy/girl". In my language titles are not capitalised, and I didn't understand that "the best boy/girl" is a title and not just a compliment. When /the Prisoner of Azkaban/ was translated, the translator knew that the Head Boy and Girl are the leaders of the prefects, and the translation was changed to "leader boy/girl", making it obvious that it is a title. (It was probably changed in later editions of PS, but I haven't read them.) James was never again mentioned being the Head Boy, and I was really confused when I read a few years ago from the Harry Potter Wiki that he had been one.

I am not a fan of Draco in general, I don't really agree with Rowling's 'he reformed' thing. He's always been a racist pissant to me, him not killing Dumbledore was more about cowardice. He didn't seem to care about nearly killing Katie or Ron.

But nevertheless, stories where he has become a good guy and Harry and Draco having to interact are hilarious.

One of my fav time travel stories actually deals with this. Harry and Draco are partners at work, they were auror partners and DoM partners or such (it's been a while). Vitriolic best buds/snarky buddies. Then an accident sends them back in time to their childhood bodies.

It's full of wonderful snark.

So, as a wizard, all you need to do is pretty much the same, though with /Evanesco/ actually lots more hygienic. It's an exaggeration of course to shit exactly where one stood regardless of whatever's going on around one, but otherwise the concept is about the same.

******** I don't think it was that common in the UK to marry at 19 or 20. Early 20s, definitely. It has crept up by today for a number of factors. But I think 19 or 20 would have caused raised eyebrows.

The marriage of Prince Charles to a then-19 year old Princess Diana, for example, in the early 80s, had a lot of talk about her age.

Anyway, I don't want to get into an argument about it. The core of my initial post which several people seem to agree with is that it's easy to forget how young Fleur is when she gets married to Bill, which suggests the text doesn't draw attention to it, which suggests either JKR was deliberately trying to skate over it, or that Fleur as written didn't read like a 19 or 20 year old young woman - the latter was my interpretation. If I hadn't remembered this and had been asked blind how Fleur came across age wise, I would have said around 22 or 23.

My parents got married in 1996 when they were 26 - definitely not old but not that young - and when I was born in 1998 my mum was considered a geriatric mother even though she hadn't turned 28 yet. So yeah I think there was still a bit of an expectation to marry and pop out kids young in the uk even in the late 90's. Obviously not everyone did but a decent enough number that it's quite clear to see the correlation.

Anyway, 19 or 20 is perfectly legal in both worlds, and Bill was officially 26 when he got married, so 20 is even acceptable under the "half age plus seven" creepiness rule.

I don't ever see Lily ever forgiving Snape after they break their friendship, she would treat him as any other Death eater. She realised she was better of without him a a friend years ago why would she allow him back into her life after that.

Lily hadn't been friends with Snape for around 6 years I don't think Lily would forgiven Snape at all, she probably never even thought of him in those 6 years unless it was bad things and she would hold the same disdain for him as any other Death eater. I wonder sometimes what some of the other muggleborn who got called mud blood by Snape thought about Lily hanging around with a racist I doubt they would think to highly of her.

#+end_quote

That is what he is redeemed for. The extent to which he was involved is debatable, as is why he joined. It has been repeatedly said that he joined to get power and get a sense of belonging. As a powerless guy who didn't have anyone except those Slytherin peeps, that's actually quite understandable.

#+begin_quote
  while claiming being in love with exact the sort of person they wanted to see dead.
#+end_quote

Well, he didn't join the DEs because he was in love with her, did he? He joined for power. This is actually the very anthesis to him obsessing over her. It's clear he was looking out for himself after school, rather than caring about Lily. It's only after he puts her in danger that he completely gives up his ambitions and promises 'Anything' to Dumbledore for her protection

It's also very debatable how much VW1 was about war against muggleborns, how much Severus knew about their goals, what they used to hook him. Regulus, for example, believed it was about wizards ruling the muggles. Black family was hoodwinked and only truly realised Voldemort's awfulness later. It's a lot to assume a half-blood whose only source of news is the prophet (lol) and his housemates who have families inside death eaters knew about the true unromanticised agenda of DEs xD

And oh, there it is. 'If he truly loved her'. Yeah. You know what he did because he 'truly loved her'? Waited infront of the gryff common room right after he'd been sexually humiliated by gryffindors and threatened to sleep there, just to get a chance to apologise. Went to Dumbledore fully expecting to be killed to warn him of the danger on potters. Promised 'Anything' in return for their protection. Agreed to keep on his miserable role in his teaching position to protect Harry, because he had her eyes, because he was her son

It's amazing that you expect him to forget all his traumas, all his circumstances and ambitions and everything just because 'uf he loved her, he wouldn't do x'. The x is not being done because of his love. It's being done because of the shitty life he's lived and the personality that results from it. The love he feels for her is not her doing. She did not love him, she married his tormentor. His love is his goodness, it's the thing that makes him want to be good in face of all of the badness all his life has predisposed him to.

To take something so pure, so inherently good and twist it beyond recognition because you can't get over how such a person could have loved so purely is so tragic.

I do think some of it may have become ideology based in 7th year, but none of them ever actually point out this as a reason even when defending their actions and trying to portray them in the most positive light possible. James also had a lot of recourse, being headboy, to handling it officially. The fact that he went behind Lily's back to do it implies that it wasn't exactly something he thought she'd approve of. If he was basically a death eater, it would be very justified, especially if it was in retaliation.

But James being headboy, having all these tools (map, cloak, animagi friends), and him not hexing Snape infront of Lily implies a lot of agency on his part. It would be retaliatory on Snapes part. So yep, justified or not, still bullying, little change

Choking, sexual assault, removing underpants to a crowd, midnight runs which resulted in people almost getting killed via werewolf and laughing afterwards, bullying people because they could, or if they annoyed them.

I know where the ideas of them being goofy bullies comes from. Mostly pre-hbp when we didn't want to believe how bad these awesome adults and Harry's father were, and didn't have the knowledge. People thought swm was the worst of it. That ww incident happened after. But no. They initiated a... torture session really, of someone minding his own business because one of them was bored after said bored guy had already almost got that killed, after the initiator had supposedly saved his life for its own sake and not for his friends. He gives the 'just because he exists' reason to someone he wants to impress /after/ that person had almost died because of his friends and while he held his dear friend's secret.

Like bruh. That's not goofing around. That's literal criminal behaviour that they are directly involved in. And they get a pass because they were rich, popular jocks who went on to join the right side in the end? That negates none of this. 15 year old James would've joined the order, that doesn't make his literal torture okay.

Don't derail the bullying discussion w/ Snape becoming a death eater. That ignored the effect the bullying and blind eye by the general of the good side would have on his decisions. It's a completely other discussion. The point of this post was james bullied Snape, and continued doing it till later. That's not something to take sides over. Its bad. What Snape became later was bad. The difference, obviously, is that James exercised his power because he was a priviliged douche with parents that doted on him and great friends who hung out with him, and Snape is a poor half-blood millrat who was sorted to the house that was a breeding ground for death eaters, had exactly one friend in teh ideologically opposite house, and the only place he felt he could find some power and sense of belonging was the death eaters. That's cult recruitment from at risk youth 101.

And it would have gotten them in trouble, most likely expelled, if it was revealed. Lupin knows that. It's why he didn't reveal that Sirius Black had an animagi form.

I've mentioned it's a very different discussion and gave you some rope with the arguments I made for why Snape joined them. Ultimately, however, we're talking about school time in this discussion, and Severus was not a death eater at this point, neither was the marauders' bullying about it. In fact, even the worst thing Sirius say about young Snape is that he was a slimy oily dark arts obsessed dude. Considering the very vague definition of dark arts themselves, that Severus seems to excels in almost all fields of magic, not just dark arts, its unclear if it's something we really should be mad at young Snape about. We also saw in dh how it started, and who exactly escalated. It's pretty clear marauders were a) bullies b)bullied Snape specifically and relentlessly c) this bullying had nothing to do with him being a death eater. Indeed, Sirius didn't even know that Snape was a death eater, even though he knew a lot of the people in Snape's group had become one.

Is it bad that he became a death eater later? Sure. Is the marauders' bullying justified for a young non de social outcast Snape? No. We're the marauders worst than the death eaters? No. We're the marauders more cruel than the death eater wannabes, atleast from the things we know about their schooltime activities? Yes.

#+begin_quote

Was it? /Choking/ someone in public because he's cussing you? What curses did Snape throw on the marauders, exactly? A small cutting curse that cut James' cheek after he'd hung him upside down in public, refused to let him down, blackmailed Lily, choked him, dropped him on his head unceremoniously? After literal torture? That's mild af. I'm very surprised that the marauders had all their body parts attached. That shows serious restraint on Snapes part, lmao. Young sev was making bloody toenail hexes and privacy spells before he felt powerless and desperate enough to make the very emphatically signed 'for enemies' sectumsempra.

Bruh, don't defend James on the torture bit. Literally impossible. You'll just end up doing a lot of whataboutism for which there is no evidence, only your speculation.

How dare baby Snape /snort/ at James' antics lmfao. The nerve of him to contradict a rich boy who's been pampered all his life 😂

You'd also notice that James started the physical bullying by sticking his leg out and either him or Sirius christening him Snivellus because he turned away from the fight when Lily implored him. But first, it'll be enough for you to just notice who butted in first, lmfao 🤣

The implication seems to be that James calmed down, stopped hexing other people but Snape attacked this time and James retaliated. Depends on how much you want to take Remus and Sirius' word for it though.

And Harry asks if Lily was okay with that, Sirius says " she didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth. I mean, James didn't take Snape on dates with her and hex in front of her, did he?"

But to be fair, that are the only ones and the Black family tree is so old that three with a middle name don't matter, because all the others don't have one. At least nit a revealed one

Which is it? You can't have both.

**** I'm not quite sure what you mean. If I don't enjoy a fic because it's low quality or I'm just not into it, I stop reading it. In fact, I have pretty much enjoyed every fic I've read and I continue reading them over and over because I enjoy them so much. So I generally don't understand how this is about how the quality is? /g

Also I was just answering a question that someone asked everyone in this sub. I honestly feel really judged and quite a bit upset, in fact more than that, because I don't think I said anything that would upset anyone. All I wanted yo do was join in and give my answer:( /g
