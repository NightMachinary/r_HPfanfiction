** Honestly, if I opened a first chapter and read about the new unforgiveable curse, I'd probably click out. My brain immediately jumps to Gary Stu.

A villain needs to be incredibly powerful, so a reader can see why he's amassed his following, how he conquered the world and why he appears unstoppable. So, I could see that, but he doesn't have to be stronger than Voldemort or Dumbledore to do that. Plus, If I read the unforgivable curse thing it would be way too much to swallow. That one spell essentially negates all eight books and makes Voldemort a very weak villian.

tbh Voldemort (and other wizards) seem to be incredibly ignorant and unimaginative in canon:

-why didn't Ron transfigured a new robe?

-couldn't Tom use less flashy horcruxs or is he that arrogant?

-couldn't Tom just throw Harry threw a window?

Also yeah I wont talk about the curse until much later

**** I kind of agree that it seems like magic, and especially transfiguration, should be able to solve most money problems your last two point are kind of silly. Yes a perfectly logical Voldemort would make less flashy horcruxes the last two books are pretty much dedicated to the fact that yes Tom is that arrogant and conceited and would only accept objects of importance to him and/or the wizarding world to hold part of his soul. And why would Voldemort throw Harry out the window? The Killing Curse had never been blocked before and is the perfect tool for murdering people instantly, using it makes total sense. Deciding to kill his prophesised foe in a less perfect way would be silly. The only different choice I can see is him deciding to use a more brutal method.

**** For point two, he is a narcissist. Honestly, if I ever made a Horcrux, it would go into something that mattered. Who knows, maybe you have to use something with a connection. Horcruxes were never really explained, just that they were foul magic.

For point three, why? The Killing Curse works. Harry just had plot armour.

  He manage to conquered the whole wizarding and muggle world by excessive use of imperius curse, polyjuice and destruction of food stockpiles.
#+end_quote

This is probably fine if written convincingly, JKR was writing kids books, and so didn't spend much time fleshing out how the wizarding world actually works, which is fine, but does create an environment where most things are either oversimplified (there's /one/ prison for the whole country?) or convoluted for the sake of being 'magical', (eg all fo Dumbledore's titles and the wizarding currency system). In short, a sufficiently intelligent antagonist could easily topple the whole thing.

#+begin_quote
  he creates a 4th unforgivables curse that can destroy someone's soul (they can't come back as ghost, they can't go to the afterlife and it can destroy a horcrux without damaging the said object).
#+end_quote

This would be hard to write well. While I'm a believer that any trope can be written convincingly, some are harder than others, and this boils down to "my character has invented a spell that's basically the killing curse, but it's better because it works on Horcruxes and kills them so hard they don't even get to be ghosts". Personally, I think this would make them too much of a Gary Stu.

#+begin_quote
  weather control.
#+end_quote

I don't think weather magic has ever actually been touched on in canon, so this could be fairly interesting if it's applied in a unique way. The key would be to make it subtle, eg perhaps creating a rainstorm above Hogsmede, so the kids stay in the castle and your guy can do his shady dealings in peace, rather than calling down lightning from the sky, killing tens of people in seconds.

If you really want to make him more powerful the Dumbles and Tom, I think the most convincing way is to just make him roughly the same power level, but Dumbledore is old, and Tom has damaged himself too much with his dark arts, while your guy has youth and vitality on his side.

I liked how in canon the only option was complete magical destruction, which had like two methods, basilisk venom or fiendfyre (and also Dumbledore's convoluted sacrifice method, I guess).

If you really want the diadem intact, I suppose you could say that what Tom actually found was a prototype, and the real diadem is still out there? Or perhaps lobbing it through the veil of death removed the soul piece while the diadem sails through unharmed?

****** Again, my personal preference is that magic and science don't mix. It's like trying to use classical mechanics to solve quantum problems, it just doesn't work.

Melding magic and science would require the creation of a new branch of science, with exceptions to most of the major universal laws and constants we use today. It could be done, but similar to how quantum theory developed, you need many years, and hundreds of the world's best minds working on it, it's not something a teenager should be able to do over the course of their 7 years at Hogwarts.

******* Because I always love the idea that magic is inherently antithetical to the scientific method, i have the following head-canon. Beyond “this spell does this thing” it becomes inconsistent and unreproducible. Two independent scientists could perform the same experiments with the same criteria and get wildly differing results.

Just because 1+1=2 doesn't mean that 2-1=1 once magic gets involved. And this is why muggle technology doesn't work in Hogwarts, because the principals upon wich they work are not constants around magic. Something (relatively) simple like a mechanical watch still works because the weirdness around science is barely noticeable when a gear ratio isn't the same stepping down as it is stepping up, as now it simply takes the second hand 1.0003 seconds to move one second and 0.995 seconds to move the next, it would take years for it to be noticeably incorrect, while some5hing electrical would just stop working the moment electrons started behaving like photons.

Much like how photons switch between waveforms and particles when observed, so too does magic, switching between reliable and wildly inconsistent as you try to understand it's mechanics. If you managed to break down the whys of magic using latin, and discovered that it was some inherent magical property of latin that causes words in it to cause effects, suddenly all your spells require gibberish incantations, for entirely different reasons, if you work it out, suddenly magic only works through gestures if you remain absolutely silent, for a completely different third set of reasons.

Basically i head-canon that magic is actually magic, and not a heretofore undiscovered part of physics.

Which after i typed all that out i realise it's probably not relevant or helpful, but i'm going to post it anyway because i think people may find it interesting.

******** Fair enough, it's really something I've given much thought to tbh. I would be careful to keep it to basic and/or crude inventions to start with, and they should have some disadvantages when compared to using purely Muggle or purely magical weapons. For example, even during the early years of the 19th century, man for man, longbowmen were better than musket infantry, they had a much higher rate of fire and were, on occasion, more accurate. The reasons muskets became more popular was because you could train a peasant to use a musket in a few months, while a longbowman needed to have practiced every week since he was 10.

Another thing to consider, it is much easier to reverse engineer tech than to invent it from scratch, anything your main guy invents will be eventually used against, firstly from captured weapons, and later from one's they've manufactured themselves, having cracked the secrets.

This is hard, because it means the writer has to be smart enough to write a cunning villain convincingly, but a villain who was smarter/less unstable than Voldie, but more ruthless and less restrained than Dumbledore, could do more damage with a comparable amount of power.

Using disguises and mind-control to stealthily take power, rather than doing so openly, could fit with that.

Why not? If that's the scale of power you're taking your cast to, then go for that scale of power. If you're only taking Tim the dark lord to that level and it's an un achievable feat by others even if he was to share the knowledge and skills, THEN it becomes an issue.

** I'm calling your OC Tim as i need a name.

Why do you need a 4th unforgivable to do this? Just let the killing curse destroy horcrux soul fragments without destroying the item. Make it like the cruciatus, you have to want to murder the target, not just kill them in a fight, but take them in their weakest moment and murder them. Make it so it doesn't work as a mercy, you can't have any intention but an outright desire to kill them without giving them any chance to defend themselves. It doesn't contradict canon, and in fact complements what we know of the cruciatus, and gives us a viable reason for why our heroes did't use this method in canon and won't turn people off your story. Honestly, 4th unforgivable sounds like rather imature writing, the kind of thing on tier with renaming harry into harridan because you think harry sounds too normal.

Well approached, the idea of weather control is great! Especially if introduced slowly, have it as a plot point, make it something people have been working on for a long time, introduce a character allied wi5 the heroes who's close to a breakthrough, but has had their notes stolen by a rival, who's part of the dark lord Tim's cult. Give our heroes access to it as the final confrontation approaches, not a great control, but enough to prevent Tim from controlling the battlefield. Trickle the power into the heroes slowly, a lightning bolt spell that's from a failed atempt at weather control. Then something that sorinkles water on an area. A spell they dismiss as an area version of a banisher that actually creates wind, then they start realising it all relates and they can combine the spells to create weather, before they learn proper weather control spells in time for the final fight, maybe even just having a breakthrough during the final fight because they need something to counter Tim's tornado with thunderbolts. Basically, make sure all the pieces are there, and Tim is just the first one to put them together.

** HP is a kid's book at it's core.

That means there are inherent plot holes that /have/ to exist or the story simply can't function. JKR never had to consider the amount of rape that would happen at hogwarts from the magic she invented and the characters she created, because it's a kid's book. As an example. If bullying goes ignored, by logic, it'd be easy for the literal villains in slytherin to get an older graudate to teach them memory magic and have free reign over the other houses.

Another more relevant example to you is that it's a kid's book it ignores the reality of the real world. Like say how easy it would be for even a moderately strong wizard to wipe out a food supply.

Use imperious on muggles and you have a fighting force that has no resistance to it and yet can do quite a bit of damage given that wizards are effectively mortal without wands or without even reaction speed/preparation 99% of the time.

Now, if you tackle the plot holes without considering /why/ they exist, then your story will probably be unreadable.

** My question would be... /why/?

What is the benefit to your story of making this villain be more powerful than Voldemort and Dumbledore - rather than being more threatening through better use of his tools, through a better organization, etc?

For your specifics, point 1 does not presuppose that he's stronger - just that he's more strategically apt and willing to use the tools at his disposal - and, seemingly, has a good organization at his backing.

For the 4th unforgivable, I don't really see the point of it. I dislike it - I'd much rather see something like that handled with a ritual.

Similarly, weather control heavily depends on the form you have it take. Just casting a charm and easily controlling everything about the weather? No thanks. A complicated ritual that takes a while to setup? Much more palatable. Etc, etc.

Personally, I don't think a villain needs to be more powerful than Voldemort or Dumbledore to be a threat - and just relying on power is pretty lazy. It's far more interesting to take some other avenues to being scary - just like how Voldemort is at his most threatening and scary, not when he's at his own personal most powerful, but when he's got his legion of followers and his planning to take over the entire ministry/government.

That water bubble dumbles did on voldy + glacius + wingardium leviosa = another suffocation

If opponent likes to dodge then send a spell at him and two to his sides so he'll dodge straight into a spell

Accio something behind opponent, might give concussion

Smoke screen and send spells through

Or some other similar combinations, maybe even some spells that cant be shielded (villain is creative = probably smart = can make own spells)

** I wouldn't necessarily give them too many crazy abilities, but rather make them more powerful by using existing abilities more effectively. For example, Harry is about to return to the Dursleys when suddenly out of nowhere the entire house blows up, and if Harry hadn't been delayed he would've been just as dead as his smoldering relatives. No crazy powerful dark curse capable of breaking through the power of love, but rather something as simple as a sabotaged gas pipe. If the enemy is capable of attacking in a completely unexpected manner at any moment, they're much scarier than someone who throws around Avadas at the end of the schoolyear.

** Hello! Personally, I like your idea..

But I think that if you want to make your villain better than Dumbledore or Voldemort, then you have to make him have characteristics that the two lack.

What I mean is, for example, Dumbledore is extremely strong and a genius. But, he strictly uses light and sometimes grey magic and does not touch dark spells. He is also shown to not want to kill people.

On the other hand , Voldemort, while also being very powerful and smart, is ridiculously unstable and somewhat obsessive.

I feel that if you are writing a villain who is better than the two, you need to turn both their reluctances into the new villains characteristics. Make him/her ruthless- they don't think twice to kill somebody if it means a personal gain. Make them charismatic- make him somebody that you wouldn't have even thought was possible of committing such crimes and still find it hard to believe because when you interacted with him, he was so nice and charming. Make them young- somebody who can relate to the youth and at first look, is considered to be harmless. Make them good-looking- people find it harder to dislike somebody who is physically attractive. Don't make him unstable. Make him smart. And if he would have gone to Hogwarts, make him a hufflepuff- sorry to be stereotypical, but that is the least suspecting house where you would expect a Dark Lord to come out of; plus loyal minions!

I like the idea of using food-stalks as leverage for the population to do his bidding and the use of weather charms... You can also make him monopolise some potions or something on the markets.

If you've seen the second Sherlock Holmes movie with RDJ starring, then we learn that James Moriaty was planning to start a war and monopolise all the first-aid and weapons. That way, whether it would be for medicine or arms, he was the only person you could come to, making the world completely dependent on him.

You could do a similar line. Perhaps release a virus, with only the new dark Lord having a cure to it? Or with the food supplies maybe. Damage the world's/region's stock. He/She is the only supplier.

Make everybody completely dependent on him/her.

No offence, but the forth unforgivable idea is a little... too much. (Sorry). In that context, you can really make use of obliviation spells as well.

This idea is quite nice. Perhaps Dumbledore and Voldemort will have to team up or something? IDK, it sounds cool though. Just be careful not to make hm overly too Gary Stu.

If you need more ideas, then I would respectfully suggest watching movies with these types of villains (Mission Impossible, Sherlock Holmes, etc.)

** I think you're on the right path. You write him by being smart. As Goblins say in every trope-riddled fic, /wizards are idiots./ One, even slightly above average, witch or wizard could take over the world in less than a year if they have a well functioning brain.

Also, play a lot on subtlety. Him marching into Paris with a giant storm behind him won't be very realistic. You need a Palpatine, not a Vader.

​

Edit: If you develop the Wizarding World, make sure your MC can out-smart it in realistic ways. The canon Wizarding world is a mess that should barely function. Probably the easiest world in literature to exploit and eventually take over. If you leave it like that, good. But if you actually revamp it into something competent, make sure to have your MC act accordingly.

​

Edit. 2: There are a crap ton of unique and interesting ways for a wizard/witch to exploit the WW and make themselves OP. In terms of magical strength, physical strength, looks, agility, wealth, etc. Whatever you do, just dont have your MC go into Gringotts and leave out inheriting half the Wizengamot.
