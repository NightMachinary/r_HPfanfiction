** One thing I wonder about the idea that dangerous events would immediately result in school closure - how many schools in the US close (permanently) following a school shooting?

I mean, there are (sadly far too many) instances of schoolkids being killed in the US, but I don't hear about those schools being shut down afterwards.

Why would Hogwarts be held to such a different standard? Particularly when it appears to be the /only/ school for British magical children.

*** There's a difference between a one-off and a persistent threat. A school shooting is a one-off event. If there's a serial killer operating on school grounds (much closer analogy to a basilisk), then they'll for sure close the school until they caught him or significantly upgraded security.

**** Looking at the figures, I think it's questionable to argue that school shootings in the USA are "one off events", but other than that, what you argue should have happened is what was happening.

The school was about to be closed, and all the students sent home, when Harry went into the Chamber.

That was because they had the first student whose life was directly in danger, and until Harry was able to explain events, no-one actually knew that a basilisk was involved at all - because the victims all were petrified.
