I'm looking for a Next Gen fic that has a lot of the children of the OG going through their Hogwarts year? All I've seen is usually pairing fic, which is fine by me but I also want a lot of character study/character development and just all the cinnamon rolls being friends with each other create havoc.


** The best NextGen stories I know about are:

1. linkao3(373224) ... Albus, Rose, and Scorpius are all Ravenclaws (to the mild or not so mild horror of their parents), nice Bildungsroman with a adventure twist in the end.

2. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] is whole eight novel series, and probably by far the best dudleys-daughter-is-a-witch story (very original, and a way more than just that). Contains some of the most horrific scenes I have ever read (but I am probably weird), “1984 with Dementors” and great use of “The White Cliffs of Dover”, great castaway type of story, very strange version of Harry Potter, and much much more.

3. Just finished reading linkffn(8255131) and I liked it very much for its following Aristotelian Unities (see [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/harry-potter-and-aristotle.html][my blogpost]] for what I mean by it) and relative brevity (highly appreciated, most fanfiction stories are horribly thin and I would say at least 80 % of stories could be cut in half without a problem). I fear very much that its sequels won't be that good.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
