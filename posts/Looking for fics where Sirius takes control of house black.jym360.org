Hi! I am looking for fics where Sirius takes control of house black. Or fics where the Tonkes are welcomed back to the house of black?

Thanks for your help.


** For the Love of Sirius linkffn(11573511)

Kinda sorta, Sirius agrees to rejoin the family and become heir. Set immediately after Voldemort's attack on the Potters. Sirius wants custody of Harry, and Grandfather has the very best lawyers.

  What if adults acted like adults? If they take responsibility, don't get distracted by revenge, build capable governments, and don't try to hold three full time vitally important jobs at the same time: result? Shit gets done. Sirius raises Harry; Dumbledore is awesome; the Blacks are possibly awesomer; the Ministry is functional, and Lupin gets a very interesting job.

** I'm interested to know as well. I love fics where Sirius takes control of the house of Black. Bonus points if he accepts a bit of his dark heritage

** FYI you want the "Request" flair; "What's that fic?" is more for "I read/heard about this fic once but can't find it again" sort of things.

Anyway, linkffn(A Marauder's Plan) has what you're looking for.

** I can think of a few where the story is Harry-centric, and Sirius did it to help him.

"Family Magic" by BeepKeeper linkffn(13370792). Not Weasley friendly in the least. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13370792/1/Family-Magic]]

"Power of the Press" by Bobmin356 linkffn(8831374). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/1/The-Power-of-the-Press]]

"Reclaiming the House of Black" by Fairywm linkffn(11811498). Currently on brief hiatus due to the author having medical issues. Hopefully picked up again by the new year.

edit: messed up the formatting and it looks like the bot won't add the links now. So I did.

  Tired of the way he and his godson are treated, Sirius takes a stand and reclaims his house. No longer will he let others rule his life. Molly, and others, get a smack down. No longer a one-shot.On hiatus due to illness.
