I'm getting quite tired of seeing fics with Ron just being shown as a complete douche who actually doesn't care about Harry. I understand he is probably the most childish of the trio but he still cares about them. I want fics with a Ron who isn't bashed and stays consistently with Harry as a friend.

I want to make it explicitly clear that this is pulled directly from the author's notes, and that I am not the author, because I wasn't clear enough when I posted this on a different thread and got praise I don't deserve.

  Second, I also wanted to write something without completely hating or cutting out Ron. The idea of him being a part of the story is thanks to several stories I read.

  More and more, this evolved into the concept of trying to write a Ronald Weasley that wasn't an idiot, that wasn't after Harry's gold, and that wasn't the boring cliche he's turned into in most stories these days. Chilord's Sekrit project was a significant inspiration. It certainly got fun to write after a while, but I don't believe we've agreed upon whom we could possibly pair him with. The idea of Hermione following them across words, appearing with her fist on her hip and waving a finger at the two of them was appealing for about two seconds, but I'm pretty sure that won't be happening in this story quite like that.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: If you don't mind sci-fi AUs, you will find it a great read. The Trio is totally awesome and Ron is a model boyfriend here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]]: A more brave and cunning Lucius Malfoy managed to take over Magical Britain after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore evacuated to France with his remaining followers, but they would have their revenge 18 years later. The main story is about Ron and Hermione, and their challenges in a brutal three sided war.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]: After being failed again, Harry and his friends declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. Interestingly, Ron and George, not Hermione, are his most resolute supporters right from the beginning.

*** I have some opinions for the Sum of Their Parts, I read a few chapters and I thought got me to stop reading because what they're doing is stupidly reckless. I mean, Potter is an ancient and noble house even if they aren't in the 28, they have a Wizengamot seat. And Sirius left him all the Black fortune stuff, well, you know that the Blacks are the strongest of all 28 ancient and noble houses, combined with the Potter fortune they can build a literal political empire. Harry could've easily used his Slytherin side, accept the god damn blasted seat, and vote to kick those 3 dark houses out of Wizenmagot, and enough of bribery would be able to kick them out of the Ministry, as well as do a thorough investigation about their finances and statuses. It will get them kicked out of the Minsitry and their spies inside would be revealed too, isn't this a better way of doing things?

** First off, second "The Sum of Their parts" and "The Red Knight", linked elsewhere in this thread.

I also seem to recall Weres Harry having an interesting Ron, with Daphne's father being coach for the Canons... linkffn(8106168)

If you have any interest in reading Harmony pairings, it is very hard to find them with a decent Ron. For Hogwarts era fics, it is quite rare, usually the best you can hope for is him simply being put on a bus.

You have massively AU fics (Harry grew up with the Weasleys! Hermione was sorted into Slytherin!) that can easily fit the bill.

For more Canon compliant fics, they basically have to diverge forth year or earlier. Starting fifth year the "Ron's insecurity over his relationship with the trio" has been so established that any h/hr is gonna portray him negatively. Or at least require a lot of character development to work through the issue, something most h/hr fics do not want to give the character.

Only one that comes to mind is:

Stages Of Hope is AU H/Hr with positive treatment of all Canon protagonists (Ron, Luna, Neville) linkffn(6892925)

Edit: Nope! I had seemed to recall Ron being in it but he isn't. Well, not alive anyway.

They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house.

** I'm kinda embarrassed to recommend this, honestly, but Linkffn(Blood of the Phoenix) has Ron as the strategist of the group. It seems to have consciously shifted a lot of the flak Ron usually gets to Hermione, instead, though, so it's not as if it's free of bashing.

** Just finished reading this one-shot, set post DH:

linkffn(Number Games by jbern)

For longer fics with a nonbashed Ron, I really like the ones where he goes back in time.

linkffn(the cost of time travel) has an adult Ron who travels back in time but would much rather remain in the future. Has some interesting ideas, especially in the later chapters. Sadly abandoned.

linkffn(The Red Knight) Is a WIP with a similar premise, except that Ron doesn't end up in the same universe that he came from. Decent writing quality.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]) is Harry-centric, but Ron is loyal to him to the core. Cracky. Very Cracky. Also complete!
