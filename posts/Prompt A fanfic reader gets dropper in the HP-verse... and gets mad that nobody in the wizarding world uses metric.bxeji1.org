** I still think that the Wizard's monetary system was a goblin revenge plot and that it was deliberately designed to be as difficult to use as possible . Imagine trying to balance a checkbook with gallons, sickles, and knuts.

*** I've seen a theory before that there is magical significance to using prime numbers, perhaps improving stability (which might help to prevent coins from being defaced or counterfeited).

***** They would all be freely using electronics, if it wasn't for the corruption and collusion of Big Enchanting with deeply compromised ministry elements, dating back to a trail of conspiracy after what the muggles call "the Great War".

Thankfully, the Rotfang movement is working to tear this house of cards down from within.

** Makes a bit of sense. Measure must be crazy since the wizarding world separation predates Napoleon who imposed the metric with all his conquests making it the continental standard.

That could be a major point of contention between the muggleborn and the magicborn

***** No, imperial units are still somewhat common in the UK. We officially use miles for distance and miles per hour for speed limits, and measuring your height in feet is still common

*** I don't think Napoleon imposed metric on the UK. A little thing called the Napoleonic Wars saw the that. It wasn't until the 1960s that the UK seriously started implementing the metric system and, even there, imperial measurements continue to exist in parallel in everyday life, even to day.
