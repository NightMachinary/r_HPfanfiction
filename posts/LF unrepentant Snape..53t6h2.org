Ok, so Snape's whole reason for going turncoat was to protect Lily. But what if Snape no longer cared? What if he'd decided she was lost to him anyway, since she went with Potter, and perhaps even found someone else among the slytherins/ death eaters?

Result: Snape doesn't go crying to Dumbledore, or even bothers to ask Voldemort to spare Lily. Voldemort kills the Potters with minimal resistance, Snape and Petigrew both rise high within the ranks of the Death Eaters and the wizarding world looks very different.


** Interesting premise, but I think it will be a bit problematic. Snape will be definitely OOC, and I don't think Pettigrew would have risen far in Voldemort's ranks anyways (despite Voldemort not having many followers at the time anyways).

*** I've seen quite a few OOC Pettigrew.

** linkffn(The Green Girl) has a Snape that questions himself, but he's not at the center of the story and I didn't like that fic that much. It was interesting and different from what I usually read, but nothing spectacular. Sorry, I'm not very usefull !
