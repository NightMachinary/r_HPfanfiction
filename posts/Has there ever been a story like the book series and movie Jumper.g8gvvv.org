Harry figures out how to apparate and just leaves as a kid.


** Crap I remember reading a fic like that! It was pretty good but I read it ages ago and I've never been one for writing down fic names. Sorry.

But I also really like this idea! I read the book and watched the Jumper movie ages ago.

RemindMe!

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
