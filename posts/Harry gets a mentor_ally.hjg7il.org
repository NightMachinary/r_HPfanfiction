I would like to read more fics starting in the 4th, 5th or 6th year, were Harry gets a powerful mentor/ally/friend/guardian like for example Amelia Bones or the Delacours. Sirius if alive should get a trial and the Dursley's should be dealt with, at least Harry shouldn't have to stay with them and Dumbledore should at the very least open up a bit to Harry. The relationship/s can be any number of partners but no M/M

Examples of fics I like is:

Harry Potter and the daft morons

Heart and Soul

Harry Potter and the rule of three.

At least 20 chapters and preferably completed

Thanks in advance.

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** My personal favourites that came to mind for this are both D&D fics (You don't really need to know anything about D&D to understand them, I don't think - they explain it all relatively well, but I've been playing D&D since I was ten, so I'm not the best to evaluate that level of understanding requirement).

One is serious, the other is not.

The serious one has Harry raised by a D&D-style Paladin (warriors of Right and Justice, generally upstanding citizens of Law and Order - kind of like Captain America [ish] or Michael Carpenter [the most Paladin guy to ever have been written functionally in anything] basically).

Radiant Heart - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart]]

The less serious one has Harry raised by Minsc and Boo from Baldur's Gate. And yes, the two characters in that fic were actual characters in a D&D adventure PC game that was actually made and played and beloved. And everything they say is alarmingly in-character.

Miniature Giant Space Hamster - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12280256/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Ranger-and-the-Miniature-Giant-Space-Hamster]]

** It's not exactly what your looking for but try The International Triwizard Tournament by Salient Casuality. It has a couple of mentors for Harry.
