Metamorphmagi are fairly undeveloped in canon. We only meet Tonks, and all we see her do is change minor details. What if Metamorphs are capable of completely becoming different people, but in order to do so, they have to consume (ala [Prototype]) that person.

I'd like to see a story where Metamorph Harry discovers this at an early age when he accidentally consumes Dudley and assumes his identity until Hagrid comes knocking.


** This might fit your request (although it's not handled quite like you describe it): "Who is Dudley Dursley?"

  Harry Potter disappeared well before he ever was meant to go to Hogwarts and Dudley was the one that got the letter from Hogwarts. Dudley has a big secret, he's not who everyone thinks he is. Mostly a narrative after Dudley arrives at Hogwarts. All six chapters now posted.
