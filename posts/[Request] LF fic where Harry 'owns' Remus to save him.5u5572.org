I can't remember much of this one, though I know Harry took control and there may be a bit of powerful!Harry in it. The one thing I do remember is that for some reason the Ministry was coming to kill Remus because he was a werewolf--I can't remember if they accused him of something, or what--but when they were on their way, Harry enacted this clause by forcing Remus to be submissive to him (not sexually, but pack-structure wise) so he would be seen as his 'pet'.

Because of this, and the fact that it was publicized, Harry was later kidnapped and attacked by a pack of rogue werewolves because they were unaware that Harry had done it to save Remus, and thought Harry believed werewolves were meant to be 'pets' or were less than regular humans. I think there's a pairing in there too, possibly Snarry, but I can't be sure. I'm having a hard time remembering.

If anyone can help, though, that would be awesome! :)
