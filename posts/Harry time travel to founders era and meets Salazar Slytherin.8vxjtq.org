I'm looking for this fic where Harry travels to the founders era on accident. He lands and meets Salazar. He becomes a student at hogwarts but due to his previous school years in the future he knows a lot for the time period. Merlin is one of his fellow Slytherins in a year below him. The founders have children. Harry ends up back in his own time period. He talks to a portrait of Merlin and another friend in the future.

** I hate the Merlin in Hogwarts plot with passion... It's one of the mayor plotholes in JKRs work, although I don't know the specifics I believe there was a chocolate card or something saying he was a Slytherin and a member of Arthur's court. The problem of course is that Arthur is from the late 6th century, a few hundred years before Hogwarts.

Doesn't this drive anyone else mad...?
