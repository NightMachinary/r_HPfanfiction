Tl;dr: Hermione looks at Harry with tears in her eyes during the exchanging of wedding vows, extremely romantic.

Normally when people submit evidence to suggest that Harry and Hermione may be romantically interested in one another, the instantaneous response is that they're just friends and any moments of affection between them shouldn't be thought of as anything more than friendly. Harry sees Hermione as a friend, so why should we suggest he feels any other way?

While I don't fully agree, I see why people feel that way. However, there is one particular moment in the final book that I'm stunned to see no one talks about. A moment that could be written off as friendship, but not as easily as any other moment in the series. It's a very short moment, but it fires up a large number of questions.

The moment takes place during the wedding of Bill and Fleur, just as they're about to finish exchanging vows and make their marriage official.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione turned around and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears. “...then I declare you bonded for life."
#+end_quote

Now on it's own, it doesn't seem like anything special. Just another character doing a minor thing that won't matter a page later. But in my eyes, this small selection of words offers so many different thoughts and possibilities. Up to this point in the chapter, Harry and Hermione are both distracted by the events of the wedding party, as well as brief moments from the characters they later end up with.

But right then, seemingly out of nowhere, Hermione, utterly overpowered with emotion turns around to look at Harry. The words "turned around" are very important here, because turning around is a very different action to turning to someone. Turning to someone wouldn't be very out of the ordinary. But the phrasing of the text suggests that Hermione made a specific and conscious effort to look straight at Harry, right as wedding vows were being exchanged. There's an important addition of meaning here that I don't want to be overlooked.

Not only that, but Hermione beams at him. I can't think of a better word to describe someone's sheer joy than beam. Also, keep in mind that the books are told from Harry's perspective. Hermione's look of joy was more important to him than anything else in the room. Ginny included.

Now I suppose it's possible that this could still be interpreted as yet another moment of friendship. At the very least, the moment is showcasing that Harry is so important to Hermione that she feels she absolutely needs him in her life for as long as she lives. But what seems more likely is that Hermione has had romantic feelings for Harry for a while, but has suppressed them, because she believes Ron is the one for her and Harry is clearly into Ginny. Yet in this moment, she can't help but reveal her love for him if only for a second.

While it personally hasn't happened to me, I've seen similar looks exchanged between people at weddings before and I can't name one time when it occurred between two people that weren't romantically involved or went on to be romantically involved. It's almost something you expect to see happen between two lovers who aren't yet married. Yet Ron isn't even in Hermione's mind as the most romantic thing she's ever witnessed occurs.

I don't doubt that some people could laugh and accuse this theory of being nothing short of overthinking. But to me, it only requires a bit of thought to make something bigger out of this small line.

*** Well, Rowling admitted Ron and Hermione would have marriage issues (to no ones surprise) and Harry and Hermione canonically both work at the ministry. I have a pretty strong headcanon that as they work together during their adult lives, Hermione begins to fall in love with Harry whether she likes it or not (assuming she hasn't fallen already). Where it goes from there, I don't know.

**** I am fairly sure that ages back Rowling also admitted that Harry and Hermione were the "original" couple (or at least implied it) but the dynamic of the Trio caused her to change the pairings. In other words, early on Harry was intended to be paired with Hermione, but later Rowling changed it, and further developed Ginny as an alternative due to Harry's strong connection to the Weasleys. Its one of many reasons people often point to the fact that Ginny seems underdeveloped and then rushed later on for such a major player as Harry's love interest.

I don't know how this exactly plays into the section of book you describe due to no one but Rowling knowing how the story was developed or at what rate and what changes happened when... but it is intriguing.

  “I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment' she says. “That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron.”

Her implication that she was clinging to the plot as she first imagined it, is about how the Trio would develop, which she has mentioned before. To develop the Trio as she wanted, it would have been difficult to pair up Hermione and Harry.

******** I appreciate you bringing in this source, however that does not say epilogue. I was aware of this BBC article and it's not the first time shes mentioned this. However, every time she has said "final chapter" (including what you linked) and is about who she kills off at the end of the book (implying the final battles). So again, in this article it's not the epilogue she refers to, but the final chapter.

She has made several mentions over the years to alterations that affected how she wrote the epilogue. For example, in this:

[[https://www.beyondhogwarts.com/harry-potter/articles/jk-rowling-goes-beyond-the-epilogue.html]]

... she discusses how things changed drastically with various parts of the book which affected how she wrote the epilogue, implying that the epilogue was never written early on, and even changed a lot late into the story development.

********* I don't know whether you've seen the actual interview, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WdmOfij1NM][which can be found here]] - 3:15 timestamp for the relevant part, but there she says that the epilogue changed only "very slightly". And that whole conversation was motivated by the interviewer saying who she would want the characters to end up with and immediately after mentioning the "final chapter hidden away in her safe".

Even if you don't think this counts, JKR admitting R/Hr to be wish fulfillment definitely suggests that she wrote the epilogue before the series started being published. Especially given that she based Ron off of a childhood friend, Sean Harris. She had a plan and was sticking with it no matter what. In fact, this is what some fans who don't like the epilogue criticize about it - that it was too choppy, too 'fanficy', not consistent with the writing of her previous books, etc. At the very least, it means that H/Hr were never the original couple, and in no interview during the series being published did she ever say or imply that.

In the link you provided, she said that she took out several details because "you have to resist the urge to tell everything", so I'm not sure how that translates to her implying that it was not written early on, or how that was anything 'drastic'. I think she had simply wanted us to imagine more, although judging by her actions these past few years, that seems rather inconsistent. Immediately after /DH/ she even said something along the lines of "no more Harry, ever", and look where we are now...

***** I've argued before that his infatuation with Cho and Ginny shows an incredible amount of immaturity (somewhat appropriate for his age). It makes more sense when this is his 'sowing wild oats' phase and not 'finding the love of his life'.

I think it is easy to argue that his upbringing with the Dursleys left its mark and gave him lots of intimacy issues. Not being able to differentiate love from lust and physical attraction seems like a logical consequence from here. It's not like he has a lot of references... how many loving relationships has he experienced or even seen?

Getting a stiffy on the other hand is dead simple. Also pursuing some kind of romantic relationship fits right in with his agenda to try to be normal, so he's not exactly in the right mindset to approach this healthily considering how obsessed he is with fitting in.

But Ginny is much more than just a "hot quidditch girl" (not that there's anything wrong with that). She shares Harry's sense of humor and his daring attitude, and she's also really good at understanding him emotionally.

I like the ship, but I also love platonic but very intimate/close Harry&Hermione friendship fics. The only problem with those is that I can't really see them happening with Ron&Ginny's canon personalities (if they are in the picture). It's my headcanon for why Harry and Hermione seem so distant in the epilogue: They are accommodating their spouses.

I think one of the things Harry and Hermione share is that they are in touch with their feelings, whereas Ron is emotionally dense. I think Hermione looks at Harry, not because of friendship or romantic love, but because he's one of the few people she's sure will grasp the importance of that moment. Harry has a deep respect for family and commitment. Ron does as well, but he takes it for granted whereas Harry sees it as precious. Therefore Harry can share that moment with her in a way Ron can't.

I also think that Hermione is way too wise and mature to allow herself to look at Ron in that moment. That would be way too much pressure for a young relationship. They haven't even been together very long, so I think Hermione would be far too uncomfortable to--intentionally or not--put out a marriage vibe to her new boyfriend. That makes Harry a safe person to acknowledge at that moment since he's not going to read into her meaningful look with any romantic intention.

I do think I can tentatively claim that Hermione has Harry on her mind a lot more than the reverse. Doesn't have to be in a romatic sense at all.

  Yeah, but I think that was mostly written by Rowling so as to show how the Trio doesn't work without the 'emotional support' of Ron, and why he's 'needed'. She hasn't really given him any talents or proficiencies other than chess and being funny, so she has to plug him into the role of being the emotional glue (which doesn't really make sense IMO with the characterization in the previous books).
#+end_quote

It might sound a bit conspiratorial, but I really have to wonder whether JKR watched Buffy and was trying to (unsuccessfully) turn Ron into Xander Harris (the heart of their trio, "the one who sees"). Ron started out as the chess strategist with the emotional range of a teaspoon, constantly starting fights, but suddenly he's the glue that holds everything together?

Xander is actually my favorite counter example how to do that archetype of a character justice. I adore Xander (who has a lot of the same problems as Ron, Xander doesn't even get the girl, twice!), who grows above his insecurities. I do not like Ron. At all. Can you imagine Ron not getting the girl in the end, if Hermione had fallen for someone else? He'd be so petty about it!

Just for Ron's sake JKR needed to keep the pairing intact, because he wouldn't have been able to handle it ending any different way.

I think it's just very likely in general that two teenagers that share a very close relationship and go through a lot of upheaval through the years at one point at least entertain the thought of a romantic relationship. Neither one of them is very proactive in those matters though so it is also believable that it never materialises into anything.

At the very least they share a bond that goes beyond simple friendship.

They sure as hell had sex in the tent when it was them against the world. Two hormonal teenagers, alone in the wild, the only two still out in the field openly fighting. Imminent death looming around each corner and the opposition being an immortal magical fascist and his own magical Waffen-SS squads would do the rest.

Not that it was done out of love, but the need for physical and emotional comfort was significant during that time and there is no better way to fulfil those, especially without access to the wonders of modern technology (or a Spa resort).

**** Except...none of their behavior suggests any of that in the book.

What, so you're saying that two friends who never felt any lust for each other, suddenly boned because no one else was around?

Harry didn't even /talk/ to Hermione for a while, and she cried a lot during that time. Neither of them would be ready for something so intimate and vunerable, especially with Ron on their mind, and a Horcrux on them 24/7.

Like, I get that that's your ship or whatever, but it's perfectly believable that they had no interest whatsoever in having casual sex. Horcruxes tend to be boner killers.

Besides, sex tends to complicate things, and I doubt either would want to risk the friendship with the only person they still know is alive.

Like, I seriously cannot see Hermione being down for that, even if Harry was a horndog and felt that monster in his chest again for someone other than Ginny.

Also, that was a pretty big tent, with private rooms. There were other ways if Harry needed an outlet.

No, not because no one else was around. Because they had no one else to turn to. Hermione had mind-wiped her parents, Harry never had a family and Ron was gone (with no return conceivable). And their survival was anything but certain. To each other, they were basically the only other human left alive.

Their friendship in a year won't matter if they are dead. And that's how things were looking during that time.

Having some desperate "I don't want to die tomorrow" sex won't harm their friendship, especially not if it is as strong as you imply (and as it was in canon).

******** Right. I'm sure Harry would argee with that assessment, and that the Horcrux wouldn't feed him thoughts about Hermione leaving too if he tried anything, leaving him all alone.

I'm sure Hermione was in the mood after crying for hours about Ron leaving her. She's clearly over him and ready to be intimate and vulnerable with his best friend.

Again, they barely /spoke/ to each other after Ron left, and even after a month or so, Hermione was still crying whenever she though she was alone.

Even later, Harry was still hesitant to even talk to Hermione and bring up the idea of going to Godric's Hollow.

Their friendship was not in a good place, and the Horcrux exacerbated their fears and doubts that neither would even attempt such a thing if they had those thoughts of sex at all.. The fear of rejection would be too much to handle, and things were still way too awkward between each other with Ron gone.

I'm sorry, but the "end-of-the-world" argument just doesn't sit right with me. Hermione wouldn't go for it, and Harry wouldn't either.

********* Why would Hermione "I just got Umbridge gang raped and look at all the fucks I don't give" Granger or Harry "I crucified a teacher over spitting at a woman who has done nothing for me, ever" Potter not go for it?

Also, keep in mind that canon was written with a younger target audience in mind. Teenage sex would be rampant at Hogwarts otherwise, and the monster Harry feels about Ginny would be in his pants, not his chest. So there's a certain freedom when it comes to interpreting anything related to sexuality.

Because those have nothing to do with the possibility of them having consensual sex between each other.

It's a different matter entirely.

Also, "monster in the chest" and "Harry has a boner", is a hell of a lot different from "Sometimes, late at night, when Hermione thought Harry was asleep, Harry could hear her crying. Harry soon found himself looking at the Maruader's Map, looking for Ron's dot to inevitably show up, only for his eyes to turn to Ginny's dot, as if he stared intensely enough at it, she might wake up and know, somehow, that he was thinking of her. " and "Harry and Hermione had sex"

If anything, the subtext is that Harry was fapping to the thought of Ginny. Wouldn't be a hard clean up for him either, since all he would need is a quick Scourgify charm.

Sorry, but the subtext just isn't there for Harry and Hermione to bang in that tent. They missed Ron so much, that they put Phineas Nigellus' painting propped up in the tent, so that they could have /someone/ there besides them just to fill the space where Ron might have been. They were not exactly comfortable alone together.

Edit: it also explicitly states in the book that Harry was looking for signs that Hermione was going to leave him too, which means even if he did have frisky feelings for her, he wouldn't dare ask her for sex for that fear of losing her too.

*********** This. Though scourgify is a little overkill I think.

I think it's probable that Hermione had had some feelings for Harry, because that happens. I think that in slightly different circumstances, it might have happened. Though Harry would definitely consider her out of bounds, as by this point she and Ron have been obviously hiding feelings for each other for at least three years.

Putting Black's portrait up in the tent because they were /not exactly comfortable alone together/ does suggest that one or both of them didn't trust themselves. I know that's your wording not JKR's, though.

** I don't ship H/Hr & I don't think Rowling intended it to be romantic so I would say no (and in general, I don't think she wrote anything that was meant to be secretly decoded like that. But there's nothing wrong with reading things how you'd like!) But I do love that scene for their friendship! I think it's only natural that she'd look at Harry. I doubt there's any deep reasoning behind it (she does only have one pair of eyes after all, and can't look at them both. maybe Harry's just closer.)

although we don't have any evidence that Hermione has a difficult relationship w her parents, they do obviously seem very distant to the plot. she has, however, faced years of ostracisation and bullying from her peers. and iirc at this point she's not long obliviated her parents, so no doubt she's in a very delicate situation re family and love. Ron, despite minor insecurities, has had a pretty untroubled life up to Hogwarts. his parents clearly are very loving and he has no reason to doubt his family will always love and support him. he's also not very emotional (beyond anger) and we know Hermione has been frustrated with this before. Harry, conversely, grew up unloved and ostracised like Hermione. at this point Hermione has in a sense recently lost her parents and her home, ahd Harry ofc lost his a long time ago. the war has just started and they know it's going to hurt them and they'll face more losses soon (Ron can't really relate to this until Fred, I think).

I think seeing such a beautiful display of love and promise and family right before their world is about to collapse, means that moment had to be shared by Harry and Hermione. I think they would both appreciate it in a way Ron can't yet. It's a very sweet moment imo

** It would take a lot of work to make that happen. Hermione didnt try very hard to get herself out of the friend zone. So to Harry she's still just a friend who teeters between and off and on relationship with Ron who she frequently disagrees with.

And as for why Harry left her alone in the tent to cry by herself, he's ALWAYS done his greiving alone and he knows that crying doesn't help him by this point.

Didn't help with the Dursleys. (Ignored) Didn't help when Siruis died. ( Channeled his grief into a hair trigger temper that got much worse) Didn't help when Hedwig died either.

So he's just at a complete loss. How do you comfort someone when you've never known how or been on the recieving? If anything would think Ron would know how (Big family and two living parents), and Ron's not there, which brings the problem back full circle.
