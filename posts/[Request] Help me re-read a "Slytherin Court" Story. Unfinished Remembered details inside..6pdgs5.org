So, I know this definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea, and I've read plenty of them that are horrid, but I'm looking to re-read a Slytherin Court story that I believe featured the following.

- Active Slytherin Court
- Harry sitting at the center of the Slytherin table rather than the head as it allowed him to hear more. The last person to do such was supposed to be TMR.
- At some point he got offered a quidditch contract, I believe?
- Some particular section of the Slytherin common room was supposed to be off limits to all but the "court". Various power-plays around that, ect.

I don't remember it well, and perhaps it's not as amusing as I remember, but I'd like to read through it again.

I also believe it's abandoned.


** Linkffn(Travel Secrets: First) Taking the centre table for his court and the common room lounge starts in the third book of the series, which is as far as it's gotten. Last updated on NYE 2016

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

*** Yep. This is the one I remembered; I quite enjoyed it - shame it's abandoned, but I remembered it being unfinished. Thank You.

** It sounds like linkffn(The Rise of a Dark Lord by: Little.Miss.Xanda) unless Slytherin Court stories are common things. I've only read of one there.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

*** Thank you for your suggestion - I'll check and see!

Edit: Turns out this isn't the one I remembered, though I enjoyed bits and pieces of it. I stopped pretty much around the Quidditch World Cup. I lost interest, but others may enjoy!
