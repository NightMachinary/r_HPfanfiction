This idea has been in my mind for a while, and honestly, if someone wants to use it, go ahead.

So, what if Xenophilus Lovegood choose his name? I mean, Xenophilus means "lover of the strange", it is just too good of a coincidence be named like that and... be him, honestly.

So, my idea follows this headcanon of the Lovegood family being related to the Malfoy Family. Now, usually, this relation comes from Abraxas gen, but! What if, Xeno was Lucius younger brother? And, when he married Pandora, he took her last name and changed his first. Why? Well, the possibilities are quite a few. Was Pandora not a pureblood? Was she poor? Was he to marry someone else? All three?

In this universe, would Draco and Luna know? How would the relationship between the brothers work? Before and after? I said Xeno was the youngest, but what if it was the other way around? Did Lucius wanted to be heir? Was he pushed to be when Xeno left?

If he changed his name, did he do it legally, magically or both? Can he be called by his birth name? Thought about in that name?

Would it be an open secret? Oh, so many options ... what do you guys think?


** On the one hand, this is a prompt, so this isn't necessarily relevant, but Xenophilius' name isn't uncommon in the HP verse in terms of on-the-nose-ness. Like, Lupin's name is basically "Wolfy McWolfguy."

*** Oh, I know that. However, isn't it fun trying to find some in-universe answer, instead of just accepting that she named them like that?
