I think a lot of pureblood supremacist families very rarely meet with muggles, so their knowledge of what muggles are like would be mostly what their parents told them which would be what their grandparents told those and their great grandparents and so on, so all knowledge about muggles is a few generations out of date.

Now read a description of how a typical muggle english city looked like during the industrial revolution when literally everything was coal powered, and "filthy muggles" makes a lot more sense...


** From [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c6kup4/1000_years_is_a_pretty_long_time/][1000 years is a pretty long time]]:

Muggles in the 990s are completely different from the 1990s. Little basic hygiene, almost no literacy (unless you were a noble), dumping waste out onto the street...yeah, I'd nope out too. Granted, we have no clue what wizards did or were like, but I had to assume they were doing better in those days.

The problem is that Muggles drastically improved over the following centuries, and wizards refused to see that (or acknowledge it). The blood purists, I assume, don't like change that much, and with new Muggle-borns brings more change from a source they are unwilling to work with. They took an argument/belief that no longer exists today and ran with it. Even with wizardkind adopting useful Muggle inventions (camera, trains, buses, graphophone, wireless, etc) the prejudice still remains, and it's mostly willful. They could find out the truth, but they don't want to. Human nature at it's finest.

*** I mean, apparently they were at squatting (or I imagine) and vanishing at some point pre-toilets. That's good to be an improvement on the open sewers and cesspits.

** Except that almost all wizards live amongst muggles, even if they didn't interact with them they'd still frequently see them.

**** There is no actual evidence that Old Family=Rich in Canon. We only know of the Lestranges, Blacks and Malfoys. And of those we onlx know the Malfoys to live in a manor, which they got when they were still part of muggle nobility.

On the other hand we know from Old families at least the Potters, Weasleys, Abbotts, Gaunts, Blacks and Diggorys lived next to muggles.

***** Yeah, but the Gaunts were notorious to being poor, and practicing incest.

I agree however that not all old families were rich,

Funnily enough, those cited as rich, tend to be the biggest bigots. Well, Sirius said his whole family was dark, but we know Andromeda and Alphard weren't, we also know that only Bellatrix and Regulus(for a time) actively helped Voldemort, despite many other family members being alive.

****** I edited the comment above, but I am gonna write it here anyway.

The Malfoys are still the only family we know who lives in Manor and we know they had it granted to them(in addition to other lands) by William thr Conqueror when they were part of the Muggle nobility.

******* Well, I wouldn't say the Weasleys lived near them, they live in the countryside, and used apparition and floo.

But even if they lived near them, we have strong evidence they either didn't pay attention or ignored the muggles completely. Thye didn't know nearly anything about them.

We do know Draco knew what a helicopter was, so he knew muggles could fly.

I wonder if they knew what a gun was, or a missile, or a bomb, or a nuke.

They certainly knew so little I doubt they would be able to mount an open offensive against muggles, and win.

******** We know the Weasleys lived next to a muggle village and occasionally interacted with the people there, like we know Fred and George showed girls their 'magic tricks' when flirting with them.

  We're off to the village, there's a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are some-thing marvelous . . . almost like real magic. . . .” “Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. “Would've only taken them ten seconds and then we could've gone too.”

Were also told the Diggorys live on the other side of the Village.

***** There is reason to assume old family = owns land though. Even applies to the Weasleys who aren't exactly rich.

Basically hundreds of years ago when wizards wanted land for themselves, the just put a muggle repelling charm on it, made muggles forget that it existed in the first place, and took it. Later on it also required modifying maps and faking records, gradually increasing the cost of land for wizards over time. So older families probably have their own land hidden from muggles assuming that they didn't sell it.

** Eh, they're not as isolated as fanfic tends to make them out to be. Remember, eleven year old Malfoy in book one at least knew what a helicopter was.

** I THINK they are willfully ignorant, and a wizard can spend years without seeing a Muggle(as far as they know).

Besides prejudices tend to be not very rational.

AND Grindelwald was already warning everyone about the Muggle's prowess with technology.

Heck, I think if I was a wizard I would have a revolver and practice quick drawing along with magic doubt a wizard can draw his wand faster than that, or dodge bullets at close range, just for surprise attacks though.
