I love these two together, and I need some more!

I don't necessarily need them during their chosen holiday, and just need some good recs!

Happy holidays.

** The Devolution of Cedric Diggory (AKA: How a Hufflepuff Became Popular!) HemsonTenths

Summary: So for the first time in his, thus far, meaningless life; Cedric Diggory aspired to do something more than the bare minimum. All because of Harry Potter. Perhaps this was the incentive the Sorting Hat had been talking about. And so began his evolution.

My fave Harry/ Cedric fic Unique Cedric is definitely Dark in here

** I haven't read any of them but the author [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/LullabyKnell/pseuds/LullabyKnell/works?fandom_id=136512&page=1][Lullaby Knell]] had some Harry & Cedric fics in their profile. (I was looking for another fic of theirs when I saw your post.)
