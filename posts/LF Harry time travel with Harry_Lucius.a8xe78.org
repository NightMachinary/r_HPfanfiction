I don't remember a massive amount about this fic but Harry ended up back in time & at some point got into a relationship with Lucius (Harry possibly ended up in the same school year as Snape/MWPP with Lucius a little older), then when he got back to his real time I remember him being snuggled onto Lucius' lap in Dumbledore's office after Luc swept in when Harry got back.

Sorry it's really vague & there's every possibility I read it 8-10 years ago, possibly more.

(Ps if you just want to rec me your fave Harry/Luc that's cool too!)


** Might want to try the Hp fanfiction slash subreddit as well :) slash isn't that popular here for some reason unfortunately.

*** Thanks for the tip! I didn't think to check if there was a slash subreddit.
