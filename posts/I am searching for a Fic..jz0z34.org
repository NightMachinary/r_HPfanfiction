:END:
This was a fairly old story i read in the early days of Fanfiction.net so there is a chance of it being deleted. Main premise is Lucius fails to plant the Diary in Ginnys cauldron and gives it to his son Draco so he can do it while in Hogwarts. Draco pretends to be in love with Ginny so he can get cozy with her and plant the Diary under the guise of a Gift but fails due to the impatience of the Horcrux and is taken to the Chamber of Secrets. Ron and Harry go to rescue him because he is Ginnys boyfriend. Other than this i remember Lockheart being competent and teaching occlumency.


** Ugh. Draco being Ginny's boyfriend? I feel like both Draco and Ginny would want to throw themselves from the astronomy tower before that happens
