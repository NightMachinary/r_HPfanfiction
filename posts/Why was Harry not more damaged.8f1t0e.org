** Sure, it's unrealistic. It's also a children's story with witches, wizards, and a homicidal megalomaniac that got pelted with snowballs at one point. You need to suspend your disbelief and just go with it =)

*** Yeah I mean Harry is a really heroic hero. He fights a giant basilisk with a sword for gods sake. It's perfectly okay for him to come out on top from a difficult upbringing. What a great guy!

** We see the story primarily through Harrys eyes, this is may have an effect on how his mental health is seen, what his emtjons and reactions arr like and his interactions with others. Harry is sort of like the narrator, an unreliable one and sometimes its very difficult to view yourself as anything but the norm, when you have nobody pointing it out or anything to compare to.

** He isn't normal. A normal person would not return to a school where he almost dies every year, a normal person would leave school when the teachers torture him.
