**** Archive at Azkaban's Lair... I'd forgotten that was a thing. I think I must have read this fic when it was new and forgotten it along with that website, but it has some of the nicest descriptions of Sirius I've ever read.

***** I also first read this fic a while ago, and was so pleased when I found it again. It has one of the more realistic depictions of a teenager's inner emotional turmoil in fic, I think.

** I may not have much leg to stand on here, but I personally loved linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and its sequels (it's still ongoing up to the 4th year).

Another one that is entirely pre-Hogwarts is linkffn(The Letter by mango-melone). Kind of alike to Innocent, in a way. I think I even read them back to back once.

  "'Dear Mr Godfather,' the letter read, 'My name is Harry Potter, and I'm living with my aunt and uncle, but I don't like it very much.'" When through an act of desperation and accidental magic a letter finds its way into Azkaban, Sirius Black decides that his godson needs him. But how do you take care of a child when you're a wanted criminal?

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
