:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So when i first joined the fandom (far longer than i care to admit to :P) I read a cute Marauders fanfic that was all from the perspective of Madam Pomfrey. From memory it followed how she watched them grow up over the years, and how she faced her own misconceptions of werewolves etc. I've been trying to look for it to re-read, but not managed so far...Any lovely folk here have any idea what it might have been called/the author? (it might have been on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], or the old HP fanfic site the sugarquill?)


** It might be A Most Unusual Student, which was on Sugar Quill:
