** I like reviews that point out the chapter moments that truly struck a reader as exciting/intriguing/surprising/stirring. It's nice to hear 'love your words' but it's great to see 'this part cracked me up and that part made my heart skip'. For criticism, letting me know when characters are veering away from believable reactions or if I missed addressing a consequence. I'd love to hear 'That scene was too detailed for what little you conveyed about the plot or the characters' -- assuming they're not missing something subtle I'm including to reference later.

I'll take what's offered, but reviews like that are the ice cream sundaes.

** Firstly, any little fixes are helpful - if you noticed spelling or continuity errors, just point them out.

The number one thing I adore as a writer, and something I try to do as a reviewer, is to add specificity to a comment about what I liked. For example, you might have enjoyed dialogue in the fic, and you could mention how it fit the character or the situation.

Telling the writer how particular scenes made you feel will usually delight, especially if certain emotions hit home for you; if there's something you'd like to see explored further in the fic, say so.

It gets on everyone's nerves when some thirteen-year-old comments that Harry should "break free" of Dumbledore and go shag a goblin, but something like "I'd love to see more explanation of x" or "I hope we see more of y and z's relationship" is stellar.

Just say what you feel! Any comments are good comments.

** The reviews I find rewarding are the ones that demonstrate that the reader was engaged with the story and caught up by it. Not necessarily the ones that are incredibly complimentary - though that's never a bad thing, heh - but the ones that remind you of when you yourself get sucked into a good book. It's very rewarding to feel like your story's at that level.

Most constructive are the ones that point out problems/issues in the sweet spot between too small to care about and too large to really fix. Generally these have to do with pace or tone of specific beats. Reviews that pick out a line of unnatural dialogue that's always bothered me and say "this sounds awkward. What if you changed this word to that word?" are gold.

** In order of importance:

1. Sentence structure. Spelling, proper quotation, character dialogue, and how well the individual pieces of the story mesh.

2. Continuity errors. [[/r/viol8er]] gives a good example.

3. Characterization. Someone acting massively OOC for a paragraph and then normal the next is not good writing or reading.

** Definitely corrections (I embarrassingly called Lee Jordan "Jordan Lee" for a chapter) and also because I sometimes overuse "apart" when I mean "a part" so it's helpful to have a fresh pair of eyes see that after I believed I meticulously edited before uploading.

I get a lot of "Good Chapter" and "Update Please". While they're encouraging, it doesn't give me a lot to go by.

Like why did you enjoy the chapter? Did I make you laugh? Was it good writing? TELL ME.

I used to get them with some critiques but I haven't received anything like this in a few years.

*** Most reviews I get on FFN are of the "good chapter, update plz" variety. Maybe some people find those rewarding, I don't. I like constructive criticism, which is when the reviewer goes beyond the barebones praise/disapproval and is specific about SOMETHING, just any one thing, really. You read a few thousand words, have been following the fic for a while and have nothing to say beyond "good chapter"? Why the hell even bother?

Yeah, this post comes off as bitter. I've pretty much given up on hoping for constructive reviews on FFN. I got a couple of good ones on AO3, but if I want actual critical feedback, I post on DLP.

**** It sounds like you might benefit from a good beta. I hear that it's hard to find a good one, but they can often offer the sort of critical reading you're looking for.

***** I thought about it, but my writing schedule is highly irregular (honestly, there is no schedule, words come and go) so I wouldn't be able to coordinate with a beta-reader to get something done. Besides, like I said, I get some great feedback on DLP when I eventually update a fic.

** Highly critical reviews which justify their criticism on non-subjective factors.

Example of good criticism: "This fight was too epic for so early in the fic. It ruins the story's pacing because everything afterwards feels like an anti-climax. Also now that you've had Harry put out all the stops, any other fight where he doesn't fight to the same level will be inconsistent."

Example of bad criticism: "This fic is bad because it's not Harry/Hermione and that's my favourite pairing."

** Constructive helps fix such as "in chapter 1 you said that Harry is left handed but now in chapter 3 he's doing everything with his right hand. Did I miss something for why he's switched hands?" Destructive is "u fukn suk. u cnt kepe harys hand's rite!!!!"

**** Constructive reviews that point out issues are better than "awesome story/chapter" which are better, though just barely, than "this sucks for reason x" which is better than "shitty" reviews.

** I appreciate most reviews that touch upon the more holistic elements of storytelling, not the mechanics†, particularly ones that identify what works, what doesn't, and how a story could be improved.

But I think most authors would agree that even a quick, "Loved your story--thanks!" is better than radio silence.

†Generally, I think my writing is structurally passable and I don't gain a lot from hearing for the fiftieth time, "Ugh, third person present tense sucks ass."

** Really depends on what mood I'm in. Some times, I just want to stuff my face with McDonalds Reviews of Praise. Most of the time though, I'm in the same boat as the others of wanting critical review, of readers pointing out what things worked for them and what didn't. It makes me feel like they're actually invested in what I wrote.

** Generally speaking, 'I did/did not like X *because* Y.'

Even if Y is 'cause it's dumb', that's a mile more constructive than 'I didn't like it.' I can choose whether to agree or not with the reasoning but unless the reasoning is involved I'm not going to find it helpful.

Followed by 'hey this is nice', because encouragement is nice. On that note though, please don't be the person that reviews 2.5 minutes after the chapter is posted saying 'Next chapter quick please!'. It's cute the first time but really, I just posted XD
