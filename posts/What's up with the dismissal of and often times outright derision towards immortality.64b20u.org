I don't think I've ever seen a fic in this fandom where the MC thinks it's a good thing. It's honestly a little disturbing how much all of the writers seem to glorify death and see living forever as inevitably angst filled.

On a side note, if you have any fics where the MC's goal is immortality that isn't a poorly written self-insert I'd love to read them.


** I'd rec HPMOR but you said no bad self inserts. :(

Pretty much any Voldemort protagonist would want this. Linkffn(yes, I am Harry's brother) and linkffn(seventh Horcrux) would fit.

#+begin_quote
  “But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?”

  “Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.” Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all.”

  “Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure,” said Ron. Harry laughed.

  “It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,” said Hermione. “But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it.”

Deathly Hallows Chapter 6.

Essentially, wizards already know that they are immortal, but that immortality is spiritual, not physical. Exchanging your certain spiritual immortality for uncertain physical immortality is seen as unnatural, dangerous and ultimately foolish. It doesn't help that, philosopher's stone excluded, all the methods seem to be gruesome and involve significant disfigurement.

** In most fics I've read, immortality only comes up with Voldemort and looking at his methods to achieve immortality, it's understandable for the MC to go "not worth it". It's not so much a glorification of death than immortality not being feasible.

The best method we know of is the Philosopher's Stone, but in canon, it seems to be unique and is destroyed in the first book, so it's not available as a method anymore. Even if it was, the fact that only Nicholas Flamel and his wife used it for 600 or so years hints at the stone not being capable of keeping a large number of people immortal. It's also the only option that might give not only eternal life, but eternal youth/health.

Drinking unicorn blood will keep you from dying, but it also comes with a curse and requires killing an innocent being, so it's out.

Having horcruxes requires murdering another human (and possibly doing worse) in cold blood, which doesn't mesh well with a desire to have everyone immortal. Also, horcruxes only seem to prevent your soul from passing on, so when you die, you'll leave a wraith that can be resurrected behind. There'd still be ageing and you need other people to resurrect you with a rather costly ritual. At some point, you'll run out of ancestor's bones and servant's fingers.

** Immortality can be as much of a curse as it can be a blessing, especially if it cannot be turned off. I mean, hey, stories don't explore the implications of what happens millions or billions of years in the future, so it's not like it really matters, but if you imagine that humans don't actually make it off the planet and possibly even die off then the immortal character, assuming they can no longer become mortal, has a life of solitude ahead of them and in a few billion years the Sun going “hey, let's toast Earth” as well. And even more short-term, some people actually do get attached to the people they know so the idea of having to live forever when those other people don't might even be horrifying to them; I can only guess but I think this is at least part of the reason why so many writers don't really like immortality as a thing and let their biases show.

Simply not being able to die for as long as you want, though, along with having your body be kept in a decent shape? Yeah, that's a great thing.

** Ever have a friend die? Want that feeling every decade or so for the rest of eternity as your friends, family, children, and so on all die?

And the human brain isn't setup for immortality. There's a reason we develop alzheimer's and dementia: they're the final killswitches for when our bodies can no longer maintain themselves. Want to be a dementia-riddled patient until the heat-death of the universe?

*** The thing is, what we should be aiming for is immortality for /everyone/. True immortality, perfect immortality, is when everyone lives. No one should die.

This means also getting rid of stuff like Alzheimer's, of course.

This is the most common argument against immortality that I've seen, this insistence that somehow only one person can be immortal, and oh, how sad will you be when everyone else dies?

Some real deathist thinking.

***** I don't think you understand what PTSD is. It develops in response to traumatic experiences, and even then not everyone develops it.

People do not develop PTSD from having close friends and relatives die. It may cause sadness and grief, but not mental illness. Life, as they say, goes on.

#+begin_quote
  Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), once called shell shock or battle fatigue syndrome, is a serious condition that can develop after a person has experienced or *witnessed* a traumatic or *terrifying event* in which serious physical harm occurred or was threatened. PTSD is a lasting consequence of traumatic ordeals that cause intense fear, helplessness, or horror, such as a sexual or physical assault, the *unexpected death of a loved one*, an accident, war, or *natural disaster.* */Families of victims can also develop PTSD/*, as can emergency personnel and rescue workers.

******* The bits you bolded have no correspondence to your previous posts. Your previous claim was that a person can develop PTSD simply by knowing someone who died, not from witnessing their death or experiencing a trauma in connection with it.

Furthermore, your previous post stated that such as result would be inevitable, not a mere possibility:

Such a proposition is clearly absurd, else every person on the planet who knows someone who died would have PTSD.

******** PTSD isn't strictly speaking a lack of good health. It's the mind trying to processes events. PTSD is most often escaped by people losing their mental health in old age. In theory someone who was immortal (with immortally perfect health) would have WORSE ptsd, and be in infinite emotional pain
