Hi all,

I would really appreciate the help to find a Severus/Lucius fanart which accompanied a fanfic.

The art was a realistic traditional art piece of a young Severus Snape in the snow; with long billowing hair. The viewer sees Severus from the side angle looking forward.

The fic itself was about Lucius being in a relationship with Severus, irrespective of their peers' opinions and Lucius rushing to meet Severus outside of Hogwarts in full view of the students.

It was a great fanfic and fanart and I would absolutely love to find it. I think I read it around 2006-2007; possibly earlier.

Any information or help would be much appreciated.

Thank you in advance.

Witty.


** Found it! It was called Winter Prince by Branwen777.
