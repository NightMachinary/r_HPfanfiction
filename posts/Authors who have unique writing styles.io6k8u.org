I've noticed recently that there are some fics that I can read and instantly realise who wrote them, because of the writing styles. Rorschach's Blot's writing, for example, is very recognisable and individual. Same with nonjon, and a bunch of others.

â€‹

What other authors have unique writing styles? Do you think it's a good thing? It can take you out of the immersion after all. Would love to hear your thoughts!


** Antony444 definitely has a very unique style. (Possibly they're not a native English speaker? I haven't asked.) It took me a few chapters to get used to it, but I can read it without thinking "that's odd". I've been reading their fic linkffn(The odds were never in my favour) lately, and I think the worldbuilding is really good.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
