The download button is sometimes present and sometimes not, I can't figure out any rhyme or reason.

Thankfully all of my old library downloaded onto my new phone, but now the download button isn't always present for now stories.

Anything I might be doing wrong or different from before?


** The download button disappears for me after I click it to download a story, but the story may get stuck at 1% and so the button stays invisible. Too ix that, go to download manager, cancel the download of the story and it should be back.

Otherwise it's probably just a bug in the app.
