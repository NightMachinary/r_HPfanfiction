Ok, I know that there have been lots of threads on here complaining about the Evil!Dumbledore thing, but, I still feel the need to complain about it. In pretty much every single story where Dumbledore is a character he is turned into a stupid dick, and it's honestly pretty annoying to me this point. I understand if people want to make Dumbledore the big bad of the story instead of Voldemort. That's cool. But if using an Evil!Dumbledore is just a plot device to make Harry more tragic, angsty, or independent, I believe there are better and easier ways to achieve this.

Tragic and Angsty:

Harry has had a life that is already tragic!!!! There is plenty to be angsty about, his parents are dead, no one has loved him up to the age of eleven, hes never had any friends, his step brother beats him up, he lived in a closet and was poorly fed, and was emotionally abused all his formulative years.

And after this upbringing he is shoved into the limelight making it even harder to create honest connections with people. If this isn't enough to create an angsty character for you then I honestly don't know what is.

Independent:

This I understand more the want to use Dumbledore betraying Harry as a way for him to rebel against authority, but still he has plenty of canon reasons to distrust authority like the Dursleys and Snape. The Minister if the story is post GoF. More so if you want to have Dumbledore take more of backseat its pretty easy to turn him into a genial, insane , quirky character who is less of a chess master and more of an eccentric headmaster.

Dumbledore's faults in canon seem to me like they are solely a product of JKR wanting to write a story about a kid learning he is magical combined with the darkening of the books as they went along. HP started out as the story of a kid finding out about a new world and then turned into a story about a magical war. Because Dumbledore is mostly the sole way to feed Harry information that moves the plot along, he is blamed for with holding information and not raising him for warfare and whatever else. The story wants Harry to have a childhood and him training to be a magical badass who is Voldemort's equal in terms of deity like powers would not be a story about childhood.

So I don't know, I feel like the Dumbledore hate can be explained away by JK wanting to make a tonal shift in the story, and shouldn't be held against the character. Well anyways, I'm open to be proven wrong about the merits of an Evil!Dumbledore.

My bad about it getting kinda rambley.


** Just a tad rambley. Anyway, my take on Dumbledore is old man trying to do his best. His best just tends not to line up with everyone else's. He is a man who in my opinion is scared of power and what it did to his best friend but had it thrust upon him. I can't remember which story it was but it suggested many of his roles were given to him in an attempt to appease him after he proved he was more powerful than Grindelwald. This is a man whose central belief is that we are defined by our choices. That everyone deserves the right to make their own choices and will always try to let people choose for themselves. See Draco in 6th year. Combine him wanting others to act for themselves with him not wanting the power given to him goes a long way to explaining why he seems so reluctant to do anything. He's terrified of becoming benevolent dictator with nobody who can balance him out. That the power will remove his perspective and he'll fall back into the views he held as teenager; the idea that muggles and people that he is superior to should be led by their betters for their own good.

With regards to evil Dumbledore, whenever I think canon I think back to the policies of the Dursleys. Often forgotten but the mantra drilled into Harry as child was 'don't ask questions.' JKR is a fantastic story teller, just roll with it and don't ask quiestions. Unfortunately, we love the world she's build we want to know more, to analyse everything and the plot holes etc come out. In my opinion on of the best things I ever heard was to never attribute to malice, what can be attributed to stupidity. Now take a plot hole, make the mistake of instead of someone making a mistake, JKR or a character and call it malicious and then mistakes are the result of evil. The idea that every mistake, every time when something stupid happened was a deliberate act in some greater plan. Who makes big plans, should know better and is in position to manipulate everything, Its Dumbledore.It can be entertaining, spin on certain things can have you thinking and it does allow some interesting ideas. It also provides a great villain, you have the establishment vs little Harry. It aides all those trying to do redeemed Snape/Draco etc. Or you can have a three-way brawl between the Order vs Death Eaters vs underdog Harry. This gives scope to huge battles and internal conflict as Harry questions whether the Order are evil or simply misled.

Tl;dr Never attribute to Malice what can be blamed on stupidity or else it all becomes a grand evil plan and we have a known plotter with a beard and opportunity. We love to see our heroes fall, else we wouldn't have the paparazzi etc.

** Dumbledore is a tricky topic, for a number of reasons.

First off, we have to consider issues with the canon. In canon, most things stand alone pretty decently. Rowling had specific IRL reasons why she made some of her calls. But the fandom community thrives of digging deeper, making the HP world more and more real, by going piece by piece through every detail. And every so often, they come across things which aren't logical, which do not stand up with the chains of cause and effect that we see in real life. And these details, are often those self-same details that Rowling put in because she was aiming at a particular concept. It is similar to if God just suddenly made a person win the lottery. It would be a completely intentional act to do to a person, but the rest of the world is not in on the act, and must assign some reason to it, such as luck, despite the odds. This is seen particularly in how the books went. If this all went down in real life, then Harry would of course be trained, and raised from birth as a soldier. There would be no other option. But that doesn't constitute a good story, to thus the illogical option is taken, and Harry is put with the Dursleys. The fandom needs to realize that at the end of the day, it wasn't Dumbledore who wanted Harry abused, it was Rowling who wanted Harry to be sympathized with and supported.

That aside, there are issues I have with the bash Dumbledore trope. The fact of the matter is, it is inherently a lazy shortcut for unoriginal authors to continue their plot. Evil! Dumbledore has the effect of providing a second enemy, a foil who acts out the intelligent enemy. And thus, we get two enemy's, Voldemort being the enemy of magic, and Dumbledore the enemy of intelligence. Dumbledore can only be defeated by intelligence, usually by tricking him into some political demise. And Voldemort can only be defeated by magic. This has a couple effects. Lazy writers use this to showcase Harry's traits, with the reasoning that if Harry could defeat such a smart wizard, then he himself must be smart. They then follow this up with a separation from Hermione and intensive studying to prove that Harry is smarter than the rest. I call this lazy, because it doesn't showcase Harry and his character development, it doesn't showcase it through his actions. In my mind, it is like having Harry take a (American) GED in one scene, and thus not have to writing about school, and education. Which itself is an annoyingly common trope. Another thing that this Evil!Dumbledore stereotype does, is it allows Harry to become independent. In my opinion a large amount of writers like to project with Harry as their target. And in that sense, a lot of the worse quality fics are nothing but original characters named Harry. The writer wants to be respected? Make Harry the heir to the founders, and don't forget to add trillions of Galleons. The writer wishes to be powerful? Give Harry the largest magical core that exists. The writer wants to be competant? Make Harry smooth and intelligent in all his dealings, buttering up Goblins, sticking Voldemort and dodging Dumbledore. The writer wants to be independent? Make Harry independent. But from what, is the crux of this post. Harry has no family. Harry's only superiors consist of the Hogwarts staff, but it isn't enough to insult Snape and get away with it. Dumbledore is the biggest person around, so making him bigger and badder, and devoting the fic to Harry getting out of his control fulfills their fantasy.

Now, I want to clear it up a bit. I have read good stories with the tropes I have listed. The tropes are not inherently worthless. The reason for my virulent hatred of them, is because they are so often used as an excuse for bad writing, and I cannot excuse that. Bad writing, lazy writing, are personally offensive to me. I am aware that I am a hypocrite, as the most popular fic I wrote has all of that, and worse writing than most besides. I hate it, but I don't delete it because I have to remind myself that I can do better.

Personal emotions aside, I have always found that I like Dumbledore better when he is good. When Dumbledore is a flawed, tragic old man carrying the weight of the world. He might be quirky, he might be funny, or take on the role as a teacher, or grandfather. But so long as he is not malicious in his actions, or malevolent, the story always turns out better.

Some examples:

linkffn(Circular Reasoning) linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) HPMOR linkffn(Deprived) linkffn(The Arithmancer) linkffn(Divided and Entwined) Even linkffn(Too Young to Die) counts to an extent.

TLDR: Writers love to take the HP world as they see it, and judge it by their logic, when their logic cannot truly apply. It is most often an excuse for lazy writing, and OP seems to recognize a lot of it.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** One of the flaws in young adult fiction is that adults end up needing to be pushed out of the way for the story to progress. My simple version of this is that " Aall adults in YA novels must be evil, incompetent, or both. If they were not, why would children have to solve anything? "

Dumbledore in canon falls victim to this rule and thus fanfiction writers take it to the extreme, often with good intentions, but poor execution.

IMO, Dumbledore was a great failure who ABSOLUTELY failed to live up to his reputation. I have ranted several times about this topic, so I won't bore you with more repetitions. Here are some links to my past comments:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/5pfii6/stopping_lord_voldemort/dcqtijj/][Why Dumbledore's final plan was crap and his actions in HBP CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT]]

Because of his ineffectiveness, he resorted to sacrificing children in desperation, and even then he failed to adequately prepare them. Being a 'good person' didn't excuse a leader's failure. Both Neville Chamberlain and Herbert Hoover were considered 'good people', but they were viewed as abject failures in history, and Dumbledore should be remembered the same way.

*** Isn't Neville Chamberlain's bad reputation the result of character assassination, though?

It's easy to point to Nazi Germany as obvious bad guys today, but back then, British people didn't know about the planned Holocaust, and didn't want to get into another World War just 20 years after the first one. And Neville did pursue a policy of rearmament even after signing the Munich Agreement.

*** Actually, Chamberlain gets a lot of flak he doesn't deserve. While it is true he initially followed a policy of appeasement, once it was realised that Germany was re-arming, he immediatelly begun secret war preparations for Britain - and once it became obvious that war was unavoidable, he resigned, fully aware he wasn't an appropriate PM for war.

I think there's another reason for an Evil!Dumbledore: More adversity for Harry. In most fanfics Harry becomes more competent than canon and that lends itself to making Dumbledore another obstacle to overcome.

  Because Dumbledore is mostly the sole way to feed Harry information that moves the plot along, he is blamed for with holding information and not raising him for warfare and whatever else.

I think this is a bit too simplistic. As someone who criticizes Dumbledore a lot my main point wouldn't be that he didn't raise Harry into some kind of super-warlock to defeat Voldemort. The point that Harry should have a childhood is a good one, but when viewing Harry through the "innocent child" lens Dumbledore's negligence becomes even more horrifying.

*** Yeah I do understand that Evil!Dumbledore does have some merits. In Hogwarts a Super!Harry doesn't have many obstacles to overcome; Quirrell, stone obstacles, basilisk, Tournament, and Voldemort's plots become trivial things to overcome especially if Harry is time traveling and does not have to solve any of the mystery surrounding these events. So in order to have some competent evil in Hogwarts the role goes to Dumbledore. But most fics with Evil!Dumbledore doesn't make him a real threat just something for Harry to bash and complain about, and where Dumbledore never even has a chance to ruin any of Harry's plans and whatnot.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11136995/1/Potter-Ever-After][Potter Ever After]] skewers Evil!Dumbledore like everything else, but its reasoning makes sense; basically Dumbledore as a super-powerful wizard has to be removed in order to let Harry Potter or Oliver Cromwell shine, because if he weren't removed he could just solve all the problems.

Thus, when a problem needs to be solved with firepower, Dumbledore has to be a moron, evil, out of the way, or some combination of all three. Alternatively, boss fights where Harry/Oliver & Dumbledore team up to whoop ass because the bad guy is just that tough.

So yeah, there's a reason Evil!Dumbledore exists, it's very hard to make Independent!Harry work without it. Although I suppose such fics could go the route of canon and let Dumbledore be a good guy, but inexplicably called away whenever Harry needs to do something by himself.

(Also, I was trying to come up with a clever way to say 'O.C.', as in Original Character, as in Mary Sue, and Oliver Cromwell came to mind. Does it work?)

  (Also, I was trying to come up with a clever way to say 'O.C.', as in Original Character, as in Mary Sue, and Oliver Cromwell came to mind. Does it work?)

Well, I began imagining a time traveling Harry Potter fighting Christmas with (Lord Protector) Oliver Cromwell.

Maybe choose someone less famous as the O.C. stand in?;)

*** Yeah I understand there are some merits, I just feel that the troupe is so overdone at this point that while it gives Harry a place to shine and think for himself it ultimately ends up taking more away from the story then it adds. Who knows though I have never been a fan of bashing of any character, and Evil!Dumbledore stories usually bash him liberally so that may color my opinion of them.
