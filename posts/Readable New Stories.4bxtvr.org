Are there any new stories, published within a month, that seem to have potential?


** linkffn(The Aurors by FloreatCastellum) is one that I find really interesting. There seem to be two different groups of antagonists with opposing agendas, which is something I haven't seen done much. Harry's characterization is also exactly how I imagine it to be post canon, which is really, really rare.

linkffn(Gryffindor Colors by EvilFuzzy9) is amusing Ron/Narcissa crack. Just started up.

Not this month, but hasn't been recommended before. linkffn(Rise of the Weasley Famiglia). CrimeBoss!Ron FTW. Written by the same guy who wrote Applied Cultural Anthropology.

*** I never realised how much I wanted Ron/Narcissa to happen before today, if only to see Draco collapse of stroke. Thank you for this.

  Ron never wanted to be a crime boss. Pity he was so good at it. Even if he did spend most of his time worrying about what would happen when his mother found out.

#+begin_quote
  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially not one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

  The reasoning of pureblood fanatics is incomprehensible to anyone halfway normal, and even Harry Potter is close enough to ordinary to find himself at a loss for how on earth Narcissa Malfoy so suddenly became Mrs. Ronald Weasley. [crackship, crackfic, crack premise; Roncissa, lemon-scented]

  An assassin goes around, killing off high profile targets everywhere. Nobody knows how he looks like. Nobody knows how he manages to overcome the best and oldest wards. One thing they do know is that he never fails. His name? Gabriel. / Dark story, not suited for children.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Edith Potter's life with her abusive family taught her two things. First - the only language some people understood was violence. Second - fear only lasts a generation; kindness lasts forever. The Girl Who Lived returns to magical Britain a cynical visionary; drawing in allies from all four houses for an end game neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort anticipated. Dark!Fem!Harry
