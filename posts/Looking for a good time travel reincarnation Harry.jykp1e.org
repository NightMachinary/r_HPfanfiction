I have just read the storms fairy which is a fic where Harry was reincarnated as Grindelwalds sister. But he wasn't a super op Mary sue, and he had suppressed most of his memories from HP. Does anyone know of a similar fic with timetravel?


** Hmm well not so much time travel but sorta at the same time. Just read and it will make sense. linkao3(To Live Is The Rarest Thing by Maeglin_Yedi)

  A disastrous trip to a waterpark (thanks, Dudley!) unleashes almost 200 lifetimes worth of memories, and now Harry is stuck as a ten-year-old while his soulmate is a wraith set on killing him.A very old and cynical Harry sets about correcting Tom's poor life-choices while avoiding Dumbledore and his Order's panicked searches for the Boy Who Disappeared.As far as Harry is concerned, the whole world can fuck off. He couldn't care less he's finally Harry Potter again, or that he can finally see his original loved ones again. The only thing that matters is getting Tom back safe and sane and with his soul intact.
