It makes me laugh. Maybe I should write a fanfiction where those two act more like The Office too. If only I had the necessary drugs to make me focus on writing a story for more than three chapters before giving up. Oh well, I always liked reading more than writing anyway.


** As Harry enters the headmaster's office it is plain that Dumbledore was just putting clothes on for he hurried the shinny robes over his shoulders as he fastened his belt.

"Oh, sorry professor, I didn't mean to intrude."

"No problem Harry, I was just putting some clothes on, but I'm ready now, we can proceed with our lesson." the old man said then turned to the middle of the room where Snape was standing impassive. "We'll talk later Severus."

The potions master nodded and left as if that was the most normal exchange ever.

** Whenever I read Snape-centric fics, I'm always amused by scenes where he interacts with Dumbledore in his office. While not really what Dumbledore's intention is, I always get the impression from Snape's pov that it seems like Dumbledore's one true goal in life is to be as obnoxious as possible. Things like being deliberately obtuse, intentionally misunderstanding what Snape is saying, and similar. Most commonly seen in SS&HP fics.

S: "Headmaster, he can't stay with his relatives!"

D: "Oh, so you are volunteering?"

S: "I never sai--"

D: "Splendid! Here are the necessary papers to transfer the guardianship of Harry to you."

S: "...Can't you give him to the Weasleys or something?"

D: "Oh, that's a good idea! I'm sure playdates can be arranged. I'll tell Molly to reach out to you."

EDIT: Harry's New Home is /kind of/ like that, with Dumbledore subtly steering the conversation in that direction and Snape objecting once he realizes he's walking right into it. Less comedic and on-the-nose though. linkffn(4437151)

never in book one

I believe the headmaster is actually the one who enters Snape's office when he is rambling about the flying car and I think they might have met up when discussing the attacks

don't think harry himself even went to the headmaster's office in book three

book four only had them together in the champion selection and the finale interrogation of Crouch

book five I don't think Snape was there at all during Dumbledore's escape or the night of snakey-snakey

book six and seven I don't think they interacted either aside from dumbledore's portrait and flashbacks and so on

Those flashbacks did include Dumbledore convincing Snape to kill him and telling him that Harry needed to die. I don't remember if those were the same conversation or two conversations in one flashback, but I am pretty sure that they took place in Dumbledore's office.

Snape was outside Dumbledore's office book 4 when Harry was running to tell him about Crouch, so it stands to reason he had been in there. Dumbledore asks Snape to kill him in his office book 6. He's also in Dumbledore's office at least once before he's an official teacher.

*** I have a feeling that this is entirely fanon. Usually when Snape is present in headmaster's office, all he does is insult Harry and his father and call him pampered/arrogant etc. He rarely, if ever, has an actual use except for getting insulted by Indie!Harry (then drawing his wand, getting blasted/stunned, "Dumbledore, restrain your pet Death Eater" etc). Then when Harry asks why Snape is even there, the author throws in a "He has my full trust" as a trigger for some good old Dumbledore bashing. If anyone is supposed to be there, it should be McG since she's the DEPUTY headmistress. I haven't read many Slytherin Harry stories but I'm guessing that in a fair number of those, she IS there and plays the part of Snape.
