** There aren't really any in the traditional sense, which is to say that Katie is the generic romance interest for Harry rather than Ginny/Hermione/Daphne/Whatever, and takes place during normal canon years. Usually most pairings have the one obligatory canon rehash that hits all the important points while being enjoyable to read, yet this one does't.

Which, I think is a shame because there is lot of potential there for the pairing. It's actually near the top of my list for pairings that I think are the most probably to happen if JKR wasn't strictly following a premade outline made years in advance.

** Katie isn't usually a prime candidate for shipping as she's sorta 'Ginny-lite'; another Gryffindor Quidditch player with no other distinguishing characteristics than a friend named Leann and being susceptible to Imperius curse.

Oddly, I've found quite a few Katie/Marcus Flint stories. Not sure what that says about anything, but they're out there.

  Harry's attraction to Parvati leads him to take his Yule Ball preparation much more seriously and his night is changed as a result. Includes an awesome Ron, an interesting Parvati and a drunk Katie Bell. Oh, and what's a Yule Ball fic without a little Fleur Delacour?

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
