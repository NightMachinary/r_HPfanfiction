I am planning a sort of rewrite of the series where I fix all the problems with it and try to make it as good as possible. I do not support bashing or OOC writing, it takes the fine away. So, when I say "fix" I am talking about plot holes and character incongruencies instead of "Make that evil coot pay for what he did!"

I plan to stay as close as possible to major canon events and plot points. So, for example, Horcrux hunt will still be there in some way and Sirius would still be wrongly imprisoned.

I am in very early outlining, so I still need to decide on approach best way to avoid plagiarism. Maybe different POVs, or keeping some dialogues but rewriting prose entirely... or skimming over some parts in canon. I am still not sure, and it is not that important at the moment. What I need from you fellow redditors, is to throw at me all the things that need to be changed. At the moment I am just looking for Book 1 things

So far I have:

- Dumbledore leaving just a letter makes no sense. He should have talked to the Dursleys.
- Abuse at the Dursleys should be lowered a notch or two. Dumbledore could have done more even if he still needed him there. More ignoring than abuse. -Lupin should have visited Harry or had a rock solid excuse not to. Even if they tried to keep magic a secret from Harry before his letter. -Need to find a way to make Sirius imprisonment believable. Dumbledore not hearing Sirius is a stretch but could work with the circumstances, however the whole laughing and not saying anything about Pettigrew seems off from Sirius side. -Dumbledore wanted to have Harry go through stone investigation, that can be sort of explained. But he needed to have had more control over it and have backup plans in case things went badly. Also have plans to keep Quirrel from harming kids. -Snape abuse should not be permitted in the level it got to.
- I am taking the daunting task of making world and Hogwarts wizarding population make sense

What am I missing?


** For point three the easiest way to explain it away is that Hogwarts is the /best/ school in the UK, but not the /only/ school.

As for book one plot holes... one of the more egregious that I can think of is McGonagall dismissing their concerns out of hand. Either have her legit investigate or have Quirrel be confounding the staff all year to assume that their protections will keep the stone safe.

*** I was thinking on making Quirrel less cartoonish. And more skillful at fooling people.

I am actually going to make Hogwarts the only school, and no homeschooled people. So I am really going to make it big. And at least a second professor per subject. I can totally pull a 20k magical population with something over 1k students at Hogwarts. Also, limiting number of professional Quidditch teams to something like 3 in the uk.

My own headcanon is that most of the Quidditch teams are semi-pro, and use the old 'Gentlemen & Players' model of old-fashioned cricket clubs. Maybe one or two all-pro teams, the Harpies being the prime candidate for this one.

The Cannons, meanwhile, are utterly devoted to the Corinthian Spirit. They not only refuse to have any professional players, they often fill out the starting lineup with whoever was least hungover from last night's shenanigans in the members' bar.

*** :o Why DOESN'T McGonagall ever investigate that even in fanfics?! Why can't we get a badass McGonagall vs Quirrell/Voldemort fight! I only ever see SNAPE going down there, sometimes even accompanying the fricking kids (which is dumb, he should make them stay in their dorms away from harm!).

** Maybe the fact that three 11 year olds could easily break through the teacher's enchantments protecting the Philosophers stone. That whole scene was a little too convenient. And also, the fact that Dumbledore rewarded Neville points for standing up to his friends. How did Dumbledore know this happened?

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** The Marauder's map. We're supposed to believe the twins have had that map for two years, and they've never seen Peter pettigrew's name on it? Please. So why exactly did Quirrel not use the basilisk to try to get past fluffy? Ginny had no problems controlling the thing, and she was possessed, Quirrel actually has Riddle with him, it should be easier.

*** Marauder's map has often been explained as Fred and George not knowing all Ron's classmates and dismissing him as one.

With regards to Fluffy, I think Voldemort could have easily dealt with him with a killing curse... no need to bring in an ancient monster who could potentially kill/hurt others... especially when you are trying to be as quiet as possible.

**** I don't mean Ron, I meant Percy. The guy talks, a lot. Never mentioned a pettigrew before. The twins got the map during Their 1st year(89-90), that's more than a year they had to catch a glimpse of the rat near Percy. And then later see that same name near Ron.

I'd rather bring in the ancient monster instead of a troll. A troll that can be very easily traced back to Quirrel, by the staff anyway. And yes, AK would make way more sense. My guess is he wanted to leave the path as untouched as possible. That goes out the window if Fluffy is found dead the next time they show up to feed him.

***** I think purposes were different. Basilisk is to be discreet and break havoc at the same time. In year one what Voldemort wanted was the stone to get back to life. And on Halloween he didn't want to be discreet, he wanted people to see the troll so he could go for the third floor corridor.

***** I can't wrap my head around how going through the trouble of waking up a basilisk to get past a mere cerberus is a good idea.

A basilisk seems like an entire plot to be explored on its own. Oh wait...

*** I think that many of the things in Book 1 can be attributed to Dumbledore's intentions. Though it is still off that Dumbledore left so many possible problems to the luck,many things could have gone wrong there. Also, the professors were surely more informed of Dumbledore's intentions there than on the rest of the books
