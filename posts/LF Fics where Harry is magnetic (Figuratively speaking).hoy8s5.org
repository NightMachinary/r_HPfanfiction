So, there's a fic series called The Quiet Ones [Link below] about a Harry who grew up in Azkaban due to some magic (the story goes into it) happening and basically befriends/becomes close to all the Death Eaters there - to the point where there's some debate as to what they'll do when the war starts up again. I'm looking for fics like that. Fics where Harry is magnetic and draws people to his side (could be an independent side, could be Dumbledore's side, etc), especially people who wouldn't otherwise give a fuck. I'd take fics where Harry is an inspiring and charismatic leader as well, but I'm primarily interested in fics where Harry befriends or recruits people who'd hate him - Death Eaters, Magical Beings, The Apathetic, etc.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

  Expectations are funny things as the Wizarding world learns when introduced to a Harry that has inherited James' confidence and Lily's charm and a complete disregard to anything that doesn't affect him. Who cares about rocks and stuttering professors when they've got dragons and godfathers who didn't wait thirteen years to break out of prison to play with?

  What would happen if Draco had feelings for Hermione Granger long before the Golden Trio are captured by snatchers and brought to Malfoy Manor? When he sees her being tortured by Bellatrix, he risks everything to save her life. But things are never that simple. Draco POV.

** It's sorta a minor thing, and Harry's not really aware of it, but-

Linkao3(Death is but the Next Greatest Adventure)

One of Harry's friends gets a chapter from his pov near the beginning and he describes it. It shows up a lot though.

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal?(Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death)

*** That is interesting. And he doesn't have to be aware of it, it just has to be there. :)

The tags say it has sexual content. How smutty is it, and can I skip the smut without losing plot or characterisation? And if it is smutty, is Harry under-age by US Standards? (I think that's 18?). Rule 8, after all. :)

**** I don't think there's much smut? I'm currently re-reading it bc it went on hiatus a while ago and I recently remembered it. From where I've gotten too, it's more a passing mention bc Death's a bitch sometimes. I'd think you'd be able to skip it though, the author doesn't seem the type to focus on it much.
