Through some inexplicable plot shite, Harry can never, ever go to Dumbledore and convince him he's a time traveler with his impossible knowledge and work against what he knows is a huge threat during the First Wizarding War. Anyone have any good fics that actually have them working together?

I see why you advised us to login.

Guests can't read without registering as they see deleted chapter notice otherwise. Was about to abandon the rec before search the site as it was new to me and ran into the issue with all works tested.

Edit

Happy cake day

** Tapestry of Fate by Minxie linkao3(10140137)

Escaping the Paradox by Meri linkao3(2060)

Return of the Prodigal by Lachesis linkao3(7876201)

All of these have a Dumbledore who knows that Harry is a time-traveller. Note that these are not Peggysue time travel where Harry goes back to his child's body: he goes back in his current/older body, to before he is born (Marauder era).
