Hi, I'm looking to read the best romance fanfics out there; the one where the writing is so good you get butterflies for the characters involved.

I don't want a Draco fic and I'd really prefer something not Harry and Hermione; however everything else is fair game! Hit me with your best shot people (please) üôèüèº


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/][Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19]] is an amazing post war love story between strong but sad single dad harry and the best written oc I have ever encountered in all my (many) years of reading fanfiction. It is not complete yet, but it is in progress. The plot is fully planned out and the author works on it consistently, that said the updates come at a glacial pace. Amazing story, 10/10, probably still gonna ve reading it in 2025.

** Why not Draco?

Isolation by Bex-chan it's one of the best fics of the Fandom.
