Was researching the canon on life debts after seeing yet another fic that said that the savior must put themselves into mortal danger for one to be created. This is not true, by the way: both of the life debts mentioned in canon did not have the savior in danger. All Dumbledore said is, "When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates a certain bond between them." /(Are we surprised, at this point, that the concept is never more fully fleshed-out?)/

Saving another's life is apparently broadly-defined: Harry created a life debt between himself and Peter simply by convincing Sirius not to kill him. (In my opinion, Remus actually did more to stop that, since he physically held Sirius back, but I guess Harry is the one who got him to give up trying.)

But then she says in a 2005 interview that *Ginny did NOT incur a life debt when Harry saved her in the Chamber of Secrets.* Why not? JKR refused to say, claiming it would give away a plot point from book seven. (If anybody who has read book seven more than once --- I may someday force myself to read it again, but today is not that day --- can clarify, I'd appreciate it. But I rather think there's no actual explanation there.)

No mention has ever been made, one way or the other, whether Arthur has a life debt from Harry possibly saving his life by reporting his vision of Nagini's attack. I believe that both Dumbledore and Molly say outright that, had help not gotten to him so quickly (which it wouldn't have without that information), he would have died. I know Molly thanks Harry.

/(Note that life debts from Arthur and Ginny are plot points in many a Weasley-bashing story.)/

Nor is any mention made of a life debt from Harry saving Ron with the bezoar in HBP, but that's not as big a deal since that would have been offset by Ron saving Harry from drowning in DH.

Arguably, everybody at the school in second year owes Harry a life debt for killing the basilisk --- except, ironically, those already petrified. But maybe not since they weren't in imminent danger, although that was never stated as criteria.

** In canon life debts are an entirely social/cultural thing and have no magical reality/existence. So no doubt different wizards have different opinions on when they arise and what they mean. Somewhat like how people have different opinions on whether the milk goes in before or after the water.

******** There's no real physical reason why you couldn't brew coffee or tea in a mix of water/milk, should you want to. It just would need an adjustment in method, and milk isn't ideal to do so.

(Eg, coffee is often brewed at close to boiling water temp, and that's obviously bad for milk. Black tea is likewise brewed at high temps - and the lower temp teas are ones that seem quite odd to me to add milk to)

I know people have used milk for cold brewing coffee, though that again should be adjusted due to the extraction profiles changing (milk being better at extracting hydrophobic components of the grounds). Plus you probably need to make it a lot stronger than you would for regular coffee/milk, given the stronger taste of milk.

**** Yes, but also no. Music also falls into that category, as does love. The point underlying this viewpoint is that there is magic in humanity itself, in the things that make us human.

Like, when Dumbledore says love is the most powerful magic there is, he isn't talking about fanon "Love Shield!" ideas. He means that love motivates people to action. It's "the pen is mightier than the sword" type stuff which should not be taken too literally.

We've not seen a life debt once have a magical/real effect. Indeed, we see Peter Pettigrew kidnap Harry and cause him significant harm while owing him a life debt.

What does happen in DH, however, is that Peter's subjective sense of owing Harry results in him hesitating in an important moment. And at that moment of hesitation, his silver hand notes his effective betrayal of Voldemort and kills him for that betrayal.

I don't care to read a story where Harry is divvying up who owes him how many life debts. It's such a minor thing.

That's just flat-out wrong, based on what she wrote in the diary at the time (whatever excuses she may have made later):

#+begin_quote
  "Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who'd been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back." (Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 17: "The Heir of Slytherin")
#+end_quote

Not only that, but she DESTROYED his belongings when she RANSACKED his area of the dorm.

#+begin_quote
  The contents of Harry's trunk had been thrown everywhere. *His cloak lay ripped* on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.

  Harry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on *a few loose pages* of /Travels with Trolls/. (Chapter 14, Cornelius Fudge; emphasis mine)
#+end_quote

Eleven years old is old enough to recognize that her actions were wrong, and thus she should feel guilty. In the face of clear danger, *that she believes she may be responsible for*, she... does her eleven-year-old best to make sure nobody finds out.

Chit, according to thefreedictionary-dot-com, is "a dismissive term for a girl who is immature or who lacks respect" --- in this case, BOTH immature and lacking respect for others' belongings AND safety. I stand by my use of the term.

At no point did I say she didn't feel guilty. In fact, I said I'm sure she did and it's backed up by text. Other things I said was that her feelings weren't as strong as Pettigrew's, who actually got people murdered, and that's why it's different for her.

** I'd argue your mistake is being too specific. Or perhaps also, too vague, in reading -- as you note, all Dumbledore talks about is "a certain bond". There are no "life debts". And this becomes more than just semantics the moment you load up that term with existing ideas of what it is.

It is never specified what this debt does or does not do. (Which, as a side note, means this is yet another failing of the wiki. "Magically binding", "obliged to repay", those are all inventions with [citation needed].) Given the way magic works in HP, and also being in line with what Dumbledore says, I wouldn't be surprised at all if it's very metaphorical. Snape "can't bear" being in James' debt, so he protects Harry. Harry reminds Pettigrew of the debt, and he hesitates. Those are decisions out of their own free will, just a mental state of mind that entraps them, not magic. FF, as usual, has the unfortunate habit of making it mechanical, "A does B", "X for Y", when it's actually anything but.

What we are left with is the "certain bond" -- the magic of gratitude, of guilt, or duty. Nothing more or less.

I mean really, shouting "Look out!" could conceivably cause a life debt by canon rules. People must have life debts left, right, and center... which makes it even more strange that only two were ever mentioned.

****** There was this fic I read which had its own life debt theory that made sense to me. It depends on how the person felt when he was saved. If the person who was saved believed that his/her savior would not have helped and yet they did, then it constitutes the debt.

It kinda makes sense. You expect your family, friends to help you in dire straits. You expect an auror to drive a dementor away. You expect healers to help save you when you are almost dying. You expect teachers to warn you when you are trying out something that might have fatal consequences. But you never expect your foe to save you from the aftermath of his own spell nonetheless.

Magic is all about intent, you might be an arrogant ponce but you can't hide the true feelings from magic. Subconsciously or deep down it was established that the savior went out of their way and now you owe them. With friends you can say "I owe you for saving me back there" but your magic knows that were the tables reversed, you would have done the same and you will do the same (without being forced to) in the future too. Hence no life debts among friends and comrades.

I mostly agree with this. Family, yes, always. As for friends, I believe there would be and exception here. For example, if a bull is running at my friend to gore and kill him, and I pull him out of harms way, this would be expected from a friend, so would not constitute a life debt. On the other hand, if a very evil wizard is in the process of draining my friends life force, and I have to not only put my life in peril to defeat the wizard to save my friend, but also also have to fight a 60 foot basilisk. Now my life is in even more peril to the point there is a vert good chance that I will die. I think something like that would constitute a life debt. Especially considering, that if not for Fawkes crying on Harry's arm, Harry would actually have died saving Ginny.

Pettigrew has no problem harming Harry in order to resurrect Voldemort or almost strangle him until Harry reminds him that it was he who saved his life. Also, as we learn from Snape's memories, he was acting on Dumbledore's orders to help keep Harry alive. I think it comes from Dumbledore and it's one of those instances where he explains mundane elements that trigger a certain response in people's brain as magic. He refers to music as magic and he also says that words are an inexhaustible source of magic.

** Maybe life debts can only be formed in the shrieking shack /s.

With regards to what JKR says, she could be referring to Harry being a horcrux. Saving someone from a different horcrux (or Voldemort) may not result in a life debt since Harry is so connected to them. This would then mean that no life debt would be formed as the Diary and Nagini are both horcruxes. None of the other 2nd years were in immenent peril anyway since the school was being shut down and they'd go home.

I don't have a great response for Ron, but at that point they'd saved each other loads of times. Maybe it doesnt work for friends or family. James and Snape hated each other and Harry hated Pettigrew.

I think that as long as you define your own rules and are consistent about them, it doesn't really matter what canon says.

** So my answer has already been stated but the life debts as I understand them from the books are not a magically enforced thing. It's basically how people feel about them. In this case very much like in real life. If someone saves your life, it can create a “bond” but that is completely up to the person who was saved and how they feel about it with all the numerous variations involved. There is quite literally no consistency in what creates or constitutes a life debt nor how it is “paid back”.

**** Like I said, I couldn't remember the specific circumstances, just that Ron claimed it was the second time.

The first time Harry definitely saved his life by going back for him.

******* I can see him doing that. It's because Ron truly didn't believe that Malfoy saved them. We all can agree that Harry would definitely think that Malfoy saved him by not outing his identity (Harry's character is like that) especially after their sectum sempra encounter. But when I said debt being paid, it was just Harry being Harry and not the life debt acting (cuz people who have saving others complex don't need magic to bind them to it) (so based on the theory I mentioned in other reply, debt might have been formed but need not act as Harry acted on it by his own free will, so magic being aware of his basest desire, didn't act up).

As for Ron, his mind works differently to me. (My opinions have strictly been swayed by all the fics that have Ron from a git to a king 😁). I think he is too simple minded.... Slytherin = evil idiots, so Malfoy didn't recognise them due to whatever hermione did or that slimy ferret was afraid for his own hide or something like that. (I know i sound biased but... I'll like hermione.... Like ALWAYS) (but I should not betray Daphne..) (uhhh... Why does it have to be so complicated)

Well, yeah because he didn't. He did identify Ron and Hermione and tried to kill the trio (along with his mother) when they made their escape

But inconvenient canon didn't /really/ happen amirite ?

*** We have almost no information, just "what Dumbledore says."

The concept that an unfulfilled life debt passes to your heirs is incredible. Does this include legal heirs, or just your children? What if you have no children? If you have more than one child, would it be your oldest child who "inherits" it, or is it just out there for any of your children to "claim"? We don't know!

Even if Harry's inherited Snape's life debt (some have speculated it was fulfilled when he went to Dumbledore and asked to have the Potters warned/hidden), then it would have been fulfilled during Harry's first quidditch game, when he cast the counter-curse to Quirrell's murder attempt.

*** Totally agree. Best list of fanon criteria I've seen is from a Dumbledore-bashing fic, wherein he tries to claim a life debt from Harry for "saving" him from Quirrell:

#+begin_quote
  He died by Harry's own hands though Dumbledore had tried to claim he had pulled the man off Harry and thereby saved Harry's life and establishing a life debt between Harry and himself. Harry knew that wasn't true. Well, he knew now. Research had told him exactly what life debts were and how they were established. There were, as it turned out, several things wrong with the old man trying to claim such a debt against Harry. Not the least of which, was the fact that as his Headmaster, it was the old man's duty to save Harry should Harry find himself in mortal peril due to something or someone in the school. Second, you can't claim such a debt against a person if you are the reason they are in mortal peril to begin with, and he was. Finally, the person wishing to claim the debt has to place themselves in mortal peril equal to the peril facing the one they intend to save. Dumbledore, who hadn't even been present at the time, met none of that criteria.
