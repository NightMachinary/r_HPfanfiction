Somehow, Vernon finds out that Harry is obscenely famous in The Wizarding World. I see it playing out during one of the rare outings where the family is somewhere with Harry tagging along, and a random wizard approaches them, gushing over meeting â€˜the famous Harry Potter'. Even though he is repulsed by the Wizards' freakishness, Vernon is intrigued to learn that Harry has a gaggle of followers that he doesn't even know about. Vernon is in upper management, after all, and he recognizes an opportunity when he sees it.

Since Vernon seems like the type of person who is always looking for an angle to exploit, he glad-hands the wizard who recognized Harry, learning all he can in a bit to turn Harry's fame into riches. The star-struck wizard agrees to take Harry and Vernon to Diagon Alley. Vernon immediately latches onto his first money making scheme when they go into Flourish and Blotts - suing the absolute pants off of everyone who is using Harry's name and likeness without his permission in the books and merchandise which are so popular.

Having parted ways with their guide, Vernon asks others in Diagon Alley for the location of a reputable solicitor nearby. After a meeting with a Wizarding solicitor, Vernon uses his shrewd business acumen and formulates a plan to quickly establish control over Harry's novelty properties.

Of course, poor Harry's head is swimming over this, but more importantly he's unhappy that his aunt and uncle lied to him about who his parents were and how they died. Vernon cooks up a story that isn't far from the truth; they were instructed not to tell Harry about his magical upbringing or to divulge anything about his parents, so they came up with a lie instead. Vernon admits they could have made it more respectful, but what's done is done. Vernon plays Harry like a client, turning on the compassion and sympathy to seal the deal.

Vernon explains that he can't keep all this money for himself by law anyway, since it's Harry's image and likeness that's being used. Harry and Vernon become business partners and Vernon will become his manager, since Harry isn't of age.

The Goblins of Gringotts never saw anything like Vernon Dursley coming, with his crazy muggle financial plans and a ruthless understanding of the currency exchange rate. Vernon grouses about the 40% he'll be obligated to set aside for Harry, but with all the money he'll make from this endeavor, Vernon will finally be able to realize his lifelong dream and start a company of his own.

Over the next three or four years before Harry starts Hogwarts, Vernon chaperones Harry to autograph signings, book signings, public appearances, ribbon cuttings, hand-shaking events and literally any other thing where wizards will pay galleons to see the Boy-Who-Lived. This might even attract the attention of Gilderoy Lockhart, who invites them to go on a book tour together with him. I even picture Vernon and Gilderoy becoming friends, picking each other's brains for marketing advice.

So what are the effects of all of this? Well for Harry, he goes from being the resented scullery maid to being the face of the franchise. I don't see him ever being entirely comfortable with his Fame, but he finally gets used to it long before he goes to Hogwarts. Things are chill with his aunt and uncle and Dudley. Dudley actually thinks it's pretty cool that his cousin is famous although he doesn't really understand why. As long as the food and distractions keep coming, Dudley is fine with leaving Harry alone.

As long as the goose keeps laying golden eggs, Vernon knows better than to treat it poorly. They already treated Harry pretty crappy up to the point before they could cash in on his Fame, So Vernon decides to treat him decently so he will go along with the business. Vernon got over his views on freakishness pretty quickly when he got the first cheques from Gringotts and the keys to the new 3-storey, 5 bedroom place in Shepperton.

Since Vernon was already spoiling Dudley with Vernon's money, he has no problem spoiling Harry with Harry's money, so Harry's Diagon Alley trip after he gets his letter becomes the stuff of legend. A ridiculously expensive, 5 compartment trunk with so many enchantments on it that it vibrates in The 9th Dimension, A Quantum Nimbus 2001, bespoke everything... just, anything and everything to make the Malfoys look like paupers.


** This is a great idea for a prompt. Maybe Vernon uses his new riches to try to get in with the upper crust of English society - instead of sending Dudley to smeltings he goes to Harrow/Eton? - and hilarity ensues.

** There's a fic where some random wizard sees Harry and uses him to advertise toys. The Dursley's get a huge mansion and tons of money, the wizard gets rich, and Harry is mostly left to himself. I think it ends with the wizard skipping town with his share of the wealth, the gringotts seizing all of Dursley's stuff. They go to jail and Harry is adopted by a wizard family. Amelia boned may have been the one investigating them

** This is a really good idea for a prompt. Wow. What POV would this be ideal to write with? Just asking because recently school has killed all my creativity as a fanfiction author, so I need some way to get out of my writer's block.

*** I mean Harry is the main character of the story so it's hard not to write from his POV when he's involved, but it's hard to write children, especially when they are 7 or 8 years old, so Vernon would be much easier. It would actually be interesting to portray the internal conflict between his desire to 'Stamp Out The Boys freakishness' versus his 180 attitude change towards wizards because good heavens, look how much money there is to be made.

Wizards have never applied the full media blitz of the marketing department of a corporation to a Wizarding product. I imagine Vernon might even employ a muggle marketing firm, giving them the name of a phony celebrity and using their marketing ideas in The Wizarding World.

People forget that Vernon is the CEO of the company he works at. He's a blustering two-dimensional villain in a children's book (like Matilda's parents) but the man didn't get where he was by being an idiot.

Petunia might not like it at first but she'll quickly change her tune when they start driving a Bentley and living the Posh life. They're both so obsessed with keeping up with the Joneses and that kind of money changes hearts and Minds.

**** I agree, it's harder to write children. Too often I would see in review sections of other fanfics that the author is making the child sound too mature like an adult or having a 3 or 4 year old speak so sophisticatedly. Thank you for the tip. The prompt is really good.
