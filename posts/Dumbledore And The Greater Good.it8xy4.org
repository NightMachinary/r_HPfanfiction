It seems like every second fanfiction I read nowadays has Dumbledore saying, 'For the greater good' or something similar. But does he ever say this in canon? I know it was Grindewald's saying and that Dumbledore believed in it when he was younger but I don't think old, kind and wise Dumbledore ever says something like this.


** Canonically, he actually may be the author of the phrase, or the one who isolate it from ordinary talk (HPDH, chapter 18, “The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore”), WHEN HE WAS SIXTEEN. However, we have no proof he ever used it ever since, especially because it was so much misused by Grindelwald later.

We have absolutely no evidence he ever uttered the phrase seriously since, and it seems (chapter 35, “King's Cross”) he regretted his friendship (or whatever it was) with Grindelwald ever since, so it seems ridiculous he would ever say it. Like somebody casually declaring “Arbeit March Frei” after The Second World War.

** Literally the only direct 'link' between Big D and the Greater Good phrase was someone's eulogy during Albus' funeral. Something to the effect of "He always worked for the greater good of others" or something. Not a reference to the Grindelwald slogan, just a general comment about him being selfless.

He could've developed it before or with Grindelwald during their association, but we don't really know for certain.

But otherwise, it's a common Knight Templar style justification for doing things generally disapproved of by society. If Dumbledore is the type to kill a child to save millions, then he'll likely be the type to have that sort of mindset. "We do terrible things for the best of reasons." and all that.

** I think it's mentioned all of twice in connection with Dumbledore - once in the eulogy where it's completely unconnected to Grindelwald's catchphrase, and once in the King's Cross afterlife where he outright /rejects/ the philosophy, talking about his regrets for ever having followed it.
