Like it says in the title. It doesn't have to be Harry/Tom or anything, could be a teacher/student or parent/child relationship instead, or even a disassociative identity disorder type thing.

Preferences for canon ship, and no character bashing.


** i LOVE this trope, I wish there were more. There's:

linkffn(11762850) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/][Accidental Horcrux]] if bot doesn't work;\\
And this ones on ao3, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1618564][Devil you know]]

Those are the ones I remember, I hope you enjoy them as much as I did

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** This is almost certainly /not/ what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12355543/1/One-Punch-Wizard][/One Punch Wizard/]] features a brief scene with Harry's horcrux displaying sentience. Given the nature of the fic, though, I'm pretty sure it's just a throwaway gag with no real impact in the story.

  Everyone knows that wizarding children often take on an aspect of magic during their childhood. Innate specialties. Children of quidditch players might be able to fly without a broom for a time, those raised by fisherman might be able to manipulate water with great ease. Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts able to heal from any injury. At least he's got Tom keeping him company.

** There's an old fic named Abraxas that has sorta that. Can't link it via the bot because there are probably several fics with that name. It has the Horcrux contact Harry after the DoM. Harry ends up absorbing it. Eventual godlike!Harry, but done really well.

Just do yourself a favour and stop reading when the author tells you to. The whole bit after the final battle was... something else. Something I'd rather never read.
