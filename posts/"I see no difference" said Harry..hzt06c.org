Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, "I see no difference."

Harry looked at Snape with fury. He took out his wand and cursed Snape with a spell.

Snape completely covered in grease.

"Potter, what you've done" moved threateningly towards Harry.

"I see no difference, Professor" calmly replied Harry.

** And then Harry took a match and set the oil on Fire.

He was then sentenced to the Dementors kiss, but the dementor only ate the Horcrux, making him the first in history to survive the dementors kiss. And since the sentence was the kiss instead of death the Ministry couldn't try again as he already had served it, and thus he became even more famous. But the experience led him to a eight months coma making him lose the rest of the tournament, which may or not have actually been caused by unspeakables wanting to study Harry.

Incidentally without him Voldemort didn't manage to find any other resurrection ritual and the Homunculus short life-spam ran it's course and he was again trapped as a spirit.

Wormtail got drunk one night, wandered in the Gaunt Shack, took the ring and promptly died from the curse.

Barty Crouch was found out when he threw a fit over ‚Äúthat traitor Snape ruining his master's plans‚Äù between the giving of Harry's sentence and its execution. Neville found and killed him in a fit of rage, the whole thing was swept under the rug by Fudge. Neville didn't complain about getting away with murder and his grandmother was very proud.

With his remaining two somewhat loyal Death Eaters outside Azkaban dead and his body destroyed Voldemort never managed to re-gain a body. Eventually he got tired of being bodiless and grew to regret ever making Horcruxies, accidentally re-unifying his soul and thus dying in agony.

And so the war was averted at the cost of a spiteful man-child's life, it seems a fair exchange.

The End.

******* Yup. And it's not his fault he lost his sanity. Horcruxes are at fault here. And considering that he was an orphaned teen with very questionable morals that lived in a LONDON orphanage (during WW11 and the great depression, no less), it wasn't really his fault that he was afraid of death or made a Horcrux. He was just an abused, hated boy at the wrong place and time. Now, that doesn't excuse what he did, but it did give an understandable reason. In most courts, people who have mental illnesses are put in a mental health center, so why not Tom? Also, Dumbledore is really the one at fault for thinking a child was pure evil and not even trying to help the poor kid. So, yes, Tom has potential to be a good person. Maybe it's because I see myself in him. We have lots of similarities, and if he had someone to actually help him, he could have been a decent member of society working as Minister of Magic by now.

******** Exactly!! Thank you!! Dumbledore was at fault there, yes. He could have been thinking with good intentions, but as soon as Tom went to Slytherin, Albus started to see him as pure evil. He was 11 for fucks sake, he could have been taught better if /he'd have been taught/.

If you're the reason someone becomes a villain, you have no right to condemn them.
