I read it on AO3 and I can't remember much about it. Here's what I do remember. As Voldemort is coming out of the cauldron something happens that makes him not want to kill Harry, but instead ends up hugging him while still naked. I'm pretty sure Harry tells him to put some clothes on or has a thought like "He's naked and hugging me," or something to that effect. It might be a time travel fix it or a true mates fic. I think they end up as lovers eventually. I thought it was A Hop, Skip, and a Jump by Genuka, but it's not. Any ideas?


** There's one with Fem!Voldemort with a very similar premise.

**** It's an interesting premise, because she'd basically be the Uber-Yandere to Harry.

**** It's inspired by another popular FemVoldemort story, but with shipping. It's quite decent, at least when Voldemort gets her Libido under control by chapter ~5.
