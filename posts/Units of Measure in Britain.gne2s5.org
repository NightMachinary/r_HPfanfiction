In everyday life during the 90s, would people use Imperial or Metric measurements in Britain and would the answer be different between adults and children?

I've been under the impression that Britain, much like my native Canada, is a bit of an odd duck when it comes to imperial vs metric measurements in everyday life... While metric is the official system, we tend to keep using imperial anyway and that many of us, even if we were born after the switch the metric, are often more comfortable with imperial.

It does depend on what we're actually measuring, however. IE some people prefer Celsius for temperature, others still use Fahrenheit (and some weirdos like myself change their mind depending on the season). Feet for shorter distances, Km for longer ones. I also convert things in my head at the grocery store - volume in metric is fine, but 500g? That's a bit less than half a pound, though this could be because I remember when the local deli counter changed to metric (it was well over a decade after Canada went metric).

Is this true in Britain as well? What do people prefer to use?


** Temp is most commonly celsius. A body temperature thermometer might have farenheit as an option; some ovens are F only; the day's temperature will always be celsius.

Road distances are imperial -- yards (eg, for roadworks ahead signs) and miles -- but shorter distances might be measured in metres, though that can depend on age and situation. I (31yo) measure myself in feet, my bedroom in metres, and the distance to the river from my house as half a mile.

Stones & pounds (occasionally just pounds) are more common than metric for measuring your weight, but bags of sugar, flour, etc are sold in (kilo)grams; cooking recipes could come in either; scales (kitchen and bathroom) will have metric and imperial measurements. Most bottled drinks are in metric, but milk is sold by the pint (you do find metric, but that usually means it was imported; more likely to be found in privately owned small shop than big brand superstores). Bottles of alcoholic drinks are also metric, but at the pub you order a (half)pint (even if you order a non-alcoholic drink from the tap at a pub, it'll be in pint glasses).

LOL. So the same sort of weirdness we have here: my bedroom and I would get measured in feet, while the distance to the highway from my house is two clicks (kilometers). And now that you've mentioned it, I don't think I've ever seen an oven that uses C before, so its a good thing that our food packaging still shows both temperatures.

A nice confusing example you guys are setting for the commonwealth :P

**** Ah yes, and dont forget the gas oven, which just uses gas marks (1-7 or 8) instead of temperatures. Also our car fuel is priced at pence per litre, but you worry about mileage per gallon.

** There are a few things that are pretty much standard:

Distances on roads: Imperial\\
Measuring the various characteristics of humans: Imperial\\
Some liquids (beer, milk): Imperial\\
Other liquids (fruit juice, squash): Metric\\
Most food and drink: Metric\\
Temperature: Metric\\
Speed: Road signs are all Imperial

But having said that, people of a certain age will use Imperial for food and drink too. My mum gets really cross that she can't buy half a pound of butter, for instance.

Also, technically, all food is sold in metric because of an EU directive from a few years back that a certain type of person got really upset about until they had the new-look bottles gently pointed out to them and they simply said "1.13652 l" and then underneath in *fractionally* smaller type "2 pints", at which point they went away and got upset about something else instead.

In recent news, social distancing has pretty much consistently been described as "two metres", although that utter cock Jacob Rees-Mogg insists on saying "six feet" because he thinks he's in a fucking Austen novel or something.

** We use an awkward mix of the two and I am sure another Brit will disagree with me as it's often a generational issue, but on the whole:

Distance: imperial

Weight: imperial

Height: imperial

Recipes: metric, sometimes imperial for fluid things, like half a pint of milk

Measurements in DIY/interior design type stuff: an incomprehensible mix of centimetres and feet

Often it's a mix of the two based on the age of the individual and how "traditional" something feels. My dad was a fishmonger with an extremely old fashioned shop and we did everything in pounds and ounces, but if I go into Tesco's the same things are sold in metric prices.

** I'm in my 30s I use metric for everything except miles and weighing people (stones and lbs rather than just lbs.) My grandmother used pretty much entirety imperial.

** I'd imagine they'd use imperials even more than they do now, because even now I frequently meet British people (I live here, but I'm not from here) who don't really have a good grasp of the metrics. They use stone for body weight, but grams for cooking, as far as I can tell, but feet, and yards too, I think, for distances. They do miles instead of kilometres.

** If you're seeking to use this information to write a Harry Potter fanfic, it's worth pointing out that the Wizarding world, unlike the Muggle world, does not use the metric system since that was put into place long after the Statute of Secrecy caused the two worlds to split. So, just to make things even more complicated, wizards still use the old pre-metric system.

*** I mean, it is called Imperial after the British Imperial measurements, so they're unlikely to just give the whole thing up. Especially with Brexit on the horizon.

** I think everyone here has covered most of what I thought to say, but I just had one thing to add. At school, I don't really remember any instance in which we were taught imperial measurements. Science was obviously in metric, but so we're all our maths problems, and I don't recall ever being taught any conversion rates between metric and imperial. Many school rulers had inches on one side and cm on the other, but we never used inches, and I think newer rulers have cm/mm.

The only time I was ever "taught" imperial measurements was for my driving theory, as driving is still mph, all the rest of my use of imperial, eg height in ft and inches comes from what my parents taught me.

That said, I use metric for my weight, though my parents don't. For reference, I'm slightly older than the next gen kids, so this YMMV with Harry and co, who are about 20 years older than me.

** Yeah mix of imperial and metric, funnily enough I don't use pints for milk, I always go out looking for a 2l bottle of milk, which I don't refer to as "three and a half pints"

I'm surprised anyone uses pints unless they get small bottles of milk, as in the shop it's usually listed in Litres.
