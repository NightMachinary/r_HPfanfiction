Does anyone here pair their oc with cannon. Or make them friends with cannon characters? If so what is your favourite friendship or paring you wrote so far? If not why not?


** I wrote Draco with an OC.

I picked up an old fanfic I'd written years ago pre-HBP without looking at what's actually going on in the HP ff community, and I see in hindsight that she kind of had a similar place as fanon Daphne Greengrass does (pureblood Slytherin, but not sympathetic to the Death Eaters). I probably would've swapped her out if I didn't have a huge backstory that didn't fit Daphne, and OC's parents were also Death Eaters, which to me didn't suit the Greengrasses. I left them, the Parkinsons, Bulstrodes, and Zabini parents to be various shades of pure-blooded families.

** I'm working on a few fics, with minor Sirius/fem Slytherin OC. The fics are centered around OCs, but in canon universe with characters like Draco and Hermione popping up every now and then.

** Hi! I'm currently writing a story with two OCs in it. I haven't planned for them to get in a relationship with any of the main cast so, no. But they pretty much grew up alongside Harry and are two of his best friends/family.\\
I believe my favourite interaction so far was in between Remus, Sirius and the OCs and also with Harry! It's all family dynamics :))

*** Nice mine is a marauders oc that is friends with James remus Sirius and Peter, the interactions between the first four. Are possibly my favorite. Also how they tease and comfort each other when a crush rejects them.

** I wrote bellatrix with an oc yes i know I know look bellatrix is hot and I like her character especially since there's not much there besides a general outline so I have the freedom to do a lot with her and it was fun

Also Sirius got a slytherin date so that was fun.

** I'm working on a longer one but the OC's are practically all shipped with one another. One part of the fic takes place during 1968-1976 and the other from 1984-1992. The oc's know the mauroders and cast during the later time but there are no relationships, other then being on the same quidditch team.
