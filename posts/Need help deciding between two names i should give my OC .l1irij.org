** Rina's a really pretty name. Avery's also a pretty name but I dunno if it'd really fit in with the setting. It wasn't used as a girls name until very recently and it was mostly in the U.S. Ultimately though you should go with what feels right to you. Both are beautiful names.

** Asia is a pretty big part of the world... with a lot of languages, people, cultures... maybe drill down a bit and find a name that makes sense for her place and people of origin and heritage? Or has her family lived in the UK for a long time and so adopted English customs and names? I like investigating the meaning of names for my OCs... and coming up with something that reveals a bit of their character.

** Avery didn't become popular as a girls' name until the 90s. So if Remus is adopting her as an infant in the time period of the books and her parents at least live in the muggle world, it could conceivably work for a name. But if she's supposed to be around Harry's age, then it's a bit anachronistic.

Rina is not a name I've heard before, but the internet is telling me that it is a (mostly) Japanese name, so I think it works fine. As long as that "Asian origin" you mention includes at least some Japanese. It would be kind of odd for a Chinese family, for example, to give their child a Japanese name if they didn't have any Japanese family or at least live in Japan. I mean, obviously you could still do it, but it feels like you'd be just asking for some commenter to try to correct you if you did.

Jordyn is also pretty anachronistic for someone born before the 90s, by the way. In the future, if you want to check when names were popular, WolframAlpha can help. It only gives US data, but any other English-speaking country should be mostly similar enough to work for this sort of thing. Here's the data for [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=avery+%28female%29][Avery]] and [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=jordyn][Jordyn]], for example.

*** The UK government doesn't provide as much baby name data as the US does, so it isn't as useful, but this tool is for looking up popularity of names in the UK over the last 116 years. Could be helpful.

** Does being of Asian origin play a key role in her character? Like before she is adopted by Lupin, does she know her ancestry? And Asian is such a broad term, it might help narrowing the field :)

** Generally names are either given or taken. So, think about how your character got their name. Was it given by a parent or carer? Did they change their name later on for some reason?

If it came from parents/carers, then think about what said parents/carers would actually name their kids. The kind of name a super-traditionalist Chinese couple would give their kid is pretty different to what a liberal Thai family would.

If it's the character that took the name, think about why, and think about that character's beliefs and tastes. Did they change it after leaving the Pack? Are they into their heritage culture and the kind of person who'd want to pick a name marking that?
