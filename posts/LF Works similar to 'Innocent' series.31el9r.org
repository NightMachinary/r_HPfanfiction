** I just got done reading The Wise One Trilogy by FarenMaddox. It's a Sirius raises Harry trilogy that is very similar to Innocent but creative in it's own right and it's complete. Hope you enjoy!

When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.

** So in terms of fics with the same basic premise (Sirius rescuing Harry), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9080018/1/Disbelief][Disbelief]] has a similar premise/scale. You might like the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1194522/FarenMaddox][Wise One]] as well.

What is it that you particularly liked about Innocent?
