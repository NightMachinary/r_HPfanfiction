Bullied orphan Tom Riddle has the misfortune of being sorted into Slytherin house at a time where blood status is more important than cunning or ambition, and with no claim to any pureblood family being out of the orphanage doesn't fix change anything.

In his sixth year he discovers the Chamber of Secrets and his Founders Heritage, and hatches a plan to get revenge on the blood purists that have made his life miserable. Using the Basilisk to petrify muggleborn he builds public resentment against the blood purists as the school bands together in defense of the mughleborn.

In his private moments though it doesn't feel like enough, he wants to punish the bullies the way he did Stebbins in the orphanage, he wants to make them hurt the way they've hurt him, and worse. Who could stop him if he did? Not with a sixty foot basilisk on his side.

But unlike the suspicious Transfiguration professor thought, Tom didn't like this side of him, and it scared him. So he hatched a plan to separate the good from the evil inside of him and destroy the vengeful, petty, murderous impulses he felt.

Unfortunately for him, Lord Voldemort, the embodiment of his cruelty, overpowered him, and took control of their body, trapping his consciousness in their diary.

Years have passed since the last time Voldemort wrote in his diary, when ink and words fill Tom's consciousness once again.

"Hello Ginny, my name is Tom Riddle, and I need your help."

I had this idea in the back of my head, with plot threads pulled together from fics like A Black Comedy and The Prince of Slytherin as well as from Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

I like the idea of a sane Tom Riddle being freed from the diary to help bring the fight to Voldemort as a mentor. Either resurrected somehow, as a voice in Ginnys or Harry's head, or just as a diary.


** I've seen Diary Riddle go against Voldemort before, but never because he was actually good from the start. Sounds interesting!

*** I think so too. Depending on how one wants to take the prompt could be interesting as well. Just how "well" did Tom's spell to separate the good from the evil go? Is he completely "good" to the point of being handicapped by inability to do what is necessary? Or is it more like Dr. Jekyll where he is himself and Voldemort is Hyde? Or something inbetween?

**** A Dr Jekyll / Mr Hyde scenario would be really interesting, particularly if you include the see-saw effect where the stronger one is the weaker the other becomes. Which would be why Voldemort stashed away the Diary, so Tom would become weaker and weaker. But Lucius makes the critical mistake and Tom is given opportunity to start growing again, while Voldemort is unable to counter him effectively yet. Then when Voldemort does come back, they begin a tug-of-war, with neither a whole person while the other still persists, each fated to fight to the death.

... like the Prophecy, but with a more properly literal interpretation. Perhaps Tom possesses Harry, transplanting into the Scarcrux? Which would give an interesting twist on how Harry actually figures in the Prophecy.

***** I would 100% read this.

Bonus points if you can use Scar!Tom's crippling goodie-two-shoesness but extensive magical knowledge and instincts to make Harry into an exceptional dueler who's handicapped by the fact that he can only use non-lethal spells.

***** What if Diary!Tom regained physical form around seven months after Ginny first started writing in the diary? There are plenty of ways (with or without altering prior events) to say that the Golden Trio defied Voldemort three times, depending on how much you want to stretch.

Alternate twist: Everybody misunderstood the prophecy - Trelawney didn't say "born", but "borne", so after seven months Ginny brings the diary to the Trio. This idea stolen in part from TheBeardedOne's "Last Mage of Krypton" series.

** That's actually very similar to a snippet I just published (which will hopefully eventually be published as a larger work). Riddle initially had a larger ambition than simple survival, but with each successive Horcrux, more of his soul was lost, leaving little more than the base desire to live. Diary riddle hates Voldemort both for what he became and what he did trapping him in the diary. In harry, he sees a way forward.

**** My read is that the first murder (Myrtle) was accidental. He knew of the Horcrux ritual and conducted it spur of the moment after he realized what he did. After that, he became increasingly obsessed with personal survival with each successive Horcrux as other motivations were eventually cut off of him and placed in Horcruxes.

He's not exactly good per se, but he's not quite the generic villain of the books.

** Hmm...I might refer you to my comments in this thread: [[https://redd.it/928d3l]]

Possibly, Tom's wandless use of dark magic in his youth (punishing and manipulating the other kids) might have allowed 'evil energy' to seep into his heart, corrupting him and turning him towards violence and cruelty to solve his problems.\\
However, a few years into Hogwarts, learning about mind-manipulating spells, how dark magic corrupts, and finding common ground with muggleborns leads Tom Riddle to discover the presence of this 'dark parasite' within his soul, and try to remove it.\\
Doing research into soul magic, including horcruxes, Riddle devises a way to draw out his darkness and seal it in an object, but, in an attempt to conduct the dark-magic-sealing ritual, the evil parasite gains form of its own and rebels, possessing Tom, murdering Myrtle Warren, and using said murder to perform a bastardised Horcrux ritual to seal Tom's soul in the diary instead.
