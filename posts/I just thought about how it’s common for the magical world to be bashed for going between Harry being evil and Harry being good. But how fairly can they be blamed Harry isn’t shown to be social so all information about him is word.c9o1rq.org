#+TITLE: I just thought about how it’s common for the magical world to be bashed for going between Harry being evil and Harry being good. But how fairly can they be blamed? Harry isn’t shown to be social so all information about him is word of mouth. This is looking at the story as if we don’t know Harry.

He was hit by the killing curse and survived with a scar on the forehead. Nobody knows what kind of after effects that could cause. Harry is revealed as a parselmouth during the time when Slytherins chamber of secrets is opened and were told that many who have this gift are dark wizards and it's a school full of terrified kids so it's more understandable. The triwizard tournament doesn't have much of an excuse at all except the fact that there are very few people Harry talks to which could be seen as him thinking he's better than others. He says voldemort is back with no proof and while fudge should have investigated it rather than instantly denying it, the magical populace are told that Harry claims Voldemort is back but has no proof. Dumbledore supports him. He has no proof. Nobody wants to believe that their families are at risk again as seen by a previous tag about why Voldemort is so bad. 6th year there's proof that Voldemort returned and their told only Harry can save them. There is no excuse for seventh year except people keeping their heads down to avoid their families being targeted.


** It's almost like the attitude and backlash that climate scientists had to deal with (and still do) because no one with political power wanted to deal with climate issues pre-2000's.

** There was proof Voldemort was back: the marks of the Death Eaters in Azkaban and BCJ. All one had to do was look. And I maintain that it is really silly to think quiet and shy people are stuck up simply because they don't want to talk.

The magical world deserves to be "bashed" just like normal people who believe in the illuminati, defend their fav celeb no matter what, etc.

*** People tend to look at famous people differently than they do normal people though. While I disagree with it, kids are raised ‘knowing' that Harry Potter is a larger than life figure. Also I think the marks don't prove anything. Unless I missed something, there's nothing saying that the dark mark had to be willingly taken. How many death eaters other than snape would show their dark mark had darkened? The average people don't see it and considering snape is one of dumbledores people, there's no way that he would be considered good evidence. BCJ was under the imperious for years after being in Azkaban as a fanatically loyal follower. Who's to say he didn't fake it as an homage to his lord? Not to mention he was kissed right away so there's no official questioning.

Remember I'm talking about the average person. Not the higher ups. How often did dumbledore or Harry speak out with anything than what Harry said happened? It to me seems like a he said she said moment. Does veritiserum exist? Yes but I'm pretty sure it's canon that it's not infallible plus he is a minor. Pensieve? Assuming it's rare and thus not exceedingly common, memories can be faked and who's to say someone else didn't fake the memory for Harry to support his story.

Your government tells you Harry is insane. Just about every news source agrees. Harry has no proof that it happened other than as said above.

**** Bellatrix. Bellatrix would happily tell them her mark had darkened. Not to mention the amount of "imperiused" former Death Eaters walking around. One was even a Ministry employee. BCJ /was/ evidence, which was why McGonagall and Dumbledore were upset.

Harry has no reason to speak out. He's 11-17. Dumbledore, I'm sure spoke out on many things.

As for the average person if my government let a mass murderer slip through their fingers /and/ if their had been a dark mark in the sky 9 months before, I'd hesitate to trust their word.

***** Which is more believable Voldemort taught black tricks on how to escape as his right hand man or Voldemort helping him. Wasn't Alcatraz seen as impossible to break out of but someone supposedly did? There's a major difference between mass murderer escaping and deadly magical terrorist coming back from the dead.

Everyone knows Voldemort died that night and it's supposed to be impossible to come back from the dead. Nobody WANTS to believe he could be back. Bellatrix says he's back. She's been in Azkaban for years and how many people are going to brave Azkaban and how many would be allowed to see bellatrix Lestrange and other death eaters to ask to see their mark as proof. I doubt the average person would understand anything about the dark mark. All they know is it's on people's arms and match's the symbol thrown into the air by death eaters. The World Cup incident wasn't related to Voldemort at all. Crouch legitimately threw the dark mark without actually knowing Voldemort was as back.

Which seems more plausible? Major fear monger deadly wizard Voldemort comes back from the dead or a few insane/disgruntled death eaters wanting for the good ole days when Voldemort was around relieving their finest moments. Keep in mind you shouldn't look at it from Harry Potter or his friends or dumbledores point of view. Look at it from the POV of the average joe.

Fudge POA

#+begin_quote
  "But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled."
#+end_quote

He said this in the 3 broomsticks in front of Rosmerta and Hagrid.

Hagrid PS:

#+begin_quote
  "Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don' reckon they could've done if he was comin' back."

** Yes, this is a good point and it ties into Rowlings' faults as a writer. Because her envisioned story involves a paragon of goodness winning via love and morality and that isn't compatible with Harry or Dumbledore being clever and sneaky and fighting, so he doesn't do what anyone with a brain would do and put the tiniest bit of effort into his public perception, do an interview or two, and make use of his Boy-Who-Lived status.

Ultimately, I think JK felt like it would "taint" Harry to have him leverage his fame or put work into PR, and so instead he just sits by and gets slandered constantly. However, she also wanted us to feel sorry for him and to see the WW as fickle and easily manipulated, which as you point out doesn't really scan too well when you consider how useless Harry is at getting his side across.

It's kinda like how JK wanted the "chosen one abandoned to abusive relatives" trope, but also wanted Harry to be a happy, well-adjusted, friendly person with no lasting trauma. So we get Harry being locked in a cupboard for 11 years and emerging from it as if it was normal and fine.

** I think the main problem of Harry is how fast people opinions change : 1st year he and his friends loose 150 points, so he is treated like a pariah until the leaving Feast where he wins the House Cup and he becomes a Hero for 3/4 of the school. 2nd year he is accused of being the Heir of Slytherin and treated like a pariah until he solves the mystery and win the House Cup. 4th year, most of the school treat him like shit when he becomes he champion (until the Gryffindors seem happy ), and after he does well in the 1st Task he is treated well again. Finally the whole 5th year where he jumped from "attention seeking liar " to "chosen one " in one evening.

Some changes in opinion are understandable, mainly the return of Voldemort. Not a lot of people know about Horcruxe, most didn't want to believe it and he did stay low. And most of these change in opinion can be explained by Rowling desire "to reset " the school (Harry is not sociable mainly to keep the character count low, and I dont want to start a book by reading 3 pages of text who list precisely who Harry is friend with and who he is not ). But from the character point of view, it can be annoying.

Some older guy who did'nt talk to you in month will come to say well done and act all friendly.\\
The Hupplepuff who refused to be near you will come just to make small talk. This girl who sneered at you and potentially wore a "Potter stinks " badge will ask to be your date for the ball. These girls who laughed at you will suddenly be all filtry, sneering at the friends who actually stood by you.

So yeah the change in opinion can be understandable. And I do hope some scene happened outside of the books (like Smith saying he was sorry for how he acted in CoS). But all these events can explain why Harry is generally pissed at people. Though bashing them might be a little too strong, and Harry is rarely likeable in these kind of fics (if ever).
