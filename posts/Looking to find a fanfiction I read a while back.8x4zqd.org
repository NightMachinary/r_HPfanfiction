It was a harry/ginny fanfiction, where hermione and ron "betray" harry and he starts to be more independent with ginny. It also has a OC who is transferred from america that helps harry. Harry and Ginny form their own DA and Hermione and Ron keep the old one.

  COMPLETE! Post OoTP. Harry went into hiding to train and Hogwarts receives a challenge from Durmstrang. Harry revolts against the Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic, and Voldemort. Chapter 23 is the turning point in the story.
