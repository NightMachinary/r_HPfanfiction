  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

  Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. Disillusioned with the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn ... AUish, Post-Hogwarts. HP/DG

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

** Well, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4gax5d/best_of_harry_ships/d2fz0nd][here's]] the wiki page for Harry/Daphne fics.

More that aren't there are:

linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerSpW) - A long one, at 81 chapters and nearing the end.

linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble by Chilord) - Complete. Super quippy, EWE fic. Lots of back and forth, very entertaining.

linkffn(Big Brother is Listening to You by Holz9364) - The HP version of the Big Brother reality show. Amusing.

linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement by TheUnrealInsomniac) - a WIP take on a marriage contract thing. Super amusing, hilarious Daphne. As Ron says "I need her in my life." Harry's a bit of a dick, but he realizes that.

linkffn(The Lies that Bind by Zephros) - Super dark, but super enjoyable.

linkffn(The Legacy Preservation Act by James Spookie) A marriage law fic. WIP. Not the best, and it's a typical James Spookie fic. So grammar and what not is good, characterization is ok and plot could use work. Actually, just go check out his profile. Has a bunch, and I don't feel like typing them all out.

linkffn(A Champion's New Hope by Rocag) A complete, GoF & OotP AU. Didn't age well.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar) I've mentioned this in the Cult Classics thread. The H/D pairing isn't the focus, but is present. Feels very b-movie.

linkffn(The Reluctant Champion by The Unreal Insomniac) The first of a series. Second fic has just been started. A "James Potter lived" fic.

linkffn(Myrddin Emrys Returns) Probably the worst fic I'm recommending, but whatever, I do what I want.

linkffn(Uncle Harry by R-Dude) is a fun oneshot featuring Harry and his Pureblood snob wife Daphne visiting Dudley's family.

linkffn(Beltane Child by White Angel of Aurolan) is a piece where [[/spoiler][Harry kinda gets Daphne pregnant during an anonymous ritual to promote a good harvest because he needed a damn break during the horcrux hunt.]] Not the best.

And that's all I can really think of that hasn't already been mentioned here.

*** Oh huh. I didn't realize there was more chapters on DLP. Could you please link me? I just created and authorized my account but when I try to access the story, it tells me I don't have permission to access the page.

**** Read the rules. Also, the bright red description of the WBA forum: "Requires 5 posts to view". New members don't get WBA access right away and WBA isn't early-access FFN. WBA is for the authors, not readers. Besides, the fic is going to be updated on FFN at some point. You can just wait a bit.

Listen people, the stuff in WBA isn't as good as the version that gets posted on FFN. Basically, the WBA chapters are the drafts, and then people help the author fix the chapters, or make them better. If you're not going to help with that process, don't bother.

****** "Help the author"

From personal experience that is bullshit. I have posted several chapter drafts there, and have had NO helpful criticism. Then there are authors who post there, and NEVER AGAIN. The whole system of DLP is fucked up, and needs a complete overhaul.

That being said, it is the only place for fanfiction to get legitimate help consistently if they like your work. So for many, it is an undeniable resource.
