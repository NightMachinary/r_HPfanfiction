*** It really is an interesting fic, but I agree that you should only read it if you can put aside differences of opinion for (ignore) the author's beliefs, (ranting) which evidently include racism, antisemitism, stereotyping, an odd and undying hatred of feminists, and the firm belief that women are manipulative creatures that shouldn't have ever been “given” the right to vote. Normally it wouldn't be an issue with Fanfiction, but this author is seemingly fond of having Harry act as a mouthpiece, and then blowing up about any dissent in authors notes.

...he's particularly vehement about how people can't stand criticism. Make of that what you will.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

** He's well on the way in Significant Digits, but it's a sequel to Methods of Rationality and doesn't really make sense without it (and MoR is quite long and doesn't have any world-conquering in it).
