Has anyone ever made a fanfic about a room that either Helga Hufflepuff or Godrick Gryffindor made a similar, hidden room?

It can be a prompt or if someone has already made one, I'd be interested in reading it.

** I can't tell if you're purposefully misspelling their names but that just gave me a head ache.

I read a fic once that touched on this idea and Hermione and Draco were resorted into Ravenclaw and they found Rowena Ravenclaw's study? Could be linkffn(The Eagle's Nest)

  COMPLETE: Hermione's eighth year at Hogwarts is already going to be difficult in the aftermath of the war, but it is further thrown into upheaval when Headmistress McGonagall orders a re-sorting of all students to promote inter-house unity. But when the Sorting Hat sends Hermione to Ravenclaw with Draco - and without Harry or Ron, how will she cope? [AU/Dramione] Prevalent alchemy.

*** I was at work, so I have to apologize for the misspellings... My phone wanted to autocorrect them to something else, and I was just hoping to make my intentions clear...

Now that I'm home, I figured that I'd edit my original post, even though I can't edit the title...

** There was one fic where they find what was basically the remains of Gryffindor's 'hidden' room which had been used for some heavy partying over the centuries and ended up irrecoverably trashed. Don't ask me the name of the fic though, must have read it ten years ago and don't remember.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  AU, third in main Dangerverse, complete. Take two Marauders and the women who put up with them. Add eight naughty children, two evil escapees from Azkaban, one wise Headmaster, and a dash of Dark Lord. Shake well and enjoy. Years 3 and 4, twisted canon.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
