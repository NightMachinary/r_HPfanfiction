Thanks!!!


** Took a look at the site. All the fics are just rehosts of other people's fics. Look up the fic title, find the original posting, and see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/reading][my article on downloading]], particularly FanFicFare to download the fic.

** If all else fails, try the [[http://www.grabmybooks.com/][GrabMyBooks]] Firefox extension, which works on practically everything. There's also an Android app.
