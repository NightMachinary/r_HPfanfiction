I'm looking for long, well paced, stories featuring Harry going to Hogwarts and opposing Voldemort that avoid simply rehashing cannon.

Let me explain what I mean with some examples

These two stories fit the bill. They are long, they feature Harry going to Hogwarts, Voldemort is present as an antagonist but there is more going on than the cannon set pieces.\\
Changes have an effect, they have meaning.

linkffn(Harry is a dragon, and that's okay)\\
linkffn(*The House of Potter Rebuilt*)

These two stories do not fit the bill, they stick far too closely to the major plot points of the original series.

linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12177140/1/Phoenix-Corrupted]]. Great fic that has a very original plotline while retaining a nice friendship between Ron, Harry, and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter]]. It's predecessor is nice as well. Summary is a bit misleading, it's more canon-themed than compliant. Great fic though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12417372/1/Old-Blood]]. Popular fic that's pretty good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7469856/17/Hallowed][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7469856/1/Hallowed]] (time skip after 1st year to 6th year/triwizard though). Can't recommend this one enough.

** I think Prince of the Dark Kingdom is the fic that comes to mind as “most different from canon.” It was abandoned near the end in 7th year, but there's still so much good shit there to appreciate. It's a story about if Voldemort had won the first war, so basically nothing is the same.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2920229/1/Eclipse-of-the-Sky]] definitely does not rehash canon, and it has in my opinion some of the best dialogue. It is also a very interesting take on horcruxes.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
