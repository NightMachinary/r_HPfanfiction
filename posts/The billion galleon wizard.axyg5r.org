So, I have no problem with Harry being rich, but why does he have a million sickles and knuts. You don't go to the bank and they be like, you got 8,745,329 pennies and 4,300,001 nickles in your account. Dafuq? Nah, it would be in dollars, so it should just be galleons, a handful of sickles, and a slightly larger handful of knuts.


** Potentially because Gringrotts stores things physically in a personal vault. So they don't actually change out sickles for galleons. When you get an account statement you see what actually is physically in the vault and not the value that translates to

** Because Gringotts isn't electronic banking. It's a safe deposit/storage unit service.

Also, if we're being real meta, people who write long Gringotts account statements are probably just wanking themselves off, or padding their wordcount. Or both.

How else can you explain where things like this come from?

  1,637,330,454,262 Galleons
#+end_quote

So, trillions are a big number, so let's try to give a scale of this. A direct size for galleons is not specified (aside from "Gold coins the size of a hubcap" that's mentioned in GoF, which I suspect is a size considerably larger on the American side of the pond), so let's be conservative and use the Dungeons and Dragons gold coin size, which is 60 coins weigh 1 Lb.

So, 1,637,330,354,262 galleons at that conversion rate is 27,288,839,237.7 pounds of gold, which sure that's a lot, but how much space would that take up?

Gold is notoriously dense at 19.32 g/cm^{3}. Which yes, that means I had to convert to grams. 12378009264377.3 g by the way. A quick bit of math tells me that if the gold were solid, it would take up 640683.709 m^{3}, which would be a cube with about 86.208 meter long sides, made of pure gold.

Of course these are coins, not solid gold, so we'll divide that volume by the circle packing ratio of ~.9069 to get an ideal estimated volume of 706454.884 m^{3}, or a cube with sides 89.062 m long.

Now by now, I'm sure you're asking how much pointless math have I done, and I assure you that I'm not finished yet. You see I'm sure you imagine that gold, while valuable is in jewelry everywhere so surely the numbers, while staggering, are not beyond the pale. Surely there's this much gold in the world, right?

Wrong.

As of 2017, the World Gold Council estimated that 187,200 metric tons of gold has been mined in the entirety of human history.

Harry's proposed wealth is 66 times that amount.

**** A thing i really liked that was in a fanfic once, not sure which one, was that the gringotts coins are actually not made of gold, and not even gold plated, they are made of common stone, enchanted to look like gold/silver/bronze.

The thing is, only the goblins know that, since they are the ones who make the coins, and real gold would be too expensive/impossible to use in that scale. It also prevents fraud, since if someone gives them a coin whose enchantments don't match, or that is actually made of gold, they would immediatly detect.

*** I'd recommend investing some o' that in the muggle economy and becoming the richest man in the world there too. Or better yet, if you live in a verse where the goblins are a merchantile race that values honor above all, make them do it for you for 1% of the profits. Of course, they'll ask for 50% but you can always just do it yourself and they Know that. I'm sure you can work them down. Maybe you'll end up closer to 15% though...

**** The LitRPG genre as a whole is full of giant stat sheets.

If you read Gamer Fics like linkffn(11950816), they use video game style interfaces as part of the story. This means long lists of the character's stats, showing the number of points they've accrued in STR, DEF, END, and the long, long list of items in their inventory that is reposted every time they gain a new item or a new level.

I see the "Gringotts Account Balance" trope to be nothing but the HP-flavored version of the classic Item Inventory.

** As people have commented, Banking-as-safe-deposit-box is the way to go.

Course, then you get the stupid "magical interest appears in vault', which makes absolutely no sense. You pay for a safe deposit box, you don't get paid.

... Not that thinking overly hard about wizarding economics doesn't cause all sorts of problems. Really not JKR's strong point. With what we know, it would be a likely deflationary economy. And the exchange rate with pounds would be sky-high. And some muggleborn parent would end up owning the place in a few years of trying.

Honestly, the way things are set up, all-wealth-being-generational would fit best, but then Canon tries to indicate they have a work/spend economy, which would just not work...
