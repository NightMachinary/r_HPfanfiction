Because if a schoolkid can be entered into a binding magical contract that can take away his magic (as so much fanfiction seems to like) against his will just by the application of a strong enough Confundus, someone should be able to come up with a way to weaponize such a contract against everyone on Earth.

Does anyone know any such crackfics like this? Like, someone writes a contract that goes 'if you live on the planet Earth, you are a party to this contract' and 'to fulfil this contract, you must say 'John is the name of my macadamia nut' three times in a row'?

  ONE-SHOT. After being entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will, Harry does some independent research on what precisely "magically binding" means...and comes up with a very different approach to the competition. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword...but is the quill mightier than the wand?

  In Goblet of Fire, JKR established that it was absurdly easy to bind other witches and wizards unwillingly into binding magical contracts with a simple, school-taught 'confundus' charm. What if Harry took note of that and decided to do something about it?
