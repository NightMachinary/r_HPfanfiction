I've been looking for good Ron-centric stories, and this behemoth came recommended from several sources. I prefer longer stories so the size was a plus for me. A quick search of this subreddit found no negative comments about it.

All in all, I was exited to give this a go, but after 5 chapters I'm struggling read any further. This is the author's first story, and it shows. I'm not gonna go into details, but it has the standard tell don't show MC wankfest going on, where every other line we are told that /insert_character thinks Ron is awesome. There's an author's note in the first chapter where he/she mentions that the first 15 chapters are being "fixed" to be up to the current standards, but I'm not convinced that the writing quality improved that much in 9 months. I really cant imagine someone writing a 1.5 million-long narrative in that time frame also finding the time to significantly improve their writing skills.

Did anyone read the whole thing? Does it get better? Should i push through to the magical chapter 15?


** I really didn't enjoy this one - it had so much potential

** I read pretty regularly through chapter 60-70 ish, and the writing technically does get better. As far as the "MC wankfest" that you speak of, it still happens. Ron is suppose to be a prodigy or at least /be viewed/ as one. As the story continues, it becomes pretty clear that outside of his "ability" he has no innate talents. His ability lit a fire under him that other characters his age don't have. He's crafty, but is still prone to the temper tantrum that blows up his plans quite frequently.

I'd continue reading. It's probably the only Prodigy!Ron on the internet even close to this size. Ron does show his cracks and there will be chapters where you as a reader and other characters will absolutely disagree with him.

*** I don't really mind reading about a prodigy. I do mind when half the chapter is composed awed descriptions of his genius.

**** It does get a bit better, once they are in Hogwarts and there is all that “inside of Slytherin house” narrative, but later it gets weirder and weirder. Also, the trope I really deeply and passionately hate, “main character keeps for no reasons whatsoever secrets from his/her friends to increase the dramatic tension” and then after the chapter fifty or so, it starts to shift into some kind of “our super-hero is bigger than anybody else and communicates with the secret $DEITY behind our all lives” crap and that made me finally snap and stop following it.

I mean the basic premise of the story was a bit interesting, but it gets really weird eventually.

** No. That's my straight answer. I got a recommendation for it, but it's just horrible.

** I've kept up with the story, but I don't think it is worth it. While the writing becomes better, the plot really starts to slog later on.

** I'd say it does and for me the author does keep it interesting since later on the povs change so your not locked to just how Ron views the world. The story does get darker and more intense so if your not into dark stories I'd say u should stay away from the newer chapters

** It doesn't change. If you don't like the style, it ups the ante as it goes on
