I am looking for a fanfic I read a couple years ago on ffnet, the name of which I cannot for the life of me remember. Hermione returns to Hogwarts and suffers from depression. Her roommate (Heads? I don't know) is a Slytherin who is good at drawing and interested in astronomy. I think Blaise? Or maybe Theo? Don't take my word for it. For some reason I was thinking it was by Colubrina, but it doesn't seem to be. If it sounds familiar, any help would be much appreciated. It's longish. I would guess at least 50k. And yes, it does become a romance. I know it's not a lot of info. Anything helps! Thank you in advance!
