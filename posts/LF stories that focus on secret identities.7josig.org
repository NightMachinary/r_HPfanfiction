I was rewatching Code Geass recently and it got me thinking if there are any HP fics where there's a group of rebels with a mysterious leader or something.

It would be nice to read a story with Harry as the secret leader to a rebel faction fighting against a corrupt government, but I'm mostly looking for anything that would focus on leading a double life with a secret identity, of whichever character, so it can be as silly as "who could possibly be the supervillan called Voldemort, and why does that nice politician Tom Riddle disappear every time he attacks?"


** This is similar to what I asked recently - Harry disappearing yet returning to Hogwarts under another identity and nobody knows who he is. I couldn't get the bunny out of my head so I've started writing it. The whole concept of secret identities in the magical world intrigued me.

** Having a secret identity, and all the trouble that this causes, is a central theme of my current story, "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief".

#+begin_quote
  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** linkffn(2695781)

Not sure if this is what you meant, but this is Harry who is also someone else to pretty much the rest of society besides his adoptive family.

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned
