It's just so underwhelming! Every time I hear that word I instantly imagine a bunch of tiny, garden snakes, fangless, smiling broadly and swinging their bodies to music. Even when a character says 'den of snakes' or 'snake' as an insult, I just picture the snek meme and get amused rather than feel the intended emotion.

Serpent's lair on the other hand is an absolutely badass name, an it is so fitting for the person that unironically kept a basilisk as a pet.

** 'Den/Pit of Snakes' is an actual idiom. It's from/also sometimes 'Nest of Vipers'. It's even century appropriate - the first use of it was 1640-something regarding some people plotting treason in England. I can't remember what it was and google refuses to tell me, but yeah. I imagine that's why it's so often used.

  The first documented occurrence of the two terms combined to form 'a nest of vipers' was in 1644, when a pamphlet that criticised a group of plotters who were planning treason against the English Parliament was titled /A Nest of Perfidious Vipers/.

** This has me imagining that the "den of snakes" is actually a section of the Slytherin common room for the lower years, full of cushions and cosy chairs. The "serpent's lair" is a seperate section for the upper years, maybe with meeting/study rooms and a NEWT-level library.

That's kind of just you, though. Den of snakes is an actual insult and has no connotations of cuteness (or dancing). It means a bunch of untrustworthy, scheming people who will happily stab you (or each other) in the back. The only issue is if Slytherins use it for themselves, because it's an insult.
