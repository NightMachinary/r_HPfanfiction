The title says it all, I want a fanfiction with one of the main story plots being that he runs any type of store. I would prefer if the story is completely about it, but as long as it is a big part of the story im good.

It MUST MUST MUST MUST MUST be over 70k words. And it also cannot, under any circumstances, have slash.

Also, if there are any fanfiction with Harry delving into wandlore, tell me about that to!


** This is probably a good starting point:

** I'm assuming you're looking for something beyond the lazy Hufflepuff Harry story. The only one I can really think of off the top of my head that isn't just Harry getting more involved with the Weasley joke shop is linkffn(5231591) where Harry buys the Hogshead and starts running it.

  The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation."
