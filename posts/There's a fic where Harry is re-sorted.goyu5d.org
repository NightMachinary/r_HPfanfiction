I just read a fic where Voldemort (Marvolo?) adopts Harry in his fifth year and Harry is re-sorted in Slytherin (Benefits blablabla Old Laws). And another where he learns about dark arts and is friend with Slytherins un his fifth year too. (Re-Idontremember what,sorry).

I really like the idea of Harry being re-sorted so... Â¿Another fics like that?

I don't care if he go to Ravenclaw, Slytherin or Hufflepuff. Just... Please not Harry x Ginny or Harry x Hermione.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
