How do you think this alters the time line? Somehow i can actually see this happening with the fact that James is pureblood and not only that but he's also half black from his mother side. I am sure the black family would love that. I wonder what impact will James have on her and she on him as well as the type of environment that happy will grown up in since the dursleys aren't in the picture. Will they even be targeted by Tom seeing that harry won't be a half blood like him? So many possibilities and i like imagining the alternative time line

Edit: Honestly i know it's a stretch and i don't see it happening logically speaking. The thing i wanted to speculate about is the RESULT of the relationship/marriage eg: Harry and his upbringing and what sort of person will he be, not the way james and Cissa get together.


** Couple of things:

1. This is a very fanon assumption. There isn't any reason to believe of that Narcissa married Lucius because her parents decided so. While arranged marriages may occur, there isn't any evidence of that in canon beyond speculation. So such a relationship would likely need to be something desired by both, a difficult thing as James was infatuated with Lily from the get-go.
2. Who most wizards and witches marry seems to be dependent upon age (proximity during school) and house (again, proximity during school). Lucius was 1-2 years her senior and in the same house. By contrast, James and the Marauders were 5-6 years younger than her and in Gryffindor. Unlikely to say the least.
3. James is not half-black. Again fanon. His mother is Euphemia, who we have no familial knowledge of other than being pure-blood as well. James is a Black in the same sense that the Weasleys are, more or less.
4. James's parents were not killed by Voldemort. They died of Dragon Pox, and besides which were fairly old (although thats a bit of a gray area with wizards/witches). Fanon.

This doesn't seem like a discussion so much as a prompt - what if James Potter (Gryffindor, anti-dark magic, jock, unkempt) was forced to marry Narcissa Malfoy (Slytherin, five years his senior, classicist, snobby)?

Again, I get that relationships in fiction that pit contrasts against one another are more interesting that real life relationships (which are based on mutual interests), but that is what generally makes them unworkable for serious discussion. A better discussion would be /how much would you have to change in Harry Potter to make that relationship occur?/ I don't know, but can guess its quite a lot.

*** Oh really? I didn't know the dorea black thing was a fanon. The more i learn i suppose so thanks for that one. As for the voldemort point i didn't mean that he went after James parents, i meant that once the prophecy is released he won't mainly target harry this time since he isn't a half blood like him unlike in canon which made him more likely to be the one. Honestly i know it's a stretch and i don't see it happening logically speaking. The thing i wanted to speculate about is the RESULT of the relationship/marriage eg: Harry and his upbringing and what sort of person will he be, not the way james and Cissa get together.

**** For some time JKR didn't disclose names of James's parents, and fans invented (based on the Black's family tapestry) Charlus Potter and Dorea Potter n√©e Black as the Harry's paternal grandparents. Later on JKR came on Pottermore with the ridiculous names Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, and some parts of fans just refused to believe it.

**** More the reason to guarantee that the line doesn't lose his purity, the only reason that the Potters were excluded from the Sacred Twenty-Eight is because their name is common or of muggle origin. Charlus Potter, pureblood, wizengamot member, from a light oriented family succeded in marrying a daughter of the Ancient and Noble House of Black, something that tell us that the Potter were respected by the purist circles.

We cannot say it anymore, Harry James Potter has first name that scream of common born and lack of sophistication, half blood and if it wasn't sufficient muggle raised and ignoramus of the Wizarding way of life and in magic expertise (all purebloods know to take the double A in third Year.

***** you think James gives a shit about that,

James willingly fought against voldemort when he had no reason too.

the sacred twenty-eight was merely propaganda written by Nott

light oriented family is a fannon idea, henry potter was merely pro muggl.

we know nothing about Charlus potter and the black women he married, for all we know he could have been a blood purist, or the black women was not one they might have fell in love at school

****** If his parents existed he should, it is clear that the wizarding families in Harry Potter are on the old fashioned model of the Father Lord of the House and that the marriage are arranged. If James married a mudblood, his father could have disowned him.

And yet the Wizengamot Members and Head of Departments were often chosen inside this Pure-Blood Directory.
