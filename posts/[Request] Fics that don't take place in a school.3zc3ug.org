I don't care whether the characters are at the age where they should be in school or not, I just don't want to read anything that has to do with Hogwarts or Durmstrang or the like. Some good stories that come to mind would be linkffn(5201703;7287278;4068153).

I like these because I think of them as "OC Crossovers", as in they more or less follow a structure in which the characters find themselves in a totally new world or location (Wastelands less so), sort of like a Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter Crossover, except it's not actually a Crossover with anything, just Original Content.


** I feel like it's quite interesting how we've got this vast magical world to explore but it always end up revolving around schools.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  The sequel to Bungle in the Jungle. Told in 2nd person. Harry Potter has returned to England. In the jungles of South America, he became his own man, a hero of his own choice and not unfortunate circumstance. Is it enough to save him?
