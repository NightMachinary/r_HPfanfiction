Pretty much every time I read one it ends up being incomplete. Any finished Harry potter in a video game, or with video game powers?


** I would recommend linkffn(11950816)

It's not completed, but it has updated rather regularly for a long time, the author has said that they have the entire story planned out in draft form, so there is already a degree of dedication and investment on their part.

Also, unlike many Gamer fics I've encountered, none of the grammar, spelling, and prose make my eyeballs cry.

  With his life turned into a Game, Harry now has to raise a Phoenix, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets, deal with political manipulations and live through Hogwarts all while trying desperately to not swear too much.

*** Well that was interesting, and technically the only actual reply to my request that gave me everything I asked for.

Never played through an interactive HP story before. Almost felt like Doki Doki literature club at first, thought it was going to be a surprise Horror game, especially before you select your name and Harry is like an evil background shadow with the eery music ha.

** How do you feel about crossovers? I liked linkffn(11799646), but it's only loosely HP, with a fem!Harry travelling to a series of different universes. I found it pretty easy to follow despite never having seen KHR (the first crossover universe), and the gamer mechanic was pretty well-done.

  Harriet Potter knew she shouldn't have picked those three Hallows... but she did, and now, she's immortal, and the gods have a proposition for her : help the heroes of other universe to save her mother's soul. And to help her, they'll give her a tool : the Gamer's Ability. First stop : the Mafia World. fem!Harry, MoD!Harry, gamer!Harry

** I can't give you Harry Potter, but I can give you RWBY if you're familiar. The Games We Play by Ryuugi on Spacebattles forums is really good.
