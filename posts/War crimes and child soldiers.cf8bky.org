An interesting fic would be the in-depth examination of child soldiers in the HP wars.

There's many real world example of how this is playing out right now: How much it confounds the justice systems, political amnesty, human rights violations.

What is a child? 16 and 17 year olds fought in both World Wars, sometimes by their own deception, sometimes with the willful ignorance of their superiors.

What do you do with a dangerous and deadly child that has had no chance at normalcy? Where do you put them once you've won or lost the war?

What of the women and girls who were coerced to marry them? The issue of their complicity and involvement is hotly debated - can a woman associated with a child army be safely given asylum? Can the legal bonds of their marriage be dissolved?

What of those who are of age at the END of the conflict? Perhaps they were recruited or gangpressed at 13 or 14, but continued to fight into their 20s. Are they suddenly culpable on their 18th birthday? If it's not really their fault, but they're also clearly not innocent, what do you do?

Also, what about undeclared wars? Genocides, civil wars, tribal conflicts. Are the combatants in these protected by even the meager rules that apply to wars and their aftermath?

I watched an interesting documentary about Ben Ferencz and the Nuremberg trials. He's the most famous prosecutor and he talks about how he deliberately didnt name any enlisted man for charges. He also talks quite candidly about himself being responsible as part of a ground to air battery for shooting down allied planes that didn't give the all clear signal quickly enough, then going to collect the bodies of his own countrymen to send for burial.

It's called prosecuting evil on Netflix. He's so extraordinary I can't even imagine living his life.

I'd love to see discussion, and if there is a fic out there, I'd read it.


** Linkffn(Stages of Hope)

I just reread this story today. Everyone who loves the 7th book, the wizard Jesus trope and canon!Dumbledore and canon!Snape need to read this story.

It throws a very harsh light of what happens when you throw children into a war, and it's heartbreaking. I think most people are simply too uncomfortable to discuss the realities of child soldiers, especially when it touches on their beloved fantasy stories.

For all her craziness, Luna, in this fic, delivers one of the wisest lines I've read: "/People want their mirrors to flatter them, not tell them the truth./"

** I mean if you throw teenagers and children to the wolves, and if they win the day, you are going to deal with a bunch of hardened and ruthless child soldiers who also happen to have a bunch of issues.

Most of them are not going to let your shit go on any longer, and they are going to make you pay, with very very high interests. Even the Wizard Jesus can only take so much, and he will crucio anyone who spits on his friends.

**** Not another Draco Malfoy wank please.

In canon, this guy has been repeatedly established as an arrogant, cowardly, entitled, and spoiled brat whose favorites line is “wait until my father hears about this”.

He's always looking out for his own and will betray anyone when the going gets tough. In fact, his personality is Peter Pettigrew squared.

I honestly don't understand the double standard in this fandom:

The Hogwarts resident Hitler Youth espouses magical Nazi ideology and actually carries out terrorist activities in the school, but doesn't have the courage to torture and murder his victims personally. "Oh, he must have a heart of gold. He's just misunderstood. Hermione should totally marry this guy!"

Their best friend routinely risks his life and stands by them even in direst situations, but has gotten into arguments a few times. "What a traitor! This guy is a filthy devil incarnate!!!"

***** Also a parallel to the Hitler Youth wouldn't be poorly received by me. What happened to those kids as they entered a world where the indoctrination of their youth no longer applied suddenly? What happened to families that spyed on each other, informed on their neighbors and towed the party line? What happened to the women who were encouraged to have as many Arian babies as possible only to find themselves widowed and facing the crushing realities of reconstruction and national reparations? What does that look like with magic?

I'm great with Draco having a shit life, I just want it to be compelling to read about.

******* Considering how emotionally flat the canon characterizations are, I suppose yes.

Using their names does stand as a short hand for establishing past events, timeline, war allegiances, appearance.... I think that often expedites fanfiction in a way that allows the author to tell a compelling story in 40 - 100k words without spending a tremendous amount of effort world building.

***** And I'm totally down with ooc using Draco as a test subject for what his inner life /may/ have been like if exploring the child solider theme. Or use a character with less scene time and background - maybe Theo or the Greengrass sisters.

I think any kind of healthy romance is probably out of the question for any of the canon characters without so much work if they reacted in any way human to the level of trauma theyve had.

I disagree here. Those who went to through hell and back together are going to have magnitudes more trust among each other than your average couples. Never forget that shared experiences also bring people together. Now, if you have a boy/girlfriend who has saved your butt multiple times in a war and vice versa, if you know you have a boy/girlfriend who has stood by you under even direst circumstances, are you going to trust and rely on each other a lot more than some random one you met at a local bar?

Not every person suffering PTSD is going to be a non functional basket case. Actually, if we look at people coming out of WW2, the records are not too bad. Most still went on to live a full and fulfilling life.

Some people are just better at processing traumatic experiences than others. For example, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simo_H%C3%A4yh%C3%A4][Simo Häyhä]], a Finnish sniper during the Winter War of 1940, is credited with up to 542 confirmed kills. He had his face shot out in the end, but made almost a full recovery and lived on to 96 until 2002.

Or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Wake][Nancy Wake]], who was one effective British SOE agent and resistance leader in Occupied France, led a full life after the war and died in 2011 at age 98. Her first husband was murdered by Gestapo in 1943, she remarried in 1957 and stayed with her second husband until 1997 when he passed away.

There are millions and millions of examples in which war survivors successfully overcame their trauma and did very well afterwards. There are some incredibly tough people out there.

***** I'll never argue that a lot of fics romanticize Draco in a way that isn't warranted by canon, but I don't think it's exactly as black and white as you paint it either. Yes, Draco is all the things you accuse him of being, but he's also the son of one of Voldemort's top lieutenants. His behavior, and his espoused beliefs, don't exist in a vacuum. And while being raised by bigots definitely doesn't excuse having the same beliefs, it makes it, perhaps, a bit more understandable why someone who genuinely might not have come into contact with someone who didn't share those beliefs /until he entered Hogwarts/ might hold them.

I also have to question the assertion that he will betray anyone when the going gets tough. I can't think of a single instance in canon where his loyalty wavers from those he's loyal to. His terrorist activities that you mention were carried out /because/ of his loyalty to his family, who, let's not forget, were under *threat of death* if he didn't succeed. It was generally accepted by literally everyone, including the Malfoys, that Draco would be killed in the attempt to kill Dumbledore, but he went ahead with it anyway because of the loyalty to his family. Even near the end of Deathly Hallows, when his relationship with Crabbe and Goyle has deteriorated to open hostility, he tries to save Goyle from the Fiendfyre, which, if there's a time to betray your allies for your own gain, fleeing sentient, magical fire has to be near the top of the list.

Draco isn't a /good/ character, but he's not Pettigrew. There is complexity in his background that can lead to redemption if the write chooses to put in the legwork to earn it. I won't ever disagree that a lot of fics don't do that work and just skip to him being redeemed, but that doesn't damn the character as irredeemable.

** Very interesting topic for a story, how well it would work would depend on how it is written.

I feel that such "case" as it were would never even be considered in the wizarding society of Britain within the context of the books as written. After all, their head of the judicial and legislative body was actively working to create at least one child soldier/suicide soldier in Harry Potter. It could be argued that Dumbledore was doing his best to ensure that dozens more would ultimately become child soldiers. His actions make much more sense if one makes the assumption that he was intending for some of his students to become child combatants.

It would be interesting to see an inquiry made by the international community via the ICW into the actions of the so-called "light side." They didn't murder or rape but they did some highly questionable things.

I wrote out an essay examining specifically Dumbledore's actions and motives, perhaps I'll have to post it. Of course, it'll likely draw much criticism and generate flames

** In my fic linkffn(imprisoned realm by lovehp) deals with child soldiers. It's a dimension travel fic, and Harry learns a lot why the other Harry joined Voldemort, and learns that children whose parents are considered enemies are abducted and brainwashed into becoming Death Eaters. There is also a scene that once that child is ready to become a Death Eater, they face a cliff where they are given a choice: become a Death Eater and live or jump.

There also OC character moments that delve into their lives and we see why they changed.

P.s it is a very dark fic.

  OoTP. Harry, Ron and Hermione realize that they're going to have to save their own lives - because no one else will. Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.

*** I just burned through this in a day. Frankly, this is one of the best fics I've read simply for sheer originality. That said, the sequel I don't particularly care for, the setup for it just doesn't sit right with me regrettably.

  One conversation changes the course of the Wizarding World. Lord Voldemort decides he no longer wants to kill Harry Potter. No, Voldemort has other plans for the Boy-Who-Lived. This is a story where Harry must fight Voldemort from within, as a Dark Soldier. This is an Alternate Universe starting in Harry's Fourth Year.

** I think you'd find [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] linkao3(15809817) interesting - it's about a reconciliation commission being set up after the war.

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.
