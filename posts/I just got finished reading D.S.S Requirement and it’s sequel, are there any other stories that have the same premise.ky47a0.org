I have read the two other stories inspired by these. The non-canon continuation. Space faring wizards seem like a fun concept.


** Well I wrote one called linkffn(Invincible).\\
Then there's it's abstract inspiration: linkffn(Voyage of the Starship Hedwig). The author is an idea guy, so don't go in looking for happy lovey characterization.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.
