**** I thought about it a bit since, and there are a few fics with similar tones, like the post-apocalyptic setting and the rebellion keeping going long after Voldemort won. Some of these are pretty well-known, so you may have read them, some are a bit older.

Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) is /the/ classic Voldemort won fic, sadly dead but incredibly long and intricate. It's the closest you'll get to Beyond the Curtain, really.

Linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) is kind of like an inverse of Beyond the Curtain.

The Star Wars crossover linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard) was somewhat similar, but Harry and the remaining wizards are fighting back against a slightly different Emperor.

Probably next closest is linkffn(Worthy of Magic), where you get to see both before, cause, and post apocalypse. This one ain't Voldie's fault, though.

Oh, and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) is a time loop story that's also miraculously completed, has a sequel, and that's completed, too.

Linkffn(The World I Leave Behind) was worse for Harry, but not as catastrophic for the rest of the world.

I remember a fic based on the concept of Hermione chasing after Ron when he stormed out during the Horcrux Hunt. They couldn't return to Harry, and many years later, their daughter (Rose, maybe?) runs into Harry, still searching in the aftermath of Voldemort's victory. I had a line here about being unable to find it but aha, my Google-fu is too strong. linkffn(8418356)

linkffn(Circular Reasoning) started off in a post-apocalyptic environment, but it doesn't stay there the whole time. Dead but good.

Uh, what else. Linkffn(Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigmata) is a completed zombie fic which I guess feels pretty similar even if the plot is a bit different.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Riders of the Apocalypse) kind of one ups Voldemort by making Harry literally an incarnation of Death, the Pale Rider, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Surprisingly un-apocalyptic. Ironically, the fic is dead.

***** I loved that fic with Rose, and to expand on that idea on a fic where Hermione left together with Ron, there's that fic where Harry becomes sorta like a ghost story and keeps up the fight by himself, and eventually kidnaps Daphne as a request by her friend, Zabini. I think it was Betrayed or something.It won some award too.

I loved Worthy of Magic and his endgame scenario was such a twist for me that I felt completely in awe of it. Weirdly enough, I suggested it yesterday to someone.

I don't usually enjoy SW at all, so Idk. I've tried reading some but never got me. Same with GoT. Too Hype-y to my tastes.

I don't know why, but I've never read Emperor, and I think it must be one of the most recommended fics here on this sub. I don't know if its the summary or what, but I always stay clear of it, mostly because of expectations. What would you say about it to convince me to read it? Considering the amount of good people here on the sub that suggests good fics, it can't be all that bad, so IDK.

Circular Reasoning was meh, same as Wastelands. I didn't like Harry's personality and the whole groundhog-day scnario from Wastelands (didn't read it all, stopped after 5 or 6 chapters.) And Circular, Idk, it was too weird and convoluted to me. Just wasn't my thing.

Same thing for Prince of Dark Kingdom as Emperor. Dunno, never appealed to me.

Never read The World I leave behind, but it seems interesting.

My issue with Incorruptible is that, yeah, the whole dystopian scenario is great, and the worldbuilding is impressive. But there's SOOOO much politics that it boggles my mind why there was a need for it. Yes, its plot relevant, but its so annoying. I couldn't stomach, sorry.

I disliked the premise of Riders, and even though I tried reading it, it felt way too forced for 11yo talk the way they did and it turned me off.

I'm picky, I know, but what can I do, I like what I like and hate what I hate. Though I do change my mind on somethings. I once disliked the Idea of Grow Young with Me and then I actually read it and it simply became my favourite fic all time. I love it soo damn much that I asked Mallory if I could translate it to my native, which she said yes, bless her.

But thank you for the suggestions, I'll take a look at that one where Voldie kidnaps Harry.

****** Betrayal. linkffn(9095016). Yep, I read that one too. There are a lot of "Hermione accidentally/intentionally goes with Ron" fics, it's one of the only good points of divergence in the seventh book and a good chance to insert someone else into Harry's life.

Darth Marrs writes interesting fanfics. It isn't always to people's tastes, but there's thought behind it and the fics aren't stuck to the stations of canon. Revenge of the Wizard is interesting because it slams the wizarding world's magic directly against the technology of Star Wars and the power of the Force, and both sides have to make adaptations to continue pursuing the other. There are ups and downs and I personally enjoyed that fic.

Emperor... It reads less like a standard fic, and closer to a narrative retelling of historical events. There's complex political movements, battles and campaigns adding up to strategies within a war, and generally just a lot of maneuvering. It's not one person fighting heroically through a series of problems. In that respect, it's an interesting fic. I wasn't super into it, honestly, but brought it up just because it kind of matches the theme. If you're on the fence about it, you might actually want to first read linkffn(5324704) Tyrant. It was the stated direct inspiration of Emperor, and was in turn inspired by the history of Rome under Caesar, but applied to the Wizarding World under Sirius Black after his defeat of Voldemort.

Wastelands didn't rely on the loop mechanic too often except as setup to how things are now, both an excuse for Harry's knowledge and skills and a motivation to keep going instead of letting things play out. A lot of time loop stories get bogged down at the beginning, instead of skipping ahead to the end, because why have a time loop and then not actually show it, right? But Wastelands moves forward and has a concrete and finite plot. I liked it. But it was a bit of a whirlwind, all sorts of things being brought up with little context, the readers dragged along by a character who already knows many details of the plot.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom starts out with a /very/ AU world and doesn't do a lot to acclimatize the reader. I enjoyed going through and seeing familiar elements in totally new situations, though, and the way that the different circumstances change how they act. I'm also a sucker for fics that have magic as something really magical and deep and powerful, though, not something that can be easily substituted with technology, and this delivered on that many times over.

Incorruptible's politics bogged down the entire thing, yep. I wasn't there to read about Harry getting yelled at for his decisions, I wanted to see him killing zombies. Riders isn't that great a fic, I only recommended it because it has commonalities. I didn't even make it to where it stalled.

******* Yeah, everything you said about Emperor turned me off even more. Though this Tyrant may seem interesting.

But yeah, Wastelands just doesn't do it for me, Idk what about Harry in particular I don't like, but he's just isn't relatable to me.

I've tried reading other things from Darth Marss, but really couldn't enjoy. Dunno what about that, but just wasn't my cup of tea.

Prince seems more interesting, I also love, well arcane shit and impressive magic. Or even different concepts from pre-determined things. Like a Horcrux that embodies a type of emotion that Voldermot purged from his soul. You can get into really interesting and esoteric things, because, lets say Voldemort "purged" his "adventurous curiosity" which is a abstract notion in itself, combined with the corruption of others in close proximity of a Horcrux, you could have a scenario where people will do reckless things without considering anything, and you could make the protection of the thing as a series of impossible obsctacles that the person will simply "want" to try because of the influence of the Horcrux.

Stuff like that is why I love fanfics, and if you splash romance on it, it becomes quickly my favourite fic.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.
