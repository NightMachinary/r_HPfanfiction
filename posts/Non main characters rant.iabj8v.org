** Well I just think it's to connect them more to the central characters

​

im not sure what your issue with the pairings is can you explain further ?

*** I think that you can like whatever pairings you like, but I don't like how they have two people who have never said a single thing to each other in canon suddenly are the perfect match. Again this is just how I feel. Sorry if you are offended or something. :)

**** see that can work in its favour because say Pansy and Ron have never spoke but you can then build that relationship from the ground up and characters like Pansy dont really have personality or atleast not fully formed ones so it becomes I suppose sort of

​

"Well who,s to say it couldnt happen?

​

I am firm beleiver in anything can work you just have to put in the leg work to make it work

​

Daphne is basically putty you can mould her into any shape because she has no defined character so she can be made a match because of that

** Most of these stories usually have divergents to make friendship or romance possible

So many stories have the same old cast of Harry/Hermione/Ron so authors introduce friendships with other children from other Houses to make it more interesting

I personally like it, especially when the author is good at creating good characterization. Though I can understand the frustration if the friendship/relationship appeared suddenly out of nowhere

** I see where you're coming from. For me, it kind of depends on what Harry was concerned about in canon. The bulk of the series is told from his point of view, and I for one really like to break out of that. Maybe the Draco-Justin friendship could have been a thing, but not during book 6 when Harry was obsessed with whatever Draco was "up to" all year. Hermione spends so much time in the library that she could reasonably strike up a friendship with any other bookworm, and I'm working on a fic where she manages to have some secret meetings with another student who helps her learn survival skills before going on the run. Harry spends all of what, 2 seconds, wondering how Hermione learned everything the needed for book 7 but weren't taught at Hogwarts? I needed better answers than that ;)
