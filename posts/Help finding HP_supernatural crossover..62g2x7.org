The fic starts with Harry being friends with Bela and basically being a troll to others as a joke. He has hate of the archangels and can't seem to stay dead. He has been alive a long time and all his fellow wizards and the witches are dead. I can't remember the name but I do remember parts of it clearly but searchs bring up nothing but slash and the like which don't match the story. Any help would be welcomed. Thanks.


** Is it linkffn(Illusions of Grandeur by Kanathia) ?

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

** I remember this one but can't think of the name either. I also remember that something happened and none of the Wizarding world existed anymore, it had been wiped out by the Angel time traveling and changing something I believe. But they couldn't erase Harry.

*** That may be another one. The one I'm thinking of was set so the Archangels destroyed it all. A scene had Michael and Lucifer killing Ginny and the kids in it.

**** It's fanfiction, so it's entirely possible. I didn't know there would be two Harry Potter as some kind of immortal in Supernatural fics, but it's certainly plausible. In the one I read there was a major plot point that the Slytherin Ring aka the Resurrection Stone was Death of the Four Horsemen's ring.

I like this concept of the Resurrection Stone being Death's ring. Tell me more.

****** That's pretty much the gist of what I remember. It was set during seasons four and five of Supernatural so that was happening in the background. It's been a while but I remember a scene where they were saying "We need to find Death. We need Death's ring to stop this." and Harry says "I have it, it's safe." and shows them what was previously pointed out as the Resurrection Stone in the story. Of course then there confrontations of "Why the hell do you have Death's ring?" "Because I'm the Master of Death." I don't remember what happened after that.
