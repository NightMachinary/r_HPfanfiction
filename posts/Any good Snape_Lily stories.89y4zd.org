I just wanna read a story where Snape stalks Lily non-stop and is super obsessed over her like he steals the invisible cloak and sneaks into her room and watches her sleep. In class whenever slytherin/gryffindor are together he's always just pining over her and kinda paralyzed to get close and one day she's forced to be his potions partner or whatever. Like he's just always standing within the trees of the dark foreset watching her and practicing dark magic. Ye, that would be a great story.


** Like, he's standing in the shadows, wanking while watching Lily and James shagging?\\
Or rather, where Snape convinces Lily to join the Death Eaters ranks with him?

**** Sneaking into someone's room and watching them sleep isn't creepy?

** That is... very specific. The closest thing I can come up with is linkao3(Betrayals by terri_testing), though it's not exactly what you talked about.
