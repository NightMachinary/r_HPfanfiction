Does one of the Trio overcome a fatal flaw? Does a villain decide to reject the Death Eaters? Do the Weasley Twins finally mature (hey, it could happen!)? Does Dumbledore get fed up and decide to use the full, potentially evil extent of his power? Whatever it is, give me your favorite, best-done character arcs in fanfic :)


** I'm not going to say it is the 'best' per se but Neville Longbottom in Linkffn(Asking for Roses by Dogstar101) really comes into his own. This fic takes place after Book 5 and we see him gain confidence and believe in himself. The story itself is not going to make any top 10 lists, but Neville as a character is hit dead on. His interactions with Gran are also handled very well and the way they treat each other adapts well as the story progresses.

  Neville thinks his summer will be much like any other: working in his grandmother's garden and other lonely pursuits. After leaving Hogwarts many months before, Hannah Abbott believes she is trapped and isolated for good. They're both mistaken. PreTDH.

** Marlene McKinnon in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) goes through a pretty interesting development. She's more of a side character for larger parts of the story but there's other interesting characters too, like the only good Draco I've seen in fanfiction that was actually believable, and very interesting developments for Tonks and Remus. It also has one of my all time favorite scenes where Harry and Hermione see magic in muggle primary school and try to convince each other that it wasn't magic because they both think that the other one is a muggle.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
