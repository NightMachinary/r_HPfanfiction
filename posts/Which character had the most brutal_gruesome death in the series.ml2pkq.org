** Probably anyone who died due to a werewolf attack. I just looked up the list of deaths, and there are a lot of unknown causes but most are Killing Curses and other quick ways.

Every mention of a werewolf though, basically said they are mauled before later dying due to their wounds. Slow and excruciating with the mental weight of knowing that if you survive, you'll be treated worse than a second class citizen in your home country.

Heck there was a five year old boy, Montgomery, who was mauled by Greyback because his Mum wouldn't help the Death Eaters. Can you imagine not having any idea what is happening as you're being eaten? Kid was five, he had no idea what a werewolf actually was.

Then there's Lavender. She did defend herself, but it wasn't enough. Imagine the self hate she was feeling, "why wasn't I stronger, I couldn't do anything" must have sucked.

So, yeah, I'd say werewolf mauling.

**** OP wasn't saying Lavender died, otherwise she wouldn't be thinking depressing thoughts (or any thoughts).

Also, we may have had fanfiction like that anyways, because it's fanfiction.

** Sir Nicholas. I believe that he was /executed/ with a rusty axe that left his head hanging on by sinew. Plus the fact that he had to endure the repeated blows? Nothing is more brutal than that

** Peter was actually the first one that came mind. Choked by his own hand for a moment if hesitation.

There also a couple mentioned by the Prophet in book 6 I believed. Murdered by their pre-Hogwarts grandchild. Imperius curse was suspected.
