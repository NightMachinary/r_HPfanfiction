Looking for any fic where a numerically inferior force of Hogwarts, effectively slaughters attacking Death Eater hordes, using discipline and good tactics. They dont have to win though, just an epic last stand is enough.\\
Alternatively, a crack, fic with copy/pasted plot-lines of Harry/Leonidas and Voldemort/Xerxes would be fun as well :)


** I know it gets a lot of hate lately but Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness did basically that except for Neville and the gang running in underwear at the Death Eaters.

*** Why does it get so much hate, other than being a bit over the top and the author being... unique?

**** Specifically because of the author. Probably also he's glorifying war and the idea of child soldier.

**** I believe it's been removed but you may find it for download if you search for it. I believe that the author was called Thanfiction.
