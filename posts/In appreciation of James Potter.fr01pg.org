I know this post is almost two days late, but on the 60th anniversary of his birth (he was born on 27 March 1960) give us some good stories focused on James Potter. Positive, happy stories with James/Lily preferred.

I'll also add linkffn(Where The Air Is Rarefied; Many Thanks by Madm05) myself. The first is pure James/Lily, the second is also James/Lily but the focus is Harry/Hermione from a James POV.

P.S. Please no Death Eater pairings, especially no Snape/Lily.


** A JP thread is getting downvoted to oblivion, how predictable.

linkffn(4180686; 13435370).

Not positive or happy, but they're decent family fics.

******** According to Snape-stans, Snape does all the shit he does because :

- he's poor,
- "abused" by his father (even though all we see is his father yelling at him),
- "groomed" into it by Malfoy (one pat on the back after Snape is sorted into Slytherin means being groomed according to these people),
- "bullied" by James, (even though Lupin clearly says Snape missed no chances to curse James back, not to mention Sectumsempra),
- calls muggleborns mudbloods because it was apparently acceptable to call them that (because Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black used to call them that, about a hundred years before Snape was born).

They go to any lengths to excuse Snape's behaviour. Everything he does is someone else's fault, never his own.

They are some of the most delusional people I've ever seen. They also claim that Snape is a fantastic teacher (lol), and that his punishments are "very kind". In their madness, they think the Cruciatus Curse is painless.

But being a "bully", hooo, that's worse than Voldemort, yessir. /s

********** Yes. Pretend I'm saying the stuff down below in a babyish voice.

"Snape picked on Hermione in 4th year because his Dark Mark was darkening, therefore Snape knew that Voldemort would be returning, and so picking on teenage muggleborn girls in front of the Death Eaters' children was vital in letting Voldemort know he was loyal to Voldemort!"

"Snape didn't commit any crime between 1978 and 1980 as a Death Eater. Snape just sat on his ass and twiddled his thumbs, and Voldemort and the other Death Eaters were 9000% okay with that!"

"But Snape asking for more leniency and clemency for school students when they were tortured with the Cruciatus Curse - ooh nooo, Voldemort and the other Death Eaters would NOT have been okay with that!"

Those three users are disgusting.

** I will give you a story that I think is just a beautiful story about the marauders and co and I just love James character in it. But it is not just focused on him, but all those characters

linkffn(Dirty Blood)

​

The next one is a story about James in Hufflepuff and how that would have suited him well.

linkffn(The Vegan Cupcake)

​

And a last one you can happily ignore because this is shameless self-promotion. It is a story I wrote about James and how he slowly fell in love with Lily. linkffn(The Best by Schak)

  [Marauders Era Year Five] It's 1975 and Hogwarts students are trying to focus on their schooling, but with fellow students practicing dark magic and friendships being tested, it's hard to ignore that their parents' war will soon be theirs. And yet, they still try, forcing light in the darkness and daring to laugh when others want to cry. After all, they aren't dead yet.

  Lily Evans can't take her eyes off James Potter when he waltzes into the Gryffindor room with a confident air and a tray full of cupcakes. He's the cocky Hufflepuff chaser that helped slaughter Gryffindor's team on the quidditch pitch. Naturally, she ought to hate James like the rest of her friends but Lily doesn't hate him, not even a little bit. (Jily Hogwarts AU).
