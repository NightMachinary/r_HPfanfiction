** Linkffn(stages of hope)

This has a Harry who knows he's a horcrux and so knows that he'll have to die to finish off Voldemort. It's a bit angsty. It's great.

In addition he goes to an alternate universe where Neville was the boy who lived, thus Lily and James are alive. More angst ensues

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

**** little0bird writes some pretty cool H/G stuff, yeah. She has an entire series of these. I like Questions and Answers a lot myself. It's WIP, though.
