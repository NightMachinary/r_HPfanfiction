I'd love to read some fics where Harry has his parents growing up, can anyone recommend any?


** There's always the oft lauded [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][& the BWL]].

Family Harry isn't really my cup of tea, though, so I can't particularly be helpful here.

** If you want a twisted version of this (with an increasing amount of shipping as the series progresses, and a focus on Slytherin!Harry/Draco), you might look into the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Sacrifices Arc]] by Lightning on the Wave. It's gigantic, and complete, which is a beautiful combination. The author uses Trigger Warnings liberally, and is especially careful to warn before delving into smut, so you can easily skip over those parts if you're not really a fan of that.

**** This is probably my favourite epic/novel length fic. It's very long, has lots of major and minor characters that we learn all about, and can be very difficult to read due to so many things going on, literary and other allusions, and the graphic violence. All that said, *I can't recommend it enough*; so much happens as the books go on, it's hard to imagine it all after only reading the first part. According to the author's LJ, it started as an attempt to write some of the major cliches into a good story, e.g. Slytherin!Harry, Harry/Draco, Lily & James alive, twinfic, etc.

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2970733/1/Unknown-Relations-The-Philosopher-s-Stone][Unkown Relations series (link to book 1)]] retell the first four books with Lily & James still alive, raising Hayden Potter, the BWL, and his twin Harry is living as Orion Black, adopted son of Sirius Black. It sounds odd, but it's very well done, despite the cliched twin-fic, nBWL, adoption, etc. The relationship Harry/Orion has Sirius is really touching, and he's written as a believable 11-year-old, while he struggles with coming to terms with the identity of his birth family.

Book 1 description:

#+begin_quote
  Follow Orion Black as he enters his first year at Hogwarts and learns more than he ever imagined about his mysterious past, the scar on his forehead shaped like a lighting bolt and the boy who lived, Hayden Potter.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween]] Is a good one and by 'robst' who is a good HP writer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10202484/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Life-He-Never-Had]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9906636/1/The-Legend-of-Harry-James-Arthur-Gryffindor-Pendragon-Potter]] Is a good one as well, if a tad crazy at times.

**** I found A Different Halloween really awkwardly written, I'm not sure if it's just that the first chapter hasn't found its roll yet or not, but it really came off as stilted and bad to me, couldn't get through it.

***** I have found his stories to be good the first time around, particularly when you haven't read a lot of other fanfic to compare it to. After that they get progressively harder to read.

****** Seems right to me. When I was just starting, this would probably be really good, but having been reading fanfic for over a decade now, it's not very impressive.

**** That's the trouble with many fanfics, the poor quality of grammar and spelling. It is a good story, if you're willing to overlook that.
