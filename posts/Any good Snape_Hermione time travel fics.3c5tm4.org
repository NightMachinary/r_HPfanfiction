Preferably complete, and if she stays in the past and can't return to the future, even better. Thanks a lot!


** Time Travel is my favorite trope for Snape/Hermione. A few of my favorites are:

linkffn(An Unwritten Future by Aurette)

linkffn(For All Intents and Purposes by rhiannonofthemoon)

linkffn(Thirty-One Days by keelhaulrose)

linkffn(Fade to Grey by marianne le fay)

linkffn(Second Time Around by Witch Nova) <-Snape is deaged in the present so not a true time turner fic

The grand daddy Time Travel fic is linkffn(Pride of Time by Anubis Ankh). I only thought this fic was only okay as it dragged on way too long for me (it's 555k words long).

With Pride of Time, the author wrote a new story that is a split from Pride that is called linkffn(Divide of Time by Anubis Ankh) where I believe Hermione stays in the past (I haven't read it).

*** I recently read Pride of Time and Divide of Time for the first time. I highly recommend both. Hermione stays in the past in both. The difference is in one she catches up to her timeline and re-assimilates herself into it, where she left off. The second she doesn't and goes "missing" from her original timeline. The way she does so is interesting, so I won't spoil it, but OP - read these two! Totally worth it.

Edit: I've also read the fics by Aurette and keelhaulrose. They're two of my fave authors, so check those out too.

Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Ancient and Noble House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.

** Every fic that [[/u/Dimplz]] recommended are great, although I personally /adore/ Pride of Time.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2872305/1/The-Library]]) has a brief ship of RLHG, but that doesn't last. It also has a sequel, which is incomplete.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/176923]]) is a oneshot.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9234232/1/Do-You-Have-The-Time]]) has Hermione going back-and-forth through two time periods.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9596014/1/Time-s-Fool]]) is unique in that both Severus and Hermione travel to the past and live through major history events.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3135350/1/This-Is-The-Way-The-World-Ends]]) has both Harry and Hermione going back in time.

  Each morning Hermione wakes in either 1997 or 1977. She has Severus Snape as a friend, and it all seems like a dream until Professor Snape tells her to stay away from his 1977 self. The teen version of Severus is becoming much too interested in Hermione for the Professor's liking and the relationship means consequences in the present as well.
