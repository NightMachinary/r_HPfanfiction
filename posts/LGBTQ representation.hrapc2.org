** I've been working on a non-binary Harry fic for a while, but am struggling to actually write it. I seem perpetually stuck in the outline phase so I don't know if anything more will come of it yet.

I, too, have been searching for more fics grsm -- especially trans -- representative fics. There's a lot of fics with Harry being gay, but I haven't seen an abundance of representation beyond that.

** The only story which seems to me realistic (probably written by somebody, who personally struggles with these issues) is linkffn(Magical Metamorphosis by Eon the Dragon Mage).

** I'm working on one at the moment with the next generation of Potter-Granger-Weasley's - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13635069/1/Daisy-Dursley-and-The-Strangest-Summer]] Here's a link to Book 1 which doesn't have much LGBTQ content at the moment (one lesbian couple) but if you follow and keep an eye on it Book 3 will be centred around a non-binary character.
