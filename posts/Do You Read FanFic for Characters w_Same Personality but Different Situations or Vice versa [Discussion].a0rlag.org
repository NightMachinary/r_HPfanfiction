I got into this in a PM recently. Someone had seen me express my disinterest in stories where characters have significantly different personalities than they do in canon despite me writing a story where some characters are much different.

I guess for me, since I read fanfic primarily for "X, Y & Z are like their canon selves, but the events happen differently", stories where Harry is a genius or a ''''''''political''''''' wiz kid, Snape isn't an incorrigible asshole or is even slightly attractive, Hermione is (to quote [[/u/Hellstrike]]) "Wikipedia with tits", Ginny as a Quidditch pro, model and super-wizard or whatever, they hold no appeal to me. There's no way for me to read these and other stories as anything but "Oh hey, they made an OC and called them Snape".

Unless it's /reeeeeally/ obvious and clearly layed out why the character is different - and they don't end up doing a 180 on everything - I just don't want to read it. I need a real tie in to something in canon to not get bored immediately. Progress is fine, as long as there's a through line there that feels legitimate. E.g. Draco suddenly being pro-equality, Ron being very smart (or a fuckin Death Eater...), Hermione deeply betraying friends "because rules", etc. No.

Maybe I'm too closed minded (it works for me), but do you read HP fanfic for diverse presentations of the characters attributes or tend more towards something closer to their canon incarnations?


** I think the point of fan fiction is for people to explore these differences and I find it interesting to see these different “versions” of canon personalities. Some of the things you mentioned - Snape being attractive or kinder, Ron being secretly a genius, etc - I'd be fine with reading these if it was the catalyst of the story and the plot focused more on how the other characters change as a result of this change. But if the focus of the fic is just Harry being OP as fuck and never losing a battle ever, then it kinda defeats the purpose of a story for me.

However, I'm a sucker for fluffy romance AUs so I end up reading a ton of fics where the characters' personalities are bent a lil to make the romance work, ie Draco not being a blood purist or being less cruel than his canon counterpart as a result of being raised not by “Lucius the Death Eater” but rather a different version of him that's more feasible in a normal universe that still parallels canon.

** In my opinion fanfiction is about playing in the author's sandbox. This means either you keep the characters similar to canon and throw them into a new situation or keep the story the same but change the characters (eg Harry gets political power). The latter runs the risk of making the characters feel like an OC with a canon name tag.

Obviously, there is some freedom for interpretation. Relationships, dating and sex for example are basically non-existent in canon, so adding fangirls doing the "Naked Man" wouldn't be unrealistic, even if untrue to Rowling's spirit. But turning Harry into a pureblood supremacist fits neither canon spirit nor plot or characters. Or randomly making everyone smoking hot because you wank to your own story. Half the appeal is that the characters are relatable, and the tits of a Playboy cover model combined with the lethality of Simo Häyhä and the academic achievement of Stephen Hawking are not.

Tl;dr: Play in Rowling's sandbox but don't build magical swastikas or naked supermodels.

** I'm a character purist, so if a fic starts going into ooc territory, I won't bother. Why read a fic about a certain character if they aren't even reacting to a situation like their canon selves might conceivably act?? I'd prefer if an author wanted to do that they just put in an oc insert instead.

*** What about divergences where Characters grow out of certain traits due to in story reasons or circumstances force them to act differently? For example, Hermione cannot deny that Malfoy is a Death Eater when Harry is in St Mungos with Cruciatus exposure and Myrtle witnessed the whole fight.

**** I've got zero problem with that kind of thing cuz it's in the realm of possibility for the characters. However, I won't bother if Draco suddenly becomes a kungfu badass and Hermione is cracking jokes. I especially won't bother if the dialogue doesn't really sound like how the characters would talk even with divergent events or character growth, which is a harsh line, I know, but given how much HP fic is out there I say why bit be picky.

** As you already said: If its laid out to me /why/ they are different, then I'm fine with it.

I'm not a fan of fics where the authors assumes canon before his fics beginning, and then every character starts with an incredible character change for no apparent reason. If you change characters, give it a reason. There needs to be some incentive for it.

** I prefer fics where characters act more or less like their canon counterparts. Just recently I came across a fic where Remus Lupin had sex with a student. I stopped reading it because I refuse to believe this would have happened in canon. Maybe I'm close-minded too, but I don't see fanfic as a means to completely change canon characters. In my opinion then it's better to call it original fiction because characters are unrecognizable there.I mean, I read fanfic because I already enjoyed the original work. I could enjoy a fic where Snape isn't as nasty and vindictive as he is in canon, but only if the author shows how this hapened. I even dislike when, for example, Tonks, upon hearing Lupin is werewolf during their very first meeting, is like,'great'. How did this happen? Does she happen to know another werewolf? In other words, I want motives and reasons, not some perfect behaviour out of the blue.

** For me it's ok to write a character that will act OOC from his canon character. Ex: fic!TomRiddle is a lovesick fool; Petunia cares for Harry; Draco isn't prejudiced against muggleborns...etc. BUT the author should come up with a backstory as to why the character is like that; and the logic and consistency of why the altered personality acts like that should be plausible.

** Personally, I'm with you. For me, what made Harry Potter great was the connection to the characters, not the world building or the good vs. evil plot. Completely changing the personality of a character but still calling them by their name is a cop out, a way to draw an instant connection between the reader and the character without having to do the work. It's how writers try to justify pairing Hermione with Draco or Snape or whoever. It totally ruins the basis of that character yet the reader is supposed to maintain that connection with the HP universe.

Putting a character in a new situation but keeping the essence of their character true is actually quite tough. And some of the best stories are great because of how well they do this. The Changeling is one of the best examples; Ginny is certainly different but the author is able to keep her true to her canon characterization. It's completely logical that if you place a character in a new situation, they won't be the exact same, but to make them completely different makes no sense either.

** The question suggests that you can only read and write fanfiction for one of those reasons. I'm not interested in either. I want the 'missing moments' we didn't see in canon and I want post (or pre) canon development. (And a plot, but that may be going a step too far.) I do want to recognise the canon characters but I'm a fan of a well developed OC too.

*** Missing moments are, by definition, accurate to canon characterisation. If a character is not well defined (eg Tonks, Katie Bell, Lavender Brown) you have some freedom, but even then "missing moments" require the author to not contradict canon.

** within the realm of their canon personality, in different situations. some of the things you're against are just because of your own biases. harry will never be a genius, or a political wunderkind. that's not in the vicinity of his character. snape isn't an incorrigible asshole, and his being attractive is subjective. ginny...is good at quidditch, canonically really hot, and talented. i can see her being most of the things you mentioned, depending on your definition of super-wizard. i don't think draco will start being a passionate advocate for equality, but he does stop being a bigot and raises his son as such. ron isn't a DE, nor is he very smart. he's a professional sidekick and Average Teenage Boy. it also just has to be coherent within the fic.

*** Snape spends the majority of the books being extremely rude and demeaning to everyone so yes he's an incorrigible ass. Ginny is regarded as good looking and a competent wizard, not so incredibly beautiful that she'd be a literal model and so talented she's the next Bellatrix. And even in the series, Draco's change was pretty ridiculous given he was still trying to give Harry up to Voldemort within the last fifty pages of Deathly Hallows.

So to the extent any of those are possible you have to squint your eyes and accept opaque character development or something.

**** snape spends /all/ of the books being rude and demeaning to people he feels like being rude and demeaning to. i'd say he's like house, except house is intentionally an asshole to his friends, whereas snape was only ever unintentionally so. he's supportive and kind to the people he likes- the slytherins, draco, lily, etc.

i don't think you know what a 'literal model' is. ginny is regarded as very attractive. enough for it to be mentioned by pansy, a bigot, and krum, an international quidditch player who goes after 'good looking' girls. bonnie wright is a 'literal model', and a lot of people regard her as less attractive than book!ginny. she's not the next bellatrix, but she is talented, enough to be noticed by slughorn.

draco tried to give up harry out of cowardice. he was only half-heartedly going along with his parents when the trio were caught at malfoy manor

***** It's like you don't read what I'm saying. Yes, Snape is an asshole. As you agree, why did previously say:

#+begin_quote
  snape isn't an incorrigible asshole
#+end_quote

Anyone can be "supportive" to those they like. Being rude to nearly everyone else (even bullying students) makes one an asshole to their core. It's even worse if they're intentionally doing it.

Come on. My point about Ginny is that some stories will either make her one because she's apparently that attractive or have people constantly mention she should be one. I said she's supposed to be attractive in the stories, talented as well. But not the silly exaggerations that I listed in the OP.

Oh sorry, I forgot that Draco only just then tried to give Harry up. Silly me. Must have been a one time thing, I'm she he never did something like that befor- Oh wait, there were six books before that one...

****** well, it depends on what you mean by being portrayed as an incorrigible asshole. if you have a fic. where snape only interacts with people he likes and wants to, then he wouldn't be an asshole in that fic., which is what you seem to be against. regardless, i don't see what's incorrigible about his behaviour

yeah, and my point is that i don't see anything OOC with people reacting to ginny that way. i have no idea what your weird hangup with ginny being a model is

draco entire arc leads up to his abandoning his prejudices and becoming a not-bad person, something you can't seem to comprehend. either write about him after DH, or something to trigger his change during the series
