***** Let me start at the beginning, then. :)

If you have 5 galleons in your pocket and travel to 10 minutes in the past, presumably you'd still have those 5 galleons in your pocket. So, now, you have 5 galleons which have been, essentially, duplicated, existing at once.

This premise is typical in a time travel story but with several years of time travel rather than 10 minutes.

When we're talking about serial numbers, we're referring to the identification numbers which appear on the Galleon (similar to money in the real world). In canon, it's said that each Galleon has a serial number which refers to the Goblin which created it.

So say we have a number which identifies that Goblin: 123

Now, if the serial numbers are "static" then they /only/ contain the information which traces it back to the Goblin which created it "123". In this case, there'd be no way to identify duplicates because all you'd know is that Goblin 123 created it.

But if serial numbers are /enumerated/, you'd presumably have numbers that look like this: 123001, where the Goblin is 123 and this is the first Galleon he ever made "001". The second Galleon he ever made would be: 123002

So on and so forth.

In this situation, detecting duplicates would be relatively easy (assuming you have an instantaneous and easily searchable database of Galleons which, on second thought, may not be the case, unless Goblins are constantly logging the serial numbers for each Galleon that enters the bank - some kind of magic?).

It could be with a hell of a lot of magic ingrained into Galleons and spells which register the arrival and location of the Galleon when it comes into the bank.

An easier but less instantaneous method would involve Goblins transcribing the serial number or identifying way into a group of magically linked books that contain a list of where every Galleon is (,be it in a vault or withdrawn by Specific person from x vault). They could do this while the person is in the bank or after they leave (easier).

I can definitely see Goblins having some kind of method to keep track.

I'm willing to concede that the original 8 movies aren't canon, as they are adaptations that did miss things out due, naturally, to cinematic constraints. But movies such as Fantastic Beasts or plays such as Cursed Child are most decidedly canon. They were sanctioned and approved by Rowling pre-production. Therefore, they are an accepted part of the world building. Hell even her interviews and twitter posts (or other WoG's) are supposed to be considered canon.

We may not like it and not use it as canon due to the contradictions (Rowling was still an amateur when she wrote the first four books after all), but it doesn't change the fact that it IS canon.

*** Yes, obviously. No one is going through the coins and hand checking every serial number. But in a world of magic it doesn't seem out of place for the Goblins to keep a record of all of them in the bank. Imagine a simple SQL script:

INSERT INTO coins (serial) VALUES (?)

If a record already exists, that would throw an error. And boy howdy, is that an error for the ages.

The obvious counter argument would be to never put your time-travelled currency back into the bank. But eventually you're going to have to buy something with the money, presumably, and then that money would go into the bank.

Oh, a duplicate record...? Well, let's see...

SELECT FROM coins WHERE serial = ?

Hmm... seems there's a duplicate of money existing in the Potter vaults!

This kind of data entry literally already exists - even in 1991. I imagine magic would just streamline this process.

It's worth noting that this kind of problem only arises because so far as we can tell, Gringotts is the central location for you to store your valuables. This obviously doesn't happen in real life because there are thousands and thousands of banks.

**** Ok true I'll concede that point but to totally get nitpicky, when would the goblins handle your gold to get an accurate look at the serial number? The way banking works in the series is you show up, go to your vault, put your coins in a bag, leave. At no time is a goblin going to know which serial numbers you've taken out. Let's say galleon serial number X237PL exists in the Malfoy vault. Draco couldve grabbed that galleon for school supplies or Lucius could've grabbed it to bribe Fudge with. How are the goblins or anyone else to know that they grabbed that specific galleon or one of their other 5 million?

And all of this is ignoring the fact that every time travel/alternate dimension fic I've read where they bring shit with them has them simply keep it on them at all times. I've never once seen a traveler redeposit the money. And once you buy something it's no longer you who is depositing it and a business isn't likely to remember which customer gave you which galleon. Therefore making it hard to trace back to you even if that business then goes to a goblin teller and has them deposit the gold for them.
