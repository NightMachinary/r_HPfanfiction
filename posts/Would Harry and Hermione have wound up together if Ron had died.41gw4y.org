JK has mentioned that she floated the idea of having Ron die in the final battle. If he had, would it have been Harry and Hermione seeing off their kids at King's Cross? Do you think Harry and Ginny would have still ended up together? If so, what about Hermione?

If Ron had died and Harry and Hermione did end up together, the tent scene would suddenly become some dark foreshadowing. Harry took the initiative to get close to her, and it was Hermione who stepped away. Without Ron, who is to say?


** It's hard to say with any certainty; Ron dying changes the whole fabric of the canon and the entire relationship dynamic of the rest of the trio. If Ron died, his death would have a /profound/ effect on both Harry and Hermione, because he's their shared best friend, which could logically push them together out of shared grief/guilt. However, I'm pretty sure JKR had Harry/Ginny planned from the beginning, and she probably wouldn't have included all that build up between Ron and Hermione only to have H/Hr win out in the end, if she ever seriously considered killing off Ron.

** Ron dying would suck. Hermione either becomes really jaded and that takes over her view of how to maneuver the political world or she goes into academia and is just far removed from personal contact. Harry's fate is worse, he's cause the death of his brother and another Weasley, he may just push their family away and Ginny away, and maybe just lock himself up in Grimmauld Place for a long while. If Ron had died I don't think these two have a chance at being balanced people in adulthood, their very direct friend and comrade who's been constabtly present for 7 years is suddenly gone. It might even push Harry and Hermione apart rather than together.

(As much as I dislike Ron (bad friend, jealous, under-achiever with delusions of grandeur, always in the shadow of Harry and his older siblings!), I can acknowledge that he's somewhat brave and makes his own decisions!)

**** Might not be fair, but people will latch on to Harry, the Weasleys will forgive him because they are decent people, but Harry, strong as he may be, has the potential to blame himself and very directly pushing people like Ginny away for their own safety. Yes I can see a possibility where the mental state of both he, and Hermione who has lost someone she loved very much, not wanting to be around each other because of painful memories being drudged up. It's a possibility.

Also, your interpretation of Ron is quite weird. And "somewhat brave" is an insult. You're telling me most 11 year olds wouldn't nope out of a heist against a very scary 3-headed dog, put themselves between said best friend and what he fully believed to be a murderer, etc. etc. Ron has flaws, Hermione has flaws, Harry has flaws. They're all wonderful people, but life-shaking events, like a war in which your near brother and the person you love the most dies (which I fully believe for Harry is Ron), can affect people and change them for the worse.

Look all these characters have terrible traits and awesome traits. Similar to normal people who can do some pretty bad things and be jerks sometimes and be generous and upstanding at other times. As long as the net is good, I would say that that's not a bad human being.

** Maybe, but not right away. Both Harry and Hermione would need a helluva lot of time to mature as people before going for each other under those circumstances.

Harry would need to overcome the trauma and issues arising from the War before considering it, what with dying and having so many people die with/around him. Besides, with his childhood, he wouldn't know stability if it rose up and slapped him in the face. His entire life has been one of traumatic upheaval. It would take years for him to get used to the fact that no, Halloween didn't mark the day where he should barricade his door & crouch in the corner with a shotgun cradled in his trembling hands, figures of authority aren't automatically going to turn around and try to frame/arrest/kill/enslave him and having people call him friends isn't an automatic death sentence to them.

Hermione would need to basically do the same. After spending seven years faced with gradually more dangerous ground and losing someone she had feelings for in a massive battle, the last thing on her mind would be a relationship. First thing would be getting her parents looked after, second would be securing herself a future in and out of the wizarding world and third would be figuring out just how to complete her education. Left unsaid is the almost automatic reaction by that stage where 'strange things happening = somebody's trying to kill me/them/us again'. Professor falling sick? Possible possession. Student acting strange? Double agent under the thrall of a Death Eater looking for revenge. Somebody jostling her from behind? Possible ambush/setup, defensive fighting advised. Someone looking to befriend you? Said someone's looking for an in into the BWL's life.

Getting past these issues will, again, take many years. Any relationship initiated during that process would need to be insanely strong to overcome these massive hurdles. Harry and Hermione getting together would require either an early start (with fifth year being the cutoff point) or a late start (with two years after the battle of Hogwarts taking place being said starting point) for the relationship to succeed.

End of year five is a wash for obvious reasons (nearly dying has a tendency to put a crimp on any crush you might have had for the one responsible for putting you into a near-death situation, voluntary or not), year six is basically CHAOS and year seven is the one where basically anything that happens between the two is hushed up and never alluded to again (lack of food, water and basic hygiene stuff? Yeah, not a good combo when doing the deed).

So, to me? Serious H/Hr'ing in a world where Ron's been smeared across Hogwarts grounds would have to take place long after the dust has settled. June 2000 onwards, sure, great. Before? Hah, no.

And there's always this to consider-the two people in this pairing are extraordinarily volatile. Harry's pretty much a noir street detective by nature-look for clues, get lost in the intrigue, fight the unfightable, kill the unkillable, never give up and give witty one-liners the second you find an opening. Hermione's a Dark Lord in disguise-scary smart, dangerously amoral when vengeful, ends-justify-means outlook on pretty much every situation and utterly, terrifyingly driven when given a cause to strive towards. They are a truly scary combination to consider-and very hard to write properly. Hermione and Ron mellow each other out. Ron's a guy who is, basically, pretty damn good at anything he sets his mind towards. He is also very frank in his outlook-if something happens, he's generally the guy that points out how cool or shit the something is. He does have his moments of utter idiocy, but he learns from them. He also is not driven by ambition as much as he's driven by interest. Hermione can find something utterly gut-wrenchingly boring and stick it out for a long time as evidenced with her managing to last a year in Muggle studies. Ron will see something he's not interested in, spend five minutes figuring out the basics then go back to doing what he wants to do. And while that's a bad trait when studying, it's a relatively good one when living-up to a point. Hermione and Ron work well together in that Ron knows what to do when Hermione gets on a roll on something she doesn't like. Hermione knows how to 'motivate' Ron. Together, they can make it work.

Harry, on the other hand, won't be the same. If Hermione goes on a roll with something, Harry's method of dealing with it would be to push her onto something else. That... doesn't work for very long. He will end up accidentally focusing her brain on something that will end the Wizarding World as the wizards and witches know it-and not necessarily in a good way.

** In universe, I don't think it would change any of Harry's feelings. He didn't pursue romance with Hermione because he didn't want to, not for Ron's sake. He would still have feelings for Ginny, and he'd still think of Hermione as a sister, like he said.

But would JKR have rewritten all that if she had known Ron would die? Maybe, but that'd dismantle a lot of Harry/Ginny buildup from previous books.

**** Well in book 5 he's more interested in Cho. He was also going through an emotional period which distracted him from other girls. Prior to that, I think Ginny's crush on him turned him off. In HP2 Ron keeps joking that Ginny was going to form a Harry Potter club. This likely turned him off for a few years.

In book 6 he spends a good chunk of the summer (6 weeks?) at the Weasleys. On the train it is mentioned that Harry was so use to Ginny's presence that when she goes to sit with her friends, he forgot that she doesn't hang out with him. I think this is when he begun to like her.

  This does not account for build-up.
#+end_quote

Yes it does, and I believe what I said is practical. He doesn't need to have a crush on her from the start. I've developed crushes on people years after knowing them - it can happen to Harry. But hanging out with someone for 6 weeks straight, when both are at a proper dating age, can make one start developing feelings for the other. How is this not practical? And this is what likely accounts for the 'crazy chest monster'.

I don't have the 6th book to quote, but as I said, when he's on the train there's something about Harry feeling disappointed that Ginny leaves to hang out with her friends. He forgets that she doesn't hang out with him. This is one of the first instances that we see he has a crush, as a result of the summer season.

After developing this crush, attending Hogwarts is the first time Ginny is hanging out with other guys which creates a reason for his jealously (chest monsters).

But to explain the other years and why they are irrelevant to Harry:

Year One - he doesn't know Ginny and he's too young to have a crush

Year Two - Ron makes fun of her for fancying Harry and how she's going to making a 'Harry Potter' fan club. No way Harry is going to touch her. Also, he and she are still way too young.

Year Three - the first time we see Harry notice a girl. It's Cho and its when he plays a game against her. Ginny is 12, he's 13, and still too young for the two of them. But we can see that JKR does show that Harry has feelings for a girl.

Year Four and Five - Although at a proper age now, his attention is diverted to Cho. I believe he still thinks of Ginny as Ron's younger sister. Remember in books five and six, he's hearing Ron complain about Ginny dating other guys (Michael and Dean). Harry is not going to touch her because of this. And he doesn't hang out with her anyways. Cho is also unavailable and then too emotionally unstable for Harry to have more than a crush on her and develop any 'chest monsters'. When he does hang out with Ginny in book 5 (end of summer and Christmas), he's too emotional due to the death of Cedric and the visions to even think of Ginny in that way.

Year 6 - summer happens. Proper dating age. Hang out with someone non-stop for 6 weeks. He develops a crush.

Ginny not being in books 1-5 I believe is irrelevant. She hangs out with Harry for the first bit in book 6 (excluding the summer) just as much as she did previous years. But because Harry likes her he notices her when she's in the Great Hall or Common Room. Whereas she may only be mentioned in book 4 or present but Harry doesn't take notice.

Harry didn't open a closet door and found Cho and Cedric kissing there. I think that at this scene, he finally comes to the realization that he has feelings towards Ginny - his best friend's little sister - and at the same time, sees her making out with his roommate. It's basically an iron fist to the stomach. I don't know if "chest monster" are the best words to use here, but his reaction is understandable.

It seems as if fans have a "chest monster" of their own when it comes to this scene, because the (somewhat memetic) reaction to it is completely overblown. Perhaps it simply serves as a symbol to the awful romance subplot of HBP.

******** Yeah it sounds bit corny but I've read worse things.

I think Rowling missed her chance to develop their relationship in fifth book. Harry was being controlled by Voldy, and she was possessed by him in her 1st year - some kind of bonding material I would say. They spend some time together at Grimmauld place. She substitutes for him in Quidditch. They both kinda meet at DA meetings. She went with them to Ministry to "save" Sirius.

Although I do agree that Ginny and him could have bonded over the connection with Voldemort. But remember Ginny does bring this to his attention, I think during Christmas, when he's complaining that no one understands what he's going through. I believe this just shows that he's only thinking about himself.

Although it's not described this way in the book, some people develop crushes on only one person at a time and they just focus on that individual until it ends. With Cho in his focus, Harry doesn't really think of Ginny romantically. When Cho is out of the picture, it makes room for Ginny.

** Barring an insane amount of emotional upheaval, probably not.

After Ron left in DH, there's no indication that Hermione and Harry discussed it or were particularly good company to one another. Neither of them mentioned his name until the night of the Godric's Hallow incident, so it's highly unlikely that Hermione and Harry felt comfortable discussing their feelings.

Things were so awkward and silent in the tent without Ron that Hermione started bringing out Phineus Nigellus for company. This does not bode well for a romantic partnership between the pair.

I can imagine them together years later if they had had enough life-altering experiences to sort of bring them together. But I think it would always be a marriage of friends who loved each other and cared so much for another that they were willing to make a concerted effort to keep the peace. They wouldn't really be truly compatible.

The movies created a completely different portrayal of Hermione and her relationship with Harry than the book did, and if you talk about the movie rather than the book (even if unconsciously) then we are, basically, speaking about two different stories (and characters).

You can say that your love for Emma Watson isn't related to it, but that's what it looks like. You were talking about Movie!Hermione, who is played by Emma Watson, and her little OC dance with Harry, not Book!Hermione, who is decidedly not Emma Watson, and decidedly did not have a "moment" with Harry.

Fallacy? I wasn't trying to make an argument here. I'm simply saying that your love for Emma Watson explains why you think of Hermione in the terms of her movie portrayal. At least, for me.

  Harry's interest in Ginny just feels really squicky and trying to explain it away by saying Voldemort's horcrux was having its say rings hollow to me.
#+end_quote

Explaining something is not the same thing as explaining it /away/ (otherwise properly known as excusing it). Rowling might never confirm it, but there is a solid argument to be made that the piece of soul in Harry's head began to influence his emotions from the moment of Voldemort's return. He became angrier, in many ways colder, more destructive, his emotions shallower. Whether these emotions are his own or Voldemort's bleeding through their connection is a different argument altogether^{^{and}} ^{^{of}} ^{^{course}} ^{^{they}} ^{^{could}} ^{^{just}} ^{^{be}} ^{^{the}} ^{^{emotions}} ^{^{of}} ^{^{a}} ^{^{teen}} ^{^{with}} ^{^{PTSD}} ^{^{but}} ^{^{where's}} ^{^{the}} ^{^{tinfoil}} ^{^{in}} ^{^{that?}} , but the soul-piece /has/ been known to react or cause Harry to react to externalities. In fact, a plot point of OotP is Dumbledore avoiding Harry because of his soul piece, which Harry confirms to be at least partly valid - he felt as though there's a dormant snake rising inside him when he [made] eye contact with Dumbledore.

In addition, love/obsession is not the only post-Voldemort-return emotion to be described in that manner. The clearest example I can recall right now is a line in OotP (or was it HBP?) that talks of Harry's guilt as "some monstrous, weighty parasite" in his chest.

Where am I going with this? Honestly I can't remember...oh yeah, whether it's by Horcrux ^{^{or}} ^{^{by}} ^{^{PTSD}} Harry's emotional expression in the last three books is anything but healthy. And he needed to be expunged of said soul piece to recover. But that doesn't make the emotions themselves any less real; his guilt is no less real for its parasitic description, and (I think) so is what he feels for Ginny. I think all love is fucked up and selfish and people who subscribe to notions of pure altruistic emotion are deluding themselves, so maybe it's just me.

Also I call dibs on Miraculously Unguarded Vagina for my band name. Our fans will be called the Muvers. :P

  I agree with you, but I question why this is dependent on Voldemort's return to a corporeal form.
#+end_quote

It's not that he returned to a corporeal form; it's that he returned to /power/. In addition, Soul Bitty's connection and influence are largely due to Voldemort attempting to breach Harry's mind (and conversely Harry unconsciously tripping into /his/ mind), something he began to do in OotP.

#+begin_quote
  I just think it's a big leap to say that the horcrux is responsible for Harry's primal reaction to Ginny. TMR had never known love. I think he'd be more inclined to mock it or dismiss it entirely (such as Lily's loving sacrifice for her child) than react in a manner similar to the Chest Monster.
#+end_quote

And I too think it's a big leap for fans to extrapolate as much as they do on Voldemort's ability (or lack thereof) to know, recognize or experience love. The "never known love" statement is an obviously meta one, and clearly refers to the sort of clean /agape/ that drove Harry to walk to his own death to save even the lives of people he didn't know. People grab that and run away with it as though Voldemort would not recognize /eros/, or /philia/, or most especially /philautia/.

Like sure, Voldemort is supposed to be the consummate psychopath. But I have experience enough in that area to say that that is exactly how he would react to a love interest, sexual or otherwise. It's very likely exactly the way he felt for his closest followers, Nagini in particular. Psychopathy is not apathy.

#+begin_quote
  Couldn't agree more. I think the series would have worked much better as a series of loosely connected books that stayed firmly in the realm of children's literature. There was no need for Harry to wrestle with the 'weightier' themes of the second half of the series.
#+end_quote

So you would have preferred Voldemort to not return at all? Because you can't establish a character who is willing to murder infants in their cribs and reintroduce him to the story while keeping it light.

Also I'm not entirely why there are scare quotes around weightier, or why you think said themes were only present in the second half. The second book in the series involves mind rape and the slavery of an entire species ffs.

  I'm still not seeing a distinction. How could he have one without the other? Harry felt twinges in his scar all the way back in PS. Why wait so long to manifest unless it's just more convenient for the author's plot?
#+end_quote

Exactly. Actual-Voldemort was in Hogwarts, and in many ways returning to power; had consumed unicorn's blood, could use Quirrell's body, etc. His regaining a body is /symbolic/ of the fact that he is no longer merely less than the meanest ghost.

#+begin_quote
  Psychopathy is the ability to disable empathy at will. I think Voldemort felt that way about Nagini because it was a part of him, not because it was a follower. Ultimately, all of them proved to be expendable. Any feelings he had for his closest among them was almost certainly a mummer's farce designed to engender their loyalty to him. Psychopaths are often known to be quite charming, but ultimately and absolutely self-serving.
#+end_quote

And you think love and obsession cannot be self-serving emotions?

#+begin_quote
  So far all we have is your declaration that he would. I suppose we can just choose to see that differently.
#+end_quote

And seeing as I, you know, have ASPD and am not basing my knowledge of my psyche on news articles...never mind that I never said he would /actively seek them out/, just that the so-named Chest Monster is the way he would /hypothetically react/ to someone that interested him sexually (or even platonically).

Also said news article really doesn't support your argument, seeing as people on the spectrum have the capacity for empathy.

#+begin_quote
  True, but Arthur dismisses Ginny's time with TMR with a rather funny throwaway line about knowing where an object keeps its brain. Given how Ginny seems to recover completely, it seems we can assume that there were no lasting implications from her time with the diary. The only time when this is trotted out again is when JKR needed Harry and Ginny to share something in common besides their favourite sport.
#+end_quote

Maybe because the books aren't named "Ginny Weasley and the years I dealt with PTSD", are they? I find it strange that you can assume so when we don't even have as much as a single paragraph of Ginny's POV.

Also I don't think you should be letting your aversion to Harry and Ginny as a couple colour your logic so much.

Or, and this is a novel idea, she would be a useless writer if she failed to tie the blatant fact that someone else in Grimmauld Place had been possessed by Voldemort to the wider narrative. And readers would have been well within their rights to assume (with what little we knew) that Voldemort was possessing Harry as opposed to them reading each other's minds.

You were the one who brought up the Elves in the brothers Grimm's tale. But sure, when I actually work through the comparison it's "an appeal to emotion".

Grimms' elves are free spirits. The house-elves are not. They may be /based/ on Grimm, but they are quite clearly a cynical deconstruction of "helpful elves". But keep on with that wilful blindness ;)

  You tacked that on to the end to make it seem as though I was arguing that they loved helping and being in a state of enslavement when I did nothing of the kind.

If you weren't making everything so personal you'd realize I was contrasting Grimms' elves' joy at their freedom to the despair house-elves sink into when they are presented with clothes. Ergo, preferring to be in a state of enslavement. But that would require admitting that words can imply more than they state outright, so I won't hold my breath.

You know how Harry has a /saving people thing/ going on?

Also life-threatening situations are far from the best metric to judge a relationship by. You might as well say that Harry and Ginny were obviously meant to be together because he went and faced a basilisk for her. Well no shit, most normal well-adjusted people would try to save even a stranger that's in danger if it's in their power.

It's one thing to not enjoy every single thing you do together, it's another to be able to count on one hand the things you two enjoy together. Every time Ron is the odd one out they devolve into awkwardness (like someone else mentioned, to the extent that Hermione was pulling out Phineas bloody Nigellus' portrait for company in DH). Even when Ron and Hermione are outright /fighting/ they're nowhere near as awkward.

And? Nobody here said they were /acquaintances/. The assertion is that they don't /get along well [alone] together/, i.e. without the common buffer of Ron. Their relationship runs on various degrees of awkwardness - in fact, you just gave me the quintessential example (the Lavender situation). Just look at this:

#+begin_quote
  “Hermione?”

  He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this.

  “Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “I was just practicing.”

  “Yeah . . . they're --- er --- really good. ...” said Harry.

  *He had no idea what to say to her.* He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally highpitched voice, “Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations.”

  “Er . . . does he?” said Harry.

  “Don't pretend you didn't see him,” said Hermione. “He wasn't exactly hiding it, was --- ?”

  The door behind them burst open. To Harry's horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.

*** Ron and Hermione have no common ground except for Harry and being on the same side of the war. Their interests not only don't overlap, they actively dismiss/dislike the interests of the other. They are constantly either fighting or Ron is just being rude to her in the books. The only reason I saw for Hermione to tolerate all that while I was growing up (and reading the books as they came out) was because she was afraid to have no friends, so she tolerated Ron so she at least had Harry as a friend.

Calling Ron the glue is even more insane than pairing them up (which even Rowling admitted was a mistake). I'm not a harmony fan with canon Harry but they at least were friends. If the canon characters were actually to attempt a long-term relationship, either Ron would have broken Hermione's spirit completely or she would have killed him.

To diss Ginny as a fangirl and say that Hermione didn't fangirl over him initially is hypocrisy.

******* Harry's first romance was with Cho. Ginny's first romance was with Michael, then she dated Dean. It's not "too convenient". Take into account that wizarding society is much more closed, there is no university, and that people know each other much better because the population is lower.

********* Harry and Cho's relationship was teen romance. Their relationship and their interactions were very awkward, which is the very essence of teen dating. Ginny was not Harry's first girlfriend, and JKR even said that the very reason that it happened like that was precisely because it was too convenient to have Harry and Ginny get together at say, the Yule Ball.

JKR has also said that the population of Wizarding Britain is about 3,000. No, he wouldn't be against dating a muggle, but he was already with Ginny, so why would he do that?

***** All you're doing is MASSIVELY EXTRAPOLATING one sentence/phrase that people think is weird. Also, Ron, unlike Harry, actually makes Hermione laugh. To be honest, I don't think that anyone could be close to Hermione without occasionally arguing with her - she's just very passionate about what she cares about, and will ALWAYS stand up for herself. And if you think that Harry never gets mad at Hermione, please reread the end of OotP.

** If so, she would have written the entire seventh book differently and the final answer would be: sure, why not?

All it would take is a few different lines of dialogue, a different outcome after the dancing scene, some "oh-shit-we-barely-survived" hugging and kissing and there we go, the road to romance after the death of Ron is free.

But then the entire buildup for Ginny (as little as it was, anyway) would have been for nothing. The possibility is there, but /after/ book 4,5 and 6 I wouldn't be a fan of it, despite my opinion that H/Hr should have happened throughout the series (with the necessayr buildup, of course).

** I think so!

It would/might start out as comforting each other and later realizing that they work as a couple and are much more compatible than Ron/Hermione (a dimwitted procrastinating unwilling to learn/apply himself slob who doesn't accept other people's opinions (he's the one going after Hermione for SPEW after all, Harry is keeping out of it as much as he can) and culture (he's mispronouncing muggle inventions like telephone, despite his love-interest being a damned muggleborn!) is not a great fit (Hermione could do so much better, even if she doesn't get together with Harry -.-) and I love it that even Rowling sees that now, despite her liking Ron (she didn't kill him after all!)) and Harry and "Random!Fangirl" (Ginny)...I mean that meme "Even the movies aren't buying it" is very accurate IMHO!

I even think they'd make a great(er) couple because they complement each other:

Hermione has the drive to learn and excel (that Harry lacks IMHO), while Harry has the drive to do the right thing and ignore rules/laws when they are wrong and/or stupid! Then there's the fact that they are both outsiders in wizard-culture and that they grew up with muggle ideas and ideals (so having kids by 20 would probably be a no-go for both of them and so they'd have more freedom to pursue their passions because of not being tied down by a child (or several))

ps: Comment to a person on this topic "Harry/Ginny-Build-Up" - nope, not much in the way of a build-up IMHO (Chest-Monster anyone? -.-)

Agreed you could even say that Harry is a dimwitted procrastinating unwilling to learn/apply himself slob. It really explains why he and Ron are friends, they have so much in common. :-)
