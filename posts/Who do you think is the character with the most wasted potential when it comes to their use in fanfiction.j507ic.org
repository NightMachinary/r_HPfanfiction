** Lavender, hands down. She wasn't a complete nobody in canon like, say, Daphne. Yet people go out of their way to flesh out someone who might as well not exist but dumb down Lavender to the blonde bimbo of Harry's harem. Do something with her, please! If Dumbledore can be the evil manipulator, Riddle the misunderstood saviour of magic and "Ice Queen" Daphne -- who barely had any sentences written about her -- the only good Slytherin, then Lavender can also be /more/.

*** Lavender and Parvati are my answer. The story I'm writing currently has them and Hermione as proper friends and they help her when she most needs support. I'm having a great time writing for them, I can't wait until it's ready to share.

I'm writing Lavender as someone who quietly lets people think what they want about her, kind of using the fact every one underestimates her to her advantage. It's fun!

**** Writing Lavender /IS/ fun, innit? I have two (three is in planning) ongoing fics which feature her in various degrees. One, she is, with Harry, the MC and they are paired. Another, she is more like support cast but has way more personality and I want to include her more further down the road. Another, she will be the LI of a female Weasley OC (Ginny's fraternal twin sister who is a Soothsayer, the fic will be divination heavy). I always liked Lavender, despite JKR's destruction of her with the whole /WON-WON!/ debacle. And if it is me who has to do her justice, then so be it! üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÅ

****** Exactly! Liking makeup, clothes, and wanting a boyfriend doesn't detract from one's intelligence. And arguably, neither does studying Divination. Trelawney wasn't a very good Seer, but there's evidence that Divination is a legitimate branch of magic, so maybe Lavender has the Sight. Honestly, the attitude given towards Divination kind of reminds me of the attitude some people have towards the arts. I would also like to point out that Lavender could actually be a good match for Ron -- she adores him, does her best to build him up (Quidditch tryouts), and is honest about what she wants (straight up kisses Ron in the middle of a Gryffindor post-game party) vs. avoiding her feelings for years. (But I also like canon Romione. I just love all the Ron ships)

***** I'm reminded of a story, can't remember where I read it, that could provide a good answer to the whole won-won thing:

In this story, one side character was a rather dorky guy in his early/mid 20s who ended up getting together with a lady. The main character found her extremely annoying because she was always all over the guy, cutesy nicknames, PDA, etc...

She finally made the main character sit down and listen to her. Turns out dorky guy has never had any sort of romantic relationship before, and his ideas were all built around the terrible high school cliches, and when she didn't act like that he got insecure and started wondering why she didn't like him.

So, despite the fact that she disliked acting that way almost as much as those around her disliked seeing it, she did it anyway. That quirk aside, he brought enough to the relationship (and she had problems of her own) that she was willing to pay that price. She just hoped that as time went on he would get more secure in the relationship and she could stop acting like that.

A similar setup could make for an interesting characterization of Lavender

The more likely reason for his descent into insanity is a latent mental illness caused by generations of inbreeding that got triggered after he left Hogwarts. Whatever it was likely got transferred to his new body when he did the ritual at the end of GoF. This would explain the descent from mostly insane but also capable person he was in Book 4 to the raving lunatic he was at the end of 7.

******* Right. Well, unlike you, I look at the actions of the man, not the descriptions of him from other men. Insanity doesn't mean a person has to be stupid. A person can still be brilliant, just that his actions doesn't make much sense. Enter: Voldemort's obsession with Harry, bad plans at conquering, and just all around inefficient melodramic acting of him. Plans, bad plans I mind, going astray can also lead a person further into insanity. Like, for example, him not managing kill harry several times, him not managing to capture Harry in DH, the stresses of leading an organisation, insanity of dark arts. Oh, and as a direct influence of Horcruxes, living in isolation for 11 years as a shade, with no human interaction, having company of animals and such. Dumbledore can rave all wants about Voldemort, the fact is, Dumbledore isn't an expert on these matters, and he certainly hasn't been schooled in psychology. So Dumbledore can't reliably rate an enemy he doesn't understand.

** I can't really put the blame on fanfictions because, in my opinion, his character was also wasted in Canon, but Peter Pettigrew.

Outside of Voldemort, he is the main reason why Harry ended up as "The-Boy-Who-Lived", and with the Dursleys. James and Lily died because he betrayed them, Sirius went to Azkaban because he framed him for his crimes.\\
After faking his death, he managed to lived undetected with the Dursley for 10 years and, by a twist of fate, found himself right next to Harry. After Voldemort's return, I doubt any Death Eater could have brought even half as much information on Harry compared to Pettigrew. This is thanks to him Voldemort know about the Cloack, the Maraudeur map (though I don't think the bad guys ever mentioned it), or what happened during the 2 previous years.\\
Once discovered, he not only escaped, but found Voldemort spirit, brought him back to England, and played a major role into his resurection (Voldemort basically have his flesh).

And yet after GoF he just . . . disappears. He make some quick apparition in HBP and DH, being used as a housekeeper by Snape or ignored during a Death Eater meeting, but he doesn't do anything of value. The character went from being the most successfull Death Eater (a right hand man material), to a servant, barely better than a House Elf. Even his death, strangled by his own hand, feels a little . . . hollow and forced, even though it was foreshadowed since book 4.

So now, I understand that the character was a little hard to use. His loyalty to Voldemort was dubious at best, and with his survival known by the Order (not to mention his Animagus form), he couldn't really spy on them anymore. But I feel like he could have done so much more. From a certain point of view, him and Snape can be seen as both side of a same coin (both are traitor, spy, more interested by their own side and goal than the war, and they even got a similar death by Voldemort hand), so maybe he could have been the Death Eater doubting Snape loyalty, and who would try to prove it during the War.

And yet in Fanfics, he is often depicted as an incompetent buffon, a mere follower of the "True" Maraudeur, when he is not completely ignored. Canon already doesn't do him justice (in my opinion), and yet most fanfic are not even reaching that point. There are some, but they are few and far between.

Edit: The Gryffindor Charisma and Hardheadedness.

That's not an exaggeration either.

- Triwizard Tournament
- Snape's Occlumency lessons
- Leaving Draco Malfoy to ineptly try to kill him all year.
- Grindelwald

Yeah, things have to explode pretty spectacularly in order for him to change his mind. This is also the reason why I scoff at Time Travel fics where post-halloween of '81 they tell Dumbledore and he instantly hops over to their side.

But yeah, definitely! It's so interesting, that juxtaposition of action and inaction. Doubly so, given that he has three different examples of trusting in people leading to terrible outcomes - he trusted in Grindelwald and his sister died, he trusted in the Order and Peter spied, James and Lily 'trusted in Sirius' and they died too. Triply so, if you consider the cult of personality built up around him (possibly by him, possibly ascribed by others) and its similarity to how Grindelwald seems to be being portrayed in the films now (I haven't seen any of them, I'm inferring from comments I've seen in this sub).

If there's a single character in Harry Potter that I'd love to chat with in a therapeutic environment, it's Dumbledore. He's one fascinating old bastard.

** Out of the sort of fleshed out supporting characters, definitely Percy. I feel like there's so many stories where he's reduced to the "prat, rule abiding" older brother or the "traitor" who sided with the ministry over his family.

There's a few stories where fic authors try to frame his "betraying" his family because he's spying on the ministry on Dumbledore's orders, but I don't really like that approach but it handwaves a lot of stuff in Percy's character.

But his character has such great potential for so many interesting stories, such as:

- He most likely in hiding with his family during the first WW as he was too young to go to Hogwarts.
- He likely struggled with many of the same insecurities Ron did (being compared to his sibling, not fitting in, etc.), and probably got worse once Fred and George came to Hogwarts.
- He likely had very few friends in school, as the books don't even give any passing mention of him meeting other friends for non-prefect/HB activities.
- He likely had to grow up way too early, as it seems like his parents have essentially made him the "minder" of his younger siblings instead of allowing him to be a kid himself.
- He had legitimate reasons to blow up at his father in OOP.
- He's pretty much MIA in HBP and DH (which gives ff authors a lot of room to play while still making things canon compliant).

Since he's not really fleshed out because he's gone for so many stretches of the series, people just latch onto the more negative traits of his character since that's what JK Rowling highlighted.

**** Not his phase, but his grievances he yelled as his father when he got into the ‚Äúbig‚Äù argument.

Namely:

- Instead of congratulating his son for a promotion he worked his ass off for, Arthur immediately thinks that Fudge is trying to use Percy to spy on Harry or keep track of the Weasleys. Which is a silly thing to even consider (at the time) since Percy wasn't even that close to Harry, and it's not like Ron would share much to him anyway about Harry since it doesn't seem like they had a close relationship either.
- Adding onto this point, thinking Fudge wanted to spy on the Weasleys is silly too. Molly was a stay at home mom, Arthur had a low-paying, undesirable job, Bill worked for Gringotts (not ministry territory), Charlie was in Romania, and the rest of the Weasleys were in Hogwarts. Plus, there was nothing connecting them to the OOP. All Fudge knew was they were big Dumbledore supporters. But like that's super common knowledge to anyone in the wizarding world.
- Percy rightly calls out Arthur for putting his passion over pragmatism. The Weasleys are poor, but Arthur would rather stay at a low paying job he loves rather than actually do a job he might not like but would actually be able to comfortably support the family - especially since Molly wasn't bringing in any income due to being a stay at home mother.
- Arthur is silly to believe that his poor reputation at work wouldn't have an effect on how others viewed Percy once he tried to make his way up the corporate ladder. Arthur /isn't/ that ambitious when it comes to his job, but Percy knew that he needed to play office politics to get ahead - but was hindered by people assuming he was a mini-Arthur.
- From Percy's perspective, Dumbledore is not a great headmaster at keeping the students safe, especially given that all his siblings have been in danger or have been hurt since PS - which could be seen from an outsider perspective as Dumbledore's "incompetence". So with that in mind, it makes sense that he would support the ministry doing more to "rein him in" so to speak.
- He's pretty much only wrong on the Voldemort thing, but the reason why he chooses to side with the ministry is more of a JK Rowling weak writing issue rather than more organic reasoning.

** There are actually quite a lot of characters that could fit that description. But, for some unfathomable reason, the first characters that came to mind where Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.

They are both competent wizards in their own right, both were members of Dumbledors Army, both fought and survived the final battle.

But, similarly to Katie, Alicia and Angelina, they are mostly only side characters without any thought put into them. Often they are made out to act like Ron, like clones or something, but they are their own people and interesting enough characters to develop alongside any other main character.

They are pretty fleshed out in cannon, and there they aren't really overlooked. But in a flood of fanfics where Nevile and Ginny or Luna become Harrys new Ron and Hermione, Seamus and Dean usually are cast aside.

Probably still some of the characters that are used more often than some of the others, that were mentioned already.

*** The reason they are depicted as one-dimensional bad guys is because that's how they are written in Canon. JKR wanted them that way - the less you know about someone the easier it is to dehumanize them and make them unsympathetic. We only ever see Draco struggling with his family's choices, and we see Draco and Harry nodding at each other civilly on the platform in the epilogue, so we assume that his Redemption Arc happened off-camera.

Honestly JKR never meant for us to take a hard look at anyone in Slytherin house except for Draco, and he is the sneering bigoted face of his house.

** Fred and George -- they're TWO separate people and there's a lot more beneath the surface than just being the trickster twins (even though they do often present /themselves/ in that way).

For example, their family being poor and being two of seven children probably is part of what drives them to be entrepreneurs. Their first memories are probably about, or related to, the war (they were 3-4 years old in 1981). They probably feel a need to prove themselves, what with Molly always going on about OWLs and NEWTs (even though her reason for doing that is that she just wants them to do well in life).

They are also true to themselves and their beliefs, placing a high value on personal integrity. Part of that is being a Weasley. Another part is the aforementioned emphasis their mum places on school -- if all they wanted to do was have decent careers and please their parents/mum, then they could have done that, but instead they chose to make their own path.

** I read a fic a while ago about female Harry. The fic was so incredibly well-written and well-researched that I, at times, honestly thought it might be better than the original HP books. The plot was complex and detailed enough to be interesting, yet showed Harry's coming of age-story perfectly. Unfortunately, the series was never finished, but the author is working on either book four or five rn.\\
One of the great things about the fic is that it took lots of the background characters, esp. from Slytherin (Pucey is the only one I can remember currently), and introduced them into the fic, with the clear intention of using them properly in the story later. She also made up her own original characters that were straight-up amazing and I wish they were in the original story. This brings me to the last point:

Fanfic authors focus too much on Harry and the original characters. I don't know if I've just been terrible at researching, but I haven't found many fics with new and unknown characters. It's certainly underutilized, as far as I can see at least.

TLDR; fleshing out the original characters, esp. pureblood ones would be really cool, as they probably have lots of knowledge, traditions, and customs that we never fully saw in the HP series.

** Sooo many i'll narrow it down to 3

The Weasely twins They are fucking brilliant they actually invent new shit with magic thats such a rare skill so few outside of Voldemort Dumbledore the Marauders and Snape do that. Not even Hermione does. She applies things in new ways creatively but doesnt do anything new on the same level. The weasely twins even get strongly involved in the action its not that they ever just stuck to making funny things. They even create things for the ministry. But like you never see them get like the au where they are the super competent mcs the way you see with say Harry or Hermione. Or even super competent supporting like you may see with like Daphne. I'd say this is also true with Bill and Charlie but you know less about them.

Sirius I mean Sirius is in alot of shit but it most often is like What if he adopted Harry or like things turned out ok and he lived happily ever after with x love interest. Or he asshole . But like he was genuinely smart? And very competent? He helped make the marauders map he became an animagus in school. This is kinda true for all the Marauders. In any au they live they kinda just normal. You dont get as much or the super competent or skilled treatment. No like Lord Sirus AU but he's in the perfect position for that and its a set up for a really entertaining dynamic given his past and mind set. Or like using him to delve into the corrupt system that put him in prison without a trial. And all the stuff with character studies or exploring trauma type stuff Sirius is ideal for but I rarely see him used that way.

Hermione Ok I know this is a weird one but hear me out. Hermiome gets celebrated alot her intelligence highlighted and explored and thats great. But her flaws aren't explored that much. They kinda dismissed and its i think such a wasted potential for good story telling and making good arcs. Like as someone who also struggled to socialize with peers when I was younger seeing her struggle with that and then succeed would be very rewarding. And it would be both character and relationship growth. She'd try to express herself more try to be more sensitive. While others who started off being more frustrated by her began understanding her better and seeing her in a better light. But you often get more power fantasy Hermione so you miss out on this sort of arc which I think is a real shame.
