They banter/argue but are generally for each other.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes

No Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame/fortune no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.


** Did you read Loose Canon?

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.
