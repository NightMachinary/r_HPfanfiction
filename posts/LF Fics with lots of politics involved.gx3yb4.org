** Benefits of Old Laws linkao3(10691892). Completed, 870k words. AU after GOF. Basically, Voldemort resurrects as sane and decides that this time, he'll conquer magical Britain politically instead of violently - starting with the legal adoption of Harry Potter.

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

***** I don't think so, but maybe. Voldemort changes his legal name to Henry Potter-Slytherin, though Harry still thinks of himself and introduces himself as Harry Potter. Personality /loss/, I'd say no, but there's certainly character development over the equivalent length of nine novels.

** The Accidental Animagus trilogy (ish) has a lot of domestic politics in the first part, with a smattering of international, while the second (really short part comprised of vignettes from different countries) really delves into international politics and the ICW. It takes a bit to get into it (after first year mostly) but once it does, it has probably the best depiction of wizarding international relations I've seen, and really fleshes out the wizarding /world/.

** Also adding linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom). A lot of it is politics, since Harry has been recruited by Voldemort to basically be his political PR person in an AU where Voldemort won the first war.

It ramps up the domestic politics in later years with the fleshing out of the werewolf colonies, and then gets into international relations even later on. Really fun depiction of how the French wizarding government looks in particular.

Warning, abandoned in the worst way, but it doesn't happen til 7th year, so there's still so much to love.

** Well, Fate by TheTrueSpartan is really good at it. When Ron sets up a buisness, we actually see the pain and hardwork of him going around, find a building, hiring and intervieing people etc. We also see him stressing REALLY badly over several problems, overcoming them, and much more.

And the buisness he sets up doesn't end up on the backburner. He uses it to solve problems, and is about to use it for the war effort and for combating misinformation and ignorance.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged.
