Is there any fic where Edward Elric from FMA/FMAB attends Hogwarts as a student? Most of the ones I searched and found where he goes to Hogwarts have him as a bodyguard (to Harry) or as an alchemy teacher.

What I'm looking for is something a little different. Ed attends Hogwarts, but as a student and learns magic and stuff.

Most preferable would be that Ed is in Harry's year, but it can be any, really. I just want them to know each other as students at Hogwarts and study together, with Edward learning/figuring out how to use magic understanding that 'equivalent exchange' doesn't really hold in the case of magic.

Edit: fixed some language to better convey what I'm trying to say

Edit 2: thanks for responding guys

*** Not all plants are completely edible. However, you can actually consume the entire sunflower in one form or another. Right from the root to the petals.
