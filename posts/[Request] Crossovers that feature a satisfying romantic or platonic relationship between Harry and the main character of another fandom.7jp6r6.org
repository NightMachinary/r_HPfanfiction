The title is pretty self-evident, and anything meeting that general description is acceptable. That said, I would prefer fandoms in which Harry's companion is clearly the main character of their fandom, e.g., Commander Shepard and not Liara from Mass Effect.

1. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Slayer Dimension by Apocalypse Thou) - Harry is transported to the BTVS dimension and befriends Buffy.

2. linkffn(The Observer Effect by The Observer Effect by d1x1lady) - Fem!Harry is transported to the Avenger's dimension and stalks Tony Stark

3. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Queen by Steelbadger) - Harry goes to Yamatai in search of lost treasures and relaxation and runs into young Lara Croft.

4. linkffn(It's All Relative on the Hellmouth by dellacouer) - Harry goes to Sunnydale to meet his long lost uncle Rupert and forms a relationship with Buffy.

5. linkffn(Blackdog by Atlantis Sinatra) - Another Fem!Harry/Tony Stark crossover in which a jaded and retired Harry runs a coffee ship in NYC and receives frequent visits from Tony Stark

There are a bunch of others where Harry meets the whole gang of characters from the Avengers (Wand and Shield) or in Middle Earth (Shadow of Angmar), etc., but I'm really interested in a one-on-one relationship between the big hitters.

** Linkffn(The Girl Who Loved)

Harry Potter / Sailor Moon / Ranma 1/2 / (Minor Others)- you don't need to know much about the latter fandoms (I didn't) to enjoy. There's a sequel, but that's only decent.

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees. He reacts with an 8 timezone apparition to the Pools of Sorrow in China. Multicross of HP, SM and Ranma 1/2. Harry/Usagi SailorMoon

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.
