If you've enjoyed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/k1rqjd/dumbledore_stated_at_harry_shocked_sputtered_for/gdquvok/][my]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/l0cjlr/prompt_fluffy_isnt_a_cerberus_he_is_the_cerberus/gjsxzr5/][responses]] to recent prompts on this subreddit, you'll likely also get a kick out of this short fic I wrote in response to an idea in chapter 16 of linkao3(Apple Pie and Other Amends). Highly recommend reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28903734][my oneshot]] before checking out that chapter of APaOA though, I think the reveal is more fun if you're surprised by it (and I'm curious if I foreshadowed it too much). Feedback would be very much appreciated - writing more has made me both hyper-critical and overly-confident in my work, so it'd be good to get others thoughts on where it needs to improve.

  It's not until she's brought a basil and strawberry sponge cake to Neville Longbottom and his new girlfriend, Hannah Abbott, a dozen rhubarb hand-pies to Luna and Xenophilius Lovegood, and another basket of ganache-covered muffins to Dean and Seamus, that Hermione admits to herself what she's actually doing: she's making a thing of this. It's a veritable PTSD tour. With pastries. And hand-skimmed clotted cream. And she has no idea why she's doing it, but it's becoming very apparent that she is.    Sometimes you're sad. Sometimes you need dessert. And sometimes, it's a little of both.
