*** Seconded. I went into it expecting a humorous romp, and it turned out to be well-fleshed out and had to have come from a place of good world-building and knowledge of the source material.

*** Further, all of the alternate spellings are explicitly intentional and the story contains hints that there's some kind of greater meaning behind them (and no, it doesn't seem to be an attempt at humor). And despite the /surface-level/ absurdity, at the /deeper level/ the story displays a lot of really intelligent and and logically sound worldbuilding.

** Linkffn(Antithesis) sounds like bland mediocrity. It's also the fic which compelled the most emotional response I've had reading most anything. Highly recommend, very tragic and great fic.

Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw) has a bland enough summary that I remember scrolling past it 10 times. However, the world building is pretty solid. I like it, though it isn't the best fic I've read.
