I've read a couple of fics where harry is adopted that are really good, but I want to read more if they are out there.

Harry could be adopted by the Malfoys, Lestranges, Grangers, Bones', other magical family (preferably not the Weasleys, Sirius Black, or Remus Lupin), random non-magical family.

I would prefer that Harry is adopted/taken in either when he is a child or in his first two years of Hogwarts, but it's okay if he is older.

Not too picky on the rest as long as it is well written


** Harry is adopted/discovered by squib relatives of the Black family in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/1/Growing-Up-Black][*Growing Up Black*]] linkffn(6518287) which is unfortunately unfinished. But it's a fun ride up and till that point.

Then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][*Hail Odysseus*]] linkffn(10645463) in which he's raised by Grindelwald. It goes about as cockeyed as you'd expect. Highly encourage a reading of this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12058516/1/The-Reclamation-of-Black-Magic][*The Reclamation of Black Magic*]] linkffn(12058516) is not for everyone, but those that enjoy it /really/ enjoy it. Basic summary: Dorea Potter (as James' mother before JKR jossed this) survives to take Harry from the Durseleys. Things change from there. Massively.

Then there's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786][*no place like home*]] linkao3(4308786) in which Harry is raised by Hogwarts after Petunia rejects him. It's a beautiful story, and I really can't do it any justice other than to say that Hogwarts bleeds back onto Harry in a way that being part of a magical school only can.

Finally, [[https://media.tenor.co/images/d0d548db13df7bb5856aeaca5cf48ef6/raw][like any good pimp]], I have my own story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12334664/1/The-Rezidentura][*The Rezidentura*]] linkffn(12334664) in which Harry is raised by Natasha Romanoff - the Black Widow. How does both the Marvel and Harry Potter universe change by them being present in each other?

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

** Well, there's "When in Doubt, Obliviate!" which has Harry being adopted by Lockhart, of all people. It's written by the same author who wrote /Oh God, Not Again!/ which is arguably the funniest of the Peggy Sue fics.

Mostly, it's the generic OP!Harry tropes, but even then there's some justification. Harry has a habit of breaking down every single magical person he meets in terms of how useful they are to him, but does so in a way that is very Mad-eye-ish.

***** I read it a long time ago, so the details are fuzzy. But I remember it was badly written in that Harry shared almost no character traits with cannon Harry. His different upbringing could not account for /that/ much change.\\
Most of details of the book, as I recall, were about Harry's romance with Hermione, in addition to every gift Harry bought for everyone's birthdays, and a lot of weird details about fancy meals, outfits, and dates.

But the creepiest part is that the author took the ship to full on sex, yet the characters were still only, like 12 years old. I imangined an adult writing about these two children having sex (while their parents celebrated) and it really creeped me out. I always have secretly prayed that it was written by a minor, because that would make the whole thing a little less creepy.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
