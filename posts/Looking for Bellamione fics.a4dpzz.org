That's right. I'm looking for the best fics centered around Bellamione, AKA The Healthiest And Most Wholesome Ship That Ever Sailed.


** Linkffn(Time Heals all Wounds by brightsilverkitty) and its sequel linkffn(a good elf by brightsilverkitty) are excellent fics as far as I remember. The premise is that Hermione is send back in time in her 6th year and lands in Bella‘s hogwarts years. It handles this very well.

I suppose I should also mention linkffn(Our Mercurial Selves by brightsilverkitty), which is by the same author, but I find it handles the relationship and how it became to be far worse. Additionally, it is more tropey.

There‘s linkffn(Murder Most Horrid by Useful Oxymoron) as well. In this AU where Voldemort never happend Bellatrix Black is the stereotypical, middle-aged, grumpy Detective/Auror that has to investigate a homocide at Hogwarts. Don‘t be intimidated by the high word count, only the first quarter or so is actually about the case. After that, a lot of fluff happens until the plot starts up again, which wasn‘t as great as the first part for me. I dropped it there. But the beginning of the story was very entertainig until the reveal, which wasn‘t perfectly handled in my opinion. I‘d say, give it a read.

All other Bellamione stories I ever stumbled upon were either not very memorable or went into the very uncomfortable corner of stockholm syndrome, but maybe someone else mentions some stories I have yet not seen.

  Are Murderers born? Or are they made? When Hermione is sent to the past she is forced to become acquainted with someone she knew she'd hate for the rest of her life. Rated M for later chapters.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
