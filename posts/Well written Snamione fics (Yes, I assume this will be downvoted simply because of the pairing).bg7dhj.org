  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

#+begin_quote
  The last thing Severus remembers is overhearing a prophecy in a dingy, goat-scented pub. Now there's a James Potter clone with Lily's eyes, a much aged McGonagall, and an infuriatingly familiar woman with wild hair all saying he is not a loyal Death Eater. Looking in a mirror proves that he is, indeed, suddenly pushing fifty. All in all, not his best day.

** I like linkffn(Lay Me Low) it's a teeny bit hand wavy on the ages (starts out at Christmas 5th year but Hermione is 17/18 because of the time turner) but the writing and plot are both great

I also like linkffn(Pet Project) that one starts in the spring of 6th year but takes awhile before the romance gets started/she's overage by the time it does

For pretty straightforeard smut I'd say linkao3(Teaching Miss Granger) she's of age in the fic but I can't remember if it's an 8th year fic or just an AU 7th year just make sure to read the chapter warnings, the story is quite explicit.

  What begins as Severus' anger at Sirius Black's attempts to seduce Hermione leads to a life he never thought he deserved to live. The past and the present mesh together in a story of protection, betrayal and trust, and how the Battle of Hogwarts might have been fought. Rated MA for tender sensibilities.

** linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao)? It is primarily fem!Harry, but Snape & Hermione pair are very relevant second pair of the story. Slightly too much sex for my taste (and even talk not much shown in action) of BDSM, but there is actual story there which is worthy of reading. Still feels like a bit of missed opportunity, it could be better if the author kept more towards feminist/anti-patriarchy side and less to the porn part (magic-gene-makes-everybody-sex-obsessed is the most stupid trope I know about, or close to it, time travels are more stupid).
