My update rate has been a tad inconsistent recently due to a chaotic home life and a terrible habit of writing and uploading one chapter at a time. I know the proper thing to do is to write it all and upload bit by bit when bit finished, but tbh I am trash and need reviews as constant validation to keep me going.

I have noticed that if I go on a writing roll and write several chapters at once, I won't get any reviews if I upload them too soon - as in, the next day or two/three days after. I don't know if this is a common thing, my readers, or me seeing patterns where there are none. I have a chapter ready to upload and I really want to submit it but I'm holding off for maximum impact. Not sure how long I can hold out though.

What's your update schedule, And have you ever messed with it to see if there are any changes in engagement?

Edit: I'm uncontrollable and I published anyway


** I upload as I write - reviews are what motivate me to keep writing past that first week of a new plot idea. I also use feedback to address any weakness in my own work.

I have 400 bookmarks on ffn, and almost that on AO3, but I'm lucky if one of them updates on any one day. As long as you keep updating, even if it's once a month or less, don't worry about it. The worst thing you can do to your readers is abandon a story and putting pressure on yourself to update more often is likely to make you want to abandon a story.

** I just love consistancy.. back in the day RobSt uploaded every weekend, like clockwork.. that is so damn nice to have..

Consistancy is king.. i think i'd even prefer a chapter every 2 months, to 3 in the space of a week and then 8 months of silence..

** I have two updates schedules. My "main" series has a weekly update schedule - I post each Saturday. However, smaller "side stories" I tend to complete, then post in daily updates. I do think it reduces the number of views a little, but on the other hand, it increases exposure for a week since it'll be posted more often.

** I've often noticed that you'll get reviews for the last chapter only when you post multiple chapters at the same time or within a few days. Most readers don't come back to your story every day, some read on weekends only. They're reading the new chapters all at once and write one review for the last chapter if they leave a review at all. I think waiting a week between the chapters is a reasonable solution if you want to get more reviews.

** Until recently I updated every three days. I've never changed it to see what it would do to reviewers, but a couple of weeks back I changed to Monday/Friday postings. Mostly because I'm rewriting one of the later chapters and I want to give myself more time before its posting date (I complete a fic before I begin posting; entire chapter rewrites like this are extremely rare), but I think that set days is probably actually better than every three days.

(Also didn't someone once post a thing about how the best time for getting reviews is a Monday?)

** I used to post on weekday nights immediately after I finished my chapters and would get... no reviews. So I try not to do that anymore. The furthest I can hold off, though, is usually just posting the next morning. For timezone context, I'm in American Central Standard Time.

I can't help but post the chapters as soon as I'm done with them, because the experience of writing/reading together is one of the weird/lovely things about fanfiction that I love: "I worked my ass off and I'm finally done with this chapter!! I love how certain aspects turned out, but maybe other parts could be better. What are your thoughts?"

But if I'm just getting crickets, that thing about fanfiction then turns into a de-motivation factor, rather than a motivating factor. In my short time in Discord so far, I have found the Discord to be a better motivator than waiting on reviews that may or may not come. So it's possible that the Discord may replace my reliance on reviewers for motivation.

I've heard that posting Saturday evenings yields the most views and feedback, and that lines up with what I've experienced, so I try to aim for that. But the reality is that I want to post my chapters when I finish them, so maybe I'll wait a couple of days if I'm close to Saturday but other than that I just like to post the next morning.

** In my experience timing makes a difference for number of followers\favourites\reviews. One of my stories I've posted to both Ao3 and ffn over different time periods. In a 6 month time period Ao3 has 392 subscriptions, 279 bookmarks and 180 reviews. Over 44 months ffn has 1362 followers, 1081 favourites and 516 reviews. Of course, there are other variables as ffn is more popular etc, but for 32 chapters it works out at 5.6 reviews per an average upload frequency of 5 chapters per month for Ao3 and 16 reviews per an average upload frequency of less than 1 chapter per month for ffn.

** Personally, I haven't updated in about 4 months. The chapter is written, but my editor hasn't gone through it yet. We find it hard because we both work very antisocial hours and live literally on opposite sides of the world. I'm thinking of simplifying the editing process, but usually we'd just go over until we're both happy with it.

** Some projects I write ahead and post on a schedule. Others I update whenever; sometimes within days, sometimes not for months. I don't have the patience to finish a story before even starting to post; I can't imagine working on such a delay. I like active feedback as I go along. In general, I post as I write, give or take a handful of chapters that may be written in advance, but it varies from project to project.

I have one story that updates on a set day each month, where I usually have more pre-written for. I have one that I only ever update as I write. I have two where I set arbitrary update dates for and try to write to that deadline, though the exact deadlines change month to month depending on my whim. And I have one where I spend several months writing a series of three or four chapters, then post them in rapid succession, which is definitely the longest delay I can manage.

Usually when I start something new, I post it right away even if I haven't decide what to do with it yet. Sometimes it stays as a oneshot, other times I turn it into a longer story.

I don't get enough reviews in general to really analyze, but I know that responses to a new chapter (fav/follow) generally trickle off within two-three days. I'd assume that one could update twice a week to keep a story consistently in recently-posted, but I can't write that fast. :P

** It took me 12 and a bit years to complete a fanfic. Updates were months and even years apart. I only wrote when I had the urge to, otherwise it was a chore. I just wanted to enjoy it.
