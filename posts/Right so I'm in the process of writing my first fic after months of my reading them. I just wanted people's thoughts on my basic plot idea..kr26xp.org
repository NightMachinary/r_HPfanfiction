** Just...why?

Why does Harry need to be the heir of Gryffindor and Slytherin? Why does he need the castle to listen to him? Why is he the most important client of Gringotts? Why was he adopted by Sirius? Why are Weasleys being bashed? Why does Harry have all these powers? Why does he meet the founders and Merlin? And so on.

If the answer to any of those questions is something like "I want Harry to be powerful" or "I thought it sounded cool," delete it. Any special powers, abilities, titles, tools, and so on that you give Harry need to actually drive the plot somehow. And giving him an easy way to solve problems doesn't count.

Now, it would be great if you cut Harry's OPness to just one or two new powers and based the plot around them, but we all know that's not likely. So the next important thing, especially if you don't take that advice, is to not dump everything on Harry all at once. Getting every new power at once is boring, but working for and really earning new abilities is exciting. That's why, for example, almost every video game starts the player with almost nothing and lets them unlock new abilities, weapons, characters, and so on as the game progresses.

And you've got another great example of that sitting in front of you, waiting to be used:

#+begin_quote
  Heir to Merlin...Has Merlins Staff which is actually capable of becoming a wand. Becomes the Master of Death by claiming all Hallows as well...[Merlin] divided the staff in two parts and gives one to the Peverells for safekeeping and leaves one in Gringotts, with the Goblins.
#+end_quote

That should not be the start to your story, that should be a major story arc, if not the main plot of the entire story. Have Merlin tell Harry that he has the potential to become his heir and become the most powerful wizard ever, but first he needs to reclaim Merlin's staff, which was split into two pieces which were given to the goblins and the Peverells. So he goes to the goblins, who are willing to give him their piece of the staff, but only if he does something for them first. Harry also does his research on the Peverells and eventually learns about the Hallows and realizes he has to collect them all to get/use their piece of the staff.

That gives you about four questlines to start with, each of which could easily split into several more subquests if you want them to. And each of those quests should take plenty of time (both in-universe and in number of words/chapters) to complete and should require Harry to use some of the powers, tools, and/or allies that you want to give him in order for him to succeed, but should not be trivialized by those powers, tools, and/or allies. And ideally, most of those powers, tools, and allies should not be dumped on him at the beginning either. Harry should either naturally acquire them over the course of the story, or he should realize that he needs them to complete whatever task he is working on and actively seek them out.

*** The staff thing is the overarching plot like the Deathly Hallows were in canon. I will consider your ideas further. Mine was to be similar anyways.

He would have to find all this to defeat Voldemort

Basically I'm envisioning shape-shifting to be as follows

Has to work for each animal form and bigger the animal, more magic drain, if magi animal then power drain at rapid rates and will be limited so nothing like a phoenix animagus form will be there, at least not the immortal factor or rebirth cycle like that of a true phoenix

I will be cutting the metamorphmagus powers

Heir to merlin was to be as you described, but more like, he has power and direct descendancy but has to prove himself worthy.

It won't be instant either he will have to train to utilise the power

I was writing this as a base to start off of although my ideas are similar to your suggestions

I will address other points

As for the bashing. I wanted to see if I could write a fic with bashing.

All advantages, artefacts and powers will be acquired over time as you said

**** Okay, that's fine then. Your original post made it sound like this was going to be another "Harry shows up at Gringotts, does an inheritance test, and discovers he's the heir to everyone important and has a ton of money and powers that will never come up again" story. And the world really doesn't need any more of those.

***** No no

However if that does happen the fic will be more than likely a one shot cause there is no point in then dragging out the whole thing for 50to 60000 words or more. I myself would not read it.

*** Harry gets power gradually i. e. has to earn it slowly by training.

Sirius would die so harry has personal motivation. His parents he does not remember

He didn't really know Cedric

Ergo, only person that important to him at that point in time would be either Sirius or Remus to an extent.

**** I feel like having one of the most powerful wizards set on killing you personally is a great personal motivation on its own?

(And Harry isn't the type to not care for someone's death only because he didn't really know them, especially Cedric 1/ because he saw him die in front of him. 2/ he died because he decided to share the trophy with him (in a way) and he still feels the guilt for year(s). 3/ Harry is the type of person who, when shown Voldemort's childhood feels for him even though he's his parents murderer and the man trying to kill him year after year.)

So, no. No death is “needed” to motivate him. Harry literally cares too much, in canon. Though, fair enough if you just want to kill Sirius.

** I realize that everyone's first fic is pretty trash, but... you can seriously do better than this.

My first observation is that your fic has zero conflict, zero motivation. Harry gets literally everything handed to him on a platter.

#+begin_quote
  Metamorphmagus. Natural at Mind Magicks. =Occlumency. =Legillimancy. =Completely IMMUNE to all Compulsions,    Obliviation and the Imperius Curse if he CHOOSES to be.
#+end_quote

He doesn't have to work for everything, he's already a 'natural' after all. Also, the only reason I can come up with for Sirius' death is that he's getting killed off so the otherwise nonexistent plot actually moves forward.

And even his items:

#+begin_quote
  Has Merlins Staff ... Gifted to him on his Majority.
#+end_quote

He doesn't earn it, he doesn't construct it himself after decades of practice like Ollivander makes his wands, no, it's gifted to him by some pesky anthropomorphic entities. Should I force Harry to struggle against stronger opponents with nothing but his wits? Nah, I'll just give him a magical nuke. I'm giving a lot of leeway because this is your first fic, but this is just /lazy/.

#+begin_quote
  This destroys horcrux in him.
#+end_quote

I don't really see how the horcrux possessing Harry destroys the very same horcrux. Also, why is he getting possessed if he's a natural in literally every kind of mind magic to ever exist?

#+begin_quote
  becomes blood adopted by Sirius.
#+end_quote

What is 'blood-adoption' that makes it different from normal adoption? Especially if Sirius is dead and can't do anything.

#+begin_quote
  Finds out he's been played.
#+end_quote

By whom? Was it by Molly, giving Ginny love potions to dose him with so they can steal his inheritance?

#+begin_quote
  Peverells created deathly hallows based on the magic of the piece of the staff given to them.
#+end_quote

Literally the only concept I like in your fic.

In essence I agree with you but that was already in place in my head as of now. These points are to remind me what to write, basic ideas, that is.

** Why so many tropes? this has been done by many others .. I say pick one inheritance, preferably not widely known to throw a curve ball to your readers and may be tack on some debts instead of just full on treasure and pick one or two powers and have him explore ... so many powers .. your readers will just ignore them and they will not be interested.

While he gets his family vaults which don't have a shit tonne of money. Its more like 5 richest, that too because no one spent it in a long time and it's just gaining interest for a while. And hiss grandfather invented the sleakeazy potion so would make some serious money obviously.
