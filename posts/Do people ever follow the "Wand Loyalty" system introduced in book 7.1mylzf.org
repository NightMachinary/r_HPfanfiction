I feel like I very rarely see fanfics mention or integrate the convoluted concept of "Wand Loyalty" that was introduced in Deathly Hallows.

I'm not necessarily complaining, because I always thought that it was one of the weakest plot points of the series, but I'm curious- is it just a generally ignored piece of canon? Are there fics that use it well? Fics that make fun of it well?


** I think the lack of it is probably due to it being both too vague a concept but also too far in solidified in canon (as the clicher piece at hps end). So in the end its just simpler to ignore it and do your own rules.

*** Yeah its like, on the one hand, its essentially one of the main plot twists of book seven. On the other hand, it makes little sense.

** I think I'll actually change some things around and use it in my own fanfic story. Having wands be slightly more "aware" seems really cool and I'll try to make it more so.

Shame it was only a tacked-on book seven thing in canon and didn't really do anything more than set up a single (still confusing) deus ex machina.

** It's a fairly key bit of canon to a long novel that I finished about a year ago. I've posted links to it here before. If you don't feel like hunting it down, reply to this comment and I'll reply with the link.

*** Sure, I'll take a look. By "finished" do you mean you read, or wrote it?

**** Oh, and as to your original question, my impression from DH is that any wand can change its loyalty if it's forcibly taken from its master by another witch or wizard. The Elder Wand happens to be particularly fickle about its loyalties because of the purpose intended by its creator, i.e. to spread death.

** wand loyalty as in a wand will work for only one person (and not at all for anyone else), or as in its weaker for the person who it didn't choose? Or are you talking about a wand being won, like the elder wand? I've seen all of these in fics i read. if i remember i'll link them

*** They're both part of the same concept that was introduced in Book 7. It's a combination of the two points you said- everyone has their own wand. If you're beat someone in a duel, you can use their wand as well as if it was your own. If you just steal someone's wand, then the wand doesn't "recognize" you as its master, and it won't work to its full potential.

That's why Voldemort was stomping around Europe for the first half of book 7- he was trying to figure out why the Elder Wand wasn't working well for him.

**** This concept also explains Neville's poor performance at magic in the first five books. He is using his father's wand, which has not given him its allegiance. After it breaks during the fight at the ministry, he is given his own wand, and (though Harry spends little time with him in class) he is quite a bit better at magic from then on. You could argue that his low self-esteem in the first five books keeps him from being good at spell-work, but I'd like to think his new wand is also better for him because of the wand's loyalty to him.

** I was under the impression Wand Loyalty applied only to the Elder Wand. Regular wands choose their masters, and stick with them. Even if Harry were to defeat idk Ron in a duel, Ron's wand wouldn't suddenly work best for Harry. The Elder Wand, however, was created by an angry Death who wanted Antioch to die. So, the Elder Wand had no built in loyalty, making it a highly coveted wand that could work for anyone (as long as they kill/disarm/beat) the previous owner.

*** Nope, applies to all wands. It comes up a bunch of times during Deathly Hallows- my memory's a bit fuzzy, but after escaping Malfoy Manor they have some wands they stole, and some work better than other specifically due to wand loyalty.

There are other instances, too.

**** But none of them work perfectly, and I thought that was due to the composition of the wand. like, Harry would cast better spells with a phoenix feather wand than with a unicorn tail wand. So they just went through the wands they had to see which one worked best.

***** That's different. That's finding your own personal wand- pretty much an entirely separate concept from Book 7's "wand loyalty."

*** My head-canon is that "loyalty" or something like it is a characteristic of wands, relating to, say, the wood or the core. We know that elder wands in general, not just /the/ Elder Wand, have a really bad reputation, so my thought is that they are really fickle, with their ownership passing on extremely easily. To make up for that, they're also really powerful, and the most powerful of them all is also the most fickle.
