Saw it in a tumblr textpost, am curious to see if it exists. Any pairings! (tomxharry and drarry preferred). [[http://i.imgur.com/I0T2zsE.png][what got my interest]]


** I've never heard of any fic like that. It sounds really interesting though! I'd read that. Well, now that I think about it some more, I think it would end up being a sad ending and I don't handle sad endings very well. So maybe I wouldn't read it. :/

Also it reminds me of the movie Timer.

*** I love tragic endings. Bawling over fanfiction is a great feeling.

**** haha, I'm the total opposite. I have to have happy endings and they better be happy tears I'm shedding. I now steer clear of major character death fics until they're complete so I can jump to the end to find out if my ship is still alive. A long time ago, they didn't use to warn for character death and some fics seriously broke my heart. Not sure I would've read them had I known. Beautiful World and If You Are Prepared, I'm looking at you...

  The last words your soulmate says to you are written on your skin, and you won't know who they are until they die. The thing is, Steve and Tony die /a lot/.
