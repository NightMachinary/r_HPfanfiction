(This prompt is a different version of my fanfiction in my notes but I think it sounds great as well.)

Since the very beginning, Lily has always felt as if she was watching the world through an one sided mirror.

She watched her sister's jealousy bloom into hatred.

She watched herself studying at Hogwarts and being a nice girl.

She watched her best friend lose his temper and change beyond recognition.

She watched herself fall in love and have a child.

And at the very end, she watched herself standing between the said child and a killing curse.

After that, she watched her own body getting buried into the ground. But somehow, she knew that if she decided to move and destroy the ground above her, she would be able to live again.

The freedom she have wished to acquire her whole life would be hers at last.

But it would made her lose everything that made her a human being. And it didn't matter to her at all.


** I am listening to the HP soundtrack and just as I read this Lily's theme played. Great timing. Gave me goosebumps.

I would like to read a story like that. Seems interesting.
