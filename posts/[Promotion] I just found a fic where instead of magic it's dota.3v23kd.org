It's majestic. [[http://esportsexpress.com/2015/07/harry-potter-dota-the-head-of-house/][Here's a link to the most recent part.]] There should be links to the others near the start.


** As a dota player, this is absolutely hilarious. However, if you don't watch dota esports and know the players/personalities, there is no point in even giving it a shot.

*** It's a video game. Here's a [[https://purgegamers.true.io/g/dota-2-guide/][link to a guide]] that will give you the basics of how the game works as well as some of the more advanced concepts of it. It won't really help with some of the jargon the community uses though.

[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/][Here]] is a link to the game's Steam page if you ever want to consider downloading it.
