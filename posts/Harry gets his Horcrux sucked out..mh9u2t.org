It was cold, too cold. Harry realized too late what that meant. He spun around to face the lake, his back facing Sirius. Dementors, hundreds of them were gliding across unnaturally towards him. He scrambled to pick up his wand from besides Sirius where he dropped it. Once in his hand his wand hummed with anticipation with being used. Harry tried to recall the happiest memory he could but for the life of him he just couldn't. Pettigrew, his parent's traitor had gotten away, his friends might be dead, Sirius and him were about to die, and Professor Lupin had just transformed into a werewolf. He felt more hopeless than he ever had before. “Expecto Patronum!” He yelled over and over again but it did nothing, not even a mist. He dropped to his knees as the dementors got less than a couple meters away. They grabbed his chin, pulling him closer and closer until their slimy, scabby, dead lips brushed against his forehead, and he knew no more.


** That happens in The Merging, except it's during the summer before fifth year when they show up in Little Winging. linkffn(9720211)

  When the dementor attack presents Harry with an opportunity to begin to fight back he gladly sets himself on the path to have a hand in his future. But as time goes on, it's clear that not all is the same as it once was. Why has his scar stopped hurting? What are these seemingly random objects he's drawn to? How deep does the connection between him and Voldemort truly run? Post GoF
