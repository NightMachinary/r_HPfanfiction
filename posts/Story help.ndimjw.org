Looking for the story that had the manipulative Dumbledore replaced by one from an alternate universe who was horrified by what his counterpart had done and did his best to fix it... I can't find it or remember the title to save my life.


** There's "Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure".

#+begin_quote
  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
