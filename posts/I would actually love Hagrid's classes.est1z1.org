I was reading a fic and it eventually mentions how Hagrid is in the wrong for showing dangerous/outlandish animals to students instead of normal (magical) ones. This isn't the only fic where I see this, not by far. Even fics with no trace of bashing eventually point it out how wrong he is to show the animals he does and that he is irresponsible. It's such a common thing to see.

I would actually /love/ that and make me automatically take his class! Give me the worst you got! Basilisks, Nundus, Hydras, Manticores, you name it, I wanna meet it! Wanna cast a Dissilusionment charm on the class and have us illegally jump the fence into a Dragon reserve just so we can observe them beauties? HELL FUCKING YEAH! Let's go into the forest to pet the Acromantulas too! Really, nothing would make me avoid his class more than studying stuff like Nifflers, or Kneazles, or Bowtruckles, as cute as they are.

â€‹

Who else here would totally love Hagrid's class? And who here knows fics where they /dont/ treat him like a fool because he is half-giant and likes mighty beasts?


** IMO, it's not that he's showing people too dangerous magical animals - it's that he's doing it without safety considerations, or assuming they'll be as durable/have the same instincts as he does.

So he wouldn't cast a disillusionment charm on the class and jump the fence into the dragon reserve - he'd just walk right up to them and expect everyone else to handle the heat/fear the same way he would, at least off of his canon attitude.

Now, a more competent version of Hagrid doing the same? Hell yeah.

******* Rowling did say in an interview that he was cleared and allowed to do magic again. So make from that what you will.

  Q: Since Hagrid's name was cleared in Book 2, will he ever be allowed to do magic openly again ? (Jan Campbell)

  A: He is allowed. He has been allowed to do magic openly ever since he became a teacher but because he was never fully trained his magic is never going to be what it should be. He is always going to be a bit inept.

***** I thought he wasn't allowed to do magic not because he was expelled, but because he was expelled as such a young age and hadn't even completed his O.W.L's. I mean, Fred and George got expelled, but after they did their tests and they weren't forbidden from doing magic. So logically Hagrid wouldn't be allowed to do magic before he passed the test. Also, didn't Hagrid join one of those Quickspell courses in one of the books? Maybe he was allowed to have a wand again, but had to take the test before he was allowed to actually use it? ðŸ¤”

** You as an adult, or you as a 13-year-old who doesn't even know the shield charm yet? Hagrid's approach is unsafe, unreasonable, and dangerous. Teenagers are brats at the best of times, let alone when they're in a group.

*** Case in point: Malfoy.

It suddenly occurs to me that like how the Overwatch fandom on AO3 has the "Genji Shimada is a Little Shit" tag, Harry Potter could probably do with a "Draco Malfoy is a Little Shit" tag as well.

** I would think that Gryffindors would /love/ his class, right? I can totally imagine the older Gryffindors telling the younger years stories about how wild the classes get (/definitely/ the story of Malfoy getting attacked by a /actual hippogriff/) and calling them cowards if they don't sign up for it as a third year elective.

** I think that when Hagrid is actually in control he can show very valuable things about creatures that no other teacher would be confident to handle, but there are things i cannot condone, like spending almost A WHOLE YEAR on a single creature /cough blast ended skrewts cough/ it's not even about their dangerousness, it's just that you CANNOT DEVOTE EVERY SINGLE LESSON to a single beast, it's criminal not to cover other animals. In the end because of Rita Skeeter and the work of professor Grubbyplank he starts teaching about other creatures, but left to his own devices he would have wasted all year on the skrewts

*** I would not be surprised if the whole thing with the Blast-Ended Skrewts was something come up with by Bagman to make the final task more "exciting". And he didn't spend the entire year on them. Harry's year also went over things like Nifflers.
