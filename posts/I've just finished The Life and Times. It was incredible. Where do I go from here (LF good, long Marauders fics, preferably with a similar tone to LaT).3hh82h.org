Self explanatory :) I like the healthy attitude to sex and the British humour (it was very similar to how me and my friends speak). Thanks :)

** Considering she's an American from Cali (I think) that must be high praise. That story is one of my favorites. Too bad she hasn't updated in over two years.

Try linkffn(Against the Moon by Spotlight Delight) and linkffn(You Want to Make a Memory by enitsirk). I've read AtM more times than I care to admit, and I'm ten chapters into other one...enjoying it so far.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to realize there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

  This is the story of four boys. This is the story of how these four boys came to know each other, of how they became friends. This is the story of their unbreakable bond that could survive any test. This is a story that will ultimately end in tragedy.

  Potter was going to say that he wasn't my boyfriend. I couldn't let him do that. For the love of Merlin, I could not let him do that. I had to stop him. He couldn't tell her the truth. So I did the only conceivable thing I could think of. I kissed him.

  Twenty years before Harry Potter entered Hogwarts for the first time, four young men had made that self-same journey. Twenty years before Harry Potter there were the Marauders. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. This is their story. Post HBP. Complete.

**** If it helps, which it probably doesn't, I'm writing one right now because I simultaneously love and hate the Marauder era fics. I also really don't like the sudden change in Peter's character from a loyal friend who is apparently an extremely talented wizard because he was able to become an animagus at such a young age along with James and Sirius into a sniveling coward. Its an AU and I have a giant plan set in mind which includes world building and changing Voldemort's character and stuff, but I'm only on the second chapter at the moment. I'm at 13,359 words midway through chapter 2, so it should be a long one. Only problem is it will probably be about two years until I actually start posting it, as I want to have it basically completed by the time I start and its going to be a loooong one. So, like I said, if it helps which it probably, most likely, definitely doesn't, there will hopefully be another good Marauders story in the future.

****** I probably will. I have been working things out with my brother who's going to be my first beta, but he recommended I get about 5 chapters in before I start having other people read it as a beta. The reasoning behind that is that he doesn't want to influence my writing style or anything. Plus, he really only reads Harry stuff and doesn't care about the Marauders, so if I can get him to enjoy the story that's a win. You wouldn't be British, by chance? Because as someone who grew up in California and only ever met one person with even the faintest of British accents, I do have some trouble spotting some American-isms.
