Can anyone recommend a good fic that delves into magical theories like this?


** “Where do vanished objects go?"

"Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything," replied Professor McGonagall.

"Nicely phrased," replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open.

Er, sorry I'm not recommending any fic. I just love that quote! It's one of the only times we get to hear about any theory of magic (other than Gamp's law).

** Harry Potter and the Golden Needle

A really great story, that has sadly been abandoned ~100k words in. Definitely deserves a read though. Dives right in to magical theory.

  Harry has an idea of how to break the rules of Transfiguration, and it actually might work. Maybe. Plenty of other things happen too. No slash and no pairings as yet.

It's a type of fic I really enjoy but must be a bitch to write. You see a lot of abandoned stories online.

** In most cases it seems like they're simply thrown into the universe's trash-bin, but there's a part in OotP where Bill vanishes a bunch of parchments concerning the Order so Harry won't see them, and it leads me to think that, depends on the kind of vanishing spell being used, they can also go into a pocket dimension where you can later pull them out of.

** I recall reading [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2699639/chapters/6041864][The Vanishing Department by dicta_contrion]], which had the idea that everything vanished (and not banished) actually goes to a Ministry department, which Malfoy is working at to serve his 10,000 hours of community service.

Quite possibly not your cup of tea, as it's very much Draco/Harry and very much NSFW. Interesting concept and full of some great sass.

  The things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, even if that involves a lot more form-filling, bickering, covert glancing, miscommunication, and flying furniture than we might expect.

  #+begin_example
      Dear birds, your “content I would love” list was a veritable treasure trove of promising plot bunnies\. It was your mention of the Room of Requirement that got especially lodged in my brain, and then sort of flipped around a bit, and mixed in with as many of your other fabulous requests as would fit, and, well, you’ll see\. I do solemnly swear that the length doesn’t indicate anything really plotty, as that was on your “rather not receive” list\. The boys just took rather a lot of convincing to come around\. I hope you enjoy their journey\! Many thanks to my wonderful, patient beta; to cheerleaders who talked through sticky bits and offered encouragement; and to the amazing mods for being patient and kind and putting this wonderful fest together\!

** In the "James potter and the hall of elder's crossing", they discuss this particular magical theory quite a lot. It's pretty good, and so are the sequels, but I'll tell you up front that it probably isn't what you're looking for.

The next book club book, linkffn(Alexandra potter) explores magical theory in such depth it was a turn off for me and I didn't get very far.

  First year fem!Harry AU. Alexandra Potter has finally come to Hogwarts, where she will meet new friends and discover a world of magic. But will an escalating rivalry threaten all that she's built? Character-driven story, lots of world building. No canon rehash, no bashing.
