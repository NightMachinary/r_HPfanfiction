I like most of DM's stories, this one not so much - but it has what you want... Harry is magically bound to some horrible manipulative bitches and fights for people that should have been burned alive.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** Closest thing I can think of is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4081016/1/The-Poker-Game]]). Not sure if you think of two as a harem, but a reluctant Harry taking two girls as his and hes not really happy about it. [[http://crys.fanficauthors.net/Chattel/index/]]

  Draco organizes a no-holds-barred poker game. Harry decides to compete... just a little fun fic co-written by Joshua. I might or might not write more on this.

** There is a fem!Harry story where Harry gets turned into a girl by Draco or something and ends up with a Harem and while hes not "submissive" if memory serves me its a little more weighted on the girls side over Harry's. Sadly I honestly cant remember its name, as I read it years ago. Hopefully someone else knows the one I am talking about.

Also, I second the OP's requests. This request intrigues me.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.
