So about a month back some fine redditor (whose name shall remain in the void) [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4rh8pf/is_anyone_else_annoyed_when_authors_dont/]]

posted about their irritation when authors didn't use cotnractions in character dialogue. I share this irritation mainly because it bothers my sense of flow. However. On the writer to editor sliding scale my pedantic nature lends me more toward the editing side, meaning it's possibly one of those things I just don't get.

So writers, I have awakened you from your death-like slumber to pose to you a question. Do you use contractions in dialogue? If not, why? Is it because writing I am is easier to you than I'm? or is it because in your head it sounds better as we are than we're? I'm curious.


** It depends on who's speaking. Harry is much more likely to say "don't" and "isn't", where I imagine Severus to speak more formally. Dumbledore is a mix of both, because I imagine he would slip in more formal speech patterns when he's angry.

*** I think people erroneously associate contractions with formality. There's far more to it than just marking off a checkbox on a list to define what "formality" is. I think all characters should behave and talk like actual people, rather than caricatures.

**** While this is true, the discussion was only based on contractions. I agree that there is a lot more to formality than that. The words used, the tone they are spoken in, things like posture and facial expressions that are a bit harder to put on paper. But I'm not sure that implying that some characters tend to speak more foamy than others makes them into caricatures. Unless I am misunderstanding you?

****** Formality no. Formal language yes. Which i think is the core mistake, assuming one has to use formal language to sound formal. (Poorly worded sentence). Formality is just a rigid code of etiquette, or a stiff way of speaking. I suppose not using contractions is the shorthand way for trying to pull that off.

** I almost always use contractions in dialogue. I think good dialogue is like good acting - you have to have a good sense of how most people naturally talk. While there may be occasional characters who speak very formally, on average most people speak quickly and naturally contract, even in formal settings, unless they're speaking very carefully to make a point.

*** Yes. If I---as a reader---pause to think about Author's dialogue choices, like if I pause to work through how a character moved in space from point A to point B, I am no longer in a story.

I will---as a writer---pull away from contractions, as you say, if I need the reader to slow down---if a character is trying to calm himself, if she is choosing her words carefully.

** I tend to speak the words as I type them. For example, in canon, Draco often uses contractions, as does Lucius Malfoy, in some points. So, as I said, I speak out the sentence, in the accent I have decided for the character. I try and avoid it completely when describing something or when narrating a scene.

In my opinion, a intelligent and formal character can say 'doesn't' instead of does not. It depends on the circumstance. I mean, I cannot see Lucius Malfoy, of all people, speaking like that all the time. Even my grandma, which was raised formally, often slips into saying shortened words when speaking among family.

It boggles my mind that people think those two sentences are identical.

The second sentence has a much more formal tone, imo.

** Mostly I use them because they're natural to speech and I aim to write dialogue in the way that it's spoken. Sometimes I don't if a character is the kind of person who doesn't use contractions (common in non-native English speakers, or people trying to sound posh or intelligent), but it would definitely be a conscious decision for me to do so. Some contractions can also be indicative of an accent, or slurred speech. It sounds stilted if no one is ever using contractions in a piece of a writing.

** As others have said, it depends on the character. AFAIK, Dumbledore doesn't use them but it shouldn't be jarring to the reader. If it sounds overly verbose when you read it out loud, it should probably be rephrased.

I see a lot of 'generational divides' in fanfic dialogue where Minerva/Poppy/etc don't use contractions, but the younger students do. Maybe my memory is faulty, but I don't recall any hard-and-fast rules to the dialogue beyond Albus' speech conventions.

** Using it or not using it depends on the character speaking.

Not using contractions can indicate that a character is hesitant in his speech. Formal speech uses it a lot. Foreign speakers who aren't proficient in the language would also talk without contractions to sound out the words.

They're simply a style-tool that may improve on your characters and storytelling if done right.

** As some have mentioned, using contractions in general does depend on the social class of a character. But also, some contractions also work better with high society characters. Someone who is posh, but also uses contractions is, for example, more likely to use shan't, than they are to use won't.

I.e, "Should you continue this line of questioning, it shan't end well." Vs. "Should you continue this line of questioning, it won't end well."

It also depends on the situation. A high class person talking to a close friend about random things, slip some contractions in to show that this person is currently at ease, they are relaxed and being more open and comfortable. A high class person is talking to a stranger or addressing a large/formal group of people, have them use less contractions to show that they are possibly uncomfortable, or being respectful.

If you have a lower/middle class person, pretending to be upper class, or talking to a formal body, i.e. Harry addressing the Wizengamot, such as at his trial. You can have them attempting to be formal, they try to use less contractions, and nicer words but have them occasionally slip up, and if they suddenly get asked a question, and they respond quickly, they slip up.

A lot of the time it's really what feels best with the character's background, combined with what makes sense depending on the situation they are currently involved in.

** I typically tend to tie the use or lack of contractions to three different things: Age (were I to write a character that lived in the past or was particularly old and set in their ways, I would write their dialogue without contractions in order to make them sound more dated)

Social Class (again, I would write dialogue without contractions in order to show higher social class, especially in Harry Potter Fanfic, where most higher class purebloods would likely be homeschooled by their parents, who would probably teach them to speak without contractions to show prestige)

& Language (were I to write a character who was new to the English language/still learning it, I would write their dialogue without using contractions because I believe that learning contractions and their meanings would typically come later, after the character has begun to use English with native speakers and had a chance to pick up on them)

My use/lack of contractions isn't limited to these three things, an author can decide to use/not to use contractions to give their characters more of a distinctive way of speaking, a different background, or anything else. But as a rule of default my characters use contractions (as I use contractions myself), so I use the lack of contractions to offer a distinction of some sort.

** Like others are saying here in and in my older post, it really matters based on the character speaking. Pompous aristocrats like Lucius Malfoy and Cornelius Fudge will refrain from using contractions 75% of the time. Lack of contractions in a character's speech doesn't necessarily imply intelligence either, despite what some authors think. See Fudge and Umbridge, for example.

** I noticed it but assumed it was a product of too much time in the classroom. Every year the lit teacher would go on and on about the evils of contractions. My professor for English 102 was especially harsh, contractions did not exist in her class room. I could mispell and throw comma's in all the wrong places, but contractions would bring the grade down fast.

** How I write characters absolutely depends on so many different factors:

Are they intelligent? Less likely to use contractions in more formalized speech and more likely to use more than two syllable words.

Are they still kids? Then two syllable words are the max I use for them unless absolutely necessary. Example: "I do not understand any of what you are saying, Professor Dumbledore" is entirely too unwieldy, even for Hermione at 11/12 so it would become "I dunno/don't know what you mean, Professor."

I generally try to not use contractions in the narrative. E.g., (a first draft of a recently written scene for Darkness!Harry)

#+begin_quote
  At first he thought it was going to be Dark. And/or Disturbing. Instead it was about neutral relics and rituals, the majority of which had been corrupted over the centuries, Sirius knew. But a few had not been, Sirius found. Harry was too young for most and Sirius too tainted, but there were a few that could be useful. Three ritual protections, one based on smoking an herb regularly, and the fifth was a relic that was, amazingly enough, upstairs. The Potters's Bollocks Dagger. It was somewhat like the Elder Wand of legend in that it was a focus that was allegedly handed down by a personification---Venus in this case---but the Bollocks Dagger did not make the wielder unbeatable. Instead, it allowed them to know if a person a wielder wanted to seduce could be by letting them know if they were actually interested. Sirius debated telling Harry or not then decided to ask Charlus about it. The ghost probably knew, he decided. It was not a particularly rare book but the dagger was considered a legend. Sirius was only sure it was the same because of the markings on the dagger and the design in the book.
#+end_quote

You can see a number of places where I could use contractions in the narrative.

But use it fairly often in my character's speech if they're young and trend it out as they get older to show they're maturing.
