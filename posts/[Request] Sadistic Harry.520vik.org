Any good stories you'd recommend that Harry is a sadist throughout the story. Would love it to be at least 75k words <3

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.

** linkffn(8312363) Honestly, the Harry in this story freaks me out; he's murderous, violent and, trigger warning, he rapes his victims. The writing was decent, though - at least, it was tolerable, from what I can remember.
