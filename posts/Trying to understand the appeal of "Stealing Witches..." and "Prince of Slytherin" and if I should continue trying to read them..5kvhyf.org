So I tried reading both of them since they are so often recommended on this sub. I got through a good portion of both, a half dozen chapters or so. I can see that both are written better (slightly?) than most gary stu, angsty godlike Harry fanfiction. That said, I've read quite a few well written godlike angsty Harry fanfiction out there. I can't seem to see how these stories "subvert" any tropes.

I'll admit that Stealing Witches gets a bit more original with its plot than other stories of the type but so far it seems to fit like most godlike harem fics out there. Stories that are quite often bashed on this sub, so I'm confused why this fic is beloved. Am I missing something here? Could someone fill me in about this?

And the Prince of Slytherin is kinda hard to read through. Both on the legibility/grammar side and the plot. I've heard the story gets much better in the second year, but that's quite a lot of reading to trudge through for a payoff I don't have much faith in. Is this story popular since it's a wrong boy who lived story that is actually being updated and is being written? Since most WBWL stories are usually abandoned, including the better written ones. (Deprived, The Santi's story)

So my question is kinda summed as what about these stories is different from the stories that they are supposed to "subvert" and be much better than? Is the popularity just from the fact these both are updated often and are written well using guilty pleasure plotlines?


** I'm not sure Dodging Prison /is/ "subverting" its tropes -- it's simply doing them really well. It's a harem fic, but not for the purposes of getting Harry laid a lot. It's a Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived, but the WBWL isn't a caricature. It's a GreaterGood!Dumbledore, but there's a reason he's over the top about it. etc.

** I don't think you should read anything you aren't enjoying (unless you have to for some reason obviously). Life is too short and there is plenty more stuff out there you will like better.

** My suggestion is to continue reading them. Six chapters is not much.

I was in a similar position myself, especially for 'Dodging Witches'. I stopped reading that one fairly early as well, due to the generic bashing. Eventually, I gave it a second try, and I must say, the story really does get much better; presenting cliches and giving them a rare/unique spin.

** Honestly both of the stories uses a lot of cliches (to an extent) but the writing is good and the cliches are well used so it's worth reading imo .

** I'm not a harem fan on principle but 'Dodging' deals with it far more realistically than the wish-fulfillment you'd expect from such fics. It also has some clever uses of magic and Harry's carefully laid plans sometimes blow up in his face. I'm intrigued enough to keep reading.

As always, read what you like.

** I'm replying because I think I have a bit of a unique position to offer: I really didn't like Prince of Slyterhin and stopped reading at some point, but I love Dodging Witches...

IMHO Prince of Slytherin gets way too much credit for being cheeky and "I am very smart". Dodging Witches... on the other hand is doing its best to transcend its cliches by executing them very well.

I'm not sure how far you got into Dodging Witches... but it doesn't take long for it to completely throw you for a loop. Of course the harem and WBWL cliches remain all the time in its theme, but it's taking the plot in really interesting and more importantly new directions. I have to say though the biggest appeal for me in this story is the complexity: I have always loved stories that always keep me on my toes and make me wonder "WTF is going on?" and Dodging Witches... really tickles my fancy there. The other characters aren't just NPCs who sit around and wait for the protagonist to interact with them, they actually do things on their own.

The downside of this is that it takes a lot of exposition and time to bring all the pieces into position, but the pay-off is great.

Oh and not to spoil things, but Harry in that story is anything, but godlike.Yeah he's much more powerful than in canon, but he has equally as powerful counter-players and makes mistakes.

** Prince of Slytherin has good plot and decent characterisation, and some good world building ideas (and many more terrible ones). Would be better if author didn't get the "I will make this good despite using all the tropes" idea. It only hurts the fic.

Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches is just "look I am self-aware of that I use cliches so I it is absolutely not stupid that I use bad cliches". Which is what trashy light novels like OreImo did long before. But people love their trashy clished fics, so it's popular.

** I dunno about Slytherin Prince, first time I've read about it. As for DPSW:RIBSR

I dont really hate it, but don't really love it either. I'm not really into the characters since most of the time harry is characterized as his 6th year Luke Skywalker self. But the appeal for me was the world building and political climate. Its not the best, granted, but there were somethings I really liked about the story in so far as I read (think i'm in the early to mid teens chapterwise.) Things like the explanation about the mechanics behind the Hogwarts Express and little things like that have keep me interested along with the vague curiosity of what will happen next. Some parts do goad me. I don't really like how the story focus's more on the girls with short little snippets of Harry sandwiched between. He's supposed to be the main character, the one we're most interested about, and yet we're served three chapters of in-depth emotional analysis of the girls and then given a snippet of Harry wining and dining with a bunch of rich old farts with very little personal introspection about his plans. (The political discussion was the only thing that got me through that part.)

So all and all: Its a good fic if you like world-building and politics and occasional hijinks. I do think it gets better as you go along. I'm not a fan normally of this kinda thing, but this ones tolerable and Harry isn't made out to be a total wanker either. So...

I dunno.

** 'One fic has 80 or so chapters, the other has about 35. I read 6ish of each so i gave them a fair shot.'

If you've got so much going on in your life that you don't have time to read more than the opening chapters of a fic then these aren't for you. If you can persevere then these fics both hit their stride later on.

** Im pretty much wondering the same thing, especially with prince of slytherin, i tried it, and i have read more then 6 chapters, but its just really bad (to me). There are two major problems with the fic for me, firstly, the dialogue is atrocious. Take the conversation between Harry and Hermione in chapter 5 as an example, no conversation would go like that, ever. Not to mention that no 11 year old would ever speak like that. It just sounds awful if you actually think about what that would sound like if spoken out loud.

Secondly, Harry is way to much of a Garry stu, everyone, bar the bad guys, likes him, he is awesome at everything and so on. I've heard that that gets better later on, but im just not willing to wade through a pretty bad fic for like 100k words until it becomes somewhat good.

*** I just binged on it and it gets better sooner rather than later. That being said I find myself caring less and less about the plot and more and more about the world building the author is setting up. I'm willing to eat a lot of bad plots for good worldbuilding (see also the original books).
