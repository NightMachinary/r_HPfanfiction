I last saw this online around 2004/5, so I know it's a long shot, but here goes...

Story specs:

- Pairings: Harry/Hermione, Draco/Ginny, Ron/Lavender

- Each couple has a child, with Harry and Hermione having a daughter; the kids are around early high school age

- Story starts in the U.S, where they have been living in hiding for a while, and haven't told their children about their wizard heritage.

- McGonagall and Dumbledore live down the street, and are described as "grandparents." They are all hiding/under cover.

- Eventually they return to Hogwarts, introduce their children to magic and all that.

Any ideas? Thanks!
