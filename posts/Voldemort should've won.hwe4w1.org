I had been visiting this subreddit for the first time in a while and when you start to think about the ending of HP, you start to realise that there is absolutely no reason Harry should've won.

Harry potter as a character has never been very studious and hadn't really shown much interest in learning magic for any reason other than necessity. In Prisoner of Azkaban Harry learns the patronus charm, magic that is said to be very difficult to learn even for adult wizards, in his third year of hogwarts. In my head that fact alone should be some (weak) evidence for how he had the potential to learn much more powerful spells to use against Voldemort.

But he doesn't.

In the triwizard tournament, he learns the summoning charm only because he has to use it in the first task (ignoring that he was essentially hinging on a single plan to work). Tom Riddle on the other hand, was immensely well versed in magic as whole and had a talent for the mind arts before ever learning of the wizarding world. When you put Tom's 60 years of experience and cunning personality together with also being the greatest wizard alive, there is no reason Harry should've stood any chance whatsoever. 100% Voldemort would have won and taken over not only magical Britain, but maybe the entire wizarding world, as long as nobody thinks to just murder the entire wizengamot, killing half of his death eaters and crippling his influence


** Yep. It's the curse of the Everyman Chosen-One protagonist. "You're unique and the only one who can do the thing! But everyone has to relate to you so you can't be too special!"

Harry has the potential, has the regular dangers as motivation to fulfil that potential, but never really does and ends up getting saved by vaguely foreshadowed but mostly out of nowhere Deus Ex Machina. He's not a hero at all, he's literally just a random jock that people told a lot of stories about that keeps ending up in the wrong place at the wrong time due to adult incompetence and a boatload of passive suicidal ideation.

I can understand why some people like the ending, it definitely fits the overall 'love and sacrifice and not fearing death are the most powerful magics of all' message of the series, but Harry definitely isn't a traditional hero to get a traditional victory over the villain.

*** Harry's feats don't line up with Harry Potter the charachter. You've got someone who killed a basilisk with a sword, drove away hundreds of dementor with a patronus and defeated the strongest dark lord ever who has trouble learning the summoning spell.

Rowling was so concerned with making the trio relatable that she makes them underwhelming even compared to others their age group. Snape was appearently rewriting the potion book and creating spells by his sixth year and was good enough to keep Voldemort out if his mind at s young age, the marauders made a map of the school and turned into animagus as kids.

It's really noticeable when you compare Ron with his brothers. The twins experimented with magic and created all kinds of cool things, Percy got 12 OWLs and managed to get high up into the Ministry pretty early in his career, Bill and Charlie got some of the most interesting jobs in the series. Ron's whole deal was that he lived in everyone's shadow, but Rowling never gave him something to get out of it. All his brothers have specialization and he basically follows Harry into being an Auror and ends up retiring to work into his brothers joke shop. I'd have accepted it if his story line was comming to terms with living in everyone's shadow, but he didn't even get that.

Hermione even more so, we're told she's the smart one, but she has nothing to show for it after six years of studying at Hogwarts. There is no field of magic she's particularly brilliant at like we we're told Lily was with charms or James and Snape were with Transfiguration and Potions.

Before mentioning it, there's exposition detailing Harry's current misery. Later, she has a line that goes like "he'd seemed to develop a block against it." After Harry says "each time I try all I see is a dragon."

So, in-universe Harry struggles because he's emotional. Out-universe JKR has him struggle for plot relevant reasons but, for once, tries to make sense of it.

***** Catch-up? No. But even a child could "kill" Voldemort (assuming he doesn't have any horcruxes left), if it was lucky/cunning enough.

Unless Harry is an even bigger prodigy (which is not as unreasonable, he /did/ completely #rekt all those dementors, while under emotional and physical duress.) or he learns some different form of magic that Voldie is somehow unfamiliar with (he /did/ supposedly travel a lot when he was young, or is that fanon?), he doesn't really stand a chance on a fair duel.

But it wouldn't be a fair duel. Voldemort would underestimate him. Voldemort would underestimate /everyone/. He thinks he's immortal after all. He doesn't have anything to fear. And without fear, one becomes careless. And what could a child possibly do?

In that case, the point of training is to give him as many skills as possible. To give him as many possible opportunities to mortally wound Voldemort as possible. He may still fail, but he sure as hell would go down fighting. Unlike canon Harry, who is a complete disappointment in terms of fighting diversity.

****** I mean, sure, I don't disagree with you that it's possible to fight Voldemort like that, but Harry isn't really all that cunning a character. He's too... blunt and forthright.

Take Fifth Year as an example. He never bothered actually trying to convince anyone of anything at any point. He literally just stated that Voldemort was back. No debate, no persuasion, nothing. Just a direct statement of what happened. There's a reason politics is entirely mired in emotion and symbolism these days - that's how you persuade people of things.

A cunning Harry would've actually given arguments: "Can you really afford to be wrong in this?" or "Well, a lot of people are disappearing now, aren't they?" and so on. Harry just bludgeoned people with the same statement over and over until events conspired to prove him right. He just isn't patient enough to take that kind of approach to a fight.

If he was the kind of character to think like that, sure, it could happen. But even a well-trained, tooled-up Canon!Harry would be more than likely to just walk right up to Voldemort and yell things at him while casting spells.

Don't get me wrong, I would definitely prefer a more cunning, smarter Harry that could take the kind of path you're talking about - but that isn't the one we got. :(

I vaguely recall Riddle travelling a lot before coming back for the second DADA interview - I'm pretty sure that's Twitter Canon though. :D

Also, on the fighting diversity note, someone made a list of all the spells Harry casts in the series a little while back and found he cast about seventy-something across all the books. No idea how many of those were in a fight, but that's definitely somewhat diverse. :)

Exactly. That's the problem.

But cunning isn't a static part of ones character. It can be taught. Not being cunning is what got Sirius killed. Both on Harry's and Sirius' part. If they knew how to restrain themselves from being so blunt in life and death situations, Sirius wouldn't have died there.

As for diversity, just look at the Dumbledore vs Riddle fight. I'll admit, however, that it's a problem of most fights from the books, not just Harry. They are just shooting curses back and forth. Nothing else.

What's the point of fighting with magic, if said fighting is just like fighting with guns?

Lucius tried to killing-curse a vaguely antagonistic child outside the office of a government official, Mad-eye signed up to the Truly Idiotic Seven Potters plan, Draco blundered from mess to mess and only was able to keep going because nobody did anything about it. Lockhart's con-artistry and Hermione's bank-robbery plan were probably the closest we got.

And well, does anyone really change all that much throughout the series anyway? Aside from Ginny suddenly developing a character and Neville, I don't remember anyone being all that different at the end to how they were at the start. It's been awhile since I read the books though.

*** If you want a character to be relatable, make them huge nerds in some subject and just all around physically weak while being able to recite a whole chapter of something on command. Believe me, that's more relatable than being a dumb jock like Harry pretty much is. Make your MC a cinnamon roll (that's what I'm planning on doing) and everyone will love them. What really matters is making your character likeable, not relatable. Give them some relatable traits, sure, but make it so people actually LIKE the character as a PERSON. You can have time to to make the MC and other characters relatable later. We don't need to always be screaming at your character to be smarter like we do with Harry.

I think the problem is mostly Dumbledore's and Ron's fault. They both treated him like hes a god or the best thing ever. They convinced and conditioned him to not even try hard. Hermione at least started trying to get him to learn but then she gave up too.

I honestly think that if Harry had had different friends that he would have ended up better, would have tried harder and been better off.

Voldemort was so much more advanced than Harry even before he ever entered Hogwarts. More power, more natural talent and more determination. Did anyone try to tell this to Harry to better prepare him.. no.

** Had Voldemort been less ignorant, Harry wouldn't have had any chance indeed. And for me, that makes the appeal of the story. Harry doesn't win because he has flashier spells, but because he understands what Voldemort, the personified evil, cannot understand. Voldemort doesn't understand love, selflessness, compassion, friendship because he has given up his own humanity long ago.

Frodo couldn't have defeated Sauron on power alone. He defeated Sauron because Sauron was too arrogant to consider a hobbit a threat and because Frodo had Sam by his side who kept him going when he couldn't have kept going on his own. Luke Skywalker couldn't have defeated Palpatine; no, Palpatine was defeated because Darth Vader in the end decided to be Luke's Father rather than the Emperor's henchman.

** The issue is that, frankly, canon Voldemort is not a particularly impressive figure from what we see. A lot of how fearsome he is comes off of his reputation - but also, a lot of it comes from other people being incompetent. So when measured against that, canon Harry winning on a case of just the protagonist getting a convenient case of writing is fairly fitting ;)

It actually gives a lot of potential for fanfics - to both make Harry (and his friends) and Voldemort more competent (and in Harry's case, driven). One of the things I find disappointing about a lot of powerful Harry fics is that they really only do the former - and Voldemort turns out to be mostly a joke. It's a lot more interesting to see it still be a struggle - just a, well, 'smarter' struggle on both sides.

I also dislike the urge that some people have to make Harry incredibly/uniquely powerful - it can be fun, but I don't think it fits with the character to make him like that. Having a friend/family group supporting him - with their own strengths - are also important to the story, in my experience.

In Wizarding Britain everyone carries an extremely destructive weapon; there are very effective magical defences, disguises and means of evasion. All of which should make it difficult to rule a rebellious population but Voldemort still manages to make himself almost unchallenged dictator. `

****** Once again my comments are due more to my history and personality and how I was raised. Eg. If you have the capability when bad things are happening around you then you're honor bound to stop the bad guys or delay them so others can get away.

So putting myself into the story being a wizard and having been taught those curses I would have immediately started fighting the deatheaters hoping that I can keep their attention on me so others could get away.

Any thing other than that and I would expect my mother and grandmothers to come up out of the grave and slap me silly. Which is the reason why even though I was on crutches I still gave up my seat to any woman and any man who looked older than me.

  Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, ‘I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors, than to his triumphs.'

  The company round the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter's continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him.

  ‘I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.' - /Deathly Hallows, pg. 8/
#+end_quote

This is one of the few times where he was so correct - Harry has survived for so long, more so because of Voldemort's mistakes than him actually having the skill. It's just that Voldemort keeps making such mistakes and eventually dug his own grave. If Voldemort had depended on sheer logic then he would've sent his entire army to kill/capture Harry Potter, and considering his mother's protection /only/ protects him against Voldemort, he would've gotten defeated by his top duelists like Bellatrix or Dolohov.

And of course, there are the extra-universe explanations. Harry Potter is a story about a normal kid defeating a great evil. Harry isn't the next Dumbledore, or the next Grindelwald. He's not even a Snape or McGonagall. He's a normal kid who beats Voldemort because of love, loyalty, and innocence.

Even if this means dying "for the greater good". Because Harry is so broken he does't care if he lived or died, because death would be a salvation.

  Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!”

** OP, you need to reread book #1. Hermione spells it out. Books and cleverness only go so far. You need to be willing to stand and fight, to have positive relationships that make you an inspiring leader rather than a maligned loser, and to have the drive to do what's right even when it's not easy. You have to be capable of being selfless even when it hurts your pride.

Harry's really the most suitable candidate.

Furthermore, Harry's attempt to learn the Patronus is sabotaged because he wanted to hear his parents. He had the talent to learn faster. He himself notes that learning the Summoning Charm is only difficult because he has a kind of mental block about it, which seems to be his subconscious reacting to the stress of Ron being angry with him and the Triwizard Tournament by seizing control wherever he can find it, even to his own detriment. He gets EE on his Potions OWL when that was his worst subject.

Harry might not /like/ studying much of anything but defense, but he's without a doubt far above average as far as brains go. There's a reason the Sorting Hat says he doesn't have a bad mind, but doesn't seriously consider putting him in Ravenclaw. Whenever Harry is given a reason to learn something, he learns it fast.

** I can see where you're coming from, but I think the error in your thinking is believing that it was Harry's innate power that would ever lead to the demise of Voldemort. Going toe to toe skill-wise, Harry would get absolutely demolished by Voldemort; he's 17 (lol), and didn't even finish his magical education. I don't think anyone would deny that if it was down to power alone, Harry wouldn't stand a chance.

Also, "powerful spells" were never Harry's approach - he knows that he's outmatched in that sense - you can see that even when it comes to his spell of choice (expelliarmus) he's trying to disarm, and not kill. If it was a matter of power, Dumbledore would've been fast-tracking Harry from the moment he got to Hogwarts like a tiny little soldier. Instead, Harry's success is directly attributed to the efforts of those who came before him and those who stand beside him - a common theme woven throughout every book.

I think there's a kind of beauty in the fact that Voldemort's demise came from his own insecurities and shortcomings rather than Harry being this OP 17 year old. It really is a team effort - from Lily sacrificing herself, Dumbledore's teachings, Neville killing Nagini, Narcissa's betrayal..... There are so many cogs in the machine that lead to Voldemort's defeat - most of which are completely out of his control or oversight, yet he's locked onto Harry as the key piece to his victory. Other commenters have already provided some great passages that show off Voldemort's hubris in this regard.

This approach really encapsulates the book's core themes - whereas I don't think anyone would ever really expect Harry to defeat Voldemort (without any external circumstances intervening and helping him) in a 1-1 battle. Even in DH, the trio's goal is to destroy all the Horcruxes so that Voldemort could be killed - not necessarily by them.

I agree with your assessment in that Voldemort is incredibly powerful, but to try to say that he should've won due to his skills alone neglects many of the core themes and narrative arcs of the books.

~cough~ the power he knows not is love ~cough~

Fanfic authors, especially in the early days, love to mock that concept, but as you noted, that's literally why he won in the books.

It wasn't some stupid love-based spell, it wasn't screaming "HEART!" and shooting a pink beam out of a ring. It was that voldemort ruled through fear and harry 'ruled' through love. If harry didn't love his friends so much he wouldn't have gone out and gotten the horcrux removed. If his friends didn't love him so much, Neville wouldn't have gone snicker-snack on the last horcrux. Every last person who opposed voldemort cared more about other people than they did themselves, and every last person who supported voldemort cared more about themselves than other people.

Even at the end, Narcissa cared more about her son than the possible personal repercussions of lying to voldemort.

If it wasn't for a long and continuous chain of love-motivated actions, voldemort would have won. But he didn't, because the power he knows not is love and voldemort only knows how to inspire fear and greed.

*** True but remember it's pretty heavily implied (and I think true) that for 10 years Harry was abused and most likely got in trouble for doing better than Dudley in school so you have all that conditioning to overcome. Now if he had been raised by normal people he would have known his parents were murdered, he would've been encouraged to do well in school. Basically his whole attitude and self worth would have improved. Then I don't think anything would've held him back from learning every piece of magic he could.

** I've long said that the good guys won in canon by being luckier and marginally less incompetent than the bad guys. The Death Eaters have all the capabilities of the Order, more money, plenty of backup (giants, trolls, Dementors, etc.) and no scruples; I'd also argue that they had a stronger political position for much of the series. Much-maligned though it may be, Harry Crow makes a convincing showing of two Death Eaters causing lots of trouble just by playing it smart, and the World Cup attack in that fic really showcases the kind of carnage Voldemort /could/ have caused in canon with a bit of intelligence.

***** While that may be true, my point still stands. Here is the full prophecy.

#+begin_quote
  "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches ... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies ... And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not ... And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives...”
#+end_quote

As you see, the prophecy says that "either must die at the hand of the other", it /does not/ say that Harry will win. Only that he /can/ win, and that he is /the only one/ who can win. It does not say that he /will/ win.

Lastly, by what evidence can you say, "that's not how prophecies work"? Where in the books does it define the exact mechanics of predicting the future? Is it somewhere between McGonagall (a fully qualified witch) calling divination "woolly", and Dumbledore (/the most/ qualifed wizard) saying that the prophecy only has power because Voldemort acted on it?

****** Dumbledore's wrong. So is McGonagall. The narrative just doesn't tell you that directly. The way Divination is portrayed in the books is a fakeout, the story tells you it's rubbish, but the overwhelming majority of predictions made through actual divination techniques do come true. If prophecies were bollocks, how could every aspect of the prophecy come true exactly as described, despite people both trying to avert it and to actively encourage it?

Dumbledore is correct when he says the prophecy only has power because Voldemort heard it, but that is why Trelawney's fit happened precisely when it did; so that Snape would hear the exact snippet necessary for the events it describes to occur. Had it been even a few seconds in either direction, events would change dramatically and so the prophecy itself would be different, if it happened at all.

We also know that it is not necessary for a person to believe and act on the prophecy in order for it to be fulfilled. Consider the only other prophecy we see, Trelawney's prophecy that Pettigrew would escape. Harry did nothing to act on this, but it came true anyway.

It's like claiming something is true just because it can't be poven wrong, it's illogical. Especially when what you are claiming is directly contrary to what is stated in the text. Clearly divination is not "nonsense", as there are prophecies and they due come true, but claiming that Dumbledore is just wrong, when he has been right about /so many more things/, especially without any evidence to back your claim, is frankly absurd. All of ehat you stated about the prophecy as evidence is circumstantial, what's more it can also support the interpretation that prophecies are only fulfilled because of the actions of those who believe them. The actions of people trying to prevent the prophecy brought it to pass, the actions of people trying to envourage the prophecy brought it to pass, the only way to knwo for certain if it would have happened any way would be if they had just ignored the prophecy and then it happened anyway. You claim that "that's how it works", I'm not saying it's impossible for you to be correct, I'm saying it /is/ possible for you to be wrong.

My case is strong. You are making an argument to authority of “Dumbledore said it, and he's often correct about other topics, so he must be correct about this”. This is a common fallacy. You are the one who lacks evidence to the contrary.

** I saw this fic recced elsewhere, but I want to put its premise and characterization of Voldemort, in particular, into this discussion. This is an evil Lord Voldemort whom I can get behind. He takes the 15-month old Harry Potter with him on the night he kills James and Lily, and ‘raises' him. Voldemort is incredibly horrible in this fic. I wish the author had finished the story!

This version of Voldemort approximates the individual I always wanted him to be, in order to be truly terrifying. Even if you only read the last couple of chapters, specifically where he teaches Harry to throw off the Imperius curse, you'll get a sense of his deep depravity, and his inability for empathy or remorse.

** You missed a big plot point if you think Voldemort losing was unrealistic. Voldemort was extremely arrogant and that led to his downfall. He considered himself different and above everyone else. If he stopped underestimating the power of love and blood magic and properly looked into stuff, he'd have won. There was no way Harry could've defeated him in a 1-on-1 duel.

To give you an example of how arrogant he was: he stored pieces of his soul in very prominent objects and hid them in prominent places, rather than mundane ones so as to avoid attention, because nothing else was 'worthy' to have his soul. In the end, he ended up creating a sort of theme which allowed Dumbledore to guess his horcruxes and even their hiding places.

He overlooked Lily's sacrifice out of love because he didn't understand love. This led to his first downfall. Still undermining Lily's sacrifice, he failed to realize that a piece of his soul was inside Harry. He killed that piece, leaving Harry alive. He failed to properly analyze wandlore and didn't realize the Elder Wand didn't transfer via killing. Simply disarming worked, but he was too arrogant to look into that. That led to his second downfall.

** Voldemort lost because he relied too much on his horcruxes being well-hidden to the point of unattainability and because he did not take Harry seriously enough.

Voldemort and the Death Eaters had plenty of opportunities to kill Harry and his friends. A general order that he was to be summarily executed if captured would have seen the trio dead halfway through book 7. Death Eaters willing to kill rather than try and grab the shiny orb in book 5 would have done the ministry six in. The end of book 6 was a golden opportunity for the Death Eaters to deal with Potter once and for all... And the most important figures to the future resistance efforts if they'd been willing to bomb/gatecrash Dumbledore's funeral.

But the most glaring failure of all? Book 4, in the graveyard. Had Voldemort taken Harry seriously, the boy would have faced a firing squad or been AK'd as he was strung up on the gravestone, not let loose and given his wand back.

Harry's bumbling and apparent mediocrity meant that Voldemort consistently underestimated him, right until the very end. Harry comes back from the fucking dead and goads Voldemort into a one on one duel... And the Dark Lord iust accepts? Doesn't command the army on the field with him to open fire with everything they have?

If Voldemort had taken Harry seriously, the kid would have been dead long ago.

As it stands though, your point is valid. Voldemort had actually won by the Battle of Hogwarts. The battle itself was a mopping up operation meant to wipe out the last of the resistance forces arrayed against the Dark Lord. Had he not taken to the field and opted to stay at the Ministry instead, it's highly likely that he would have won full stop since even if the Death Eaters had suffered massive losses, the ministry and it's defenders would still be his to command, forcing a reversal of the BOH. Had that happened and a ministry siege took place, then the attrition rate alone would have made victory pointless for the order of the Phoenix. The circumstances that allowed Harry to win would not have existed in this scenario either. It would have been a grind that favoured the Dark Lord all the way.

In short, poor planning and overconfidence did what a fucking prophecy couldn't, bringing about the end of Voldemort. Just as planned... To the degree that anyone actually planned this out.

** Ah but then you have to remember the prophecy where Voldemort marks Harry as his equal. Now the simplest way to look at that is to have Harry having the same level/size magical "core", raw magic ability etc as Tom. I think one fic (which used cores or some other way of measuring raw magic capability) had Harry being as powerful as Voldemort and that is why the killing curse rebounded.

Another fic did something similar but had Harry become even more powerful as he was equal to Voldemort at one year old and the fic had magicals get more powerful as they age until they "mature" in their 20's. So Voldemort as powerful as he was would have ended up weaker (in terms of overall magical power) than Harry but more knowledgeable about spells.

And again we have children's books (and lots of fanfics) where the kid is the Hero so of course Harry was going to beat Voldemort because of "plot reasons".

** Oh I agree 100%. Younger me was jumping off the walls thinking how amazing it was and how epic the battle was, in the books and especially in the movies (I'm one of those ones who liked them breaking away into black dust even tho it isn't canon it looked amazing /especially/ in 3D) but now I'm older I realize how disappointing and unrealistic it all was (and omg don't comment saying it's a fiction series). I wish now Harry Potter had been truly trained like personally trained by Moody or Dumbledore or even Snape! They worked so hard on occlumency which was okay and all but once it was obvious it wasn't working they should have done defense! Not Dark Arts but there are some spells that I'm sure isn't /mainstream/ but isn't /dark/. Harry is /amazing/ at defense and with the promise he'd only use it on Death Eaters and Voldemort I'm sure he'd been all for it. It wouldn't have been /perfect/ if Snape had been teaching him but they'd have a better advantage then occlumency since Harry actually likes Defense. But it's a children's book. If anyone wants to read the /adult/ take on Harry Potter then Saving Connor by Lightning on the Wave on fanfiction is my absolute favorite. It's slash but it doesn't go into explicit too much for them.

** Apart from the fact that it was exceedingly easy to kidnap Harry. He was escorted every time from King's Cross station (how hard was it to follow the Dursleys all the way to Surrey?). Then there's the problem with the Horcruxes. You posses a Hogwarts professor after years of waiting and still barely survive without the Philosopher's Stone. Not much of a fallback plan. Why not go for the ritual "blodd of your enemy" kidnapping Harry in first year? How hard would be for Pettigrew, sleeping in a room with four 11 year olds? Or anyone else that qualifies as "enemy". Even Neville's parents, in a hospital, would do. The whole think was not too carefully thought up.

Once Voldemort is quietly back in a body Then you have your deatheaters follow the Dursleys and Harry from Kings Crossing and blast all of them to smithereens while they are in the car..

** The reason that he could defeat Voldemort was that he had practice fighting for his life, and he wasn't afraid. That was the whole point of his arc. First of all, Dumbledore did half the work in fighting from the shadows and creating the order and discovering the horcruxes. Second of all, the Hallows weren't at all random - they were intricately tied to Voldemort and Harry's fate. You could make the argument he should have won, but in my opinion isn't a very good one because the point of Voldemort is that he would die eventually anyway to someone like Harry because he was afraid of death and Harry was not. That's why the Hallows weren't random - they were a concrete literary device that communicated that abstract struggle.

Voldemort being defeated by heroic sacrifice is a thematic resolution, and a call-back to the way he was defeated the first time.
