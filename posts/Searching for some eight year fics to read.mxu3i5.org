Would prefer longer fics. Emphasis on world building and how the characters are coping after the war.


** Do you mind oc centered series that don't exactly follow canon events to worldbuild and are in 2nd person POV? Cuz if you do my series is 336k words for the first book then crosses over into the hobbit fandom when the third Wizarding war destroys their world and the allies get sucked into a book portkey while trying to escape

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Follows multiple Hogwarts students through '8th year' and one additional year of early adulthood. COMPLETE.
