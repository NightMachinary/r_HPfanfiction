** My username is relevant for once... but alas I don't have an answer for your fic search.

Edit : I do have one. It's a woman, and she isn't the main character but she does have a decent size role.

Promises Remembered / Promises Unbroken series. Lucius Malfoy's sister, Julia. She's in love with Sirius. Her character is great!

#+begin_quote
  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
