********* There really aren't words. You need to at least read to about chapter 10 when he finds out he has to bang McG "who has a surprisingly stunning body". It's just awful. The ridiculous kingdom plot doesn't really get going for a while either, there's just chapter after chapter of Harry banging more people then eventually becoming king of this island, bringing everyone loyal to him over and getting them a bunch of wives.

My favourite bit is when he finds out Dumbledore is selling all the muggleborns as concubines so he buys them all and spreads them out amongst his allies. No one has an issue with this. Like they go along with the "you have to cum in my mouth and vagina to bond me" thing and it's so good they willingly stay bound to everyone. Everyone. Even Arthur. They're just so good in bed.

The author has actually written a few fics that are decent but this is designed for a horny 13 year old who just wants something to wank over.

********* If it had ever plateaued I probably would have quit but it just kept going and getting more and more ridiculous. Like how can you top Harry getting 24 wives and his own kingdom you'd think? Well he's 5th in line to the British Throne and his huge amounts of wife magic goodness cause Narcissa Malfoy to become a member of his coven. Wookiee you brought that up out of the blue you might say? Nope, that's how it happens in the fic too. He just has a coven now and Narcissa tells him that it's a thing before they, of course, bang to make it official.

You might think the airforce makes it hard to cause a realistic villain once Dumbledore and Voldemort are weakened (never neutralised though because this needed to be longer)? No because Remus shows up and confesses that Sirius let him borrow Tonks (Harry's second wife, one of 3 of Sirius former concubines that Harry inherits) for sex because he's a werewolf. Scary stuff, how do they resolve it? McG (Bound to the Potter family to serve them sexually, James included) manages to calm everyone down by explaining shit happens and he was at least a kind rapist, Tonks reveals her love of anal to distract Harry and Remus becomes the Mayor of Harry's Kingdoms Capital City and get's a dozen wives who are cool with the werewolf thing (don't worry, Harry cures it later by locking him in a time slowing room so he experiences a month a day and therefore goes more than a month without transforming so his body just quits being a werewolf and becomes a wolf animagus instead).

****** This is a piece of fanon that I actually prefer. JKR's explanation doesn't specify the need for the horcruxes to be human-accessible, but paranoid gamer logic would suggest that there's a reason Riddle didn't chuck one into the Marianas trench.

To be fair, it's the best explanation of why Riddle kept running back to Albania. If his spirit could roam anywhere, it'd be childsplay for him to visit Bellatrix before she went on a nutty and just convince her how to make him physical again. If he could only hang near his horcruxes but it doesn't matter which one, he'd have lurked in the Malfoy's basement until he could appear to Lucius in a private moment, then tell him what he needs the diary to do.

Instead he goes to Albania. Twice.

My fanon to explain this is that he's drawn to the last completely-made Horcrux (i.e.: not Harry). The first time he was recovered by Quirrel he was too happy to have ended ten years of isolation to think about having the horcrux extracted. When Wormtail comes to find him, he's learned his lesson: 'Let's make the last-made horcrux into a mobile death platform, like a freaking super-snake'.

This also assumes that a horcrux's soul piece gets used up in the process of re-embodiment, but can be easily remade since all the prep-work is still in place. Just need to do another murder.

**** Technically correct, but that isn't what my comment was about. Barty is the Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Knowing languages are a requirement of his job, and they probably bust out the crazy hard magic to make him capable of it. Also, we don't hear about every wizard knowing a ton of languages (Dumbledore knows more than usual, yea). Most just speak their native language and another standard like french or german. Heck, Krum barely speaks English and it hurt his chances with Hermione. If there was an easy peasy spell for him to pick up English, I think he would have used it.

When you have magic to help you to learn a language, it becomes a rather less valuable skill, because if you ever have need of one, the magic is there to help you learn. When you can learn any language you like on demand, it becomes rather pointless to learn languages before you need them.

I did read a fic somewhere where the unbreakable was made more costly in that a certain percent of your magic would be tied up in the oath for the rest of your life. Like you'll be 5-10% less powerful after making the oath. Which is a decent way of explaining why it wouldn't be common, besides the whole "break it and die" threat.

  According to JK Rowling: "When we were editing 'Philosopher's Stone' my editor wanted me to cut the scene in which Harry, Ron, and Hermione fight the troll. Although I had accepted most of the smaller cuts he wanted me to make I argued hard for this one. Hermione, bless her, is so very annoying in the early part of 'Philosopher's Stone' that I really felt it needed something (literally) huge to bring her together with Harry and Ron."

So pet peeve: When authors leave out eleven year old Hermione's most annoying characteristics and have Harry befriend her straight away on the train ride or before that. I can scrunch up my nose and bear this if the rest of the story is good, but if this is accompanied by Harry disliking Ron for stupid reasons, that's a big red X right there for me.

I fully admit to be guilty of sticking too close to canon when writing a supposed AU, and am now trying to improve that, but there are some things that I see no reason for changing. Whatever else changes--Harry being a shrewd Slytherin, Harry being raised by Malfoys/Weasleys/the mafia/Sauron, Harry being abused to the point he cowers away from a hissing cat--if the AU doesn't change Quirrell (who has "a special gift with trolls") and still has him possessed by canon-style Voldemort (i.e. a Voldemort who doesn't have the forethought to say "Oi, Quirrell mate, you don't think it might be a tad suspicious to bring in a troll when everyone knows you've got a thing for 'em?"), then why wouldn't he bring in the troll on Hallowe'en?

****** I get what you're saying, and I'm not against people writing things differently, just that personally I think Quirrell/Voldemort need to be AU for it to be plausible in a story that's trying to go the ripple effect route, or certain other elements rather than just "Harry was raised differently".

But if Quirrell does bring in the troll, admittedly the reactions are limited to "go after it" and "leave it alone", and in the instance of Hermione-in-the-bathroom there's only so many ways of taking out the troll if Harry /does/ go after it. "Wand up the nose, levitate the club" is likely painfully overdone in fanfic, but I'm curious as to whether anyone's ever written it that Harry and Ron fail to subdue the troll, got knocked off their feet, and all three are just barely saved by the arrival of the teachers.

But he doesn't always have to go after it--he could tell a teacher or prefect, or he could just not know or care about Hermione being in the bathroom. The "levi-O-sar, not levio-SAR" incident is going to happen 9 times out of 10, but a more conscientious Harry may go after Hermione and talk her out of her sobbing fit before the evening feast, or if that incident doesn't happen there's no need for people to make contrived reasons to have Hermione in the bathroom at that particular time, which entirely eliminates Harry having a need to go after it at all. He could see Quirrell or Snape heading for the third floor, inform them that Hermione's shut in a bathroom somewhere and return to Gryffindor, then have to deal with the fallout when they ignore it and Hermione dies/is injured as a result, or with Snape going to save Hermione which then allows Quirrell to have a go at getting past Fluffy that night. I'm sure better thinkers than me can probably come up with a half dozen more interesting ways of dealing with it.

Also the turban is never mentioned when Harry first meets Quirrell in the Leaky Cauldron, but is remarked up at the start of term feast. "He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban." Specifically, a standlone sentance that draws attention to it, rather than a sub-clause of a larger sentence about Quirrell in general; we're meant to take note of the turban because, as later revealed, it hides Voldemort. If it was something Quirrell wore before the possession, he surely would have been wearing it in the Leaky Cauldron and attention would have been drawn to it then, alongside greater attention to Quirrell shaking Harry's hand to highlight the difference between then and when he's possessed.

** The ubiquitous "Ron holds Harry back in his studies or he would become super indy!Harry awesome" trope.

This is stupid for so many reasons. One, even if there was a hint of truth to it (insofar as any of us could get better grades if we stopped socializing altogether and spent all the time studying), Harry would be far worse off without a friend like Ron than with him. Second, Ron is just as intelligent as Harry in canon (only slightly worse off in DADA, level elsewhere, as his grades suggest) and most haters seem to conveniently forget that.

Third, none of the other two reasons fucking matter since we know it's false anyway. Harry indeed spent more time in Library with Hermione when he and Ron argued in GoF (Harry was also bored with only Hermione for company, but that's another issue entirely). I don't recall any sudden progress in Harry's academic career during this stage. If anything, it was the opposite. Harry constantly failed at trying to learn summoning charms, and the only person to as bad as him in charms was Neville. It was constantly mentioned how badly his classes were going during this period.

So, no. Harry ditching Ron for whatever contrived reason would not infact help his studies any. Cut that shit out ASAP.

There is no meaningful ambiguity in what she said. She identified the Unforgivables as a class, then used a plural pronoun. The pronoun alone, she could have misspoken. But, actually spelling out "an Unforgivable Curse", she almost certainly meant what she said.

I am not convinced that she was wrong in what she said. At worst, she was a little limited in her perspective.

Ah, yes, that bullshit. The chain of logic usually goes as follows:

1) """"Light""""" (or worse, gray) magic can be used for evil purposes.

2) Therefore, Dark Magic isn't evil, it's the caster.

Which is bullshit because Dark Magic includes such spells as the Cruciatus or the Imperius. Try to tell me there are legitimate, non-evil purposes for these curses. Go on, I'll wait.

Going off on a tangent, why can't Dark magic actually be fucking Dark magic for some people? It's in the fucking name!

I want to see Dark magic being forbidden knowledge, and for a good reason. I want to see it requiring such sadism that it crosses the line into black humour, I want to see magic so Dark and vile it outright sprints cross-country across that line /and then loops back to do it again!/

Give me deals with devils! Torture, murder! Freaky shit with rituals! Jaywalking!

And yet all fics with that kind of thing are either shit, abandoned, or I've already read them. Fuck. Such is life, I guess.

***** I mean, if you push hard enough, there /could/ be a bearable purpose for two of the Unforgivables. The Imperius could theoretically be used, say, if someone's about to walk off a cliff and you stop them. The AK could be used as a mercy death or something.

But those are admittedly massive stretches in a special level of pushing it. Especially the latter, because as per Barty Crouch Jr-as-Moody you have to mean it ('you couldn't even give me a nosebleed' or something along those lines if I remember correctly.) Really, the Imperius would be the easiest to put into acceptable terms albeit stretching. The Cruciatus I have no explanation for (and I don't think there is one.)

I too love fics with Dark, Dark magic. Sometimes, I love the explanation that grey magic can be as vicious and cruel as it could be thought in terms of sacrifice, but intent matters. (Example: a really, really gross ritual I remember reading about a long time ago involving the voluntary, extremely graphic and painful self-amputation of a protagonist to save a friend) But really, my usual personal definition of grey magic is magic like /reducto/, which has a clear destructive purpose but isn't always used against people.

***** Dark magic isn't forbidden it's just in the restricted section of the Hogwarts Library.

It's not saying that magic isn't cruel, because the inventor of the unforgivables wasn't thinking sunshine and daisies. It was just pointing out that even spells considered "light" can be used with cruel intentions. As others have pointed out one could use darker curses for other means, though the unforgivables, I believe require hate to fuel them, but no one hates in moments of self defense do they?

There's so little evidence for it, yet some people insist that it's canon.

Magical creatures vary wildly in how they are portrayed. You can't assume that centaurs rape people in HP just because that's what they did in Roman mythology.

There's also any number of reasons that Umbridge would have come out of the Forbidden Forest feeling traumatised. There's really no need to automatically jump to rape.

Sort of related, but when I was checking something in DH earlier, I noticed it said in The Prince's Tale that when Snape was called up to be sorted there were a dozen student left. By contrast, there were only three students left after Harry and there are only a few letters better P and S--it rather supports the theory of Harry's year group being small due to being war time babies, which was something I'd always seen as plausible but never really got behind.

That said, it's also at least slightly wrong because Dean Thomas would have been sorted after Harry but he isn't mentioned as one of the three. There is the one paragraph, talking about the staff, in between the cheers for Harry's sorting and the three students remark, but that could have been long enough only for Dean to be sorted and not anyone else.

And the things that are slightly wrong I've always put down to JKR being bad at math (as she has stated multiple times). I'd have to get my books out and reread to really speak to the Dean/numbering issue.

But yeah, neat numbers aside, it's not realistic. And it's the "Has to" that really gets me. Like, all five slots in all four houses must be filled, so instead of being sorted on their qualities, the students at the end of alphabet get sorted based on what's still available? Yeah. No.
