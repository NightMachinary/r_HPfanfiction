In canon, Severus was able to invent his own spells. Are there any fics out there where they go into this process in detail, or a character invents a spell of their own?

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable in the highly complicated and controversial subject of Spell Creation, a subject he soon becomes enamored with despite having to hide his interest from everyone. Besides, it's not like he's going Dark, after all.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] by The Santi goes into detail with this. It's not the main focus but is definitely featured.

***** this was basically my reaction when I found out about it a few months ago. You'd think that the author would have included an authors note or something on ffn telling people this ¯_(ツ)_/¯

*** I started this fic, but I've sorta stopped reading it because Hermione seems so overpowered, and it seems like the other characters put her on a pedestal. It's disheartening, because I loved it when I started. I wish I could keep suspending my disbelief...

*** It's entertaining but it also makes me sad -- it goes from actual math to essentially techno-babble; what could have been a wonderful chance to explain the intuition behind various concepts just gets tossed aside in a lightning quick mental calculation.
