Over the course of the past couple years I've been saving my favourite fanfiction stories and creating this google doc. I figured I'd share it with you all! If there's a really great fic that you think should be on the list, PM me and I'll add it!

*** Yeah, sorry about that! I tend to find fics by browsing through pairings or looking at my favourite authors, which doesn't lead to many gen fics. Are there any you'd recommend?

*** I know... I think that's the main shortcoming of my list, but it's just a list of my favourite fics and I don't really tend to read much slash and that usually results in Hermione being one of/the main character(s).

**** I don't read slash either but I dislike Hermione as a primary character in fics because authors usually make her a Mary Sue !

***** Sorry to hear that. I don't like reading fics with Hermione as a Mary Sue so most of my fics on the list don't have that kind of story.
