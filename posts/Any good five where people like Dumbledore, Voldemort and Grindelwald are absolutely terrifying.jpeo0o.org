I'm looking for fics where Voldemort could tear through the entire ministry by himself or where Grindelwald was an unstoppable madman who would have conquered the world if not for Dumbledore. I would like to read fics where Harry or another character has to step up and get to this level through a long journey.

Edit: SCREW YOU AUTOCORRECT! I miss spelled fics. Why!?

** linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

The story is Ron-centric but uses multiple POV's, including Voldemort and Dumbledore. Voldemort possesses children to escape the pain of his ethereal existence and do his dirty work, and at one point duels Dumbledore, where he causes an international catastrophe in order to escape. Later he possesses someone at St. Mungos and to cover up his tracks he kills everyone in the hospital and burns it down. People tried to fight back, even two Aurors, but they were no match for him.

In this fic canon events are accelerated and with greater stakes so Dumbledore is forced to get serious and go on the offensive. He leads the Order of the Phoenix on a strike against Voldemort and his forces at Malfoy Manor and goes straight after Voldemort, who he overpowers and would've killed had Voldemort not been saved last second. He also participates in a raid in Knockturn Alley that has been overrun by vampires which was inadvertently due to the international catastrophe he helped cause. He's a force of nature during the raid and single-handedly decimates the last of the vampires before they could overrun the Aurors.

The fic doesn't heavily focus on them but it is descriptive.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that in this fic it's Dumbledore and the House Heads that go down to the Chamber of Secrets to rescue Ginny and destroy the basilisk, only instead of just confronting the basilisk they also have to fight Ginny whose fully possessed by Tom Riddle and is extremely dangerous.

**** The fic itself is very lengthy, close to three million words and 126 chapters now and still in progress. It took me a few weeks to read and the events I listed won't happen until much later, like after chapter 50.

EDIT: Correction, the first event I listed occurred at chapter 61, and Voldemort is more vile than what I described. In the chapter he forces the kid he possessed to drink unicorn blood to stop the physical deteriorating his possession is causing on him. I think he also broke the kid's mind so that he wouldn't resist.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** Linkffn(The Mind Arts), linkffn(The one He Feared), linkffn(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament), linkffn(Phoenix Insurgent) and maybe linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries) all have elements of it, though in the Arcanist Voldemort is a very minor character at the moment and I am not sure if it will ever change, the bar is just a bit too high at this point for him to be a greater threat.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.
