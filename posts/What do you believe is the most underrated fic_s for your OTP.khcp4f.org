Idk if the phrasing makes sense bc I'm running on fumes lol but you get the gist. Mine is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/241474/chapters/371479][Reservoirs]] by Rosie_Rues. It's r/S and honestly I haven't read it in a while but I remember being really fascinated by the way it did world-building and how it handled it's character, especially Lily. Seriously, hands down one of my favorite characterizations of Lily to date. It was brilliant but I've only seen it recced like once.

*Summary:* /In the blazing summer of 1976, Sirius Black escapes from his family with information about Voldemort's latest plot. But Dumbledore is missing from Hogwarts and it's up to the Marauders and Lily to find out what's happened./

​

Anyways, what's yours? Multiple fics and pairing are acceptable, tbh I only posted one because it was the only one I could remember.


** New dramione story:

The Secret War

by njcov

Lucius tasks Draco with a special mission: "You will seduce the Granger girl. I don't care how you do it, I don't care how long it takes. Tell her you renounce your family, tell her you want no part in the Dark Lord's plan...tell her you need her help. You will make her love you Draco. You will win her trust, and then she will lead us to Potter.”

Check it out on A03 and FFN:

*** I just skimmed the last chapter. No apparent pairings, Harry, Ron, and Neville all appear to be good friends, there is an OC named Cassandra.

** Well, It's 'Too Young To Die'. If you could stomach the first. There is also a reason for why the Potter treated him like they did.

***** 'OTP' means "One True Pairing". It's a reference to people having certain romantic pairings that they will only read stories featuring. So when OP asked for "underrated fics for your OTP", they wanted people to say,

eg, "My OTP is Harry/Hermione, and I think What We're Fighting For is the most underrated fanfic featuring that pairing" (I think that one's pretty well appreciated, I can't think of an underappreciated one right now)

A "gen" fic is one where the main characters aren't involved in any romantic relationships, so there's no OTP involved.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

******* Eh, looks like you haven't gotten a lot of responses.

I'll say [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/4723][Magic Never Dies]], Harry/Hermione. Good Ron, Good Draco. I actually don't remember it that well but it's an attempt at book 7 written before book 7 came out, and it gives the wizarding world some scale, there's a set piece battle at Durmstrang... time for a reread.

I'm not sure underrated is right, it's just that with it not being on ffn, it doesn't get read as often.
