#+TITLE: Does anyone know any decent fics that are over 60k words and include a Harry that's has characteristics more similar to that of James and Sirius. So a bit but not overly cocky yet actually pretty smart as well?

Been looking for something like this for a while and would prefer for it not to have a Harry x Ginny pairing as that's always seemed wrong to me.


** It's incomplete and very AU, but Rogue's Bet by Hufflepunk linkffn(Rogue's Bet) is 78,000 words and has a Harry that is very similar to James and Sirius.

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

** Harry in linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI by Larry Huss) is like that, although he is not really the focus of the story.

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.
