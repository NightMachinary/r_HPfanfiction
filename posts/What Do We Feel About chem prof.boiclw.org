I was recently going through my favorite writers, and a thought came to mind, should I still keep chem Prof as one of them? He was the 2nd writer I read, and I genuinely like Harmony, but recently some of his writings have been too hard for be to read, as in I get bored easily. What are your thoughts?


** I like him. But that is entirely because I am 90% certain I know him.

** Personally, Chem Prof is hands down one of my favorite writers. That being said, yeah there's been a few stories that are rather slow, or easy to drop for other 'better' stories. But I will be keeping Chem Prof as a favorite just for the hope that there will be more.
