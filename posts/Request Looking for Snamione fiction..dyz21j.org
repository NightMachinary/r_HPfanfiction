I'm looking for a fiction I've read years ago; Hermione overhears a conversation between Dumbledore and Severus in HBP, his request to assist suicide. It's not Pet Project... has some similar plot point of “One Of Those Moments by Andie Baldwin”. Please let me know. Don't bother with hate comments or any complaints on the following. Just need a straight forward answer, thanks!
