** I'm enjoying it so far, except for the Ron and Ginny bashing. Well-written and well-paced, with lots of humorous bits to make you laugh when you're supposed to be in class paying attention.

Time travel fics are my favourite though, so I might be biased.

** I left the following review:

The multiple first person viewpoints are very confused.

Harry's internal monologue is not very good. Firstly, it reads as far too immature for a man who has had a long career and raised a family. He sounds like a teenager. Secondly, it's far too sarcastic, and far too chatty. It doesn't sound like Harry at all. Thirdly, it really dominates the narrative too much. For example, when he uses that fire spell on Voldemort, we have no idea what's happening. We're getting a load of Harry's inane internal ramblings, but have no idea of what else is going on in the scene.

In fact, the whole story could do with a lot more description. A lot of this is just dialogue occurring in a void.

Don't like the present tense narration. In addition, sometimes you accidentally slip back into past.

The combat was uninspired. You're basically treating wands like slow guns. You just have them shooting direct damage spells at each other - in many ways it doesn't even matter what the spells are. You certainly don't describe their effects. A good magical duel is dynamic. It should be like a sword fight, or a game of chess. People react to what the other person is doing. They adapt. It involves a lot more than puking up a "chain" of spells at the opponent. It's for this reason that I really hate the fanon idea of "spell chains".

The real "red X" moment, however, are the character interactions. The way everyone just sits back and a) does what Harry says or b) do nothing and watch him do shit. No. Children telling adults what to do is an instant "red cross" moment - especially if the adults then actually do it, rather than tell the child to shut up and go to bed without dinner.

In addition to those comments, I forgot to mention that the story includes the tired and terrible ideas of magical cores and magical exhaustion.

** It's the kind of fic that pays more attention to H/Hr post sex conversation (in a destroyed library, cause the sex was that good?) than Harry telling Hermione he's from the future. I wish I was joking.
