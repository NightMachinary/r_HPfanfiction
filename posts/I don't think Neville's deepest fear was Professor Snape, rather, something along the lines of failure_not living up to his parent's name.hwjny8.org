Sorry if this is obvious but I see people say "oh Neville was so brave to go to his class when it was his deepest fear!" I was thinking about it, and I don't think Snape was his deepest fear.

So before I get into it, here's two examples of deep fears being represented in a way that seems misleading:

So Remus's boggart is the moon, right? (Often mistaken for a crystal orb) But he's not scared of the moon, as shown by how calmly he flicks it aside with the word "Riddikulus". Instead I think he was scared of what he became, or maybe even himself. I don't think it's the moon.

Hermione's boggart showed McGonagall telling her she had failed everything. I believe that instead of failing all her tests, or even McGonagall being her deepest fear, it's something along the line of failure. How can you represent the feeling of failure? I think that her deepest fear was failure.

So now let's look at Neville's life up until his third year at Hogwarts. He is constantly tested to see if he's a Squib, and the incident where he was dropped from his heels from a tower leads me to think that his family wouldn't have liked or even loved him if he was a Squib. There's also a theme in Neville's life of being compared to his parents/grandparent, such as using his father's wand, or being forced to not take Transfiguration because Augusta failed it.

He is belittled and scared at every corner, and there's even the whole thing with Trevor: it's his proof of him being worth going to Hogwarts. Neville does not want to lose this ugly toad because it's probably his only consolation that he's even worth anything.

Let's now skip to the infamous first class with Lupin: right on the spot Neville is asked what his deepest fear is. There are three ways this could go:

1. He doesn't know that his deepest fear is really failure, and is scared of the mean teacher, so says that
2. Neville somehow knows himself inside and out and only says Professor Snape so that he doesn't sound "foolish"
3. He just panics and says Professor Snape, because he doesn't know what to say

I think it's the first one. I probably would do that.

Also, if Neville lived with his Gran for 10 years while she compared him to his parents nearly everyday, wouldn't he be scared of her? I think he was scared of her a little, but not as much as Snape, possibly thinking that his Gran didn't really know what she was saying, or even that she was trying to compliment him.

Meanwhile, Snape makes fun of his magic abilities and makes Neville feel like he wasn't supposed to go to Hogwarts at all. He makes him feel like he's failed his parents, known wide and long for their kindness and bravery.

So when Snape comes out of the boggart closet, I think that he was a representation of how Neville feared he wasn't living up to his parents.

(Sorry if this doesn't make tons of sense! I haven't fleshed out this theory very well yet)


** Yes, some or even most people's fears have deeper underlying elements, compared to just basic phobia but it's still significant that Neville's boggart turns into Snape rather than other numerous possibilities.

As far as the moon and Remus is concerned, Remus is obviously not thrilled about being a werewolf, but that doesn't somehow eliminate the possibility that thing he fears the most is the transformation process and that only gets triggered by the full moon.

I've always interpreted it as Remus hates being a werewolf, is always trying to fight the transformation every full moon (with the stresses of doing so causing him to prematurely age), and fears above all else the kind of damage he could potentially inflict while transformed.

** I get what you mean, but just saying something is your worst fear doesnt mean it actually is. I don't think you can trick a boggart, or theyd be way easier to deal with.

I think you're on the right track though - - i think Neville's worst fear could be one of two things:

1. He is afraid he isn't a good enough wizard/isn't magical enough. This manifests as the teacher who makes him feel this inferiority the most.

2. He is afraid of death eaters because of what happened to his parents, and he knows Snape was a death eater (the trials would have been highly public). Perhaps his grandmother didnt let him see much about his parents' torture so he's never seen a photo of Bellatrix or Barty Jr, so his brain substitutes Snape in as the only death eater he has seen.

Personally I think its the first one, but who knows!

**** I reread what you had said and i see what you mean now! you just mean why he chose to name Snape as his worst fear when Lupin asked, right?

i think its a mix of your 3rd point (he panicked) and the fact that he knows snape makes him miserable, but maybe he doesnt know /exactly/ why. Although he might, he does seem to be the introspective type!

****** mhmm! although this does get me thinking, do most people really have a grasp on what their worst fear is at 13 years old? like, what if lupin asked another student and they said 'i dunno, spiders?' and then bam, their boggart is their dead family or something?

** I've seen this argument before because Harry, Remus, and Hermione's were symbolic, and it's not at all impossible that Neville's was, too, but I don't really think so. If it was all about criticism or failure, it would be his grandmother. There's really no way to twist what Augusta and Longbottoms do and say to Neville while also keeping Neville's mind based in reality. I think there's even a line in OotP where Neville says his grandmother says he could be more like Harry.

I really just think Neville was scared of Snape. He'd just turned 13 and Snape often made him cry.

Edit: "Neville regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape made things ten times worse." - PoA narration

**** At the beginning definitely. He's generally scared of them: their look, their affect, and his inability to handle them, but I think it becomes more "fear of fear" or "fear of an inability to act in the face of fear" by the end of PoA and definitely in the maze.

** That's an interesting theory. I always thought Neville's boggart might reflect his fear of what happened to his parents. I mean, I doubt Neville knew what Death Eaters like Bellatrix looked like, and Snape was rumored to be a Death Eater, so I thought it possible his subconscious drew a connection there. Either way, I like the idea of the Snape-boggart being a totem for a deeper issue in Neville's life, like with Hermione's boggart!

** Harry's boggart was a Dementor and Lupin says "Your fear is fear itself" so the stories imply quite clearly that despite boggarts taking a physical form of the closest thing that could induce your fear, the concept of fear is quite abstract. Also Neville was just coming from a class where Snape had threatened to poison his toad.

** I've always believed that Neville thought that he'd never be as good as his parents, so instead of him being scared of living up to them, he just accepts it as the truth, a certainty.

*** The source material (the books) are written from Harry's perspective. Just because something isn't addressed in depth, or is shown from Harry's point of view and thinking, doesn't mean he cant be wrong or oblivious to some things. Harry can't read Neville's mind, and just because a 13 year old boy says something about what scares them doesnt mean they are telling the truth, or even that they fully understand it themselves... preteens aren't always the beat at sorting out emotions.

So saying that Harry's understanding of Neville's boggart is the ultimate true explanation is ridiculous.

****** ... Rowling didn't write in a narrator... but you don't understand basic writing forms, because Murikan education, so sure. FYI: being a poor writer - as Rowling is - is not the same thing as an unreliable narrator. You can find both poor writing AND unreliable narrators in any agony aunt sub.
