** When I read gof the first time I actually thought it was going to be norberta, and I was really disappointed it wasn't. However, I don't care how cool the scene would be, it's not worth doing unless there's a cutaway to malfoy, who has recognized the dragon somehow, going absolutely ballistic, and ranting and raving about how nobody believed him, but all of his foaming at the mouth is drowned out by the crowd.
