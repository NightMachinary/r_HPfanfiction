Sure I know Voldemort was big bad dark lord and bellatrix tortured people to insanity but none as bad as wormtail. His betrayal is the betrayal of highest kind. He betrayed everything marauders stand for. They took him in, included him in everything from pranks to animagus. You understand how big his betrayal is when Sirius says "Then you should have died! Died, rather than betray your friends, as we would have done for you." I can't imagine what James thought at the last moments when he faced with Pettigrew's betrayal. That's why I think Pettigrew is the worst.


** Easier said than done, I'd like to know how you would behave under torture by a sadistic Dark Lord.

Now if Wormtail betrayed his friends because he wanted to seek power and glory from the Dark Lord, then that would make him truly despicable. Unfortunately, we don't know whether he yielded under torture (or its threat) or committed the treason through opportunism.

However, I think it was obvious that he became a spy and traitor BEFORE James entrusted him to be the Secret Keeper. The Order had suffered serious losses and they suspected a spy (especially Remus) well before the Potters hid under the Fidelius. The last minute switch from Sirius to Wormtail was actually a result of that.

Another question is how long the time was between Wormtail becoming the Secret Keeper and betraying the Potters. My impression is that the Potters had been under it for several months before Voldemort busted in. If that was the case, then it would indicate Wormtail had indeed reservations about selling out James.

** I rather disagree. Bravery is admirable, but lacking it doesn't make you a bad person. Pettigrew was no more evil than so, so many other Hogwarts students who just never found themselves in a situation where their lack of a backbone resulted in someone's death. Pettigrew is certainly not /admirable/ by a longshot, but I find him more pathetic than loathsome; certainly nowhere near as bad as someone like Bellatrix who actually went out of her way to cause harm, as opposed to Pettigrew who was just too weak to say no when someone else /forced/ him into it.

**** Re: not saying he was a good man. But all the evil he did, he did out of fear. He didn't actively want to kill the muggles, he just did so because his diseased psyche saw it as an acceptable sacrifice to save himself. He didn't /like/ Voldemort, he just thought he was the only being left who would have both the power /and/ inclination to protect him from the entire rest of the Wizarding World which he had made enemies of. Again, this all makes him a villain, but one who is objectively less of a terrible person than Bellatrix, who commits atrocities for the hell of it because she finds them /funny/.

*** Being someone's secret keeper requires ultimate trust in them. It's not same as lack of backbone. James trusts him with not just his life but with lifes of his wife and son. Somethings can't be accepted by reasons like being afraid or coward.

**** I'm not asking you to forgive, I'm asking you to /understand/. I am not saying Pettigrew was unambiguously a good person. But he didn't go out of his way to kill James and Lily; he was just bullied into becoming a spy for the Death Eaters and it all went downhill from there. That is cowardice; criminal amounts thereof, perhaps, but still cowardice. Not actual malice.

***** Do we actually know the circumstances behind Pettigrew becoming a Death Eater? Is this something that was in the movies but not the books? I know Lupin and Sirius spent a lot of time calling him a coward, but that doesn't really seem like reliable evidence.

If we go by ultimate harm committed, Pettigrew is pretty much single-handedly responsible for willfully re-emodying Voldemort. Even if he started out purely out of fear - which I'm not convinced was necessarily the case - I don't think he would have gone back to Voldemort if he had no malicious intentions.

****** I'm not sure that he was actively and maliciously responsible for getting Voldemort back into a body. It's possible that after Peter got away from the Shrieking Shack he had an unlucky encounter with the wandering spirit of Voldemort. That bit of Voldemort managed to control Quirrell and it might have done the same with Peter and forced him to prepare the re-embodiment spell.

This might explain why Voldemort accuses Pettigrew of being motivated by cowardice even after Peter's seemingly gone through at lot of trouble. You'd think that if Peter had actively been searching for Voldemort then it would have been acknowledged in the graveyard scene.

******* Doesn't Voldemort mock him that he's such a coward he wouldn't be there if he had anywhere else to go? To me that implies he actually could have gone somewhere else. Or something like that - I wish I had my books with me.

Also, behold, I submit for your consideration Trewlaney's second prophecy, from the end of PoA, according to the internet:

"It will happen tonight. The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve years. Tonight, before midnight... the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant's aid, greater and more terrible than ever he was. Tonight... before midnight... the servant... will set out... to rejoin... his master..."

Unless that was supposed to refer to Barty Crouch Jr. or something? But the timing wouldn't make sense, would it? Hmm...

******** Great quote, I'd entirely forgotten there was a prophecy. So it looks like Pettigrew does choose to go back to Voldemort.

I looked up Bertha Jorkins (I don't have my books with me either) and it looks like she's the one who has the unfortunate random encounters, first with Crouch Sr. who mind wipes her knowledge of Crouch Jr., and then with Pettigrew when she's on vacation in Albania.

It's just strange that Voldemort goes back to Albania after PS/SS, and then that Peter somehow knows to go down there to find him. Why Albania? must be a magical place.

ETA: wait, now I'm not sure if they prophecy is about Crouch or Pettigrew either...Pettigrew wasn't really chained for 12 years, but Crouch was under the imperius curse. Hm. Need books.

** I agree with you that Wormtail is the worst character in HP, but mostly in the literary sense, not the ethical sense. We really don't know that much about him, or what motivated him to join Voldemort. I have never been able to write him in fic specifically because I can't come up with a narrative that includes all of his actions and everything we know about him and still makes sense, and I think a lot of authors avoid him for similar reasons.

Ethically, I don't think we can excuse him with just cowardice. Too scared of Voldemort to resist the Death Eaters? First of all, how did he get in that position? As far as we know all his closest associates are very anti-Voldemort Gryffindors. You can't say he didn't have any support to turn to. I guess he could have had Death Eater parents, but there's no real evidence of that. Secondly, he didn't want to betray his friends but was too scared to stand up to Voldemort? Refuse to be secret-keeper, problem solved. No reason to bring up you were ever offered the opportunity.

Personally I can justify /not/ doing something out of fear a lot more than I can actively doing something for the same reason.

He definitely loses any kind of moral high ground when he decides to flee to Voldemort instead of Australia post-PoA. And killing Cedric definitely didn't seem like the first time he'd used the killing curse, either.

I was personally disappointed with where JK Rowling took Snape's character in books 6 &7, but I don't think you can argue that Pettigrew is better than Snape. Calling your best friend a racial slur in the heat of the moment is not as bad as actively working to ressurect Voldemort. Being habitually nasty to children is not as bad as killing said children. Plus Snape legitimately seemed to have no support when he joined Voldemort.

Huh. So I guess I agree with you either way you look at it.

**** I find that highly unlikely, just in a geographical sense. Even Quirrel can't really be said to have had a purely random encounter - wasn't he investigating rumors of strange phenomena in Albania or somesuch? With the implementation that said strange rumors were caused by Voldemort's presence?

Also, see the thread above re Trelawney's second prophecy.

** On a personal level, I'd rate him above Lupin, who ran from his pregnant wife and never gave a single fuck about Harry, or Snape, who fucked over an entire generation because he couldn't get over not getting the girl he called racial slurs and then joined the magical SA-equivalent because that shows how much he regeretted that... /wait.../

Sure, Pettigrew betrayed people, but being afraid that Voldemort would win and not wanting to end up on the wrong side were valid concerns. If not for Pettigrew's betrayal and Lily's sacrifice, Voldemort would have won and then simply killed them afterwards. I am not sure if you realise it, but the resistance against Voldemort suffered casualties which would be considered catastrophic by any military standards. They were a few weeks away from total defeat.

Now if you want a good question, ask if it wasn't completly stupid of the Potters that they didn't catch British Airways 15 to Sydney. Especially considering the prophecy.

** Disagree. Its easy for us to say that he's a coward. But how many people will not succumb to joining the dark side when a threat like Voldy appears? He was cowardly. But he did not outright kill anyone. On the other hand, Bellatrix and the Lestrange brothers murdered many and sent Frank and Alice on a one way trip to St. Mungo's.
