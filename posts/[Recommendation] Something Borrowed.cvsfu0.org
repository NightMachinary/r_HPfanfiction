I know recommending a fic, especially something as niche as time travel stories, is usually not a good idea because everyone has different tastes, but the fic Something Borrowed is spectacular. It involves Hermione finding herself thrown back to the seventies (bear with me here), but she also finds that Snape has been thrown back too in his old body. They have to survive attacks from their pursuers - the true targets for time travel- and cobble together some haphazard excuse to get Hermione accepted into Hogwarts, and she poses as an estranged heir to the Prince fortune as a way of infiltrating future Death Eater society. The story features a very shrewd Eileen, who is different than most interpretations. Of course, it's much harder to fool the new DaDA Professor, Frank Longbottom, who seems to have a grudge against her, and Sirius Black, who can tell a Pureblood imposter when he sees one.

The story is well-written and has some great twists and turns. In the most recent chapter the authors finally explained how the time travel mechanics work and its pretty unique. Despite what the summary says, it's been twenty chapters and there's no romance yet if that's a turn off for you

**** Glad you like it too! The author's been talking about abandoning the fic, so I thought I'd let more people know about it before it happens!

  The odds of Hermione falling through time? Slim. The chances of a young Severus Snape recognizing her? Minuscule. Join her as she attempts to discover her purpose in the past. Sirius/Hermione, Severus/Hermione

** Just read through the posted chapters. I hope the pairing isn't putting people off it. So far, no romance but a really interesting dynamic between the main characters and a unique take of the deage/ time travel theme.

The villain plot is also surprisingly twisty. And I'm always for a good PTSD fic with magical complications.

*** Especially the part where they deal with long term effects of Cruciatus exposure. I thought that was really innovative.

But yeah, it was one of my favorite fics of 2018, I'm glad the author is updating again

  Blake's new neighbor is beautiful, gregarious, and definitely NOT interested in someone as boring as herself - no matter how much her imagination loves to think otherwise. Yang's new neighbor is gorgeous, reserved, and shy enough that she worries about being too forward...so she finds another way for them to get to know each other.
