Hello Everyone! I, like so many others have lost the name of a fanfic that I'd like to re-read, and turn to the ever present, all knowing forums. From what I can remember (it was quite a few years ago I read it), it's a story of how Sirius Black gets out of Azkaban(or escapes, don't remember) and adopts Harry (of course). What I can remember, in as much of a timeline as I can manage:

-Lord Sirius Black

-Sirius adopts Harry -> Lord Harry/Harrison Black/Potter-Black, Harry learns about his heritage

-Wizarding world and/or Hogwarts turn on Harry (might be set after Harrys second or fourth year because of this)

-Ginny, Twins, Bill and Charlie are on Harrys side

-Ron, Molly and Percy bashing

-Ginny is disowned -> Ginny No-Name

-Sirius adopts Ginny -> Ginny/Ginevra Black, becomes a lady

-Ginny is pushed down a set of stairs -> have to use a cane for the rest of her life bc some injuries are just to complex to heal even with magic (might happen before adoption, don't remember)

Arthur might disown his wife, Ron and/or Percy at some point, I don't remember. Sirius takes both Harry and Ginny under his wings and teaches them how to behave like nobles and be worthy(and good) Blacks. Harry and Ginny might be re-sorted into Slytherin for some reason, or not, but Harry and Ginny makes friends with Draco anyhow.

​

If any of you potterheads have stumled upon a story that even resembles this jumbled mess of thoughts, do tell me so I can continue with my life and studies. Both my professors and my boyfriend would be forever grateful, but most of all - you would save my grades.

** Faith by Dragongirl16? If the story you're thinking of has Celtic gods running around in it and a vision potion, then this one. It's definitely got all the other things you said, but it's not Sirius centric.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1318020/1/Faith][Yeah, I think it's definitely that one.]] Bill ends up disowned and a Black as well if I remember correctly.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
