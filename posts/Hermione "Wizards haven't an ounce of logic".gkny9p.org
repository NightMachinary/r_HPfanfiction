Also Hermione: "Of course one 11 year old who nearly died to Devil's Snare half an hour ago must be the one to take on Snape! I'll go back and look after Ron. It has to be you, because knowing spells and things doesn't matter at all!"

I actually face palmed when I first read that. I wish the thing had involved some sort of reason why it HAD to be Hermione staying back, like Ron being the only one in the right position on the chessboard and choosing to sacrifice himself, because really, Harry was right. Hermione was the smarter choice. Heck, I'd be happy if Hermione had just admitted she was too scared.

And while they could have gone to another teacher, why bother when one is obviously untrustworthy, another appears to be a coward, and the deputy explicitly tells you to mind your own business or else. They obviously thought it would be useless and that they had to do something.

Also, they suspected an other teacher, and thought that teacher was trying to bring back Voldemort (and on that part they were right, even if they had the wrong teacher).

Though, I've never quite believed Dumbledore ever actually left Hogwarts.

"“I don't need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently." From the conversation about the mirror of erised.

"“You got there? You got Hermione's owl?” “We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you ---”" from Harry's discussion with Dumbledore after quirrell's death.

Just a bit odd to be like "yeah I suddenly realized, for no reason at all mind you, that as the headmaster of Hogwarts I should probably be at Hogwarts." Especially since he's often not at Hogwarts, apparently.

****** Apparition most certainly was- Dumbledore is shown Apparating to the Dursleys', and the random wizards Harry meets growing up are always described as disappearing before Harry could get a good look at them. Presumably they were Apparating as well. Even if it had been established that you can't Apparate on the ground of Hogwarts at that point (not sure if it had been), it would still be much faster to leave, Apparate off the grounds, then Apparate back outside rather than broom ride all the way there. More so, even if Dumbledore didn't realize the danger the Stone was in (which seems like a huge oversight but from what he says that seems to be at least partially the case) and decided to take a leisurely broom ride to the Ministry, as soon as he realizes something was wrong then he should have Apparated right back. Which he might have, however he told Hermione (I think, maybe it was Harry) that he must have passed Hedwig "mid-flight," which implies he was flying a broom back. So either he was lying to them about how he got back for some reason, was speaking in an odd metaphor that makes no sense, or he really did fly a broom despite knowing about the danger at Hogwarts and there being a faster mode of transportation already established.

The whoosh of air as it blows against the hem of robes can become exhilarating as it rustles against against knobby knees and rickety ankles.

The author of this post goes pretty in depth over Dumbledore's master plan. Basically, Dumbledore needed Voldemort to be amazed at Harry as the child of prophecy to ensure he used Harry's blood in his resurrection. So he engineered a controlled scenario to do so. The poster claims that Dumbledore never left the castle during the climax of the 1st book and was likely in the mirror room during the climax, ready to merc Quirrell in case of the plan going off the rails.

** I dunno, Harry is definitely better under pressure than Hermione: with the troll she froze and with the devils snare she forgot she was a witch.. Also Harry was in charge, he talked them into it with the whole stop Voldemort or die trying speech. And he's more athletic, the most likely scenario off a first year going against an adult would pretty much look like a game of Harry hunting on steroids while hoping for help to arrive. I don't think knowing a few extra first year spells makes enough of a difference to compensate for that.

***** Sort of. They were in different situations.

Hermione did not choose to confront the troll. She was just moping alone, and then the troll showed up, and someone locked the only way out. Harry and Ron /chose/ to enter the bathroom and engage the troll. IANAPsychologist, but that seems like something that would completely change how a typical person would react to a given situation.

If either Harry or Ron had been been doing his business in the bathroom alone, a troll had wandered in, and someone had locked the door, it is not unlikely that they would have reacted similarly to Hermione. Similarly, if Hermione had seen someone in danger from a troll and had chosen to intervene, it is likely that her actions would have been more similar to Harry's and Ron's canon actions than to her own.

In the hypothetical case of Hermione taking Harry's place, it would be her choice, and so she would be less likely to freeze.

** As much as we like to analyse Harry Potter, theories ship and write fics, we can't forget that Harry potter is a kids book.

Especially the first few. The maturity and age group of the novels increase with the books. But it is important to realise that the characters are not meant to be realistic they are meant to tell a fantastical story of a little kid beating a powerful and experienced adult with the power of love.

I love HP and have gone down this road as well over thinking things. Like why not place a sonorous charm on a mandrake and poRtkey it into diagon alley? We can't hold imagine charecters to the same standards as normal humans.

** The word /logic/ has a number of related meanings. Hermione was using the more mathematical one: logic could be used to go from the propositions in the text of the puzzle and the arrangement of the potions to a conclusion about which potion did what. Not being in the habit of using this formal logic to reason, most wizards could not have solved it.

What to do with that conclusion was a different matter, and a different meaning of /logic/.

Now, the idea of Hermione going to confront Quirrelmort in Harry's place is a fascinating one, and I can definitely see her being afraid and rationalising in canon. I know of one fic---linkffn(The Mudblood's Logic by Cervantes Diderot)---that explores it. She justifies it by figuring that Harry is this big symbol of hope, whereas she is relatively expendable. However, fic quickly goes off the deep end, in my opinion.

  Hermione Granger was a a plain mudblood. At least until one rash action leads to her battling Voldemort first year and miraculously surviving. Stuck in a whirlwind of political ploys, fame, wealth and power along with assassination attempts Hermione has a rather difficult path. But what is that saying, "The ends justify the means," and she will do whatever it takes...

** I was 11 my first read through, and I didn't facepalm, but I was fairly astonished. My first thought was for them both to stay between the fires and tackle him when he came back through. Safety inn numbers type thing you know, but then I realized there might be a second exit so ok, maybe someone should go check.

My second thought was to send Harry back running for help because his history of 'Harry Hunting' probably made him the faster runner of the two and Hermione being smarter she might have a better chance to survive my favorite character of the book.

My last thought before reading on was, "why are you wasting time to look after Ron?! Go fetch a professor to save the rock and then grab Madame Pomprey to take care of Ron. Unless heroine studied healing that the readers didn't know about there wasn't a whole lot to she could do for him.

After finishing the book I had a thought that was funny to me. What if Hermione had went on to face Snape, and Quirrelmort tried to use her to get the stone, but she couldn't retrieve it because 'only those who wanted to find the stone but not use it could get it out of the mirror'. After all, as inquisitive as she is, would anyone deny that deep down she wouldn't want to find it, then "use" it to study? I could easily see her wanting to study it to learn more and replicate it if for no other reason to prove she, a Muggleborn, could. Possibly tempted to live longer to learn more, but that reason is a little more debatable.

** Another thought just occurred to me.

So, suppose that Hermione's the one to go ahead. Quirrelmort quickly subdues her, and tries to use her to get the stone out of the mirror. But, can she? The mirror would only give it to someone who wouldn't want it used, and Harry didn't.

Unlike Harry, Hermione thinks big. She might consider all the good she could do with the gold she could transmute. She might remember that her grandma and grandpa could use a rejuvination. She might want Nicholas Flamel to keep living, so that she could talk to him one day. Indeed, she might not covet the Philosopher's Stone for herself like Voldemort, but she would certainly like to see it used for good.

As a result, she is no better at getting it out of the mirror than Quirrelmort. What would happen next?
