I've read fics where Harry kept doing rituals to make himself stronger, and better looking, and looking like a thirty-year-old model while he's only thirteen or fourteen.

Write a short story duel where a genius, hard-working Dumbledore-esque Harry, finds himself facing against a Harry who has done lots of rituals to make himself stronger.


** "I have transcended human limits!" cried Lord Hadrian Potter-Peverell-Slytherin-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Gryffindor-Peverell-LeFay-Emrys-Black. "I can run faster than a cheetah! Lift more than an ox! Bed a thousand women in a night!"

"That's great." said Harry. "Did you pay attention in Defense Against the Dark Arts?"

"What? Of course not, my mind was on greater things. Rituals are-"

"Well, if you did," said Harry, "You'd know that magic is the best leveler in a fight. It doesn't matter how strong you are."

"STOP INTERRUPTING ME!" cried the asshole with more names than Dumbledore.

"Oh good grief." said Harry. He wordlessly raised a sound ward so he didn't have to listen to the ranting and then waited until the imbecile was truly to involved in his monologue to notice. Then he raised his wand. "Avada Kedavra." he said, almost tiredly.

The seven foot mound of muscle collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been cut. Harry walked up to the corpse. "Unless you have Horcruxes, there isn't a thing you can do against that curse but dodge." he said to it. "And you aren't in your own universe, so any hypothetical horcruxes you might have had don't matter here." It didn't listen. He sighed, and pulled his trunk out of his pocket. The specimen would be an interesting study, at least.

"Now about that dimensional rift," he murmured to himself. He was getting sick of having to kill off alternate versions of himself.
