I've had this idea rolling around in my head for a couple of months. I'd love to take a crack at writing it but I have already given myself more projects than I'll likely complete. So, I'll share it with you guys. It's kinda weird, so bare with me.

Harry Potter is the first human male with magical abilies to be born since Merlin. All other male characters in the series are female versions of themselves. I was leaning toward a harem comedy with a crunchy center of dramatic action.

The details I worked out in passing are as follows. Normally, only girls can be magical. Girls born to witches are usually witches too. Boys born to witches are always muggles. Occasionally, girls born to muggles are witches, as per normal muggleborn conventions.

There is a divide in Witching society. Some witches believe that breeding with muggle males leads to more male children and a tainted society. These witches, instead of seeking male partners, partner with another witch to create a magically inseminated, geneticly blended daughter. These witches are effectively the elitist purebloods that make up fem!Voldemort's power base. They want to fully separate the witches and muggles from each other to protect their culture.

The opposition are the witches that don't want to be told who they can have children with and muggleborn witches unwilling to give up the muggle parts of their lives.

Mostly the story would be a vehicle to explore genderswapped characters and put Harry in a harem anime situation. Please, discuss. Let me know if this has been done before.


** I had this idea but with a little twist : Harry is not the second wizard ever but the third, Voldemort was the second one. Merlin is revered because Merlin and he deeply fashioned the magical world but the magical matriarchy is still fresh of Voldemort's atrocities so Harry's arrival is met with mixed reactions.

*** turns out voldemort is a good guy in this timeline

as the only born male wizard in a thousand years every female wizard wanted to have his child

which meant during his time at hogwarts he was required to carry an antidote for love potions at all times or he would suffer for it

Voldemort's mission is too free all the people who are used as breeding stocks by the witches

******* I forgot to mention it in the post but I figured he'd be treated a little differently by the Dursley's too. Petunia would know that men can't be magical. They would treat Harry more nicely but with growing trepidation as accidental magic started happening. Maybe they would be in denial at first but that could lead into a feeling of betrayal when the letter arrives.

** I have considered this sort of concept, but I always end up hurting my brain with the timeline and last names and whatnot. With a change so far back in the past it'd be, for example, basically impossible to figure out what any non-muggle born's last name would be even if every witch in history somehow ended up with the same person they did in the OT. Sure, you can handwave this stuff (and for a haremfic, I guess my standards are being bit high here), but it feels less satisfying to me dammit.

I actually prefer the idea of having this be a very recent thing. With Harry's generation being among the first all/mostly female generation and the adults still being pretty balanced. That way you get a first hand look at how the society struggles to adapt to such a huge disturbance and I avoid hurting my brain over the timeline.

Either that, or just make this a completely original fic based off this premise.

*** I was leaning into that handwavium pretty hard but I see your point. I'm more interested in examining the characters that have been genderswapped. Just picking new first names for those characters that aren't too terrible is pretty hard. I don't want to think about rewriting history back 1700 years. As for the more recent demographic shift, I feel like it would still need to be three or four generations old to be significantly different from cannon.

The original story idea could be cool but one of my projects is already a novel. I'd love to read anyone else's original story based off this, however.

** +linkao3(Planet of Witches)+ /A world of Witches/ by zweltstein7 on AO3 sort of does this. However, men from magic families are squibs and still attend Hogwarts. They can do the theoretical stuff, runes, potions and even become animagi (Sirius Black is one), but can't do active magic. Not sure how many characters are genderswapped, but it's going the full harem route ala linkao3(Total Command).

Until Harry. Not that anyone other than the Sorting Hat knows it yet.

ETA: fixed title, but can't direct link. There hasn't been any sex that I remember, but it's stll rated E.

  Wixen come in many varieties. All are witchcraft users at their very core, connected by the thin strings of magical energy spread out across the planet like a great web of wires that cross but never tangle. But they are still separated.

  When quirks appeared, humanity dealt with the greatest power shift it had seen in millennia. The sudden change gave women powers never seen before, but men were left behind.As society changed, villains began to use their powers for cruel and selfish means. However, brave women rose to face the challenge, using their powers for the good of the people. It was an age of heroes.Now 200 years later, the rest of humanity began to catch up... and it all started with a man gifted with Total Command over every function of his body.
