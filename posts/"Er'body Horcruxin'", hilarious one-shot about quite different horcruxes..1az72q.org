** That's quite a cool idea. But insects work too? Then you could make, like, thousands of Horcruxes and be unstoppable.

  I suppose the "Horcrux" only lasts as long as the sacrificed creature's life would have been? So the Fly's will be good for about a day, after which he'd have either used it or have to make a new one. Fantastic idea. Would you mind terribly if I borrowed it at some point? It strikes me as something Hermione might come up with when she was doing research on Horcruxes.
