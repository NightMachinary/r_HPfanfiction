I recently read â€˜Exile' and I really liked it. Is there any more fanfics without romance with Draco as the main character?


** Seconded.

** The Code by Aduro is Draco focused. The first book doesn't have much in the way of any romance for Draco, but he does begin a relationship with a canon character in either book 2 or 3.

** Yes please! I can't seem to find anything without romance in it, like come on, he's cute, but I just want some good plot without having a ship with Harry or Hermione.

** "Time to Spare" by Emysabath features Draco and Harry traveling 20 years into the past and infiltrating the Death Eaters. There are no pairings. linkffn(2538955)

ETA: The perspective is still Harry's, though Draco is a main character.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

** linkffn(2538955) is an old favorite of mine. Due to unfortunate luck and bad planning from Voldemort, Draco and Harry get thrown back in time to the Marauder Era, and with no way to get home, end up having to take the slow path. Harry is technically the main character but Draco is present for essentially the entire story.

Neither Harry or Draco are involved in any romance iirc, including with each other. The main focus of the story is about their lives together as they go through the years. It was also written pre-deathly hallows so the most of it is canon compliant to the history of the marauders, but without the whole master of death plot line (for better or worse.)

** I just spent like 15 minutes trying to find this fic and I can't but I'm hoping someone else knows it. It's mad old so for all I know it doesn't exist anymore.

The story starts with Malfoy confronting Dumbledore to try and kill him and Dumbledore offering him a way out. Which turns out to be a portkey to Lupin's hideaway.

The story is basically Malfoy hiding out with Lupin being his usual douchey self while also coming to terms with Lupins lyncanthropy. It's kind of a "growing up" story for Malfoy with Lupin as a catalyst. I remember really liking it because the characters were very true to their natures. Malfoy in particular toed that perfect line of unlikeable brat and scared clueless teenager and it all plays well together.

Can't think of the name of it though.

** The following is a massive favourite of mine. It is canon and epilogue compliant so there is Draco/Astoria but IMHO it was character rather than romance driven. linkffn(The House That Cedric Built by Anna Fugazzi)

  Draco didn't think there was much reason to hope for a better future. Astoria proved him wrong.
