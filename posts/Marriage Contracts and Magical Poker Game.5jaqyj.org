I'm looking for fics about magical contracts between Harry/Female. I realize that there are a couple like "Amalgamation agreement and Grass is always greener, but I'm looking for all kids of this particular genre.

Also I once read a fic where Harry wins a bunch of girls in a poker game I think the author was called "Enterprise" are there any similar fics?

Thanks in advance for the help.


** The Poker Game is here: linkffn(4081016)

It's decently funny and rather absurd at times.

  Draco organizes a no-holds-barred poker game. Harry decides to compete... just a little fun fic co-written by Joshua. I might or might not write more on this.

*** It is as you say, but I was actually wondering if there were any other fics like it in the fandom?

** If you filter the fanfiction site for Daphne Greengrass then about a third of the stories are marriage contract stories. A few. Linkffn(9750991) linkffn(4079609) , linkffn(5598642) and linkffn(9774121) all have that theme.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
