:END:
Hi everybody,

I'm trying to find this fic that I read a while ago that was a Ted/Andromeda fic.

I remember that Andromeda was with Evan Rosier, and that Ted was a member of the order. Also the order raided a Death Eater meeting that Andromeda was at, and Ted got injured? Sirius was also there, but he was just a second year student, and helps create a diversion when Ted and Andromeda run away.

Does anyone remember this?

Thanks!


** omg I've read this too but i can't remember and now it's going to annoy me too till i find it
