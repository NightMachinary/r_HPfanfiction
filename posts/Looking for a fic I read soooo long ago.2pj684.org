#+begin_quote
  Harry goes into Ginny's room one night and forcibly has sex with her. Not entirely rape, but not entirely consensual.
#+end_quote

How is non-consensual sex not rape?

*** It's still rape I guess, but I'd say there's different levels of consent.

Don't get me wrong, I'll not be having any type of nonconsentual sex.

**** Still not sure that I see this as a continuum. It's consensual or it's rape, pretty much an either-or thing.

***** I can see a scenario in which I really don't want to have sex with somebody, but I would anyway because of extreme arousal or some such.

** Try the fourth bullet point under Useful Links in the sidebar.

Much easier if you can guess what site it was.

*** Thanks for the suggestion. Although somehow through a stroke of pure chance I just remembered it was on checkmated, but I can't remember the actual URL. Has that site been shutdown?

**** Ah yeah. Tough luck man.

Sites been down for a long while I think. It's a shame how many stories have been getting lost without any archiving.

****** Ah thequidditchpitch. For all my shipping needs.

I think this is the only other website besides fanfiction.net and occasionally archiveofourown that I am comfortable navigating.

Neat series! I see there are two ron/hermione and fred/angelina companion pieces. This will keep me entertained for a while. Good find!

***** :(. Well I'm still holding some small hope that it may have been posted elsewhere, and somebody else knows about it. I'm not holding my breath though.

** I'm not sure if this will help, but I vaguely remember that I may have read it on a forum that had a dark green green background similar to DLP? Sound familiar to anybody?
