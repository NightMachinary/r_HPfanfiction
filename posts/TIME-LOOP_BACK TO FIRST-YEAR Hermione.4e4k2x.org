Does any know any good time-travel fics with Hermione traveling back to her first year or different year in the 1990-1997 period and changing things? Hermione is often a target for time travel but she oftens is sent to the marauders era or Tom Riddle's era rather than Fix-it/peggy-sue kind of time-travel

  Hermione gets some of the answers early. She has trouble understanding what all the questions are.

***** An unfortunate accident, then, I see.

Sorry, I tend to assume that everyone checks their messages for stuff like that, and thus it's a result of not knowing when it happens.

** linkffn(Kick in the Arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa) is the same general idea as /Palimpsest/: Hermione sends herself a message back in time.

  Hermione life suddenly changes, courtesy of an experiment conducted by herself from an alternate, future universe. You'd think messages from the future would have more then vague hints and a headache. Or was that from fighting the troll. CH1-3 Beta-ed.
