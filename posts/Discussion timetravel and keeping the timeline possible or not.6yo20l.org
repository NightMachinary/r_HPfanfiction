I have recently started rereading several timetravel fics and i started wondering, why the hell do authors try so hard to maintain the timeline? If you are sent back from the future and have to redo your life, lets say from 11 years old. How can a mature adult possibly act like an 11 year old again? And then theres the whole future knowledge, you know everyone, whos good, bad, who slighted you, who supported you. You will be more open and friendly consciously and subconsciously towards those you already know are trustworthy, and vica versa. Harry is more friendly towards susan bones? She might tell her aunt about his shabby clothing because she suspects abuse. Harry ditches ron and studies more? All the little elements, the words used, the conversations, body language and so on will influence the people around you, will change things. Any changes at all will influence the timeline in some way.

So is it even possible to avoid changing the timeline?

(This isn't a discussion of why the authors does this, (i myself am more of a fan of "screw the timeline" fics) but the feasibility itself)

The farther you stray from canon, the more you actually have to write/plot.

But to address your actual question, no, I doubt it would be possible to avoid changing the timeline for anyone who went back in the past. A character from the future who ends up in a "do-over" fic would be so far removed from who they /were/ that they couldn't hope to replicate it as they /are/. Mistakes would be inevitable.

... and considering that the whole point of going back is likely to change something, why bother preserving anything at all in the first place? The past has already been mucked with by the mere act of time travel.

** Well in most writings there are two schools of thought about time travel.

The first is that you cannot alter the past and that everything will generally unfurl the same way regardless of your interaction with the past.

For example - Man loves woman. Woman is killed by a mugger. Man invents the time machine to save her, goes back in time and walks down a different street to avoid the mugger, but now she is killed by a runaway car. He tries again and just stays with her in their home but she slips in the shower and breaks her neck - despite his actions the outcome will always be the same because if she did not die he would never have invented the time machine. The timeline is FIXED - we see this illustrated in the original 12 Monkeys movie.

The other is that the timeline is in FLUX and that by changing the past you create a new future (well, new futures as each change then creates spin-off choices which again create new alternate realities). Similar to what happened in the film "Sliding Doors" where we see two of these diverging timelines where the point of divergence was whether the protagonist caught or missed a train. The one who caught the train discovered her partner was cheating on her which started one chain of events. The one who missed the train did not get confronted immediately with her partner's infidelity and the arc of her story is therefore different. Another obvious example of this would be The Butterfly Effect.

I don't think either choice is better for plot/story purposes. Either can be done in a meaningful and impactful way. The key is to be consistent in your choice - if the timeline is fixed it's FIXED the key beats that are revisited must happen - but preferably seen from a new perspective or in a way that its context puts a different spin on how the time traveler viewed "history".

If the timeline is in flux then history will be totally remade and the traveler can only rely on what they know of the /character/ of the historical figures they interact with in order to be able to predict the outcome.

So I guess the TL:DR here is, yes it would be possible if the time travel is within a story universe where the timeline is fixed but not if the travel takes place in a story universe where the timeline is in flux.

** I mean I suppose to answer your question in a very black and white way; Yes it is POSSIBLE, but as you highlighted it would be insanely difficult, I mean horrendously difficult, to try and do everything almost exactly the same as you did originally.

Now from a more literal stand point, maybe. Just maybe. It would take either multiple people going back in time together, and being fully aware of the others that went back aswell, or the one(s) that went back being able to successfully convince the core group that they had indeed come from the future.

If they were able to pull either of those things off I think it is POSSIBLE for someone smart enough to keep things relatively similar to the original timeline, but it would take a huge group effort and coorporation to do so. You'd need to keep everything as close to original until the point you needed/wanted to change.

Finally, if the time travel you're referencing is same as timeturner time travel from cannon then I suppose you could just hide somewhere extremely secluded until you needed to edit the timeline. That said starting any kind of talk about the timeturner canon time travel opens up all kinds of paradox's and plot holes so I don't even want to get too deep into that idea. Basically because in that world, the problem would have never happened, but at the same time it would have happened so that you could fix it and have it never happen? Idk timeturners are actually the dumbest thing ever.

Just my thoughts, I'm probably stupid and wrong but thought I'd share nonetheless.

Hope this helps.

*** Would not call you stupid or wrong, as you had good arguments, as i agree with you that it could be possible to remain somewhat close to the timeline, and just hope that the main big events come about the same way. But if Harry is smarter and doesnt dumb himself way down to his 11 year old self, then wormtain might know he is smarter and warn voldy, making him more careful, aggressive, or kidnap him differently, might make wormtain flee sooner, anything can happen when secondary characters react differently to different circumstances.

And wasnt really going to mention the deux ex of timeturners, seems really broken! But more in the line of real timetravel. (Harry potter and the quantum leap for example, or deaths pride -or any of the death sends harry back fics)

**** Well when I said "if someone is smart enough" I was more insinuating that they would be smart enough to look dumb enough? If you know what I mean. I do understand what you're saying about secondary characters changing the timeline significantly, that's why I was trying to stress how difficult it would be to keep it the same. A change so minor as just taking a different route to the same place you went in the original timeline could, via the butterfly effect, change everything.

We could discuss this all day to be honest, and I'd love to. That said I don't think we'd ever come to a conclusion that satisfied even just the two of us, let alone the population at large. I'm not sure we'd really come to any real conclusion at all to be honest. Not that it would put me off the discussion in any way.

When it comes down to it, despite everything I said originally, in theory I suppose it is POSSIBLE. In practice probably not, heck something as trival as tying your shoelace differently could cause you to trip, someone may see it, laugh at you, cause others to come and look etc. etc. everything would change from then on.

Personally when I read timetravel based FF that tries to stick to the original timeline I just turn off any logical part of my brain and just enjoy the story for what it is, just a story. Digging any deeper just seems to frustrate me.

Two things, primarily. Keeping the canon timeline means the author doesn't have to come up with an original plot. Second, it's often rationalized that the characters can predict their enemies more reliably if the timeline is as close to the original as possible.

** Even if you were trying hardcore to do everything the same, there would be countless things you didn't even remember doing that you would do different. How much do you remember about the year you were 11? Granted, most of our lives haven't been as eventful but I wouldn't even remember my class schedule and half the names of the kids in my grade let alone day to day things.

** If the author chose a time turner as a method for time travel, then it makes sense to avoid changing what the person already knew about. But then the time traveler could change aspects that they didn't already know about.

If the author choses another method (veil, potions, rituals, spells), then I feel like its fair game to change the events.

The easiest option would be writing something similar to the timeline.

** Just find an out-of-the-way corner and Obliviate yourself of all your future memories. Or, if you have a perfect memory, good acting skills, and tons of patience, you can try to mimic your past actions exactly. With strange rituals you might be able to combine the Imperius with a Pensieve and force yourself to act just as you did in the past.

If you're bodily moved into the past, you can Apparate to the sun or conjure a ship and sail into the middle of the ocean and drown yourself, thus maintaining the timeline.
