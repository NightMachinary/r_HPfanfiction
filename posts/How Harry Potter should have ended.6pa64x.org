Imagine this! Voldemort and Harry are having their battle. Voldemort kills Harry, then Neville comes out of the crowd and casts AVADA KEDAVRA and kills Voldemort, revealing after all he was the chosen one. Then he runs to his body to retain the elder wand from Voldemort (who possessed it from Harry) and kills Bellatrix and finally gets justice for his parents. Then it fades to black and shows Neville throughout all the films always being in Harrys shadow and always being doubted by everyone. After this, it shows a black screen saying, 25 years later, showing Neville as the minister of magic, married to Ginny Weasley, sending his child off to Hogwarts.


** Meh.

** Nah - because the person who doubted Neville most was:

NEVILLE HIMSELF (!) - sure his family layed the groundwork to that (bunch of abusive assholes, almost as bad as the Dursleys!) and people like Snape and Malfoy used that to make fun of him, but over all? He was the one who doubted his own skills (well: His father's wand "helped" (to keep him down)! His grandmother really is a bitch IMHO)

I'd really rather have had a normal hero's journey, where Harry gives his all (he might still die and only live because of Dumbledore's plan, but at least he really tried...this is what I hate most about the character: He's a stupid idealist unwilling to work for his greatness and hoping that self-sacrifice will be enough :( )

** Neville is over glorified for no reason. 'OMG he killed that snake' is his only achievement in war. Let that man rest.

Breaking the elder wand was really stupid. Harry was equal to Voldemort. Nicest twist would be Harry winning that war, taking everyone powerful position (like Dumbledore) and saying 'Fuck you all for leaving me at mercy of muggles'.

It's certainly better than settling down with a fan-girl whose only redeeming quality was that her red hairs reminded Harry of his mother.

*** well, Neville also lead DA in Hogwarts when the Trio was hunting for Horcruxes. And Harry didn't snap the Elder wand in books, he put it back to Dumbledore's tomb.

**** They had same abusive childhood. Both survived AK. Both were destined to be slytherin. Both were halfbloods.

In battle of will (brother wand business) Harry and Voldemort were at stalemate.

Even at the end they both were equal in power. Harry won on technicality (which is based around a plot hole regarding ownership of elder wand).

When did Tom Riddle survive the AK?

But none of that means Harry was equal to Tom in power..just in plot points..there's was nothing that proved that Harry was as powerful as Voldemort without all that plot armor getting in the way

****** Curse was reflected back at Voldemort. Voldemort should have died but didn't because of Horcruxes.

Yes, they were plot armor. But they are part of his skillset now.

****** Harry was equal in power, it was show in various moments like the cemetery or the battle while flying. What Harry lacked was skill and knowledge, which luck (hemhem plot armor) ignored.
