Does anyone know of any good fics that feature Sirius as one of the main characters? I'm not picky about time period, ships, length, anything like that. After reading The Debt of Time, I've become more interested in fics with him. I just haven't found anything I like on my own.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  September 1974 and Remus goes a bit loopy, what with the moon, and the teenage wolf, and his friends who are not Animagi yet, and the creepy dead thing that is following him around.Sirius had a horrible summer, too.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

  Sirius had made a slew of different decisions that night he had arrived at Godric's Hollow. With Sirius' focus on Harry rather than revenge, a very different Boy-Who-Lived is going to make his return to the wizarding world at the age of 13. But the question is, why did Harry return so late? And will he still be the Hero the Wizarding World needs? Haphne! AU-ish, slightly mature!

** /A Bad Week at the Wizengamot/ a crack-fic, or at least a comedy, but the second chapter centers around Sirius Black.

/A Marauder's Plan/ involves Sirius, rather than going on the run to hide somewhere tropical, remaining in Britain to stay in

/Promises Unbroken/ is a story based on the idea that Sirius and Peter never switched as secret keepers, and it all goes from there.

Also, someone just posted this request yesterday so there are some more suggestions [[https://redd.it/gp0xnd][*here*]].

** I've just started reading The eighth Weasley, it's still being updated but it's pretty regular updates and I love the OC! it's kind of dark but also really sweet! It's an AU if that's your thing, but it's not too out there! I'm loving it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24214726/chapters/58333537]]
