Im curious if out there are Fics that have a Canon fitting Bella and Harry, but she manages it that he gets attracted to her. I can imagine that this would be easier if Sirius death either not happened or very late or from some other Person. I dont really want Harry to be corrupted, just that he is getting (sexually) attracted to her, if thats even possible without getting corrupted. Maybe it would cause a twisted Harry. Sex scenes are no Requirement, but i would welcome them, atleast there should be sexual tension.

I know there is Ouroboros, but as much as i enjoyed the Sex parts, its to Dark for what i want to have with this Request. So i would avoid Torture scenes. There is also this other Fic that have Bella and Harry are trapped in another Dimension and forging a Contract or something. For what i looking for, i would like them to stay in the Canon Universe, Time or Dimension travel can still happen, but it shouldnt be the Focus and the dwell times shouldnt take so long.

In the Canon Universe the process of said Canon can however be take a different Course, like maybe the 2. War dont happen at all or Bella (and maybe Harry) dont participate in it.

I would like the Characters (especially Bella and Harry) to keep in character as good and long as possible. So at one Point when Harry realizes that he is attracted to Bella he questions himself. I would be Curious to Read his thinking.

Whether Bellatrix keeps her Canon-like appearance or decides to return her old Beauty doeant really matter, maybe the Ahtor decides to describe her as a Beauty, despite looking like an malnourished ugly Hag. But maybe she attempts to regain her old appearance, when she actively wants to manipulate/tempt Harry.


** i second this! sounds like it could be very good!
