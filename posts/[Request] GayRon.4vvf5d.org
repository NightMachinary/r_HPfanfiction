Hey y'all!

Could anyone give me some recs for Gay!Ron? Preferably fics where he's a main character as well. Pairing isn't important as long as it's not incestual. Same for genre- I'm trying to expand my tastes right now so anything is fine. I've read just about every Ron/Draco fic on the internet, but if there are any obscure ones (e.g. not on ao3 or fanfiction.net) please rec them! No Drarry, please.


** Have you read "No Hiding Place" by Rimau Sua Lay? It's primarily Harry/Snape, but the secondary pairing is Ron/Draco. It's long, over half a million words, written before HBP so it doesn't follow canon, but it has a wizarding air force. :-)

*** Keep us posted. I've searched long and hard for slash fiction that isn't harry/malfoy, harry/Snape or harry/TMR and my rate of success was pretty low

**** yes, all the ones that I have found so far are all Harry/Draco or Harry/Snape and sometimes Slytherin!Ron/Snape. Definitely not what I was looking for. I may need to break out the old laptop for this one.

***** linkao3(the cartographer's craft) was a pretty good harry/sirius fic where the marauder's map was, somehow, like Tom Riddle's diary and Harry summons a 16 year old copy of Sirius. That's the one I was able to find. There's obviously wolfstar!, too.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.
