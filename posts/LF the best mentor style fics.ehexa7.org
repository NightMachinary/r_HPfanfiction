** Albus and Harry's World Tour linkffn(13388022)

Ongoing. Harry 'dies' in the Chamber of Secrets, then wakes up. With the horcrux gone, Dumbledore no longer feels any need to keep Harry at arms length. Albus takes a sabbatical and becomes Harry's personal tutor for the low price of 1 knut a year (he hasn't directly taught in years and is horribly out of practice).

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
