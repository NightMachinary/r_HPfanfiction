** A ton of bashing issues come from the fact that the early Harry Potter books were children's books and not really supposed to be held up to heavy scrutiny.

The Weasley's talking loudly about the platform is a cute way to introduce important characters while adding to the wonder of the magic world. Walking through walls? How neat. However, apply higher standards to the scene and all of a sudden it makes no sense. She has tons of children, and has been doing this four times a year for at least 11 years straight, plus when she went to school. She is also talking loudly about things that shouldn't be talked about in front of muggles. Most people ignore things like the fact that a muggle train station would be very disorienting for a mother with 5 children to look after, or that she might have been doing something silly to keep her young children occupied. The only logical conclusion is that it is a devious trap to indoctrinate Harry.

Next we have Ron sitting with Harry. People have crunched the numbers, there is no way in hell that "Everywhere else was full". Clearly this is another ruse to make Harry fall in with the Weasleys. Except that JK has been proven time and time again to be bad at Maths. Also, it's a children's story, she just wanted a way to introduce Ron.

We also have Molly pulling money out of Harry's account without him being with her. They must be stealing from Harry! Also, yes, looking back this is odd, but JK had already written about the bank and had no need to rewrite it, so she just had Molly do it.

The personalities are another thing. Molly is a caring, worried mother figure. Her not wanting the kids to be involved is a normal, even logical thing for her to do. It would be weird for her to want her children involved in the war. Arthur was supposed to be a fun eccentric father figure, unfortunately when looked at in the right way he is kind of demeaning and offensive..... again introduced when it was more of a children's novel. The twins were fun loving pranksters.... who when viewed in more adult eyes, are clearly bullies.

The rest is usually from Ron leaving Harry in 4th year and 7th year.People don't like ugliness in their stories, and the fight in 4th year was pretty realistic. The one in 7th year was a bit more melodramatic.

TL;DR The Weasley's were introduced in a less serious children's novel, and were not treated well when looked at in a more serious setting.

*** The whole "everywhere else is full can't be true because maths" thing really ticks me off. Like, when I was eleven and I couldn't find a specific Lego brick for ten minutes, I would declare it lost, not search through every single one of the thousands of Lego bricks until I found it.

Ron could easily have not found any free compartments from where in the train he got onto the carriage and Harry's compartment, and declared "everywhere else is full" because to him, every other compartment he'd seen so far might already have been full. He might've only seen compartments at one end of one carriage, but such a statement in that context would still be true.

The whole thing about it being a lie to ingratiate himself with Harry (usually on Manipulative! Dumbles' orders, too) is just /beyond/ tenuous.

It's a collection of short one-shot drabble thingamajigs, one of them is Ron's perspective on finding a seat on the Hogwarts Express.

In a nutshell, yes, he lied, there were free seats in the other carriages, but he looked scruffy and everyone else looked neat and he was embarrassed. And then he finds Harry who's messy-haired and misfit clothes and who looks just like him.

** Molly can be very annoying, and ticks off teenage readers who have similar overbearing mothers.

A few months ago, [[/u/taure]] ran a survey here and it turned out Ginny's core haters are teenage girls. They must have bad experiences with similar RL persons. (Unsurprisingly, Ginny's biggest fans are among teenage boys)

Ron's betrayal in Book 7 ticked off many readers across the population segment. I was initially in the same camp until my reread. Now I'm convinced it was mostly Locket induced, because minutes after taking that thing off, Ron regretted deeply and wanted to go back. Only circumstances prevented him from doing so. And it was Harry who came up with this utterly INSANE and STUPID idea to put a Horcrux around their necks.

A lots of Weasley bashing also stemmed from readers' hate of Dumbledore and their loyalty to him. H/G shippers bash other Weasleys just as often as H/Hr ones, with Brennus and kb0 leading the pack.

*** To add on, when I was a teenager (a while ago, while the books were being published) one of the common threads at the time which led to dislike of Ginny in general was that the idea of her winding up with Harry in the books was just too cute. As in, it was too easily telegraphed. There was also the feeling that her character literally came out of nowhere and that the story line with Harry felt 'forced' in some way.

As I got older and reread the books I've discovered I have little problem with Ginny, Ron, or any of the Weasley's in general. Molly caring so much about Harry became more endearing than overbearing the older I've become, and is one of the more powerful aspects of the book for me (contrast Voldemort growing up without anybody loving him unconditionally, with Harry's best friend's mother instantly accepting him as one of her own).

Most other complaints I held/had about the family have similarly disappeared. You realize that the characterizations of the family at the beginning of the story are 1) as part of a children's story, and 2) seen through the eyes of Harry who is not an unbiased or entirely reliable narrator.

**** I didn't like Ginny because there wasn't that much we knew about her, and it felt like it was just an obsession (like when she was younger), because she was obsessed with Harry Potter from when she was young so it felt like why should it change? Also the chamber incident would have led to more obsession.

** Before I got into fan fiction, I had no issues with the Weasleys. Made sense since I was just reading the series for pure enjoyment and through Harry's eyes they were all great (save Percy).

It's only when I started reading fan fiction where I discovered that there are some legitimate reasons to dislike some of them. Ron is the easiest since he abandoned Harry twice and probably did hold him back a bit.

I understand the hate for Ginny purely on the basis of wanting Harry with someone else. You need to make Ginny unlikable in your story provided it followed canon up until when your story takes place.

Arthur generally comes across as affable and sympathetic even with other Weasleys are bashed. Same with the twins. In nearly every H/G story, the twins are cool with them from the get go, as is Arthur. It's really Molly and the older brothers who have the issue.

It's easily understandable why this seems to always play out the same: it's a combination of using existing canon and exaggerating the character traits and easily-created conflict in a story that desperately needs some.

Let's look at H/G stories that are heavier on the romance. The author generally wants H/G to have this great relationship, but the problem is a great relationship does not make for an interesting story. So in order to protect H/G, what the author does is create conflict by having Molly (and the older brothers) be an obstacle for them to overcome. And the author can get away with it because while they would have to exaggerate her character, there is canon-based evidence to support Molly being the obstacle. She is overbearing, controlling, stubborn and a "my way or the highway" type of mother. Of course, in the series, these traits are present but played down in favor of amplifying her positive attributes. The fanfic author merely subverts things to play up the story.

Percy is too easy to not bash. He was basically bashed in the actual series so the author might not be bashing his character so much as being consistent with the original series.

Ultimately, I think in a lot of stories it is less about having an axe to grind with certain Weasleys compared to it being an easy way to manufacture conflict without going too far off canon and out of character.

** Hmmm... where to start? Arthur seems to be a very weak father figure and ineffectual. Molly... Molly seems to thrive in fandom mostly on what she's supposed to represent, not on what she actually does. I'm still looking for relevant parts in the books where she actually does anything to help Harry - excluding big talk ("Oh why did you rescue Harry with Arthurs flying car, we could have done something" - yeah, right, suuuure Molly). The only thing she does is get rid of Bellatrix and in terms of writing that clearly should have been Neville or maybe Hermione.

Personally I like the Twins, especially because they may have flaws, but they actually do something (as opposed to their matriarch), so I give them a pass for some of their flaws. I think there are some valid arguments that they are at least in part responsible for the poor state of Ronald though.

I don't have to say much about Weatherby right? He's an arse.

Bill and Charlie I have nothing against, but they draw a strong picture of a family that is much more dysfunctional than it seems from Molly's projection.

As I said in another comment I believe the Twins could have been much more successful (both academically and in business) if they had a strong father figure that encouraged them, but also showed them limits for their attitude. Their rebellion seems mostly directed against their mother and they have a hard time growing out of it.

#+begin_quote
  I can't really think of a single situation where she could have actually "helped" Harry without overstepping her bounds as his best mates mother, other than Book 5.
#+end_quote

I think you make some fine points, but they strike me as too apologetic. Some people act on hunches, or try to inquire if something strikes them as ... unusual. Everything surrounding Harry could encourage her to investigate his home life, his education (Snape!) or anything else.

Harry has very few people (besides his Godfather) who's 'genuine' place it would be to be his advocate, but I can promise you I wouldn't be criticizing her if she ran into Privet Drive with blazing red hair and yelling at the Dursleys or maybe sneaking food into his locked bedroom or just helping him along in any other way (she seems to be a very skilled duelist if she can keep up with Bellatrix, why didn't she offer to tutor him ever?). She could have made a place for herself...

When people (including me) call her "overbearing" we do it because it comes totally out of the blue, just because she saw him for a few weeks over the summer she behaves like a mother-hen when she knows nothing about the situation. If she were his *actual* surrogate mother (and being a mother comes with more responsibilities than providing food and lodging, she knows this) no-one would complain. Does she even have *one* genuine conversation with Harry concerning his messed up life that isn't completely superficial... about anything except that he should eat more? Does Harry treat her as his surrogate mother? Does he ask her for advice or think of her and send her an owl if he has problems at school?

#+begin_quote
  Of course she's overbearing and protective, it's the only way she can feel any agency when her kids are off beyond her sphere of control.

They are her kids. I don't have a single problem with her yelling at Ron, Ginny or the Twins. Yelling at Harry or - worse - Hermione is completely off-kilter.

Edit: The whole problem probably centers around the fact that JKR failed to portray what she had in mind when it came to the Weaslys and when it comes to Molly in particular. Like, I can see from the subtext what she intended and most or at least a lot of the readers just go with it and ignore the contradictions. I just can't. Same goes for Dumbledore, I can totally see what she wanted to do with him (and having a humanized Mentor figure who makes mistakes is a good idea), but it's not what's in the book.

Here is a good example from Book 5 how they are rebelling against their mother and clearly need a strong father figure:

#+begin_quote
  “Fred --- George --- NO, JUST CARRY THEM!” Mrs. Weasley shrieked.

  Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second later, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air toward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before.

  “FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley. “THERE WAS NO NEED --- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS --- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!”

  “We were just trying to save a bit of time!” said Fred, hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table. “Sorry Sirius, mate --- didn't mean to ---”

  Harry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, who had toppled backward off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet. Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from whence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.

  “Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, “your mother's right, you're supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you've come of age ---”

  “--- none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!” Mrs. Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost as much again. “Bill didn't feel the need to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didn't Charm everything he met! Percy ---”

Molly isn't a main character, so it's the small moments, but this oneat the end of Book 4 stuck in my head particularly:

#+begin_quote
  When Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him. All of them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream.

  “Harry! Oh Harry!”

  She started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.

  “Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to me for a moment. Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with him,” he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, “you may do so. But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this evening.”

  Mrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron, Hermione, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear? He needs quiet!”
#+end_quote

Their best friend just got tortured and used in a resurrection ritual and this woman just barges in like that... it's just. ARGH. As if Ron or Hermione wouldn't be much more concerned about his well-being than her... she barely knows the boy and it's her who almost assaulted him after a traumatic experience (Dumbledore has to block her with his body). To me it's just a perfect representation of the kind of person she is, blustering, overbearing and overall useless. So she hissed at Hermione, not sure if she ever yelled at her, might be a slight exaggeration.

To be completely fair though, she /is/ a good person. We should not forget this in all of that, before people come out of the woodworks and claim that I hate Ron or Molly. They oppose Voldemort, aren't bigots and want to help Harry. I just don't much care for them.

Your exception clause at the end seems kind of unfair. Of course the plot requires them to be that way in a well thought out story. In a good book nothing is just there for the sake of it.

I wanted to point out that there are quite a few adults who aren't useless in HP... your sentiment that in general adults have to be less competent in such a story is valid though. However, I think it can be done in a reasonable and realistic manner... An incompetent government and Fudge in particular seems quite plausible (just look at the Trump administration).

- *Arthur* : calls himself an expert on muggles, yet has no clue what anything pertaining to them, also pretty useless : /pisses me off/
- *Molly* : meddling, smothering, knows better than anyone else, hot tempered, but really loves people : /pisses me off most of the time/
- *Bill* : seems courageous, daring, the epitoma of Gryffindor in the family : /really like him/
- *Charlie* : don't know enough about him to have an opinion : /meh/
- *Twins* : underrated, brilliant, very intelligent, funny, but bullying, careless and childish : /need some whipping to get in line and could be amazing/
- *Ron* : arrogant, stuck-up, prejudiced, jealous, hot tempered, loyal when he calms down : /really don't care about/for him/
- *Ginny* : hot tempered, gooey, mushy, fierce, loyal : /really like her when not paired with Harry/

Yeah I really enjoy fanfics that emphasize their brilliance. It's a big condemnation for the whole Weasly clan that it needs someone outside of their family (Harry) to encourage their talents and helping them direct it into something useful (opening a shop). It's fun to wonder how well they could have done in Hogwarts academically (at least in Potions, Charms and Transfiguration) if their intelligence wasn't so much focused on rebellion if they had a more supportive family. Sadly Molly seems more focused on image and being a "proper wizard".

Until you consider the implications of the defacto ministry muggle expert being /that/ inept, at which point it's rather horrifying.. I can't remember who wrote it, but someone said that Arthur sees Muggles the same way that Muggles see chimpanzees, as something to be protected and cherished.

** Alright, so let's start with the biggest issue, Ron. Ron deserted Harry not once but twice. He deserted the only hope of his world because he was hungry. He was jealous because his brothers achieved something and yet he does not apply himself. Also he treats Hermione horribly. They would never end up together since "desertion of your spouse never goes unpunished" (the quote was from a Harmony fic set during the hunt).

Next is Molly. Molly knows that Harry is abused and makes jokes about it (bars on the window scene). She refuses Harry information because he is too young despite the fact that he faced Voldemort four times at that point. It is also one of the causes for Sirius death since she prevents him from learning vital information which could have prevented the Battle in the DoM. SHE IS OK WITH RAPE AND RAPE DRUGS.

Ginny is an odd case because she had a lot of potential that Rowling threw away in the sixth book. There is no buildup to the relationship, Harry is somehow suddenly jealous of the guy she is snogging (love potions anyone?) If there was a proper build up to their relationship (and maybe more than two pages on the actual relationship) it would have been more believable but it is not the logical conclusion of the story of books six and seven. That would be H/Hr because two young adults alone in a tent with the threat of imminent death would lead to more than one night of love.

There is also the whole issue of Fleur and how the Weasleys (especially Molly and Ginny) treated her in the summer of 96. That was unacceptable and Bill did little to stop it.

**** In addition to the "Ron/Horcrux" issue, he was worried about his family. Their home had been attacked, his family under heavy scrutiny for being associated with Harry and the Order of the Phoenix, and his little sister was in the Death Eater controlled Hogwarts. Harry's reaction to Ginny being sent to the Forbidden Forest was the match to the powder keg. It made it seem like Harry wasn't worried about what could happen to her. He didn't like the excuse of "She's been through worse" because to him, it didn't matter if she had been; it mattered that she was in danger now. Harry's parents were already gone, Hermione sent her parents away to safety, but Ron's were still out there, in the open, for any Death Eater who caught them. Then came the fact that there was no real plan for the Horcrux Hunt (which is not Harry's fault. As he said, he'd been straight with them, and going off of the information that Dumbledore had given him). Even Hermione was skeptical of what they were doing; Ron's just the one who voiced it.

Charlie did. Bill did. Percy stuck on for a while, I thought. The twins, unknown. Ron and Ginny, unknown.

  In canon the Marauders were often times seen as ruthless bullies instead of pranksters and since the twins use them as models, the twins also became ruthless bullies in some fanons

It takes some work to come up with pranks that aren't mean. Pranks where the victim laughs as much as everyone else. It's easier to come up with unkind pranks.

***** That /was/ normal, certainly. In the US, with wages dropping in relation to housing costs and rising unemployment, it's becoming less common. I understand the same thing is happening in the UK.

It's also a question of whether your parents live in a place where you would easily be able to get work. Floo and Apparition makes this mostly a moot point, but if I had chosen to stay in my home town living with a parent, I would have needed to drive three hours a day for work, and I would have had a lot of trouble finding positions.

****** It is becoming more common for people to live at home with their parents in the UK but as you say I think it's based on economic considerations. I think generally young people want freedom and independence.

Honestly there's a generational thing going on here. Rowling was born in 1964/5? She's the same age as me. When we were young, you moved out of your parents' home when you were 17/18/19. It was unusual for someone of our generation to still be living at home at, say, 20. Plus most young people find their parents a bit of a pain in the arse. It's a fact of life. It hardly makes Molly any different to any other mother.
