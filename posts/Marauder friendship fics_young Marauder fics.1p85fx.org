I'm absolutely in love with Against the Moon, and I can't ever remember reading a story that painted such a perfect picture of the four boys and the way they interact. It's made me slightly obsessed with Remus and Sirius's friendship.

Does anyone know of any other novel/novella-length fics that focus on the early days of the friendship? I don't mind Lily as a secondary character, but I prefer a fic that keeps the friendship at the forefront.

Failing that, any fics that focus on their respective childhoods would be interesting. I'm especially interested in James' and Sirius's childhoods. It's easy to find fics where 16yo Sirius angsts over his family, but I would love to find something with a younger and more vulnerable/confused Sirius.

It pretty much spans full 7 years IIRC. I really liked it a couple of years ago.
