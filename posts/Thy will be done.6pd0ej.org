By now, most members of the HP fandom will be aware of what a hilariously awful criminal justice system the Wizarding world has. Besides Sirius Black being imprisoned without trial, there are two instances of no less a personage than the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge himself, committing grievous crimes, specifically Summary Execution.

In PoA Fudge tires to use a Dementor to kill Sirius, a nearly comatose escaped fugitive who was, at the time, safely behind bars. Then, in GoF, he brings a Dementor along for ‘protection', and the Dementor kills Barty Crouch Jr. A competent lawyer might be able to spin both incidents to leave Fudge in the clear, but what is most telling is the reactions people have to both incidents. They act like it is totally legal for Fudge to kill people. In fact, Minerva McGonagall, who personally witnessed Fudge kill Barty, seems more upset by how awful the death was, and that Barty could now no longer give testimony; not that Fudge had brought a lethal weapon to interrogate a prisoner /at all/.

Now, it could be argued that this is merely indicative of the sad state of Magical Britain, save that this is not an isolated incident. Nearly the exact same thing happens in FBaWtFT, when [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Graves][Graves]], after about 5 minutes of interview, sentences two people to death. Graves is not a judge; he's the head of MACUSA's DMLE. He did not hold a trial, he just sentenced Newt and Tina to death. And, what's worse, is that he wasn't going to do it himself; he apparently did this through proper enough channels that the execution was going to take place in something like the American equivalent of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Veil][The Veil]]. So [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Bernadette][Bernadette]], that sweet black lady with a hipbone wand who was probably just doing her job, got the order ‘kill these people' and said ‘everything seems to be in order!'.

The reason Graves ordered the execution is immaterial, what is important to note is, again, how people reacted to the order. They said: this is okay. It is okay for someone powerful to just order an execution.

This highlights something important about Magical Society in general that seems to get ignored: Magic is Power, Power is Authority, Authority is Right. Both societies behaved as if it was fine for someone in power to kill people without demonstrating that the accused party was actually guilty. But this trend is repeated elsewhere.

After Voldemort's first fall, nearly all of his supporters vanished into the wind. Only a very few fanatics kept on, out of a total of dozens. Some might say that this demonstrates how self-serving all of his followers are, but I don't think so. No one really knew who most of the Deatheaters were. Most of them managed to slide right through the system. So why aren't they still committing public acts of terror? The incident at the Quidditch World Cup should have been an almost monthly event, not the first real act in over a decade. Lucius Malfoy explicitly believes in both blood purity and muggle inferiority, and has more than enough money to buy himself out of jail time; why isn't he burning down muggle orphanages every Christmas?

And this behaviour is not confined to the bad guys. After Dumbledore dies, the Order of the Phoenix does... bugger all. Ask Harry what they should do. Quietly resist. No active attempts to throw off Voldemort's rule, or help muggleborns escape to the continent. Why don't they do something, /anything/? Because Wizards believe that the magically powerful are not merely above the law, they /are/ the law.

Imagine the Wizarding version of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Canute_and_the_waves][the story of King Canute]]. You know how that story ends?

/”But when King Canute's weak, foolish, courtiers waved their wands at the waves, nothing happened. So King Canute, the wise and powerful, waved his wand and threw back the tides, proving his might for all to see.”/

Wizards don't have a concept of ‘can't'. There is no such thing as ‘impossible'. If you are strong enough, you can /bend reality to your will/. In the minds of wizards, people like Dumbledore and Voldemort are the only ones who get to decide what is right and wrong, because they are the only ones with the raw power to make that decision reality. The Deatheaters scattered after Voldemort's fall because in their minds they no longer had the /right/ to do what they were doing; the source of their power was gone, Voldemort wasn't around anymore to say ‘this is okay'. Similarly, with Dumbledore dead, the Order had no motivation because /it wasn't their place to make plans/. Without a powerful wizard to tell them the correct thing to do, they no longer had the right to do anything.

Now, I don't think any wizard would /admit/ this, but it probably lurks at the back of their heads all the same. Bernadette probably knew that what she was doing was technically illegal, but she probably assumed that, since Graves was a powerful wizard, it didn't /matter/ that it was illegal; he would either protect her from consequences, or make it legal after the fact. If you pointed out how insane and unjust that was, excuses would be made about ‘exceptional circumstances', but those same excuses would be made in /any/ circumstance, not just exceptional ones. In fact, I bet if Cornelius Fudge had been magically powerful, not even Dumbledore tier, but simply on par with someone like Snape, that no one would have complained about anything he did, ever. He probably would have kept his job going into HBP, even with the scandal, because it wouldn't have occurred to most people that he was at fault for being wrong. It wouldn't surprise me if some of Voldemort's earnest supporters knew blood purity was bunk, but just expected him to make it reality after he won.

What do you think?

Well, that would explain why the Death Eaters don't like the muggleborns, at least. They're not just from another culture, they have totally different morals and ethics, with ideas like 'due process' and 'basic rights for sentients' and 'you can't just kill someone because you don't like them'. It's totally different from the hierarchical autocratic structure of the wizarding world.

*** Well, as I understand it, there were only like, 4-5 students actually doing something more than not turning in their homework. And even then, they were using the framework that Harry and Hermione had built for them in the DA; it wasn't very spontaneous. At the end, really only Neville stood up to the plate to distance himself from the herd by attacking Nagini. If Harry had stayed dead... I'm not sure if Hogwarts would have kept fighting back. Some people would have, like Ron and Hermione and most of the professors, but I'm not sure if that would be enough to motivate the majority of the students.

See, I see wizards as having sort of a herd mentality. Powerful wizards are like the alphas, the head of the herd, and it just wouldn't occur to most wizards that /they could be that alpha/. So instead, they let deffer taking initiative until they think the alpha is giving the go ahead, or the herd is moving as a mass. So a few die-hards /might/ motivate them to battle, but it might not.

** Harry Potter's disciplinary hearing in OoTP shows additional evidence to what you are saying as well. Fudge clearly shows he doesn't care about the current laws and will change the laws to suit what he wants to happen. No one but Dumbledore seems to be too concerned about the injustice up until there seems to be a struggle between the two authority figures who say what is "right", as you point out.

#+begin_quote
  “The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,” said Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.”

  ** “Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely. **

  "Of course they can,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head. “And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!”

  A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats.

  “As far as I am aware, however,” Dumbledore continued, “there is no law yet in place that says this court's job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a specific offense and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do now is to await your verdict.”

*** "Laws can be changed" is not unknown in the Muggle world either. It is unusual but not beyond Parliament's power to pass an ad hoc retrospective law to "correct" a court judgement that the government considers badly made.

The War Damage Act 1965 was one such law. The House of Lords had held that, according to existing law, the government was liable to pay out compensation. The government then put a law through Parliament to exempt themselves from this liability.

All too frequently these comparisons of the Muggle and wizarding worlds completely idealise the Muggle world as a utopia of universal justice. In actual fact, at the time of the Harry Potter stories, the UK government had - legally - imprisoned large numbers of Irish suspected terrorists without trial. Since the 90s, the UK government has twice reintroduced laws which amount to legal indefinite detention without trial, and has multiple times had to pay out compensation to victims of UK government sponsored and facilitated kidnapping and torture.

That's the tip of the iceberg and it's just the deliberate stuff. Let's not forget the massive and systemic incompetence. I have a friend who works at the local court and they lose prisoners on an almost weekly basis. And let's not forget about the one that the judge ordered released but whom they accidentally shipped off to prison anyway.

The problems in magical government are not supposed to be in contrast to the Muggle world, they are - like all magical societal problems - supposed to be in /analogy/ to the Muggle world.

The KKK is a better comparison than with Nazis. Voldemort and his Death Eaters were numerically small, even with comparison to the small wizarding population. Given how the wizarding world widely rejoices at Voldemort's first fall, is deathly afraid of his return, and between wars behaves according to political norms where the use of the word "Mudblood" in public creates shock and outrage (analagous to "nigger"), it's clear that blood purism is not some nationally endorsed public project akin to Nazi antisemitism, and more like a small, criminal splinter group whose views are at odds with most of society.

The difference, of course, is that Voldemort as an individual is so powerful that his KKK have the ability to influence society in massive ways. But the moment Voldemort is out of the picture, the Death Eaters completely collapse, just as the real KKK would if they tried to infiltrate government.

****** The Death Eaters are wizard nazis. They want to mass-murder muggleborns for their blood, and they easily took over the country - like the Nazis in Germany in the 1930s, who were put into power by parliment deals, and then turned the country into a dictatorship. They even have the same blood purity criteria as the nazis had with regards to jewish blood.

(If your "the people have the power" argument were correct, then that would mean Wizarding Britain became Nazi Britain with solid popular support, by the way.)

Also, the KKK analogy is not any better. You might be ignorant of the historical fact, but the KKK massively influenced the south of the USA for decades. African-Americans were systematically oppressed through legal means and lynchings until the Civil Rights movement - twenty years after Nazi Germany was destroyed - and even then it took federal action including the National Guard to enforce equal rights for everyone. The KKK certainly had popular support in their day.

As I already stated, the figure of Voldemort is the disanalogy. He is the exception that proves the rule - when he disappears, the Death Eaters are rapidly defeated and wizarding society defaults back to its norm, where blood purism is widely rejected.

This is complete fanon. Name one thing that Malfoy or Umbridge did which could count as "open blood purism". I'll help you out: there's nothing. The political mainstream was strongly against any kind of open discrimination against Muggleborns, and use of racial slurs etc was taboo. Of course there was a strong undercurrent of indirect discrimination and unspoken prejudice - again, in close analogy to the modern Muggle world, as you just noted. Another reason why the comparison to the modern KKK as opposed to the Nazis is appropriate.

*** I don't like to be too critical, because the problem is a known one. JK wrote the first few books as children's adventure stories, and then made the material more mature and realistic going into the later books. This means that something like Dobby, a lovable little imp sort of character who helps around the house (probably modeled after something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_(folklore][Brownies]]) now becomes a horrifying instance of modern day slavery.

This also means something which makes sense in the context of a kid's story, like the challenges guarding the philosopher's stone being really easy to get past, suddenly needs explanation (the most popular one being that Dumbles is evil).

I think you could write a story where everything remains consistent, but it would require at least a little bit of AU, or a nice helping of 'behind the scenes' stuff. I know I read one fic where the reason the challenges around the stone were so easy was because Dumbles was following the trio and disabling the real traps, like the brooms in the key room were enchanted to throw you off when you were going fast enough and he un-cursed them so Harry wouldn't splatter.

But it is a hard problem to solve, and the little things sort of add up to paint a not very nice picture.

  The expressions 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' have been coined by people to whom these distinctions matter, and express their originators' prejudices. As far as somebody like Lucius Malfoy is concerned, for instance, a Muggle-born is as 'bad' as a Muggle. Therefore Harry would be considered only 'half' wizard, because of his mother's grandparents.

  If you think this is far-fetched, look at some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to see that the Nazis used precisely the same warped logic as the Death Eaters. A single Jewish grandparent 'polluted' the blood, according to their propaganda.

  Are all the pure-blood families going to die out? (We've lost the Blacks and the Crouches during the series)

  Don't forget that, as Sirius revealed in 'Order of the Phoenix', *none of these families is really 'pure' -- in other words, they merely cross Muggles and Squibs off the family tree and pretend that they didn't exist*. But yes, the number of families claiming to be pure is diminishing. By refusing to marry Muggles or Muggle-borns, they are finding it increasingly difficult to perpetuate themselves. This subject is touched upon in 'Half-Blood Prince'.

** Certainly the wizarding justice system lacks certain elements we in the Muggle world consider important. However I think your examples are weak.

In the cases of Sirius Black and Barty Crouch Jr, they were escaped prisoners. A "Kiss on Sight" order for escaped Azkaban prisoners was established in PoA.

As for Graves, it's not clear to what extent his actions were legal, and how much they were the result of his personal influence meaning he could get people to do illegal things for him.

Ultimately I feel like the most appropriate explanation for wizarding political and legal norms is the size of their society. In a society of a few thousand people, it is not clear that our Muggle/Western legal norms are appropriate.

Imagine starting a book club and opening it with a long constitution establishing separation of powers, correct procedure for disputes, etc. It's kinda nonsensical.

Which political system is most appropriate for a society is not completely divorced from the nature of that society. The magical world is still small enough to do things by general consensus. Sirius Black's lack of formal trial is no great secret or cover-up. This is not some 1984 situation where the people are ignorant and oppressed. When the general consensus turns against Fudge after OotP, he is forced to resign. That would not have been able to happen to a true tyrant. The people are empowered to intervene in the political situation when the consensus supports it.

It's just that it didn't support it in the case of Sirius. People knew him, they knew he went to prison, they knew and gave evidence regarding his guilt. If they had so wished, they could have kicked up a fuss and forced the Ministry to hold a full trial with the accused present and able to defend himself. But everyone considered him guilty (on the basis of the rather strong evidence), so no one cared enough to disrupt the consensus.

If the magical world is a tyranny, it is a tyranny of the majority in a form of direct democracy.

This is an extremely American perspective, and one which many legal scholars would dispute. Even modern Muggle Britain has an uncodified constitution which depends heavily on convention and the political culture.

Modern Britain is not a tyranny, not because of any formal laws which prevent it - Parliament has absolute power to pass any law it likes - but because the political culture and strength of convention prevents political actors from abusing the power that they do possess.

Imagine the wizarding world did have greater legal formalism, a codified constitution, etc. What good would it do?

This is a classic problem in legal theory: ultimately, a law is only as good as your ability to enforce it. Whether or not you are able to enforce it ultimately depends on your political culture, by what is called the rule of recognition. Essentially, a procedure or law is only binding if people of political influence (not just politicians, but also civil servants, senior military staff, the police, etc) view it as such. Rights and laws per se are about as valuable as the paper they are written on - what truly creates a stable political situation is the political culture.

The attempts to introduce democracy into nations without that political culture are object lessons in how paper-thin constitutions can be. The American constitution is unusually - pretty much uniquely - durable. And that too is a result of the political culture of the USA, not of the constitution itself.

So we ask ourselves: how can the wizarding world best defend itself against tyranny? From increased laws and greater formal constitutions? No. That will likely result in a similar situation to Iraq, Afghanistan, etc, or at the very least France, where they ditch their constitution on a semi-regular basis for the newest flavour of the week.

Wizarding leaders can simply ignore their laws unless their political culture developed to the point where they are unable to. And if the political culture develops to that point, then actually greater formalism in the use of power is surplus to requirement, because the political culture acts as an effective check in and of itself.

So, as I said above, it is entirely unclear that increased formalism and adoption of Muggle legal/constitutional norms (and specifically, American Muggle ones), would lead to any improvement in the wizarding legal situation. The only thing that could effectively improve that situation is a change in the people.

Neither of these established anything. They merely recorded what had already been created by the use of military power: the Magna Carta from the rebellion of the nobles and the Bill of Rights from the Civil War resulting in Parliamentary victory.

The Magna Carta was in fact ignored and actively repudiated by many subsequent monarchs - because they could. Similarly, if the balance of power had shifted back from Parliament to the Crown, the Crown would no doubt have repudiated the Bill of Rights or just ignored it.

That is to say, ultimately, legal power is derived from political power. Legal authority without political power is useless.

You say "you need laws and procedures to counter that; to tell the Aurors and Hit-Wizards that the Minister cannot do this" but this is not how the world works. As stated above, laws which tell Aurors to constrain the Minister will only lead to that eventuality if the political culture is such that the Aurors (and more importantly, their superiors in higher levels of management) believe that the laws are right and the Minister is wrong. That is to say, laws only have power in a society with a political culture which values the rule of law.

Implementing greater laws and procedures in a society without that political culture is pointless.

And if you do have that political culture, then there are all sorts of different levels of formalism which can be effective. The American system is not the only just, democratic system in the world - and indeed, in most of the world's view, the American constitution is in many senses an antique.

Which amounts to the argument that modern Britain is undemocratic, because the UK government is solely constrained by what it can politically get away with, rather than any formal legal limits to its power or formal procedures which constrain the use of that power. UK democracy recognises that officials can use vaguely defined powers conferred upon them with wide discretion, and that the political culture will constrain any abuse of power.

Political culture is not about what you /have/ to do, it is about what you /choose/ to do. This is because ultimately, what any individual has to do - the constraints on their power - is determined by how the body of political officials choose to react to any given use of power.

Then you don't understand how the Muggle political/legal system works in the UK. The vast majority of law in the UK is secondary legislation, which is passed exactly by whim of the Minister of the government department in question via something called a Statutory Instrument. Literally thousands of these laws are made every year, far more than Acts of Parliament.

In theory Parliament has oversight of these laws, but the volume is far greater than Parliament has the capability to oversee. Due to this, the vast majority are passed by "negative resolution" - where they automatically become law and are only removed if Parliament objects. Ministers have extremely wide discretion to make laws on a wide variety of matters without any effective oversight of Parliament. The main constraint on their power is that if they pass something absurd, the press and the opposition will hold them accountable in the court of public opinion.

The development of the democracy in Germany is actually much more complex than "Here is the Grundgesetz, live with it". Even the name /Grund/gesetz was meant to imply that it is a /temporary/ solution. The Grundgesetz was never even meant to outlive the split of Germany for one thing.

And it is actually very much based on the Weimarer Verfassung, (Weimarer constituion) that allowed Hitler to take over. And one of the big reasons that Hitler could take over were stupid procedures that they thought wouldn't be abused. The Grundgesetz just fixes a lot of the flaws of the Weimarer Verfassung, but is very similar (Bundestag / Reichstag, Bundeskanzler / Reichskanzler, Bundesrat / Reichsrat, ... - all have very similar functions)

The Weimarer Constitution can actually be a case-study of what can go wrong, how proper rules and procedures set in law can be abused.

The democracy was there before Hitler, Hitler just took it apart by *abusing the laws*. Without some laws Hitler would never have gotten the power he had.

It actually angers me that you get this so wrong.

Also, between 1990 and 2013 Germany had 23 changes of the Grundgesetz.

** On the whole, I think the OP has done a good job as can be expected to 'salvage' this apparent inconsistency in canon, and has raised some interesting questions about the fundamental philosophy of wizards. Indeed, it is only natural that people who can materially bend reality to their will with just at thought may well develop a divergent morality. I'm tempted to steer the discussion towards Heidegger and his writings on how technology conditions thought and values, but I will leave such an in-depth discussion for another day.

No, Occam's razor suggests that the apparent ubiquitous authoritarianism/voluntarism is rather the result of JKR's failure in consistent world-building. Now, people will argue that details such as the politics of the wizarding world were not really relevant to the early books, and perhaps they are right: I know of very few 11-year-olds who take an in-depth interest in such things. But when that 11-year-old is 15, and the target of a press smear campaign, a kangaroo trial, and an ongoing conflict with the de jure leader, these things just have to be explained. Honestly, was it /that/ difficult to slip in a small conversation with Arthur Weasley before or after the trial in which we learn just how the government really works. We see glimpses throughout: Arthur and Percy struggling with/brown-nosing his way up the bureaucracy, respectively, or the names of various departments in the ministry, and we observe several trials---but never enough to get the full picture.

How, when, and by whom is the Minister for Magic elected (if he is elected at all)? What are his powers? What does the court system look like, besides the Wizengamot, which we are told is the supreme level and does not handle all cases? And most bafflingly of all, how the hell does legislation work?! We know there are magical laws---Harry's apparent violation thereof is made an important plot point several times---but how do these laws come into being, and how are they changed? The International Statute of Secrecy is something that sounds both like a law and a treaty between countries---which is it> The two are very different in the real world. There is an International Confederation of Wizards: does it work like the UN, the League of Nations, or something even less political and more focused on standatrisation like the International Postal Union? Et cetera, et cetera, ad nauseum... And don't even get me started on the legal status and role of Hogwarts and the other schools! The one book that made the tension between Hogwarts and the Ministry one of its principal conflicts somehow did it without elaborating on their legal relationship in the slightest. Umbridge was using what were essentially executive orders from the Ministry to modify the internal rules of Hogwarts whilst remaining de jure subordinate to the Headmaster. Was he unable or merely unwilling to stop her? What about the Board of Governors---in case of such blatant ministry intervention, they should have either intervened, in which case we would seen /their/ legal standing and rights, or else chosen /not/ to intervene, which inaction could then still be commented on by someone (most probably Hermoine).

Now I don't care if some of these points have been addressed on Pottermore or elsewhere, that's not the point. If I can read all seven books without still being able to produce a back-of-the-napkin sketch of the British magical constitution, then this must be acknowledged as a failure on Rowling's part. Now, I don't think it is a catastrophic failure that makes the stories unreadable by any means---but it is something that many people like myself will be bothered by.

Finally, those arguing about democracy and authoritarianism in this thread are somewhat missing the point. We don't need a written magical constitution, especially as this is Britain and muggle Britain seems to have done perfectly without one. A just government doesn't even need to have full separation of the powers, which is an eighteenth century invention anyway. Until quite recently Britain's Lord Chancellor carried out executive, legislative, and judicial duties---hence I don't see it as strange in the slightest that the Minister for Magic would sit on the Wizengamot, especially since this is Britain. What is needed, however, is basic functional clarity. I honestly cannot object to the fact that fanon often turns the body in question into a magical parliament: it is the best guess as to where magical laws and statutes come from.

I am sorry for the rant, but this thread hit upon my greatest peeve with canon, magical politics and government. My principal motivation for getting into fanfiction was that I was looking for a better defined system. In my own writing, I've tried to set up something like the British system prior to the 19th century reforms, with both an upper house of hereditary (pureblood) peers who can veto legislation and conduct trials of their own, and an elected though less than democratic and somewhat corrupt lower house that appoints the Minister and his Secretaries via a vote of confidence. Granted, it's not perfect, and it's partly coloured by my conservative views, but I daresay I've given the question of the governance of magical Britain a great deal of more thought than what it has been afforded in the books (again, I care very little for JKR's post-factum published notes, if she failed to use them in her stories).
