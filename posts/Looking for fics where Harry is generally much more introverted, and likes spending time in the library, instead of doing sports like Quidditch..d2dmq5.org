** Seems like you're looking for something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][A Cadmean Victory, by DarknessEnthroned]]. Just a heads up, though, the ending of the story is true to its title. Read at your own discretion.

** My fic sort of qualifies. Harry enjoys being in Slytherin because it means that almost everyone leaves him alone, which he finds preferable to being the centre of attention. He and Hermione spend a lot of time hanging out together, which involves very little actual interaction between them. The only extrovert in his friend group is Tracey, who's only there because none of the others can get rid of her.

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

**** I'm going to be honest, half the time when I'm writing this fic, I just ask myself "what's the most ridiculous thing that could happen here?" and write that. That's how Parvati came about. She has been a bit of a base-breaker, though. A lot of people adore the direction that I went with her, while others think that it's just too much. I am trying to even things out by showing the perspective of her second in command, Carmichael Stephens, in the next chapter, so readers will have a better idea of what actually goes on in her organisation.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.
