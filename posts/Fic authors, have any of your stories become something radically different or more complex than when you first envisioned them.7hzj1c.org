I'm curious if any of you have written a story that's taken on a life of its own in your head. I'm writing one where that's happened to me.

It started out as a simple smut story with a cliched premise: Harry is a sex demon, an incubus. It rapidly expanded into something of light-AU worldbuilding project, mostly revolving around a modified prophecy, a demonic Harry, and a version of Voldemort suffering from hypersexuality and a breeding fetish on top of everything else wrong with him.

A different Voldemort lead to a slightly different war and slightly different death eaters. Different death eaters passed different laws in the ministry, and since they had a tendency to rape rather than kill when they could avoid it, the war resulted in a baby /boom/ rather than a dearth.

And then there are the changes Harry's "heritage" brought about before he even knew about it, such as how the entity known as James subtly influenced the personalities of the rest of the Mauraders, or how Harry's different soul expelled Voldemort's soul fragment, preventing their bond from forming and depriving Harry of parseltongue.

So despite being basically an excuse for Harry to have as much sex as he wants, the world of this story ended up being bigger and richer than I expected.

Have you guys had something like that happen to your stories?

** God yes. My story originally started as something simple, something that didn't go too far from canon but instead focused on smaller interactions. Then I began writing and now, 130k words later, my outline has been altered completely. The outline alone is like 15k words, and if I don't burn out, what was supposed to be end at like 200k words is now going to go above a million words.

I don't regret a thing though. It was fun (and still is) going through my outline and extending the story, having all these small actions snowball into larger consequences.

** I originally envisoned LIke a Red Headed Stepchild as either a one shot or a series of shorts that played up the humor in people confusing Harry for a Weasley. Instead, I ended up with Gilderoy Lockhart as a world traveling monster hunter, Hermione Granger as the Dark Lords bane, Ron as a side kick, and Luna as everyone ones favorite youngest Weasley sister.

I'm not even sure about Why Time Travel is Wrong and Other Morals. I still think SI stories are dumb, even if they are fun to write.

**** Ah, SIrius. He was probably my second favorite character, after Gilderoy Lockhart of course. I remember in Seventh Horcrux he ended up as a Death Eater because Voldemort was insane, but the idea never really went anywhere. So I decided that when he met Voldequirrell, his reaction to "are you a Death Eater" was going to be "Sure, why not." Of course, that ended with Voldemort falling in love with him (which is possibly the worst thing to ever happen to Sirius in any story ever). I may have to revisit Red Head someday, because there is a story arc I have planned that would finally throw the old dog a bone.

** I was writing a one-shot about a girl who kills a runaway dragon. It was told through a special edition of the Daily Prophet, in which the reporter interviews her friends and professors to understand who this girl is, why she would even think to face a dragon, and how she could win.

In order to make it seem more real, I was writing outlines for what had happened up to that point. As time went on, even minor, off-hand comments actually had a detailed explanation.

There was a point in writing the interview of the Quidditch captain where I had just gone too far. By the time I went back over my notes, I had outlined a sizeable chunk of the protagonist's life.

Now it's a massive project about a modern-day conflict between the muggle and magical worlds, and I am in no way qualified to write it.

** In the olden days of 2012, when Avengers was still a new thing that no one had ever imagined before, I was a shit writer. I got the idea for a fanfic from a challenge posted on FFN, so you know it was gonna be bad.

I wrote 80k words of prime indy badfic. I nailed just about every trope on the fucking head (with the exception of nice goblins because fuck goblins). I was immensely proud of my edgelord super!Harry.

Then I joined DLP.

What is now my biggest fanfic went through a couple more iterations as I became less shit at writing. I went from a relatively short (by fanfic standards) story to over 250k words of half a dozen subplots and worldbuilding, half of which I came up with on the fly.

It's been a hell of a journey.

** My fic started as a simple crossover between Harry Potter and Danny Phantom, where HArry is raised by the Fentons. Now, lots of worldbuilding, a handful of OCs, and a reincarnation cycle between Phantom and Plasmius, which Harry throws a spanner in. My outline and notes are 12230 words, and I have even more ideas in my head.

** All I wanted to do was write zombies in the HP 'verse and now I've got a budding romance (okay the romance was always going to be there) an entirely new (and highly illegal) form of magic, Hermione's very weird family and their secret sanctuary for wizards, and a flying horse.

** Oh, completely.

An AU for an RP character - what if Harry was sorted in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor? How would I write that?

2 years, 350,000 words and 5 books later, I'm in too deep. Gilderoy Lockhart is a freedom fighter, Severus Snape is still a spy, and Harry Potter is growing more monstrous than he ever wanted to be.

** Yeah, it was supposed to be some lighthearted pre-canon Hogwarts fun with a few dark undertones and now I'm looking at like 25 chapters at 6K words each. It's a little ridiculous because I told myself after my last story to call it quits with fanfiction.
