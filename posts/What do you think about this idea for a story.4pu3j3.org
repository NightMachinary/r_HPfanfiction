** You have an incredibly basic premise for a crossover. No one can give you a real opinion unless they have an idea of how you plan to execute it, in what fashion, and why.

You might as well have said, "I have an idea where Harry finds a magical door at Hogwarts, and it goes... Somewhere. What do you think?"

** I'm not even going to say that this is very, very basic, as LocalDictionary says, oh wait, I just did, but I'm also going to shoot it down.

How would it even happen? The Justice League would have to be handed a idiot ball of epic dimensions for this to happen, and a world where the Justice League exists would have a different Magical World in some fashion, simply because wizards aren't that goddamn ignorant. They would notice if capes and aliens wandered the earth, and reacted accordingly.

Now... Voldemort leading a crusade against the Justice League and other DC stuff instead of against the Muggleborn? That sounds interesting... until you run into the problem of the DC universe being incredibly inconsistent, and running off of wildly different rules than Harry Potter, so it would quickly fall apart.
