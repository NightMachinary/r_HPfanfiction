What if Rita Skeeter finally pissed off the wrong person? After writing a particularly nasty article about Umbridge or the Ministry (or both), Umbridge is now on the warpath for Skeeter. And Skeeter isn't one to go down without a fight.

Imagine Umbridge trying to introduce one legislation after another in an attempt to trap or arrest Skeeter. And Skeeter just keeps finding loopholes and writing more and more horrible articles about Umbridge.


** Considering that in the extended canon Umbridge's ascension to her position involved her stepping over people whom she asked her uncomfortable questions, I would imagine she would eventually find Rita Skeeter's secret that she's an animagus and she'd just use the existing law to imprison her.

*** Is there official stuff about her disposing of prior obstacles? I've always figured that she left a trail of bodies on her way to Senior Undersecretary, given her complete lack of hesitation in trying to have a fourteen-year-old boy assassinated for being politically inconvenient - no way was that the first time she arranged some sort of "accident" for somebody, not even close.

** Skeeter wins, no contest. Umbridge is an incompetent twatwaffle that needed endless legal handjobs from the ministry just to stay relevant, and instead of properly using that power in any real way, she just threw its weight around like some ridiculous Indo-Asian communist dictator.

Meanwhile, Skeeter, for how much people rightfully dislike her, is genuinely clever and cunning. She has two strengths, her writing and her animagus form, and she uses both of them to the best extent she can. An entire society of law enforcement and wealthy homicidally-inclined socialites never caught her, or even suspected how she was doing it. Remember, she was not even suspected of being an animagus. It took Hermione, the marauder's map, and dumb luck to catch her.

Skeeter was alive, sane, and more lucratively successful than ever before at the end of the books, living large after slandering Dumbledore in a massive tell-all, and then following it up with an even more lucrative autobiography of Harry Potter that sold out everywhere. Umbridge, by contrast, was implied gangraped into catatonia by a herd of horse-men after being tricked into going into a placed called */The Forbidden Forest/* and mouthing off to a bunch of obviously dangerous and pissed off nonhumans. Skeeter would eat Umbrige /alive/ if they ever came to blows in the arena of public opinion. Skeeter was ruthless enough and clever enough to outlive every celebrity, every scandal, and every dark lord who came through town: she was the Rich Queen Bitch. Umbridge only got as far as she did because of Fudge protecting her and empowering her, and he's hardly the most competent or scandal free politician himself. And apparently no one really /likes/ Umbridge, on either side of the aisle, so nobody is really going to go to bat for her. People would be cheering it on, if anything.

The more I think about this, the more I actually want to see it. A spat between Umbridge and Skeeter is exactly the sort of "throw a pebble at a mountain to start an avalanche" sort of event that could blow completely out of proportion. Skeeter and Umbridge go at it, both are hated so people actually want to see how this goes. It escalates, and Umbridge starts trying to outlaw her writings, so Skeeter starts digging into Umbridge, and in turn ends up finding a ton of dirt on Fudge. Normally she sticks to hit pieces on celebrities because it's safe, you can't be arrested for tabloid slander, but with her very livelihood and freedom being threatened, and knowing she'll end up in Azkaban if she's caught as an illegal animagus, she decides to go political, if only to save her own skin. Skeeter pushes out a massive tell-all on Fudge, and even pins some of the events of the books on him, like the Dementors at Hogwarts, arresting Hagrid to be seen doing something. Maybe she even figures out a way to blame the attacks in second year on him, without knowing the full story.

Fudge's reputation starts taking massive hits because of this vendetta between the two women, and that by itself could literally change the entire plot of the series: what if Fudge and Umbridge are so discredited by the end of this row that people don't believe the Ministry over Dumbledore and Harry when they say Voldemort comes back? What if Fudge almost gets lynched for his denials, or better yet, what if he manages to stay in office, but Skeeter is now completely against him and vaguely on Harry and Dumbledore's side, just out of the sheer grudge she now has with Fudge and Umbrige?

I feel like this is a really interesting "for want of a nail" concept. Skeeter getting baited into going against the ministry by Umbridge could start a series of events that completely changes the course of the story. The entire second half of the series was defined by bad and misleading press, slander of Harry and Dumbledore, and a corrupt and incompetent ministry. If you change that, then you change the direction of everything post-Goblet. Skeeter and Umbridge getting into an argument would be literally all it takes to create a massive AU divergence in the story.

*** 'wealthy homicidally-inclined socialites never caught her, or even suspected how she was doing it. Remember, she was not even suspected of being an animagus.'

Agree with everything else bar that one, in the books she got her interviews with the slytherins by using her animagus form (somehting about Draco talking to his hand in the book). If for whatever reason Voldemort needed Rita or Rita went against that faction, they would have known about the animagus form. She is still clever enough to not get legally trapped or be easily findable so she would be fine but she wasn't overly secret with it.

**** She was never suspected by the DMLE specifically. And she was never caught by said socialites. Maybe I should have been a bit more clear on my wording, that's two different groups.

If law enforcement had ever suspected she was an animagus, her ass would have been done. The trick only works if it's not common knowledge. So they can't have known. And it couldn't have been really common knowledge, either.

** I like the idea of Umbridge saying something at the trial before 5th year and pissing off Hermione, who contacts Rita and tells her she can have her quill back, with interest, if she writes against the Ministry. Then she lays it all out:

-The Arrest of Hagrid, both in second year and fifty years prior.\\
-The Guilt of Lucius Malfoy turning a basalisk on the school and his own son, WHILE BEING A SCHOOL GOVERNOR\\
-The Truth of Barty Crouch and Barty Crouch Jr.\\
-Sirius: Illegal incarceration, no trial, his escape, that Fudge was TOLD all this.\\
-The Dementors in third year.\\
-The Dementors THIS year and the kangaroo court.\\
-The truth of the end of the Triwizard Tournament\\
and lastly\\
-The Truth Of Tom Marvolo Riddle... You Know Who he is...
