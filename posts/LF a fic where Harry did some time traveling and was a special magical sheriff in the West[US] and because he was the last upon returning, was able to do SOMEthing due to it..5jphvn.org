I don't remember it as being all that good past the first few chapters but I'd really like to refresh my memory. He was very reliant on his Colts[I believe] and essentially eschewed magic aside from enchantments on his weapons.


** I think linkffn(Have Chrome Will Travel) is similar based on the summary, if you're into that.

*** This fic genuinely pissed me off. the author has absolutely no idea about how reasonable well adjusted adults interact with each other. His treatment of the women and their responses is absolutely insufferable and I swear to jkr herself every single time someone clapped for harry I wanted to strangle him. In the space of two scenes Harry goes from overt sexual harassment to "honorable marshal; protect the girls" and then right back to being a 12 year old who hits girls to show he likes them.

The author wrote him as a blatant abuser with ultimate power and authority and wrote all of the girls as followers who simply flock right back to him after his crude sexual innuendo. He's the classic hero for a fedora tipping neckbeard complete with an obsession for handguns and stetsons.

I get wanting to write something fun, and that not everyone writes fanfiction as if it were their passion, but this kind of obnoxious power fantasy coupled with such extraordinarily bad female characters, a complete disregard for grammar and spelling, AND an obvious lack of consistency within its own plot is a way beyond reason. It takes concentrated effort to produce this level of pointless drivel masquerading as a decent fic.

I mean for fucks sake I swamped through 9 chapters and half of the tenth before I realized Harry's demonstrated he's capable of immediately deleting the entire enemy force on a whim yet shows only the desire to piss off the girls for 8 more god damn chapters.

Sigh.

Mostly I'm just mad I wasted like 4 hours reading that much of it. He can explain it away between molly and Harry all he wants but having your main character act like a cunt with no possible way of seeing reprisal for it does not make for a good character.

**** I find all of this author's stories to be similarly unreadable. I think I made it about two or three chapters into this one before dumping it.
