Okay so maybe this is weird, but I'm a sucker for unrequited love. I recently read a story with a pining and bitter Snape and I loved it so much, and was just wondering if anyone knew anything similar to it? I just love Lily/James from Snape's POV. Here is the story I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9789386/1/Ten-Points-From-Gryffindor]] Thank you in advance!! The more bitter Snape is the better haha


** Snape's lip curled as he pulled the door ajar to watch the Potter boy pounding into Ginny Weasley.

"Typical Potter," he muttered, "his head's just as big as his father's was."
