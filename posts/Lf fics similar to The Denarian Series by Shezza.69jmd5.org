I find myself intrigued by the idea of Harry hosting an ancient powerful being, preferably a female. Suggest all fics that meet that criteria so I can indulge in this interest of mine.


** I cannot vouch for the quality, but there are several more revolving around a Denarian Harry and a female Fallen. One is a fanfic of the Denarian Series.

  He hated his life, his relatives, and most importantly, his own weakness. So when he chances upon a Denarius coin, he took it, even if it meant damning his own soul in the process. And now, he's a Denarian, the host of a Fallen Angel, and the Fallen is hungry for vengeance; and for him, absolutely nothing will stand in his way. Based on Shezza's Denarian Renegade. Slight HP/FD.

  She was an agent of Evil who regretted her choices. He was a child with a destiny too heavy for his shoulders. Is the Wizarding World ready for a Boy-Who-Lived influenced by a reforming Fallen Angel? ...Probably not. NOT Harry/Lash
