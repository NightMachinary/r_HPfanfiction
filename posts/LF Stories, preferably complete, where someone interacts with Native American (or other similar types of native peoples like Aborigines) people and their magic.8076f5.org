I'm looking for less traditional types of magic, with Shamen, Medicine men, etc. Rituals, sacred fires, dealing with nature spirits, that sort of thing. While I'd prefer it if the stories are complete, I'll take whatever I can get.


** It doesn't really go super in-depth, but I have a story that features Coyote. I'd be interested to know what you think. linkao3(12132915)

*** It wasn't exactly what I was looking for but I found it an excellent story and I literally just finished reading it. Kinda sad there wasn't a sequel... (Hint hint ðŸ˜‚)

I enjoyed the interactions with your OCs and it felt very real and authentic to me.

**** Thanks! We lived in the Southwest for several years and Coyote is very well-known there. We're in N CA now and I was very surprised to learn that the Miwok and Ohlone have a Coyote tradition as well.

I have a feeling Coyote isn't done with Teddy just yet!

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] had several characters like that, but their role became important later in the fic, I think.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.
