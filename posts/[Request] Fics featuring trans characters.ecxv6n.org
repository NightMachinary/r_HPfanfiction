In honor of the catastrophe going on right now on twitter, it feels right to highlight these fics.

Edit: I wanted to keep this apolitical/fandom focused, but if you're curious as to what this refers to, I explained below.


** Okay, so I have a bunch. For clarification, trans woman / trans girl is someone who identifies as female, trans man / trans boy is someone who identifies as male. Nonbinary can mean many things.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501][The Girl who Lived (Again)]]: I think this one has already been posted here, but here it is just in case. Mainly trans girl Harry. Trans boy Blaise and nonbinary Luna on the side.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/92021][Once Upon a Time]]: This is not something that I was expecting, but I enjoyed this. Trans woman Dudley, post war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11827911/chapters/26692608][Out and the Open]]: Significantly longer than the above fics. Eighth year drarry slow burn, featuring trans girl Draco. Also set in an AU where Harry is a cisgirl (cis is the opposite of trans).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10223405][Fresh Starts, Old Hearts]]: Post war Hinny fic. Featuring trans woman +Harry+ Katie Potter. Brief mention of Luna wearing a binder, but whether she is gender-non-conforming, nonbinary, or a trans man is not specified.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13884816][Whole New Kinds of Weather]]: Post war drarry erotica. Features Genderqueer Draco.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13627047][Dracaena]]: Very short third year fic with either drarry friendship or perhaps pre-relationship. Trans girl +Draco+ Dracaena Malfoy.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15966041][World so Sick with Loss]]: The first primarily transmasculine work on this list. Features trans boy Draco, and a side of trans girl Hermione. I highly recommend this one.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1943][Sleeping Underneath Your Skin]]: Slightly melancholy fic with a hopeful ending. Features trans man Ginny and a brief mention of an trans boy OC.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2111271][Got the Sunshine]]: AU where Ginny is a trans girl.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8393899][Paperwork]]: Post war fic about trans woman Audrey Weasley.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2659871/chapters/5944760][Truth in Transformation]]: Post war fic about trans woman +Harry+ Harlow Potter. It's been a long time since I have read this one, so I really don't remember much about it, but I'm certain that I enjoyed it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3876859][Family]]: Very short fic about trans girl +Ablus Severus+ Alice Minerva Potter. Ginny gets to choose the name this time. One very brief statement that seems to imply trans woman Hermione, but if you blink, you will miss it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4088071/chapters/9207688][Transformations]]: Post war romance between Hermione and +Draco+ Libelle Malfoy. It has one line in it that goes something like "You seem happier than I can ever remember you", and that one line filled me with giddiness because no less than three of my friends had said something like that to me in the past week.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14076102][Hand-in-Hand and Handkerchiefs]]: Very short Drastoria fic set during the yule ball. Mainly trans boy Draco and trans girl Astoria, but a brief mention of trans woman Narcissa.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10936140][Reflected]]: Very short fic about trans girl Hermione. Features supportive friendships between Hermione and her roommates, which is not something that I see a lot of.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10662990][Jubilant]]: How Molly and Arthur met each other. Featuring trans girl Molly and trans boy Arthur.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19417180][All the colors of Diagon Alley]]: The gang attends a pride parade. Centers trans girl Hermione. Very fluffy. I highly recommend.

That's all that I have for now.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

*** So JK Rowling has a history of supporting comment that are transphobic, and today she tweeted in support of a researcher who was fired for anti-trans tweets.

Here's an article about it: [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/jk-rowling-tried-make-her-work-more-inclusive-then-she-tweeted-support-an-anti-trans-researcher/]]

Here's a link to the tweets that started this (the women sued her employer I believe and the court ruled against her): [[https://twitter.com/tyleranny/status/1207688079823134721]]

and here's JKR's tweet: [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1207646162813100033?s=20]]

There's a huge discussion on twitter about Harry Potter, fandom, etc, in the context of this tweet and JKR's views overall.

***** The problem is that biological sex is left completely undefined. This is because the experience of growing up a woman is dependent on culture, the stages that we go through as we grow up is not guaranteed based on various sex development issues (approximately 1% of people are intersex, 1:4500 are born without a uterus, and an unknown number are born with xy genes). Thus for practical purposes bio sex is utterly irrelevant, and sex is purely socially defined.

This is why it's transphobic.

******* 1% of the population isn't an outlier. It's the intersection of two bell curves. Binary sex is acknowledged by the scientific community as worse than useless because it doesn't match up with reality.

Additionally, intersex is caused by hormonal irregularities in the womb not genetic problems, and current research suggests that being transgender is an intersex condition of the brain rather than the genitals. Testosterone insensitivity is a genetic condition though.

I don't have an issue with someone saying you can't change your sex (for transparency, I'm genderfluid.) Maybe Jo doesn't fully understand the situation - it doesn't seem like she does. The woman wasn't /forced/ out of a job. She works for a charity that is about equality, and her contract was up. They found her tweets didn't match what their charity stands for, so they didn't renew her contract.

Decent fics and decent stories, but they're more 'Harry suddenly grows tits and is kinda alright with it' than an actual exploration of body dysmorphia or the like.

I'm not trans myself, so my evaluation is kinda based on second-hand understanding. I'd recommend anyone giving them a read and seeing for yourself if you're interested rather than taking my opinion as a recc or not.

******** Sure, but at least to a degree it can be changed. Even if not completely, then still close enough as far as common-day perception goes. Of the five aspects that form one's sex (chromosomal, hormonal, gonadal, visceral, and genital), the ones that people notice during day-to-day actitivies are hormonal and genital, and those can be changed; medical professionals may also pay attention to the gonadal and the visceral, and of those the former can be brought to a neutral state ... the latter the same but it's not necessary; and only chromosomes cannot be changed, but they are also the least known and the least important actually.

The problem is that TERFs, and not only them because some other people do it too, don't even do basic research and just grab the basic idea and go around claiming that you can't change it at all because of the chromosomes and then proceed to be all-around terrible people. It is like someone finding out about solanine and then going on a crusade against vegetarians for daring to eat potatoes or tomatoes because they're supposed to be toxic, it just doesn't make any sense that anyone would do it without it being simply a means of being a horrible person rather than a goal in itself.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  When Harry Potter is seven years old, the Dursleys move to Tadfield. They have no idea what they've just stepped into the middle of, but Harry is just glad that there are actually people her age who seem to like her, and Them are thrilled to find another real live witch in their midst. And while the Apocalypse-That-Wasn't is now over, ineffability continues to play its part...ish.

  [Trans!Ron; Ron/Hermione, various pairings] He learned his lesson a long time ago. Boys are boys, girls are girls. And Ron, Ron makes a good boy. He's tall, sturdy, manly, not like some of those long-haired Slytherins he sometimes mistakes for girls when they slink in the dark corridors with their robes floating behind them. He plays Quidditch. He loves Hermione, with a little too much intensity and adoration for a boy his age, but that's what constant brushes with death do to you. He shaves; he doesn't jerk off, granted, but apart from that, he's pretty much the poster boy for healthy, honest masculinity.So why is it, then - why is it he can't believe it, not for one second?
