Curious if I'm the only one who's had this happen but I've read 2 fanfics in recent weeks where I came across something blatantly revealing the nationality of the person writing it to the point I had a hard time continuing to read.

The first describes how a 16 year old Gabrielle Delacour was allowed a glass of wine because it was a special occasion.

Because everyone knows that a 16 year old, Mediterranean girl drinking wine is something that requires a special occasion or is in any way "risqué". 12 year olds get some wine on New Years Evening. 16 year olds aren't exactly barred from alcohol in bloody France.

The second was calling a barbecue an American tradition.

Both of these have stories that pull you in and then suddenly punch you in the face with "yea, I'm American btw".

/rant. Downvotes on the left.

But seriously, it ruins stories for me :(.

*** Ow, I'm in no way blaming these people. I'm complaining about how jarring it is. Not calling people out.

Sometimes things even get done differently in the same country. Say whether Christmas is celebrated the evening of the 24th or the 25th to stay in the holiday theme.

Reading is escapism and getting pulled out of that is like being interrupted by the doorbell. It's not fun :p.

Still, the barbecuing being called an "American tradition" in this case does warrant a slap compared to the alcohol thing which is obviously not the writer's fault.

****** I'm not trying to be confrontational about this, and I understand that brits also do barbecues... But it literally is an American tradition, is it not?

I mean, IIRC, it originated in Florida or the Caribbean. And came to the UK by way of Spain. It literally is a traditional cuisine from America.

Even if it exists (or a uniquely British variant of it) in the UK, it doesn't change the fact that it is an American Tradition. It's like saying since brits cook their own versions of curry, it's laughable and bemusing to call it an Indian Tradition.

******** Fair point. And I never argued about whether Harry should or would identify it as such, I was just confirming that it was an American Tradition, in light of the fact that the OP seemed to believe that this was a ridiculous notion (I could have been reading it wrong, and thus why I added a caveat at the start).

Further, I don't think Harry being able to identify barbecues as an American tradition is an immersion-breaking American-writer indicator. I'm not American, and I've known barbecues to be a uniquely American thing since I was a kid... In fact, the idea that Brits also do barbecue and strongly identify with it is the newer piece of info for me.

********* The problem with saying it is "American" is that America encompasses North, Central and South America. I live in North America "which encompasses Canada and the United States of America", however, I have never heard of BBQ's being an inherently American thing. Different parts of America do BBQ's differently. From what I read on this thread, parts of the USA use the slow smoked cooker style. However, other parts of the USA, as well as Canada, use the same grilling style as Britain. So (to stay on topic) saying in a HP fanfic that BBQ's are an American tradition, is a misnomer.

And please don't assume my nationality. I'm not American.

EDIT: I think the issue why we can't agree with one another could be from the definition of Barbecue. Since outside of the culinary world, people use the words barbecue and grilling interchangeably. Further exacerbated because it seems like the British barbecue is what an American would call Grilling.

*********** Okay so I went and had a Google and barbecue in America and Britain actually means two entirely different things, neither of which is the original method referred to by the word.

In Britain, barbecue refers to fast cooking directly over the heat, in the US it's slow and indirect. The original way referred to by the word involved burying the meat and building a fire on top of it.

So we're both wrong - barbecue British fashion is British, barbecue American fashion is American, and both cultures nicked the word from a third.

** The story with Gabrielle (I'm assuming you mean Twelve Nights by [[/u/Te7]]) being allowed wine made an issue of that because of the straight-laced Molly Weasley being present more than anything else.

You should have spotted that Harry had no problem taking her order, how there was no problem with her being given a second glass (when Molly's back was turned) and also that she was 15, not 16, so she was under the minimum age for drinking in France at the time. It's 18 now but that didn't change until 2009.

There are legitimate concerns with cultural blindness spoiling stories but if you're going to be /that/ picky, practically everything will offend you.

Ayep. I hate to think of the amount of downvotes I'd get and how entitled I'd be called if I posted something about how the average fanfiction reader's inability to look beyond the absolute surface of the text 'ruins stories for me'

Hell, I've had dialogue tagged "blah blah blah" Emily lied. And had people harp on me that what she said wasn't true. No fucking shit?

But yes, the literal only person that has any issue with Gabrielle drinking is the fussy British house-wife who just lost an argument about the sleeping arrangements. And, rather than say something snooty like 'this is France' or 'don't tell me how to parent my daughter!' the French mother hand waved it away with an excuse about the holiday. Exactly how she won the other argument. And then proceeds to utterly ignore the limitation.

It's a dichotomy between two different families. And it's showing familiarity between the two. Apolline knows how to appease Molly, and Molly knows when not to press.

There's also the expectation. Gabrielle ASKS for a glass of wine when asked what she would like to drink. She does it casually and with no obvious guile. She expects to get a glass of wine. This isn't Ron wondering if he can get away with ordering Firewhiskey at the Hogs Head. This is someone familiar with drinking wine.

I could go on for like another week here about what the reader is supposed to get out of that scene but I don't have nearly enough wine to get through it all. It's no wonder people like Letters instead...

When Apolline even brings it up there are two drinks on the menu, Louis is opening wine and she is about to make Hot Cocoa. She then asks if someone would find out WHICH Gabrielle would like.

It's HARRY who misinterprets that as 'take drink orders'. If Apolline had done it herself she would have poked her head into the living room and asked if Gabrielle wanted Cocoa or Wine. There's one person at the party that cares at all about drinking in that situation AND its the person presented in the wrong in the argument!

The loons (North America) or divers (United Kingdom / Ireland) are a group of aquatic birds found in many parts of North America and northern Eurasia. All living species of loons are members of the genus Gavia, family Gaviidae and order Gaviiformes.

--------------

*Loonie*

The loonie (French: huard), formally the Canadian one-dollar coin, is a gold-coloured coin that was introduced in 1987 and is produced by the Royal Canadian Mint at its facility in Winnipeg. The most prevalent versions of the coin show a common loon, a bird found throughout Canada, on the reverse and Queen Elizabeth II, the nation's head of state, on the obverse. Various commemorative and specimen-set editions of the coin with special designs replacing the loon on the reverse have been minted over the years.

The coin's outline is an 11-sided curve of constant width.

In the one fic I read that had characters eating pancakes for breakfast, there was a girl from America, but I can't remember if someone mentioned earlier that this was an American thing. I think this annoyed me so because Harry Potter is a British series, which means there are things specific to the British culture, I want to see those things and not pancakes or 'vacation'. I sometimes feel that I get irrationally annoyed by Americanisms, for example. Then I open the author's profile and see them saying they don't want their fanfic to be a work of art. But is it so difficult to write holiday instead of vacation? Its like there are two groups of people here, one group writes fics for fun but works hard to make sure they are as British as possible, while the other just says,'I'll write however I want to'. Both of them want to be equally appreciated. But I don't think I'll ever be able to equally applaud people who try not to use 'gotten' and those in whose fics Sirius says he's going on vacation. Of course, I know that if there's already something I dislike about the fic, I'll notice all the Americanisms, all the uses of the word 'pup' and count all the pancakes they had for breakfast.

Also, cultures aren't uniform. I'm sure you can find a Frenchman appaled by a drinking 15-year old.

I understand being annoyed or dropping a story because of poor writing, grammar or spelling, but simply because soemone uses an English word that's not British? That's a bit much. (That's more towards the commenters)

** I don't think that something not being "British enough" in a fanfic is something to complain about. I don't mind it because I'm not British and frankly if the author isn't British, then I dont think they need or have to try that hard or do a lot of research to make the story or the characters convincingly British.

If the author does, it's a nice touch but not something that is necessary. Like if, for example, Harry and co eat 'bangers and mash' for breakfast instead of pancakes. Like, ok I guess? I dont know what that is, but good on you, author, for making your fanfic sound British.

Fanfiction is at most a side hobby for most authors. I'm just glad they're taking the time to write something that I can read in my spare time.

*** Just for clarification bangers and mash is sausages and mashed potatoes. Not something that is typically eaten for breakfast in uk

** Because of creator provincealism, being too lazy to look up the attitudes towards alcohol in other countries and the weird Puritan attitude the Americans have towards alcohol (the prohibition ended less than hundred years ago).

** But you're talking Muggle, and the action's happening in the wizarding world. It's entirely believable that wizarding France would have a different attitude about alcohol from the Muggle side.

*** If anything, their attitude would be laxer. Attitudes toward alcohol in France tended to be quite lax until fairly recently when the drinking age was upped in a bid to match other european countries.

** I'm only annoyed when they use fuck as a curse word instead of sodding, bloody, or bollocks. Also things like hoodie instead of jumper. And using the right usage of pants. Hmm, maybe there are a few more that I pick up on than I thought.

**** I do actually know that, I'd even go so far as to say the British friends I have use it more than I do (Canadian), but they never say it in the books so it seems out of place.

*** I'm British and a hoodie and a jumper are different things. I don't actually own any jumpers as they all have hoods, thus are hoodies. I use ‘fuck' as much as ‘bloody hell' or ‘bollocks'.

It's you that is wrong here. OP has a good point though

**** Fair enough on the hoodie/jumper thing, that's my bad. But with respect to curse words, I guess it's because they don't use duck in the books so it seems out of place in fics.

***** I agree with you about the use of fuck. It seemed to me out of place too. I suppose it was about making the books more,well, adult like. But I get annoyed whenever I see that word. I think it also doesn't help that I see it used everywhere..
