Harry is the Heir to Slytherin through Voldemort's death since they're related through the Peverell brothers. Neville is through Hufflepuff, the Weasleys through Gryffindor (since they are a strong line of Gryffindors and the red hair), and Hermione is related to Ravenclaw somehow because all Muggleborns are descended from Squibs!


** Sort of like Sinyk's fic (don't really remember the name, something about heirs?) but with no Ron bashing? Or Lordships? Or too-mature ten-year-olds? Or Dumbledore bashing? Or piles and piles and piles of inheritance? Or too-many-hyphenated-last-names? Or being knights in the Muggle world?

Edit: or marriages/betrothal at 10?

** In terms of muggleborns being descended from Squibs. If you don't have something like that then you need to come up with how a muggleborn gets created with no magic ever being present in any ancestor. Obviously the easiest rationale to justify explain muggleborns is the descended from squibs storyline.

A couple of stories went with the idea of the ability to use Magic is a recessive gene and is present in all humans and somehow becomes active. I believe one story had Hermione's house on a leyline and Hermione's "magic gene" was activated at conception. And further enhanced/strengthened by living overtop of it.

*** I know that Helena was killed, it's one of the important parts of the series. We just simply don't know whether Rowena had another child. Plus, this is a headcanon. I can change things as I see fit.

** There is also the possibility that the Founder's 'inheritance' -so to speak- is one confirmed by magic, not by blood...

***** Canonly, Harry's not related to Gryffindor, but considering this is a headcanon, I completely agree. It's like how Tom Riddle's mother was related to Slytherin and his family turned into muggles after generations of Squibs. I can totally see that happening to Gryffindor's family and considering Gryffindor and Lily Evans both had green eyes and red hair, you could claim that it's a family trait! Especially when considering the Prewetts and the Weasleys. And I think that Neville and Harry may be related, so you could say that since Harry is already Slytherin, Neville fully inherits Gryffindor.
