So I guess I never went to the homepages, always just linked directly to stories so I didn't know they were leaving! After this winter break I came back and suddenly stories I had been reading for years were gone! I would have saved everything if I had known!

I would really appreciate any help anyone can give in finding these fics, I tried to figure out as many of the authors as possible.

*The Vanteerian Charm* by The_Minx_17 - On Harry's 17th birthday he wakes up to find he has wings... beautiful, black, feathery wings. The wings aren't the only thing that changed overnight either

*Harry Potter and the Prophecy of Esclaria* by unknownxcelebrity harry/snape/draco/lucius

*Handcuffed* - What happens when Harry and Draco are handcuffed together and unable to remove them? Harry/Draco

*So Wrong, Yet So Right* - He's his professor, as well as his father's best friend. He knows it's wrong, but when he realizes the feelings are reciprocated, he cannot stop himself. Will they stop when a third person comes into play, or will feelings just grow stronger between them all? Harry/Draco/Snape

*Justified Chaos* - AU: Sixth-year. When Harry gets de-aged, the Slytherins learn things that they never would have imagined about the Gryffindor Golden Boy. He's more Slytherin than anyone could have imagined, perhaps surpassing the Dark Lord himself. What does he know, that they don't? What secrets will they uncover? Harry/Draco/Blaise

*A Past of Emerald Shadows* by Samantha_kathy - Harry de-ages himself with the unwitting help of Draco. And to make matters worse, little Harry is trusting nobody but Draco, who is forced to choose between the little boy and his own destiny as a future Death Eater. Lucius Malfoy gets involved after his release from Azkaban and Hermione and Ron are captured by Death Eaters. Can the trio's sixth year at Hogwarts get any worse?

*Serpent Child* by Eriador117 - Snape/Harry. Dedicated to Coeur-de-ma-Vie who wanted a Snarry adoption AU fic. JK Rowling owns the Potterverse I just play in it for fun. Warnings for child abuse, under 18. Summary: "He should never have been left with those people!"

*Bitten* by SoftlySweetly - Draco has to claim Harry to save him; but can the Gryffindor Hero ever love the Slytherin Vampire, and will it work out even if he does? An interesting and well written story with Draco very much in character and Harry's friends beautifully depicted and supportive.


** Earlier announcement/thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4w4rrn/misc_hp_fandom_and_the_hex_files_being_imported/][HPfandom and Hex Files being imported to Ao3]]

I assume that's why the actual sites are being shut down.

*** I know that a lot of people volunteered to help move stories over because they weren't in the correct format, but I am not sure how many actually got moved before the sites ran out of funding and shut down. Hopefully once I have an account I can find a few more.

Thank you for sending me this link!

** I'm pretty sure I have most of HPFandom and TheHexFiles. There are thousands that I systematically saved in 2014 and 2015 for both sites, so while I don't have the newest uploads for those sites, there likely weren't many new fics. I have HPFandom ready to go, but TheHexFiles are on a computer I won't have access to for a while.

*** Oh my gosh that would be amazing! I was starting to lose hope that I would ever be able to get some of these stories again so if I have to wait a little bit that is totally fine.

What might be the best way to get the files from you? Are all of the hpfandom files like in one big folder u can just zip and send to my email. Or should I sent up a place you can upload too? Anything! I'm just so happy that you might have copies, most of my stories are old so there is a good chance you have them!

**** haha the problem is they're both very big files. I can send you the copies of the individual fics I have currently (PM me your email), but the entire archives will have to wait a bit. Sending them via email won't work because the zip file itself will be a couple of gigabytes (I think most emails limit attachments to 25 megabytes at most). I'll have to figure out a good way to share the files.

***** If I set you up with a google drive folder would that help? I dont think they have too many size restrictions.

Edit: looks like its up to 15 gigs would that work?
