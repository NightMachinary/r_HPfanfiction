** I've never been able to see him as anything other than gay. Which doesn't necessarily mean that he didn't desire her in a non-sexual way. But I've always been convinced she was a sister to him and that he only ever wanted to be her friend.

*** Why do you think he is gay?

**** Mostly because of the way he never got over Lily's death. I always thought if he had a crush on her or if he loved her that he would eventually get over her loss. But if he thought of her as a sister he would always mourn her loss. But I'm probably being an idiot. I'm autistic so most normal human behaviors are extremely confusing to me. I know most people seem to think he was hopelessly in love with her, and they find it romantic that he never moved on, but I can't see him being that irrational. But that's me and I'm thoroughly weird.

***** While I've never applied the "gay" idea to this thought, I've always been a bit sad that more people don't give any weight to the role that true friendship and guilt would play in just royally fucking someone in the head for the rest of their lives. It doesn't have to be romantic, there are other psychological reasons for someone to not be able to move past something. The whole "Snape was an incel" movement is flawed in my opinion. Feeling like you killed the only family or friend you had is far worse mentally than most people might be able to imagine, and doesn't quite equal the same thing as feeling upset that you didn't get to bang a person before they got married and/or died, or being angry that they picked someone else and not you.

****** Exactly. Even if he had gotten a stranger killed he would likely have felt guilty about it for a long time, but for it to be someone he was that close to...I don't understand why they think he had to have been in love with her. I tried to see it from that perspective years ago, because I felt like I had to be wrong since so many people are in agreement on it, but I never could.

******* Yeah, I let people shame me into feeling like I had to view Snape as an irredeemably vile and stalkerish character or else I was a vile person by default, but I finally had to admit I just didn't see it that way. When you stop and think of it on a more human level it's a more complex and depressing scenario than just some stalker who didn't get what he wanted. Also, the role of a spy who is on both inner circles of two opposing groups is a whole other level of mind fuckery. Snape just had a really shitty run of life, and sure a lot of it was from his own bad decisions, but that doesn't mean he can't ever feel remorse for ruining what was most important to him.

****** Him seeing her as the only good thing in his life and him wanting to fuck her aren't mutually exclusive.

Teenage snape probably leaned more towards the sexual/romantic attraction part. But as snape got older and he reflected on his own role in lily's death and his fault in pushing her away, the guilt probably overtook attraction as the reason he's so obsessed with her.

****** I suppose that could contribute to him putting her on a pedestal. Still I like the idea I have of him in my head and most of my fics rely on him being that version so I'm not going to try and change my mind. With most of the other characters I can see them differently if I need to, but my idea of him has always been constant.
