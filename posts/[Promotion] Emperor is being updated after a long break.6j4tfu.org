Author also states that it's back on a regular update schedule (once every three weeks).

[[/spoiler][As far as the latest plot goes, Harry's empire is in deep shit, and Voldemort has the advantage again.]]


** I really feel like Emperor could do with not being an HP fanfic. Or at the very least, it should have taken place in a rather more AU magical world. I enjoy the premise of a modern conventional war between developed nations, with Harry using magical powers to propel himself to prominence during this war. But the fic has two really quite significant problems, IMO:

1. The tone of the magic Harry is using - large scale, flashy, but without subtlety or conceptual complexity - clashes with the HP magic system that all the other wizards are still using.

2. The eclectic and fantastic nature of the wizarding world clashes with the gritty and realistic tone of the military storyline.

I feel like a magic system like Dresden would have been a better fit than HP.

** On a 1 to 10 grade, how good is it? I've tried reading it a couple of times, but I've never been able to go past the first few chapters.

*** Read it with the expectation of pretty much original fiction with some elements that bear resemblance to HP. It's better that way.

*** I'm generally dissatisfied with where this fic went. I think the premise is fantastic and it had some really interesting scenes and characters (i especially like Ginny in this fic) but it seems like the author just bit of more than he could chew.

The start is great, it's a good setup for what's to come but as soon as the civil war in England is largely over it just devolves into Harry randomly fighting on the front line [[/spoiler][despite being the fucking king.]]

Then there's a few scenes that reminded me of 'Band of Brothers'. They were really cool but in the end not really relevant. We basically follow a group of random soldiers around while everything else gets ignored.

I would have liked a bigger focus on the technological advancement and the policies and politics in this new kingdom instead of random action scenes.

Then there's the weird behaviour of some characters; Well it's really only one character but i think the author wrote himself into a corner with the Prologue and now he's artificially creating tension between Harry and Elicia (his wife).

I just don't quite understand the sudden turn in her opinion of everything Harry does in the latest chapters. She hated everything he wanted to do but was still supportive of him, she disagreed with him on virtually every policy but they still worked through it because love conquers all or some bullshit and now suddenly for no reason she's starting to distance herself.

So yeah, it's hard to explain, i love reading it and i think it's definitely worth checking out but I also won't touch these updates with a ten foot pole because i just prefer to ignore the last 10 chapters and go with my headcanon on the ending.

At my first attempt of reading it I've dropped the story on the first chapters.

Same on the second try.

On the third try I just skipped the first ? chapters, and suddenly it was a pretty interesting story to read.

*** to bluntly answer your question, its a solid 6-7 out of 10. (if 10 is the best thing ever written by man in this fanfiction world). Now the reason for that, is that is long winded, portions seem forced, the characters while OOC, are consistent, but the plot is literally war. While this works, it should be mentioned that because of the realistic qualities, that the war feels less like a wizarding war and more of a muggle war with occasional magic. That I feel detaches from the story.

While the writing itself is fairly good, the update speed is atrocious (once a month is fine for a story as long as that but the unexpected and random hiatuses are not), and often deter readers from reading. If you truly wish to read it, wait a year or two, see if it finishes, then go for it, otherwise, you are either pushing yourself to slug through an unfinished monster, that you may have to do again with the next update, or you are waiting 3 weeks for the next chapter, if not longer.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** The worst thing about Emperor is Team Guardian. They're unbelievably boring to me. And it's not like Marquis doesn't know how to OC. Jeagera were basically German Guardians and they worked fine - well, their leader did. With Guardians I can't even tell which ones are women and which are guys, besides like two of them.

All their word count is basically wasted Imo. I'd much rather read about Military Mages instead or the happenings in Albion. Ginny is one of the best characters in Emperor, but after her plot was discovered she was shoved aside. Fuck, even Snape. Just no more Guardians.

And the are timeline inconsistencies which are irritating. Josefina is a master fucking spy, carrying out black ops in the lead up to the Civil War after like a year of training, which makes less than zero sense. There's a moment when Harry or Warwick or someone says they'd been in the North for two years when by date headers they'd been there a couple months. And in the first timeskip at some point Harry's daughter is referred to as being seven years old when she's four.

Small things, but irritating. It plays into the unfortunate prologue as well. Originally it was set in 2019. Marquis pushed it back a couple times before just changing it to 20XX. If you're writing a story that relies on having its timeline straight, then keep it straight.

Emperor is not without problems, but it has good stuff too. But it's not HP fanfic. It happens to feature some HP names. And I hate Harry's wandless magic, it feels too anime-like, especially with dual-wielding swords and the enhanced energy kicks straight from DBZ. But having read the author's previous series, I expected all that the moment Harry did the Fiendfyre fingersnap.

All in all, Emperor is an average fic. Perhaps even guilty pleasure for me. I'd have a hard time recommending it to anyone who's actually looking for HP fanfic.
