Anything?


** Well there is linkffn(The Casebook of Harry Potter by chris400ad) where Harry is a detective like Sherlock. He even has some of the same social incompetencies and intelligence.

** I know of one or two that have HP be Moriarty (instead of Sherlock). Would you be interested in that? not sure any of them are completed though.

  The first is one that I read a while back that is not finished, and likely never will be. I recall it being entertaining (with Hermione playing the part of Holmes), but I don't remember details. The second has Harry be very scientific, and reminded me of your request. I read it up to a point, and then stopped cause I disliked an event that occurred. No idea what happens after that. Not sure it fits what you want as much, but no harm suggesting it.

***** Nah, I never read it. I read the summary and the reviews. I don't usually read fics without checking it for a LOT of negatives. And I found enough to make me turn around and never look back. Manipulative Dumbledore is the least of my problems.

Which is hilarious, because if Dumbledore was manipulating a bunch of kids, said kids wouldn't even notice it.
