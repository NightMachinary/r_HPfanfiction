*** If Voldemort was mentally and physically in better shape, he could certainly have persuaded Harry with following reasons:

1. The prophecy was Dumbledore's conspiracy, sacrificing Potters in order to destroy Voldemort. Even I find it odd that Dumbledore interviewed Trelawney without any kind of privacy spells, despite knowing that a marked Death Eater would be there as well. It was even more curious that Snape was only able to hear part of the prophecy.

2. Play up to Harry's hate of the Dursleys, and further imply that dumping him at the Dursleys was another of Dumbledore's schemes. Voldemort could explain that by giving Harry a terrible childhood, Dumbledore would have an easier time to impress and manipulate Harry into self sacrifice.

3. Threaten to go after Harry's friends if he refused to join, and promise rewards vice versa. Hermione, imho, was especially susceptible to promises regarding creature rights (one of Voldemort's key agenda) and access to knowledge.

This could be fanon or my headcanon, but IIRC, it was a proforma job interview: he was planning to eliminate the position and the subject, but first had to conduct some interviews to show that there wasn't anyone qualified. There was no reason to be private or secretive about it. Then, Trelawny up and made a Prophecy...

Even if it doesn't have direct canon support, I think that pedestrian and whimsical explanations like this one are generally better than conspiratorial ones.

Mind you, [[http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/anomaly-hunting/][anomaly hunting]] is a time-honored practice of conspiracy theorists everywhere, so Voldemort could certainly point out something like that when making his case to Harry; and I don't know if canon Harry is a good enough critical thinker to spot that.

***** The lack of privacy spells don't bother me. What bothers me is that the interview was held in the Hog's Head. The only interviews I've ever had that weren't at the company/institution were for retail jobs. It makes no sense to me that the interview would be held anywhere other than Hogwarts.

****** New headcanon: Dumbledore used to do exactly that, but then there was that time when he was interviewing an applicant for the DADA position (in Hogwarts), turned him down, and on his way out, the applicant put a curse on the position that he never was able to remove...

***** The entire point of fanfiction is "if". And no, Harry doesn't need a different upbringing to make him be antisocial and hate Dumbledore - he was even close to it in canon.

***** "If"

Yea, welcome to fanfiction, buddy.

Actually its believable that an eleven year old could be manipulated into believing that Voldemort is the good guy here. We have seen Dumbledore-bashes and the typical arguments against him. Voldemort could easily make Harry believe that his parents are dead because of Dumbledore. And for everything else there is Obliviate.
