I have been planning to start reading this for a while but it is so huge that I am unable to make up my mind about it. Is there and shorter fics with a similar premise that I can read?


** I personally found HPMOR to be awful, with an obnoxious protagonist who is constantly held up to be the best by the text. I was sold this fic on promises of the Scientific Method being applied to magic, but Harry never does any science in this fic, there are a few brief moments in which the author waffles out a few fancy sounding words, usually involving "quantum" which are occasionally not utter nonsense, before he abandons any kind of exploration of the mechanics of magic and returns to his usual inane ramblings about philosophy.

I can't tell you what you will or won't enjoy, but if you also find yourself screaming inside after the first few chapters I would highly recommend you read this review of the story by su3su2u1 instead, I found it infinitely more enjoyable. [[https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/]]

*** to be frank the existance of magic functionally makes the muggle laws of physics, chemistry science cry in a corner

a true sicentifically minded harry woudl accept that magic functionally makes whatever knowledge he has about science moot. he would try to learn about magic and respect professors then try to do experiments ex the effect of potion stirring left vs right effect etc

*** â€‹

I haven't read the fic yet, but I've been hearing enough to talk about it and considering the numbers...

Chapters: 122 - Words: 661,619 - Reviews: 36,032 - Favs: 27,896 - Follows: 20,403

Well, on the surface it is easy to think that you are an example of a successful author and that we can learn something about writing.\\
On the other hand, if it is as bad as people are saying, how do you explain its popularity? Of course, being popular doesn't mean it's good quality, but it still intrigues me about all those numbers.

** Short answer, no.

Long answer, hell fucking no.

Detailled answer, sure, if you don't mind waddling through a long sea of meaningless words where the author, using Harry as a focal point, spew out his meaningless beliefs on anything in order to sound intelligent.

**** Interesting in the sense that it was one of the earliest long fics, for one. It was read by /so many/ people that it enlarged the audience of HP fanfiction itself by bringing in new readers who, at some point, have heard of this weird fanfiction making "fun" of the HP world (myself included, fun fact there). It broke the barriers of the fandom and spilled over to other forums, pulling people in.

Then of course it is interesting because of the sheer amount of controversy it spawned. Beginning from its content, style and characterisations, to the authors shenanigans online.

While I don't know this, I would assume that is also spawned, or made famous some of the more wide spread tropes we see to this day.

In short, I come back to my original comment. It is a large part of HP fanfiction history. For that reason alone I would recommend people to read it.

** It depends on what types of stories you usually read and like. I think Harry is a condescending a**hole in this and did not enjoy it, but if you like powerful Harry stories or stories that criticize everything, you'll enjoy it.

** I mean if you want to set yourself a challenge for how far you get into it before you can't stand it anymore lmao

I don't think so personally, I feel like we're all exposed to dudes who think they're smarter and more logical than anyone else in our lives and don't need to seek it out in fic as well. Imo there are people who wrote fics that were probably affected by the fic at the time, and acknowledge it's a classic or something, but there are fics that are way better, you know?

** It's a soapbox for the arrogant and conceited author, who is using Harry and by extension the world of Harry Potter as his mouthpiece.

It's literary diarrhea.

He was even arrogant enough to try to even request JKR to make his stuff canon or published, IIRC?

** I liked it. It's a way to read about some interesting ideas that has enough plot to make it not feel like a textbook, and it has some decent jokes. But if you're looking primarily for a story, you'll hate it. It's not a beautiful story. It's a bit of halfway-decent story wrapped around a bunch of interesting ideas and humor.

You'll like it or hate it, and a lot of people around this subreddit are in the "hate it" camp. But it's not objectively terrible across every dimension one might care about. It's just polarizing and the people of one pole are very common here.

If you'd like a brief view of some of the ideas across a variety of contexts, read Omake 4 from chapter 64. If you want a concentrated demonstration of the author's sense of humor, read Omake 3 from chapter 11, which is about funny things that could have happened during the Sorting. Or read someone else's rationalist fic for a preview. Or just jump in with the understanding that you can leave if you want.

** Read the first ten chapters. If you enjoy the story, continue. If you don't, stop reading. I think that's what the author suggested at some point.

HPMoR is my absolute favourite fan fiction story, but it seems I'm not an ordinary fan fiction reader. For example, I strongly dislike romance while many if not most readers consider it the main thing of fan fiction.

Two stories similar in some ways that I have found through the HPMoR subreddit are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex][The Imposter Complex]].

*** I used to like HPMoR, but I gave up on it when the plot started pointlessly meandering, and I was completely turned off from it when I found out the author hadn't read past book 3. Like, if you're going to write a monster of a fic criticizing canon, at least read the whole damn thing.

I've noticed that a lot of people who like HPMoR seem to believe that people who dislike it are just not interested in fics with an intellectual bent and are just in it for the romance, but that's really not the case. People who've read enough of it to dislike it clearly were interested in the premise but were put off by the fic for one reason or another.

*** Seventh Horcrux is a much different premise. It's much better too. Unlike MoR, it's actually worth reading. The only similarity I can find is that Harry grows up with Aunt Petunia. That's it. Uncle Vernon and Dudley only exist in one. Everything is different.

**** They both have main characters who are exploiting the canon magic system in ways that the canon characters never realised for plot reasons. JKR's worldbuilding is flawed in many ways, and some readers enjoy stories that make fun of her.

** In my opinion, it is absolutely worth reading the whole thing, but you may not agree with me until you actually finish it. The MC is a conceited, arrogant little brat, there is no arguing with that. But there are some amazing scenes, some wonderful lines, and a final confrontation that makes the whole thing worth it. The HPMoR podcast where it is read out by amateur voice actors is a great way to enjoy the story while not reading it. I listened to it on two separate long road trips, and it really helped the scenery pass by faster.

That being said, it was my first fanfic, so I'm sure part of my appreciation for the story at this point is nostalgia. There are a lot of subplots that drag on a little bit, and a good editor would probably cut 25% of the words out.

If you're looking for a lony story that is already complete, there is no reason not to try it out. Not everybody likes this story, but the people who do like it, really like it, are the ones who finished it.

** I would follow the author's advice on it tbh - keep reading to at least chapter five, but if you still don't like it at chapter 10, definitely drop it.

Edit: On the second question it's not a fan fiction, but here's a good way to tell if you'd like HPMOR. Read Ender's Game, except for the last chapter. If you don't like it or like it in a "wow this says a lot about our society" way, you won't like it. If you like it in a "fuck yeah that Ender kid is really cool I wish I could have gone to Battle School" way, you will like HPMOR.
