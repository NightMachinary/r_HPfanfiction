** It's been a while since I read Harry Crow, a few years atleast, but was it that bad? I don't remember the writing being horrible per se.

The overpowered MC I can understand. "Crow's marauders" and all the other stuff too.

But I don't remember much about the writing to be considered bad.

What did you dislike about it?

*** Considering how much people hate it around here, it's actually surprisingly well written... if that kind of trope appeals to you it almost reads like a feel-good story which you could finish it in a few days despite its length. However I feel like it's one of the main culprits that set the tone for the very much hated trope around here of Lord Potter which became popular a few years ago and now everyone on this sub hates it. I am absolutely not a fan of RobSt and I absolutely hate every trope that is common in his stories, but I can appreciate the fact that he/she actually is a pretty decent writer and if he/she would have produced some original stories and had an army of editors, I think some of the works would have been hits.

**** Nothing with bashing in it, let alone the heavy lean on bashing and tropes that story has can ever be called "well written" or "good writing". If you cannot make your readers dislike a character WHO YOU HAVE FULL, GODLIKE CONTROL OVER as author without needing to use cheap writing techniques like bashing, you're just a shit writer.

**** This is one of the best takes on RobSt's work I've seen on this sub. His fics are trope-heavy, and very characteristic of their era of HP fanfic, but quite well-written for all that. Harry Crow is still one of the few written works to get my heart pounding with tension at times (when I originally read it).

The first thing that drew me to RobSt's work was the original touches - ideas I'd never seen before (and in some cases haven't seen since) that were interesting and/or clever. Even his first story (that even he admits is pretty crap) has the Lily Potter Clinics and a microwave-dinner fad among wizard-born that leaves Muggle-raised just shaking their heads.
