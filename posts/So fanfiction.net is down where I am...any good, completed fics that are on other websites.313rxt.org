thanks!


** did you check out the side bar? There's AO3, fanficauthors, hpfanfiction, hp.adultfanfiction, thequidditchpitch, siye, ficwad, fictionalley, and at least a dozen others. I'm not sure about complete stories but I imagine you can sort by complete for all of those sites.

*** thequidditchpitch seems to be down. Hopefully it's a temporary thing since I haven't backed up some of my favorite fics that are exclusive to that site. :(

**** Oh man I was just on there yesterday too. I have no idea how to even contact the owners and let them know. Maybe Northumbrian would know as they're a regular over there. I know simons flower was a Co founder and her memorial page was run by another one but I've no idea how to find it again.

Edit and I hope it's not an April Fools joke =(

** You have to register for it, but [[http://www.fanficauthors.net/]] has a selective number of authors that generally have some excellent works. A lot of it is older stuff that is starting to show it's age, but it's still good. JBern's stuff is on there, Ruskbyte, Jeconais, etc.

*** Thanks! I just signed up on there. Any particular recommendations, or is it generally good overall?

**** JBern's completed stories are probably the best. Ruskbyte's are good, but a lot are old, pre OotP so you get those stories speculating on what that actually is. Jeconais is one of my favorites but all his stories are vaguely similar and have a very idealized, super love conquers all sort of life for Harry. Draco664 Apprentice Potter series is still extremely good.

There's a lot of stuff on there.

*** Does it really? I like the site itself, and its functionality, but every AO3 HP fic I've seen mentioned here is either slash or a one-shot.

Any particular examples?

You can edit the search there to be more specific or to filter pairings. The problem with the het tag is that some fics are tagged het and slash. Over 400 there. Most are slash though which is kind of ironic in the het tag.

Changing to archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=✓&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=&work_search%5Bcreator%5D=&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=1&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=>50000&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=Harry+Potter+-+J.+K.+Rowling&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcategory_ids%5D%5B%5D=21&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=&commit=Search) gem makes things slightly better.

Looking at them, I recall archiveofourown.org/works/838184/chapters/5237063 being interesting. Also I recall hearing good things about [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/598019]].

But yeah, AO3 is a lot of slash...

***** Hit The Ground Running is also in FFNet, not sure which version came out first. I'll give Digging for the Bones a try even though it does look like just a hurt/comfort Severitus fic.

EDIT: It was, also Snape is Harry's dad and he knew all along and he's actually a nice guy!
