Hey, guys. As you can probably guess from the title, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19442071][I have a story that I'm writing at the moment]], and I'm not sure how to (or whether I should) continue it. Basically, I would love if anyone could take a minute or two to read it and give it some proper feedback, just so I know whether or not it's worth continuing.

I feel like if I knew the right angle to go at it, I could craft it into a really personal, heartfelt story. Unfortunately, I'm struggling to see how, and I need an outsider's perspective. Any comments or ideas would be welcome.

This is my first story in this fandom, so I may be a little rusty, but I'm ready for any and all feedback. Don't hold back, I'm a big boy.

Thank you and happy reading.

[I've marked it as complete for now, but that will most likely change in the future once I know how to proceed]


** It depends what you want to accomplish. I'm really bored of canon retread personally, so if it was just going to be summarized canon with scenes like what you have written sprinkled in, I wouldn't be a fan.

I really like what you've read, and I would like more of it, but there's only a couple directions that come to mind for me. One would be a little cheesy, but could work if approached correctly. That would be run an adults-take-responsibility plot. Have the details align with the books but not take place in the same order or with the same participants. Focus more on the relationship and the mental health component.

The second that comes to mind is to skip describing anything that happens the same as in the book. I hate the idea of Harry somehow acting exactly the same and having the exact same events play out, with the PTSD not being affecting or being a barrier to any of it, but some scenes can be used, but be in the background, with the focus being on the aftermath, the coping, and Harry and Hermione's relationship. Vignettes where the story happens in between and is understood in brief or implied.

I like how this is written. I want that to be clear. I just always worry about how good writing can be spoiled by too many tropes or too much canon-adherence.

Edit before I forget: it's also kinda good where it is now. The extreme version of my option 2 might be to skip to post-battle/war and just do one more chapter with some epilogue, but I like it as a complete thing now too.
