I don't know about you, but I know I wouldn't be quite so mad if a friend of mine actually said he/she was going to tell a teacher/authority figure about an expensive gift with no name. Especially if it was an electronic gift. I honestly think Harry being angry at Hermione for going behind his back as both believable, and a little warranted. So any stories about such. Any stories that focus on Hermione either not trusting Harry enough to tell him, or worse, her seeing Harry as a child, which causes her to perform such an act without at least informing him. After-all, of Hermione os Harry's friend, does he not at least deserve to know at least discuss the situation with her instead of her just straight up going behind his back, not trusting in their friendship enough.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Thank you. Some fanfics use this a staging area for Harmony ("She cares about me so much!1!") but I always found it annoying. That combined with the whole Scabbers deal makes Book 3 my least favourite (in terms of Hermione's behaviour/attitude).

linkffn(11271241) chapter 5 has this as a one-shot type of thing.

*** Book 6 is my least favorite book with Hermione, then book 3/5.

  This is a series of one-shot stories and miscellaneous scenes about what if Harry had responded differently to key events in his life.

  After McGonagall's dismissal of the first divination lesson Harry decides to change elective. In the process Harry starts to understand that he can do things without Ron or Hermione and that their yearmates are worth getting to know. A different take on PoA and on. Rating's for safety. Not a Ron/Hermione bashing story.
