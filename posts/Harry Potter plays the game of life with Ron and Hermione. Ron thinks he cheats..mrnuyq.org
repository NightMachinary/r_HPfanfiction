It's on ao3, it's definitely a crack fic, and there's a sequel where Ginny joins them playing monopoly or maybe cluedo?

*** I love Sarah1281's writing, but I don't think I've read this one. I've read /Oh God, Not Again/(but then I'm pretty sure anyone who knows that name has), /When in Doubt, Obliviate/, and /Don't Waste It/.
