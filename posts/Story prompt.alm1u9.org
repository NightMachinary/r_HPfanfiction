AU prompt, Purebloods may have lost voldemort, but they did end up taking over the vast majority of the wizarding world, but, instead of wiping out muggleborns and half-bloods, they decided it would be better to force them to recognize their betters, so they created various runic accessories, such as necklaces and earrings, for anyone who didnt agree with their ideals to wear, that force them to act either in a way that 'befits purebloods' (for the disbelievers among them) or to defer to purebloods in all matters involving them (for non-purebloods). either harry grows up outside of this world, and is able to fight off its effects, or an adult harry arrives in the world by some means (such as through the veil) and joins or creates a resistance force in either scenario
