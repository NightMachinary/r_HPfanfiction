** TL. DR:Novel length, twisty combinations of multiple plot lines, smart and capable main characters facing smart and capable opponents, reasonably developed characterizations for everyone involved.

I've mostly found myself interested in fics where characters are on the smarter side and consistent to themselves and at least reasonable in behaviour. Reading about dumb and dumber gets boring very fast. Deviations from canon characterization is fine if such is explained in the story in a plausible way.

When reading about younger years when characters are aged 11 to 14 it helps if the author quietly upgrades everyone involved by several years in terms of maturity. Fanbase of Harry Potter grew up and writers should take this into account.

Angst and drama is boring - I prefer to read about heroes who struggle with and handle difficult situations instead of whine and brood about everything life throws at them. Moments of weakness is one thing, but reading about stupid fights and hysterics for an entire chapter usually kills the story for me. It may not be "realistic" behaviour for young teens, but frankly real teens are boring.

Twisty and multi-threaded plots are a big bonus.

*** Aye, I agree on the last point. What really made the last book interesting was all of the factors, characters, places, ideas that were built up over the previous six books, and all came into play during the 7th.

** I like the 'fics where things are more... realistic, for lack of a better word. Where Harry acts like the emotionally stunted and damaged child he would be, after being raised, unloved, by the Dursleys; where Hermione is as callous and calculating as she is hinted to be (the 'SNEAK' incident; Obliviating her own parents); where the Imperius curse is used intelligently, by intelligent people.

Stuff like that.

***** It certainly gets points for noticing the fact that Hogwarts is magical castle, I think that only HPMOR and "A Study in Magic" used this so well.

EDIT: And for starting as decent AU - not too close to canon, but without overkill.

EDIT2: This story is great, well done and unfinished. Well, nothing is perfect.

** Story where at least part of characters behave like intelligent beings (making more than one group smarter is recommended). And I really would like to see more stories with intelligent people that avoid instant cultural assimilation after encountering magical society (I know only about three that fit this criteria).

***** there's not really a lack of intelligence there, I don't think there would have been a muggle way to get rid of volde, otherwise Hermoine would have surrgested it, "magic must defeat magic" as the saying goes. However, the mind control thing i do agree with, that always seemed out of character for Hermoine, particularly with her being so against slavery

****** I am pretty sure that nuking Tom would result in second disembodiment (though there are good reasons to not do this) - anything else would be cheating. I think that snipers would be quite efficient in DE removal. And I would love to see Malfoy Manor destroyed by artillery/air strike, just for pure hilarity.

Obviously it would not fit canon style, plot and themes - but I would like to see more of this in fanfiction (I have seen attempts at this but it was either pure humor ([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784825/1/Old-Soldiers-Never-Die]]) or total failure (trench warfare would no happen with at least one side able to teleport around)).

******* In the sniper situation, nothings protecting the muggles from magic accio gun would be enough, and that's assuming there isn't a shielding charm against bullets. plus they wouldn't be able to see their targets, notice me not charms and the like. Magic is in total need of nerfing

******** Main point of snipers is that there is no time for reaction - bullet is faster even than its sound. Equipped with teleportation support (portkeys, side-along apparition) they may completely avoid detection. And I doubt that DE are constantly under notice-me-not (and this one may be solved by finding squib snipers). Shielding charm against bullets - it depend on author, it may range from "in century or two we will find spell for this", through "it worked once, or twice then everybody spend X time to layer protection charms" to "it is not working because guns stop working near magic".

** I'm such a canon-whore that I pretty much stick to Harry-centric stories that take place after GoF. I like long (novel-length) plotty stuff the best and really appreciate magic that follows the rules of JKR's world.

Ideally, I would love a series of fics that follow Harry through the years after the war into his magical crime-fighting Auror career.

**** I've only found one series following Harry through Auror school and while it's really great, it deviates from canon after book 5 because it was started before HBP was published.

It starts with year 6 and while there are some Potter fic cliches at the beginning, (Poor!Harry, Powerful!Harry, NotaTotalBastard!Snape) it really overcomes that with improved characterizations, fantastic relationships, Rowling-esque levels of important detail and a strong, driving plot.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3470741/1/Resolution][Resolution]]

The total is something like 1.7 million words, so if you start to read this, you'll be at it a long time.

If I ever find one that picks right up from DH and follows canon as JKR has said in interviews, I'll be recc'ing it all over the place.

Most, if not all, of us got into the books because of the adventures/setting/characters. We did not get into the books because of the sexual tension between Draco and Harry, because there isn't one.

** Maybe I'm a bit late, but I just found this sub. My favorite stories are set during GoF and have Harry in a different Triwizard tournament. More tasks, harder tasks, etc. Also, those where he is intelligent. But I'm tired of reading stories where intelligent!Harry means readsalotofbooks!Harry. Sure, reading is part of learning, but testing is more important. I'd like to see a fic where instead of buying a new wand and new trunk to live in and a truckload of spell books from knockturn alley, he makes what he needs, using runes, charms, transfig, potions, woodcarving, whatever. Sure, some of those need to be learned from books, but trial and error, learning by doing, and small projects leading on to bigger ones would be nice.

There are very few fics that do any of that very well. The sorting hat's stand and temporal beacon do a pretty awesome Triwizard tournament. Methods of rationality does okay with intelligence and has an alternative to the Triwizard. There was another that did well with intelligence and self sufficiency, but its plot was horrid.
