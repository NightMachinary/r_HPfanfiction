Hey all. I am currently writing a fic that involves a lot of uber-powerful supernatural entities that simply outclass human sorcerers, period. In doing so, I've realized I run the risk of sidelining characters like Dumbledore and Voldemort, despite their brilliance, skill, and raw strength. As such I'm looking for inspiration on these 'terrible, yes, but great' characters.

Things I'm looking for include:\\
- A charismatic, politically savvy, and completely evil Voldemort whose very name inspires terror.\\
- A Gandalf-esque Dumbledore, in that he is wise, kind, capable, and if angered, utterly terrifying.\\
- Creative uses of magic, including canon magic, magical creatures and entities, rituals, cultural differences in magic.\\
- Creative interpretations of mind-magic, with purely mental battles between accomplished Legilimens.\\
- Extremely powerful beings, gods or eldritch horrors or what have you.\\
- A MC (probably Harry) with potential to be the Dark Lord's equal, but has to struggle and cheat to get there.\\
- I tend to get frustrated with SPAG errors, so preferably technically well-written stories.

Things I'm not looking for:\\
- Bashing of any characters.\\
- Romance. I'm fine with peripheral romances of non-Voldemort characters.


** Linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) but it's very slow in getting there and Voldemort is only seen in someone else's memory.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** You should find quite a bit of inspiration by reading NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series. Without any cheats but mere curiosity and some reasonable talent for magic, Albus becomes from nearly a squib at the beginning into someone comparable with Dumbledore by the end. And he is not even the most powerful because both the antagonist and the mentor are even more powerful.

The magic introduced in that series is unique in its own sense but it ties in a very believable way with the one created by JKR.

While not entirely helpful, the main antagonist is also very charismatic and ruthless at the same time (although he has different goals than Voldemort) and the occasional appearances of portrait Dumbledore always remind you of what a great wizard he was in life.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** A personal favourite Dumbledore is from Ingenio ab Artifex. He's a little old, a little tired, enigmatic in a teacher-ey 'leading you to the point' sort of way, adores Harry as a grandson, and amiably manipulative like the most conniving parent ever. I can't link directly, since it's technically a violation of rule 8 (though completely non-graphic to the level of 'we went upstairs and had a great half an hour'), but here's the author profile.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7221605/JaimeJabs]]

There's another fic I cannot for the life of me remember where Dumbledore threatens the shit out of Malfoy for something or other - invites him in for tea and nibbles and says something along the lines of "That diary was important to your Lord, wasn't it? Also, you're eating his basilisk now. Won't he be pissed. Heh."

EDIT - did a whats that fic post and copperscale kindly found the name. It's Enter the Dragon on Questionable Questing. Basically, imagine a bigger AU around 'Harry is a Dragon and that's okay' and add in some inspirations from Shadowrun. :)

**** “You little tyrants have always been useful. You swirl like a whirlwind, drawing lore and devices into your chaotic storm. You kill off rivals, steal items of power, and break open hidden hoards. And eventually, thanks to a hero -- and sometimes with the help of the Lethe Touch or the Ritual of Home or the Dustukhíascue -- you and much of what you've gathered are destroyed.” Meldh straightened back up, smiling again. “You do the world much good with your attempted evil.”

From Significant Digits, Herpo the Foul to Voldemort.

**** A Mab level entity would be interesting. Maybe Iris could battle it indirectly then? Deny it access from the physical world. Kinda like what Thomas and the Archive are doing ? Or maybe imprison it through something like Demonsreach.
