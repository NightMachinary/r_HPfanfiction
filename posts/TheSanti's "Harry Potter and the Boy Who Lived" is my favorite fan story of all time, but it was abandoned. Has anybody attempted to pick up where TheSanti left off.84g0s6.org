Occasionally, when a story is abandoned, somebody else will express interest in continuing where the author left off. Has anybody done that with HPBWL?

I've been following that story for nine years. I'm desperate to see it completed.


** He did that surprise extra chapter idk a year or three back on DLP that got my hopes up, but since then officially abandoned. You can't really pick up this story.

I don't know if I'd want to read another Author's interpretations. Maybe if TheSanti officially sanctioned it. But I know I'd immediately start to talk like a fan of some obscure band with a new album.

"I guess this is okay, the earlier work was better though. I hope they get back to their roots."

Because as I read the new author's version in the back of my mind I would be hoping for TheSanti to dramatically return and start writing again.

The only abandoned fanfic that could work without some kind of sanction from the original is probably if it was written by multiple authors, and one of them left the project.

#+end_quote

FYI this is absolutely against DLP's rules and is pretty much the fastest, most direct way to be permanently banned there.

Continuing a dead fanfiction is considered in many (most?) places a form of plagiarism, and a particularly nasty form at that, because you're not making a derivative work, you're literally putting yourself into the author's shoes and laying claim to their right to tell the first version of the story.

Maybe you can explain what the difference is, because I tried, but I really don't see it. In either case you're taking away the author's right to the first version of the story.

****** The relationship between original authors and fanfic authors is different than between different fanfic authors. Specific fandoms evolve over time and any rules we might have develop and are either accepted or rejected. Not everyone agrees on everything, but there's a general consensus imo that you should have the blessing of the original fanfic's author to pick up a dead story. I for one would be pissed if I abandoned my WIP and then found out that someone else is laying a claim to how that story would have ended without even asking.

******** Ultimately this might be an issue where neither of us will be able to convince the other. The conflict arises when you'd have author A and author B. Author agrees with you, author B disagrees. Because of the opinion you hold, if you want to continue a dead fic by author A (even without their ok or linking the original fic), there's no problem. With author B, what happens? Do you disregard the author's wish to let the story rest in peace and wrote your continuation anyway?

Mind, I'm talking about the specific case of continuing a dead fic. If you want to write your own version (a fanfic of that fanfic), I have no problem.

****** A fan who writes a 6th year story before JKR publishes HBP is never going to subvert her ability to tell the authoritative version. JKR is recognised as the true author of the HP universe, not to mention the fact that she has legal protections.

If, on the other hand, you take the fic I'm writing and start posting follow-on chapters in competition with my own, they're both just fanfics. Author #1 has no ability to say their version is the true, authoritative version of the story, so author #2 has stepped into their shoes and taken away their right to dictate what their story is.

This is not just theoretical - it happened with Project Overlord and Kurinoone. The latter ripped off the former's work entirely then continued it, and yet no one has heard of Project Overlord whereas many people have heard of Kurinoone.

The other distinction is that JKR has given explicit blanket permission for people to write fanfic. Without that permission, all fanfic would indeed be plagiarism.
