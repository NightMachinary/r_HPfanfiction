I often open things and then forget why they're there. Do you recognise any? I'll stick with a story if people say it's worth it to. But at this point I've forgotten the reason of why I had them tabbed in the first place.

*Against the Moon by Stoplight Delight* :: I'm on chapter 65 and no idea how I got to this point. Seriously, how can I have read so much of a story with no recollection to what is happening....

*The Beurocratic Error* :: it kept being recced but I can't seem to get past the second chapter...

*The Eyes* :: I'm on chapter 2 and got confused.

*The Strange Dissapearence of Sally Anne Perks* :: I think I got a bit bored of this? Is it worth cracking on with it?

*The Story of Miles Brand* :: I don't even remember why this one is tabbed...

*As Red as Hearts and Autumn* :; again, I don't remember why this is tabbed...


** I really liked the SallyAnne one I think the prose is beautiful and the story is really touching. I think Dobby shows a lot of agency and his magic/abilities are valued. I like that it has them in 3rd year and there is no romance. It feels a lot like the first book in tone in that there are lots of details and scenes exploring the magic and history of the castle/wizarding world. And touches on themes of love, friendship, loss, and how children can often solve things because they have more natural curiosity to them.

So I mean I understand everyone looks for dif things in fanfic I often read darker fics where they are older or deal with more mature themes. I also like darker fics and horror and adventure. But I found this worth it for sure and it reminded me a little about how I initially felt coming into the Harry Potter universe back in the 90s.

*** That's a sweet description I love it üòä. Thank you. Yeah the bits I read did feel very Philosophers Stone era Potter. Which was a bit of a jump after reading so much like Marauder/First War fics you know? To suddenly have an innocent mystery again.

I'll.go back to it with a new head.

If you like dark fics, linkao3(Manacled by senlinyu) I thought was brilliant if you haven't already. A Handmaid's tale inspired story. A lot of mystery and secrets and tension and plot. It was really well written. The characters are a bit OOC I thought but in a good way that fitted them into the story. I would recommend it üòä

**** Thank u! Yes I tend to read several fics at once. I started manacled I think I'm on chapter 13 but I don't know that one I think I need to read in pieces cause it feels like just a pit of despair at the part I'm at. I have read other fics with ppl being held captive and with assault...I can't put my finger on why but this one bothers me more. Maybe it's the way the mind reading (total look at all her memories and all her thoughts and all her feelings) and the forced pregnancy that feels just so invasive and exposing.

***** Oh it got me. I read it all at once in a day or two but afterwards I had to read a bunch of agressively fluffy Wolfstar muggle AUs just to cheer myself up again... I don't even like fluff I just needed to read something that was the opposite of cripplingly depressing.

The first arc of Manacled is very dark. You're right it's very invasive and exposing and just harsh... Super interesting though I loved it. Draco was chilling it's great! The second arc from chapter 26 or something is...marginally lighter... It's a little easier to read after that which is something anyway. So you have that to look forward to!

Stick with Manacled. It is worth the read you will enjoy it. And if you need them, I'll send you my happy Remus/Sirius fics where theyre in a band and sappily adorable to balance out the sad üòãüòã

linkao3(Text Talk by Merlywhirls) - Texting conversation. Adorable. Very funny üòä.

  *The Beurocratic Error* :: it kept being recced but I can't seem to get past the second chapter...
#+end_quote

Personally, I really enjoyed it. I was a little wary at first since the summary gave me the impression it's all about Remus, and I don't really like him, but I gave it a try and it's good. There are some problems, but that's the case with all fics. The author spends quite some time with Sirius and tries to get into Sirius' head post-Azkaban, PTSD and grief which I feel many fics ignore completely.

#+begin_quote
  *The Strange Dissapearence of Sally Anne Perks* :: I think I got a bit bored of this? Is it worth cracking on with it?
#+end_quote

I think it took me a few years before I decided to read this fic. I saw it recommended everywhere, but I just couldn't get into it until one day, I was in the right mood, and I consumed it in a few hours. It's pretty short, only 10 or 11 chapters if I remember correctly, and quite enjoyable. Harry and Hermione solving the mystery of Sally Anne Perks was a nice change.

** I like several of those fics, but if they aren't for you, they aren't for you. There's too much fic out there to force yourself to read something you've forgotten.

The first two you mention are both quite long, and both follow a plot so standard that it's not really about the plot. Against the Moon is Marauders growing up; Bureaucratic Error is time travel Peggy Sue. Sometimes in those situations I'll read a few chapters out of the middle at random. If the character interactions grab you, keep going. If not, delete the tab.

** What kind of things do you normally enjoy? If you're only into Draco-Snape coffeeshop AUs, then you're not going to like any of those fics.

Haven't read Against the Moon or Miles Brand, so I can't speak to them personally.

The Eyes is one of my favourite fics and I adore cosmic horror in general, so I'm heavily biased in favour of this. If you're not into the weird, esoteric "It was indescribable and squamous and his mind snapped instantly!" type vibe of horror, it probably won't be for you.

Bureaucratic Error is a pretty solid time-travel fic with lots of Remus-Sirius interactions. Didn't find much particularly notable about it myself, but it's a solid fic if you're into that kind of content.

Strange Disappearance is pretty well written and I'd say it's worth reading at least once, but again, not an overly striking fic (IMO, your mileage may vary). I enjoyed it overall, but it's not a fic I'd chomp at the bit to reread.

As Red as Hearts and Autumn is pretty much just Marauder's scenes and Black Family drama (with some interesting background) that Sirius later introspects and mopes over. Some interesting plot ideas though, I found it worth reading.

*** I suppose im a big adventure person? Heroes battle the odds to save the day, that crap but I'll read anything. I'm assuming something in these tickled me if I opened them in the first place. I just don't remember what that is.

I'll give the Eyes another go so. But I might wait till im in the mood to properly concentrate on the story.

I really like Remus/Sirius so I'll keep Red as Hearts open and give B.E another whack. Im not far into it so my opinion isnt valid here but I think Remus being weirdly casual about losing his son and family is throwing me right now. He seems too happy and not at all confused about the fact he has timetravelled which... is an odd tone... But again, its probably to early for me to tell.

The other three I might bookmark so on your recs. I can't keep everything open its clogging my browser and my brain and driving me nuts!
