I've absolutely forgotten the name of the fic but I remember the premise really well. When Harry receives the letter from the ministry, aurors show up at Privet Drive. Harry freaks out and escapes on his broom. Aurors follow and die in a freak accident with a plane. One of the aurors' brother is furious and tries to have Harry arrested. Harry makes a deal with Scrimgeour and gets no sentence. Towards the end of the fic, Umbridge and the aurors invade Hogwarts. Harry and the auror duel and then Sumbledore makes an epic entrance on top of the stairs and looks down on Umbridge.

I can't believe I've forgotten its name so please help, it's been stuck in my head for the past week!

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
