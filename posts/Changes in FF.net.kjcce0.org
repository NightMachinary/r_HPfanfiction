Has anyone else noticed that [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] now doesn't have the ability to change things from mobile mode to desktop mode.

Have you also noticed that when you look at the site on Google, it's called Fanfiction /Mobile?/

Im not sure if this is specifically for me but I'm still curious.


** They do seem to be making changes and hopefully improvements. I'm glad we have direct message alert emails back for the first time in maybe years.

** They are making some large changes on the site and breaking a lot of stuff (hopefully, temporarily) all over the place.

** I find AO3 absolutely not easy to navigate but the opposite.\\
Without a recommendation here I wouldn't find anything on AO3 and the tag system is broken. Some stories have more tags than info what the story is about. FFN didn't invent the wheel either with their search, but at least it works.\\
Yes, I also noticed the changes that you can no longer switch to desktop mode and find it annoying. Let's hope they don't shot the databases with the changes.

*** They really need to put the desktop button back. I'm starting to get pissed.

** FF is also dying due to the more cancel culture of the community that harasses the writers. Archive seems to be the increasingly popular of the two lately because of it and it's easier to navigate. The filters aren't as simply as FF but the community is definitely nicer and it's actually looked over actively by staff instead of an update or two every couple years
