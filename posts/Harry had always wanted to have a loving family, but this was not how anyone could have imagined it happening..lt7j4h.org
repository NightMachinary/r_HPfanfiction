An idea where Harry forms a family from a lot of the magical creatures he comes into contact with. Some examples: Hedwig acts like an older sister by keeping him in check Norberta sees Harry as an older sister/mother due to Harry helping raise her The Basilisk is the mom who pushes him to do and be better The Hungarian Horntail is the mom who dotes on, worries about, and loves to keep Harry close

And whoever Harry decides to marry has to deal with all of the eccentric family members, this would be even funnier if it was a Fem!Harry because of the even stronger protection instincts

** Harry did a quick recap of his actual situation. Sometimes you had to stop to smell the roses. or better yet, sometimes you had to hide behind something and reevaluate your life choices.

Points in his favor: The summoning spell actually worked and his broom came to him. He was unharmed! not on fire or mauled, or torn apart. He was really close to the golden egg.

Points against him: the dragon was faster than expected. The status of his broom was unknown. His glasses were MIA. He couldn't actually move at the moment.

â€‹

This was the second time in his life that something big and scaly (and scary) snatched him up and wouldn't let him go. It was as unexpected as the first time. When the horntail plucked him from his broom in the middle of a dive, to the horror of the crowd watching in the stands, he expected to be squished like a bug, or roasted in her flames. Instead, she sniffed him a bit (and, oh boy, those FANGS) and after giving him a lick that made his heart stop, his hair stand and his glasses to disappear, shoved him under her right wing and settled over her nest.

---***

One day when Harry was about 7 years old, the Dursleys have had enough of Harry's freakishness and decide to put and end to it.

Vernon comes home from work one day and acts unusually nice to Harry, smiling at him and even tells him he doesn't need to cook dinner that night, that he brought home Hamburgers for everyone.

Harry is cautious, but starved not just for food, but also emotion, he joins his family for dinner. Dudley reaches to take Harry's burger after devouring his only to have his hand slapped away by his Petunia who encourages Harry to finish up before Dudley does take it. As he is drinking a glass of water, his memory gets foggy and passes out.

Unbeknownst to Harry, Vernon loads Harry into a dishwasher box and drives him out to the docks where a man hands him an envelope of money and puts the box into a shipping container where a number of other children are huddled against the walls. The doors are shut and a crane loads the container onto a departing ship.

*** Harry wakes up the next day still in the box. He hears murmuring from outside. When he opens the box the other children gasp. None of the other children speak to him, they all have one hand cuffed to the wall. A dim light is attached to the ceiling. A small girl with platinum blonde hair, and younger than him near the door is sobbing and reaching for a bag just out of her reach.

Still very confused, Harry crawls to the bag and opens it. Inside are various food stuffs, some it smells bad, but most of it is better than the scraps he received at the Dursleys. He passes some of it to the girl, and then proceeds to distribute it to the other children cuffed to the wall. He tries to get someone them to talk, but most won't even meet his eyes. When he is done, he has an old Orange and some bread for himself.

The next day, a slot in the ceiling opens up for a second and a bag falls in. Harry repeats the distribution. This cycle is repeated for a week before he gets enough information to understand his situation. These other children were taken from all over the UK along with himself. He had been the last to arrive after the others had been there for over 2 weeks. One of the men who had taken them had brought them the food before they left the port.

Harry estimated it was nearly 2 months before the shipping container was opened and 4 men came in and started dragging out the children. Harry resisted, kicking and clawing until one of the men punched him in the head connecting right where his lighting bold scar was.

A burst of energy released, partially accidental magic, partially something else. Both the men and the children that been unchained were sent flying. The ship itself let out a groan and began to list to the side. The other containers started to slide off the ship into the water with the one containing the rest of the children staying put at the bottom of the stack. That would not last long with the ship almost about to capsize.

Harry held on to a railing on the ship as he saw a few of the crew members fall over the side. He heard the scream of the girl who had been by the door and been taken out at the same time he had clinging to a railing near to him. As the ship got almost rolled over completely, the girl let go and fell into the sea. Harry couldn't hold on much longer so he dropped as well after her. Scrambling in the water as he had never swam before, he tried to reach the girl. Suddenly, he felt his clothes fill with air and he was able to move easily. He reached the girl and she grabbed onto him just as the ship near them completely flipped over and began to sink.

Almost an hour later, Harry and the girl found a wooden desk that had been part of the debris from the ship and climbed on top. Being that they were both very small, and the water was quite warm, they had no trouble fitting both of themselves on top.

Exhausted, they laid down and didn't speak as they floated away. When they woke up later, Harry finally introduced himself pointing to himself and saying, "I'm Harry, but most of the time people call me Freak."

The girl stares and responds a moment later, "My name is Lyra, but my family mostly calls me Squib." Harry of course has no idea what the nickname means.

**** They float for another 2 days when, starving and dehydrated, they wash up on a beach of a tropical island. Crawling up past the beach the found a small pool of water under a banana tree. After drinking, the two took turns throwing rocks at the tree finally knocking down a few bananas. While they are eating, Harry hears a small noise behind him but nothing is there when he looks. After eating, the two fall asleep. When they awake, there are about 2 dozen bananas laying next to them.

For the next few days, they explore the area around the beach, both of them feeling like they are being watched they attempt to get food on their own, succeeding in very small amounts, but when returning to the place they rest, finding fruits and berries, and various bugs which they avoid eating.

That night, Harry is woken by Lyra screaming, she says something about a hairy man who disappeared. Harry calms her down but stays awake the whole night. The next night, he stays up as well and after Lyra falls asleep, he feels a presence, but stays quiet and eventually, he sees what can only be described to him as 2 small men covered in white hair with large eyes creeping into their camp with bushels of bananas. As they are laying them down, Harry sits up and says, "Hello."

Both the small men let out a screech and vanish into thin air. Harry wakes up Lyra and tells her what happened. She scared, but Harry tries to calm her down, with some success telling her they are bringing them the food.

Each night, they try to stay awake and wait for the hairy men, each night trying to greet them, only for them to drop their gifts and disappear. After a week, they realize that it is more than just two different hairy men, but at least 4 or 5 that they've seen based on size and hair color shades. One night, one of the hair men is also carrying a small hairy baby and when they try to greet them, they as usual disappear, but the baby does not and seems to just hover in mid air. It then seems to float away.

Harry grabs Lyra and drags her after the floating hairy baby deeper into the tropical jungle than they have been before. The finally reach a clearing where they see the baby float up into the trees and disappear into the canopy. Not knowing what to do next, they lay down and wait for morning.

When the sun comes out, they can see what look like large nests across the tops of the trees surrounding the clearing and hear noises coming from them, rustling and murmurs. After a few hours, one of the hairy men comes out of a nest and slowly and cautiously climbs down to them. In the daylight, they can see now that it is some kind of monkey, but nothing like what they have ever seen before. It stands up nearly 5 feet tall, with eyes like an owl, hairless hands and feet, and a tail more like a Labrador than a monkey.

They stare at each other for a time before another of the creatures fades into existence next to them causing Lyra the let out a Yelp and both of the creatures vanish. Lyra looks around and apologizes to thin air before kneeling down and crying. Harry moves in to comfort her and as he holds her, a hand fades into existence next to them to hold them both. Then another hand, and another hand, and another; until there are 5 of the creatures offering them some kind of comfort.

***** Harry and Lyra spend the next week trying to figure out how to live with the creatures. It is very hard as the smallest noises tend to cause then to vanish, so Harry and Lyra begin to primary communicate with hand gestures. To their surprise and fascination, a few weeks later the creatures begin to mimic their gestures. A kind of communication between them begins as the creatures try to teach them to gather food and build nests.

After a month, a small rumbling can be heard in the distance and one of the creatures begins to glow blue before letting out a loud chirp and the entire clan vanishes. A plane is seen flying over the island and Lyra tries to hide in a small nest she built but it collapses in her struggle to get in. She panics and looks around for a spot to hide while Harry motions her to come to a hole he dug out in the ground as he is not a very good climber. Lyra is frozen in place and just curls into a ball on the ground.... And then vanishes.

After the plane has passed, the creatures come out and walk over to where Lyra disappeared and scoop up an invisible Lyra and hold her, until she fades back into sight. A number of them begin to coo and make happy noises and Harry explains to her that she vanished like they do. When asked, Lyra explains that she was scared more men were coming to take her and she just tried to disappear... And then she did. After another few days, Lyra was able to do it at will.

After another few months, so could Harry.

After a year, the baby they had seen before was almost their own size and could communicate with them in basic hand gestures almost as well as the did with each other. They almost never spoke out loud anymore. One time Harry observed Lyra signing to their young friend that he was a much better brother than her last one.

Occasionally, one of the creatures would glow blue and often times the clan would hide. Sometimes it was because of a plane, others because of a crocodile from a inland lake was venturing near their nest area. One time a large hooded snake came near but Harry simply yelled at it 'GO AWAY' and it left. Harry swore he could hear it say, 'Fine!' as it disappeared into the underbrush.

****** Years later in a castle, far off in Scotland, a magical quill scribbled green writing onto an envelope. From another room, few pieces of parchment flew into the room, folded themselves in half and slipped into the envelope. A pot of bubbling wax nearby lifted itself up and poured a dollop of melted wax onto the back of the envelope and a stamp was pressed on top.

A large owl swooped down and studied the writing on the outside before letting out a loud hoot and flying away without the envelope.

5 minutes later a tall woman wearing a pointed hat, glasses and a Scottish Tartan walked in and picked up the envelop to gasp and look confused.

On the envelope was written:

Harry James Potter

Philippines

Invisible

  Cast out by the Dursleys during a horrible childhood, Harry washes up on an unknown island. Stranded with another who had been thrown away by her family, the two of them build a new family with a small group of intelligent creatures. How long can they stay alone on the island with so many unknown threats and people that are out looking for them?

  During the First Task, Harry realises she can understand the Horntail and instead of outflying her, tries to talk to her. And is promptly adopted. No one is sure what's funnier, what the presence of a strong maternal figure (however unorthodox) is having on Harry, or Charlie Weasley's happy sobbing at the new focus of his magic PhD.

** Actually, the Hungarian Horntail the weird aunt who is slightly zany but you love visiting her all the more for it; it'll either end in a trip to the movies, or in learning a dozen new swear words in another language. You just never know.

** The Brazilian boa constrictor is the cool, DudeBro uncle with a place in Maui that he won in a not-even-sorta legal poker tournament. He (somehow, blame magic) teaches Harry how to surf and do tricks that are not even close to any definition of safe or age-appropriate. The Horntail, Norberta, and Hedwig all threaten him with dire consequences should Harry suffer the slightest injury.
