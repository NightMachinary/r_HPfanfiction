So that whole Lord Potter thing is a guilty pleasure of mine. Any good recommendations, preferably some where HP uses his trillions of galleones for something. If it includes a manor, double plus good. Thanks!

  Everybody has a Wrong Boy Who Lived story in them, and everybody has a Slytherin!Harry story. This is mine for both. AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.

*** This is my favourite fix of all. I love it to an absurd degree and reread it frequently. It is /literally/ a 'f-you' fic.

  (Current specialization: the post-OOTP genre.)In case you've ever wanted to write such a fic, but didn't know where to start.Reader input encouraged! This is a rough draft at best.

  #+begin_example
      Welcome to the Independent\!Harry genre\. Currently, we're focusing on the post\-OOTP branch\. Others may be covered later\.
