Since we're all in this quarantine together, I wanted to ask you for your recommendations.

What is one of the best Harry Potter Fanfictions in your opinions, and why? Or which one should everyone read? Which one is the most original? Which fanfic will always stay with you?


** You've probably already read this one, but the fic "Oh God, Not Again!" will always be my favorite. It handles time travel really well, Harry isn't overpowered, it is very humorous, and it is well written.

** Alrighty time to list my favorites

Make A Wish - linkffn(2318355) - Most original thing I have read, and I wish there were more stories like it. Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot]] is original and a good read.

Picnic Panic - linkffn(12265183) - Most touching fic in my opinion and one that is always going to stay with me.

Dancing in the Green - linkffn(11703507) - I just like this one a lot

Ice Cream - linkffn(13323518) - This one is cute and I like to share it.

Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent - linkffn(13133746) - One of the best Harry and Daphne fics out there and has good read and reread quality. Its sequel is just as good.

Harry Potter, Squatter - linkffn(13274956) - A good crossover story that great for killing some time and is very touching and original in its execution.

Inspected by No 13 - linkffn(10485934) - A good fun crack-fic that is well done. One to be shared with others for sure

Most of you will probably know of this one, but here Harry travels back into his 11-year-old body and decided to change to course of the war. It has some very slight Dumbledore bashing, and is very Weasley centric. Does make Harry a little all-powerful.

linkffn(12317784)

Stepping Back is probably my overall favourite story. Believable story and good characters. TheBlack'sResurgence is one of the best Fanfiction authors out there, undoubtedly one that manages to create a really good villain. I enjoyed reading pretty much all of his works from the beginning to the end. This one is just a tad bit better than his other one, which will shortly follow, simply for the last couple chapters and the ending alone.

Harry Potter/Bellatrix Black.

2nd

linkffn(12155794)

Honour Thy Blood is in its base rather similar to Stepping back. While the plot is completely different, you really notice that it is written by the same person, which is nothing to be annoyed about. Again, really good read from start to finish, slightly disappointed by the ending though. It left a slightly bitter taste after finishing it.

Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass.

3rd.

linkffn(11191235)

The Prince of Slytherin is one of my all-time favourites. This is largely due to the fact that you really notice the maturing of the author over the latest chapters. The author combines a lot of common, and not so common, tropes and creates a believable world that surrounds his great plot. One of the few stories that I really regret not being able to binge read in one sitting, as it is yet not finished. But judging by the length this one is already at, I hardly believe that would be possible. Really Really Really recommend you to get a read on, soon you will find that the rush of dopamine when looking in your inbox and seeing a new chapter is really something.

/No paring as of yet./

joined 4th.

linkffn(12511998)

If you enjoyed Stepping Back and already finished it, here is something that, again, is rather similar. I have a feeling that this one was majorly inspired by TheBlack'sResurgence /Stepping Back./ The major critique with this one is the ending as well, it just ended so suddenly. I actually had to reread the chapter to be sure that I didn't miss the end. Still, even though it felt like the author simply tried to wrap the story up, it was an enjoyable read.

Harry Potter/Bellatrix Black.

joined 4th.

linkffn(11446957)

I read A Cadmean Victory a long time ago, but I still remember it being a really good story. There are some rough patches all though this one but I really liked the open ending, allowing the reader to imagine their own ending. I can only encourage you to read this one.

Harry Potter/Fleur Delacour.

joined 4th.

linkffn(6535391)

I loved the concept of Letters by TE7 from the start. It really managed to embed itself into the Harry Potter canon, allowing the reader to pick this up easily. The characters create a strong imprint, I highly recommend reading if you have the time.

Harry Potter/Fleur Delacour.

joined 7th

linkffn(13140418)

As somewhat of a mixture of TheBlack'sResurgence's story-styles and A Cadmean Victory, this one, /Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament,/ manages to find a really nice mixture of head- and actually canon. It has two major critiquing points though, one being the fact that it remained unfinished until now, the second being that there was a completely unnecessary and even annoying OC added, which I personally strongly dislike. At some point in that story, there was also a strong tank in quality which made the good work from the beginning fade into the background of the head. The only reason this is currently in my mind is the fact that I recently read this one, but it might have looked up from after the thirtieth chapter, I paused reading after that, so I can't really give feedback on that.

Harry Potter/Fleur Delacour/Daphne/OC (:/)

joined 7th

linkffn(12021325)

I really regret having to put /Antitheses/ this low on this list, it deserves a higher place. But the ending, overall feel of the story and especially the deep Depression this one drove me into drag it down a bit. The real world and relationships created by /Oceanbreeze7/ are phenomenal, the plot that grants no mercy on the characters is highly unique. This is something for dark rainy fall days. Still, highly recommended if you're looking for fanfic which you will remember in a few years still.

9th

linkffn(13398928)

The Son of Grindelwald by OfMiceAndLice follows an interesting trope but is yet to be finished. I really hope this one continues to be updated, currently, we see one now and again, there are usually quite long chapters. A drawback here is the fact that the author rambles a lot, meaning there are only a few conversations and a lot of describing going on. On the upside, this is one of his strengths, managing to create a vivid picture with his descriptions. One of the reviews describes that really well, saying: " It is fascinating how you are expanding the magical world with little tidbits of information and painting a vivid picture. [...]" The characters are also a strength, together with a plot that slowly takes shape. If this one ever gets finished, it might be a couple 100k long.

Harry Potter/Fleur Delacour

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I always enjoyed Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot. The story starts shortly after Harry hears the prophecy. Feeling overwhelmed he decides to "take a vacation and live a little". The story has him having all sorts of adventures where many of them are either pure luck, mistaken assumptions etc that leads everyone to believe that he is a legendary wizard. Lots of humor and it is basically a very fun read. There is a sequel called The Hunt For Harry Potter, and a compilation of omakes for Make A Wish called Mr Black Omake Collection
