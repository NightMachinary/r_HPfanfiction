I think there's some potential for interesting plots. Any ship, any length, preferably good writing.

Thanks!


** There are, but they are poorly written, incomplete, and the characters are not fleshed out well at all. I honestly don't even remember the names of the fics.

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

** I love this one, partially because it shows James II connecting to Dumbledore over their sexuality and it's interesting to see a grown man react to the marauders, but mostly because it's really well-written.

  Twenty one year old James Sirius Potter never expected to go back in time to the seventh year of the Marauders. And he certainly never expected to fall in love there. But James doesn't belong, and the fate of Sirius Black has already been written.
