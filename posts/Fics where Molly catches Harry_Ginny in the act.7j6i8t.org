** I do think its weird how it seems like are more Harry/Daphne marriage contract stories and more Harry/Ginny soul bond stories than stories where two hormonal teens who are into each other & sleeping across the hall every summer make like mammals.

*** because authors often have no idea how people actually naturally enter relationships and just use a plot device to do it for them.

*** Totally. I don't even know where the whole "marriage contract" concept in fics came from, since marriage contracts are never mentioned in canon even once as something that exists in the Wizarding world.

I dunno; maybe it's something that was added into the books for translations in countries where marriage contracts are more common, and then people from those countries wrote fics with that theme, and it took off from there. That's the best explanation I can think of.

**** I think they mostly come from the fact that arranged marriages are a big part of romance books. With Goblet of Fire setting up the concept of involuntary, unbreakable contracts it creates an easy device for arranged marriage fics.

**** Ehh... No? Adding concept that doesn't exist into officially published stuff and you get sued for copyright.

How about a more simple reason like "this is fanfiction and the author writes what he likes"? :D. Like, someone needed a quick way to pair up two people but didn't want to (or didn't have the skill to, this is fanfiction) flesh out their relationship, so 'Bam!', marriage contract.

Another person saw that, then thought 'How about a story where two MCs struggled because of a contract?'. He wrote that. People liked that, so the concept caught on.

I mean, even if it doesn't exist in canon doesn't mean that it's impossible to think of. Just like "Ice Queen" Daphne, Hermione bashing, overly helpful goblins, Lordships, Dark!Powerful!Independant!A whole host of other qualities that Harry doesn't have!But in the end he still turns out to be an edge lord! Harry.

There are some examples of things that were changed in translations around the world to reflect other countries' cultural norms: for example, [[https://medium.com/the-curious-storyteller/lost-in-translation-harry-potter-in-arabic-6ebd2e4f65de][the Arabic translations]] removed references to non-married characters kissing and to characters getting drunk (with the exception of the Death Eaters, since they're the villains). I wondered if maybe someone translating the books into, say, Arabic or Hindi had added in a similar reference to a marriage contract somewhere - perhaps in HBP, where Bill and Fleur are engaged? I'll admit I may be off base here, but it might be more plausible than you think. But I'll agree that an author not knowing how to write a relationship progression is equally (and probably more) plausible.

** Im sorry, did you say Harry/Ginny sub? Is this a thing for most pairings? Tell me there's a Sirius/OC Marauder era sub!

Ps - I feel like Molly wouldn't really care ..so much. She's raised boys, I'm sure shes walked in on them once or twice. Ron, however..

*** There's a Harry/Ginny sub and a Harry/Hermione sub, both of which you can find in the sidebar of this sub (look where it says "related subreddits"), but as far as I know there's no Marauders-themed sub. (No Harry/Luna sub, either... Booooo...)
