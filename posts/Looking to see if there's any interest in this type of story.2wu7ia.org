Basically it's Harry after he dies, and wakes up to learn that his life is a video game. I know there's 3-4 out there right now, however they're all below 80k, (1 around 76k repeats a lot of the info over and over, whereas the rest are around 30-50k).


** If you can make it an interesting story, sure. Like, if there are actual plot points, character development, narrative flow, etc. I've tried a couple fics like this and they, for the most part, use the video game mechanics as an excuse to devolve into munchkinism. YMMV, of course.

*** I am aiming for something that has a story, I have a strong dislike for fics with no plot whatsoever. I don't plan on an OP Harry, however, with this specific type of story (video game related) it will be hard to not have a more powerful than canon story line. Unless you go full on humour.

I'm a bit confused. Would you mind clarifying what you mean by munchkinism?

***** I actually didn't mind it so much in Natural 20 - it was pretty tongue-in-cheek and the writing carried it. Although I've only read the first 5 chapters or so, so I can't really say for sure.

** Yes. I'm unfortunately infatuated with this trope at the moment, and finding well written versions of it in fandoms I enjoy has been a small struggle. As long as you take feedback on it and such, I'd be happy to see another story in this line floating around!

** Yeah i like the idea , obviously (as everything) there are many ways to make it an horrible story if you make the characters use game-breaking mechanics. The main thing i don't like the concept of everyone else exept the protagonist (i've read one where hermione was the PC) is the PC and all others are NPCs .

I toyed myself with the concept of "harry" being a post-singularity being that created an universe for his own amusement based on some books (/eye twinkle/) he read but something got wrong and he ereased his memory/powers. Obviosuly it's silly :)

Anyway would i read it? Most likely yes

ps: please if you do don't copy/Paste the character sheet 12 times each chapter , just post it once at the start and once at the end of each chapter in the story , please, just put the relevant bits.

** Yeah, I'd love a story like this. The HP community could really use a version of this that isn't abandoned. I have no problem with munchkinism and/or crackfic, as long as it's funny. But if you want to try and use this idea in a serious fic...more power to you, though I have no idea how it could be managed.
