A group of wizards and witches gather together to form a thieving squad that steals from muggle museums. They could do it slyly, like duplicating paintings and stealing the original, leaving the copy in its place, or they just straight up steal it. The ministries try to catch them, but due to the talent of the thieves they can't catch them.


** Wizards stealing from muggles would be way too easy until they get into trouble with the magic government.

There's two fics I know that are somewhat similar:

Linkffn(The Granger Principle) is in an alternative universe without magic, but Hermione is a dimensionally stranded witch. No wand, a limited number of potions with no way to make more, and they have to break into several high security places. Less stealing paintings and more kidnapping enemy spies for interrogation though.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has Hermione leading a small group of thieves who break into magical places like the Ministry and Malfoy Manor. Heists are very challenging and the aurors do try very hard to catch them.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.
