** I wrote a Mr Black Ã— PJ crossover. If you've read 'Make A Wish' you know what I'm talking about.

Not exactly MOD, but in the same veins. Do give it a shot.

** Huh sounds interesting. I've read a lot of PJO crossovers but they mainly involve Percy and a few of the Seven Demigods (and/or Nico and Reyna and sometimes Will) going to Hogwarts post OOTP to protect Harry/stop Voldemort. I actually think I did read one fic where Nico was dating a MOD!Harry?

** The only ones I have seen so far where Harry is Mod and (not necessarily dimension traveling) in the PJO verse are Fem!Harry and almost always shipped with Hades. So I too would like to know if there are fics like OP asked ðŸ˜…
