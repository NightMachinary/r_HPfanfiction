basically i am looking for any harry potter fanfiction, regular or crossover, that has Harry as an alchemist.

two conditions, cannot be a slash fic.

i in no way wish to read about two men doing the horizontal tango. nothing wrong with that, just not what i am looking for in a story.

second condition, harry must be the main character and focus of the fic.

i have seen MANY crossovers between Harry Potter and Fullmetal Alchemist, most involve one of the FMA characters as a professor at hogwarts or something along those lines. in almost every fic i have found the FMA characters are the focus of the fic. i have found very few fics that focus on harry or make him an alchemist.

so, that is the long and short of it. looking for a Harry-centric fanfic with Harry as an Alchemist. preferably one that is a decent length, but i am none too picky in that regard.

thank you for your time.

*** thanks, i'll give it a look. i think i glanced past it once or twice, but "Wrong Boy Who Lived" fics are not favs of mine, so it could be why i skipped it. still, could be worth a look.

**** I can't blame ya on the WBHL dislike, but if you dislike the fic, one of the others I had was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10602908/1/Transmuting-Freedom][th]][[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9EsHbqmjN4][is]] fic that, if I remember correctly, had him researching Alchemy.
