I'm looking for a story in which the following scene (or something similar) has played: Harry claims to have turned to the Queen for help. The Queen knows nothing. It turns out that with the help of magic, someone prevented Harry from being helped. Harry wants revenge.

Do you hate it when you remember a small part of a story, but the framework of the story, or the title, you can not remember? I'm not even sure it was a good story.


** If it was a crossover than this happens in my fav story Potter's Protector linkffn(7665632)

There wans't really any revenge for it more justice.

** I remember something else. Harry wrote one or more letters to the Queen. It received no reaction. Harry accuses the Queen of that. But not directly to her, but in the media, or others in his environment. Someone informs the queen about the accusation. It is being tested. It is found that the Queen unconsciously ignores certain things.

***** Oh you silly colonials and your experimental government.

In earnest though, monarchies of some form or other still make up over 20% of modern nations (43 of the ~ 200 nations of the world). While absolute monarchies like you may be thinking of are not too common in our current age (though some do still exist with the most influential being Saudi Arabia, ruled by the house of Saud), a decent number of countries are constitutional monarchies. For example, the 16 members of the commonwealth realms (canada, australia, Jamaica, UK, etc.) all have queen Elizabeth II as their sovereign, while Denmark, Spain, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Belgium are all examples of other European countries that still have a monarchy.

****** I'm honestly so confused right now. There are English speaking, Internet using people that don't know Queen Elizabeth II. And I don't say that to be mean or anything, there are many much more important things I don't know myself but it had just never occurred to me that somebody connected to "the western world" might not know her. If you had asked me who I thought the most famous person in the world is, I would have said the Queen
