Thinking about it because of Grindelwald :P Not saying he was completely right, but he /has/ a point.

In the context of the HP world, wouldn't it make more sense to have wizards create their own nation rather than just blend in with their native countries and hide? If Muggles can hardly harm witches or wizards, why is there a need to hide themselves? Then if Muggleborns crop up here and there, an emissary of that nation can scoop up that child and formally inform his/her community about their powers, rather than just have their guardians lie to explain were they disappeared off to.

Unless the Statute is more than just an agreement between wizarding nations, I'm really having a hard time accepting its practicality.


** no government would allow such a threat to exist. You would steal the baby of parents, making "the magic country" a public enemy to any other nation. Why give potential death machines to another country if you can keep them yourself?

What would you gain from it in the first place, previously you just had to obliviate people, now you have to make sure noone uses imperii defense, have public representants so people will give you their childres, somehow guarantee other nations your people are not helping their enemies and lets not forget that everyone wants your magical healers.

Also witch hunts in the middle ages, who says it wouldnt happen again, why risk it?

Who will lead such an incredible diverse country, where would you put it.

No one would steal the muggleborn babies. It can be a mutually agreed upon decision of the wizarding nation rep and the muggleborn's parents should they wish to have the child grow up there or let them join them at the agreed upon age.

"Dangerous" nations already exist now and in general governments tolerate them in the name of the greater good.

Keeping things secret from society is what leads to corruption. Given how powerful wizards can be, I am frankly shocked that only 2 have made a power grab (Voldemort and Grindelwald) in the last century.

A lot of the problems that arise between muggles and wizards is due to a lack of communication. If these sectors of society have an open dialogue, maybe they can reach an agreement.

It can be like the Commonwealth. There doesn't need to be a singular nation.

Oh they definitely would. Magic, even the relatively weak version shown on canon is stupidly OP. The potential for magitek ensure various countries and corporations will attempt to hoard their own stocks of magicals. Besides, why would a nation grant sovereignty for the magicals anyway?

Governments only allow dangerous nations when it's infeasible for both of them to attack each other. But the magical nation have hundreds of potential super-powered spies randomly born all over the world. Thus, it's very possible for the magical nation to attack the Muggle governments, and its also very possible for the Muggle nation to target the muggleborn or their family.

But opening up also means the current rulers of the magicals lose their power. They have all the incentive to propagate negative (real or imagined) impressions of Muggles. Officially and openly holding their own sovereignty means the headache of trading regulation, managing security etc, all of which they can skip by being an isolated system that pay lip service to the government, without paying any taxes.

The small magical population unfortunately made them prone to instability when split into smaller countries. Just a couple of years worth of subsidizing and encourage known Muggleborn parents to keep popping off another child will result in predominantly hyper patriotic Muggleborn generation enough to take over a small magical nation.

** 1. It's annoying to deal with muggles; the witch hunts are irksome and time-consuming to avoid. If they revealed themselves now, muggles would have a lot of questions, problems, and expect solutions from wizards.
2. Wizards, like muggles, are not a completely unified group. Why don't all the countries on Earth unite to form one country? No more wars or conflict between nations right? It doesn't happen because no country wants to give up power. Though I'd note that wizards are far closer to one country, see the power of the ICW.
3. It is much easier to regulate wizarding conduct with regards to muggles when the world is fully separated. Imagine if everyone knew wizards existed and wizards were free to cast spells in public. It's going to be far harder to track down someone using magic on muggles when everyone can cast magic freely in muggle areas.
4. Wizards look down upon muggles.

But wizards already use magic on muggles all the time and the wizarding government has a hard time tracking down these offenders. Sometimes they don't even bother. But if the wizarding world is not a secret, using magic against muggles would be banned. Because no sane muggle government would allow such a thing. I always see people complaining about the use of Obliviate on muggles as it is a violation of their person. If muggles already know about magic and are protected accordingly, no such thing need to happen anymore.

**** I think it's the case of it's easier to find a needle in a stack of hay than a stack of identical needles. It's not good now but it'd be even worse. And the other reasons are there as well.

** Because the muggles would exploite and torture the magical creatures(and don't say they wouldn't you know they would).

The Statue of secrecy in the Harry Potter world also benifits the muggles, after all do you really think its a coincidental that right after a its created the muggle world starts down a path of over three centuries of accelerated progress?

Really there is just not enough magical people,animals,plants,resource,ect to let the muggle world anywhere near it. Because you know they would ruin it.

** Just look at one small slice. You can, via transfiguration, conjure material from effectively nothing.

How long do you think it takes for some enterprising company like FoxConn to start kidnapping muggleborns to become a new supply of rare earth metals? Or just the US government conscripting them to provide water to LA?

The biggest thing the Statute of Secrecy is protecting the Wizarding World from is late-stage capitalism, and it's been in effect since before Adam Smith.

** Disclaimer: I haven't seen any of the Fantastic Beasts movies, so I don't really know or care about Grindelwald's exact philosophies.

Why was the Statute of Secrecy created? The answer that most people will give you is that it was to protect witches and wizard's from witch hunts. That is at best a complete misunderstanding of history, and at worst a deliberate misrepresentation of history. The real reason is that witches and wizards are generally racist jerks who don't want to be bothered by muggles asking for their help. Now, magicals being racist jerks lording their superiority over the muggles may have also led to the witch hunts, but those witch hunts were largely ineffective, so there would have been no reason for them to spark a worldwide disappearance.

^{Sources: Rowling's W.O.M.B.A.T. tests, /The Wizard and the Hopping Pot/, and everyone who has ever complained about mugglewank fics because the muggles wouldn't stand a chance against magic.}

When you understand that background, it becomes clear that no, the Statute really isn't necessary. But magicals like it because they're still generally racist jerks. Abolishing the statue would not be very likely to hurt any magicals, but it would inconvenience them by getting a bunch of muggles to tell them to get off their lazy arses and spend a few days turning the world into a post-scarcity utopia already. And that would be /so/ bothersome.

And yes, moving to Antarctica and using a bunch of weather charms to make it a paradise would accomplish most of the same things the statue does and make some things easier. But it would probably be harder to relocate all of the magical plants and animals too, and it probably wouldn't keep the muggles away quite as well.
