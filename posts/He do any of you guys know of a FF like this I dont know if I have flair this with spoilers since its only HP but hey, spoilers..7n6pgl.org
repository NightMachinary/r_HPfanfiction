So I KNOW were not the only ones to have thought of this, so there has to be like a fan fiction or something somewhere one of you guys is working on. What if instead Harry going into the car with Ron, that car was full and Draco was by himself? He goes down the COMPLETELY wrong path, and Nevill winds up becoming the chosen one, but key plot points are still in play. Goblet of fire Harry still gets chosen, Sirus instead of wanting to adopt Harry sees too much of Voldemort in him and shuns him only deeping Harry's hatred, eventually either being directly involved in or killing Dumbledore himself but either way he would still become a Death Eater.

My whole idea with this is he was in an abusive household, why did he turn out morally correct? I'm not saying all people who grow up in an abusive household don't turn out alright, but with the level of abuse he had it doesn't make sense.


** Abused Harry joining Voldemort has already been done ad nauseam.

Harry shagging Voldemort or being shagged has also been done ad nauseam.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione going dark together and becoming a power of their own is however extremely rare. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/][This one shot]] might give you some ideas.

Finally, this sub generally hates canon rehashes.

**** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is an excellent dark Trio fic. It's postwar however and pretty much the only one of its kind.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** It may have been done but it has not been done well. Dark Harry threads are on here around once a week and every time I see them none of the Fics are something I would call "great". We don't have the definitive fic or even a few great ones. As much as it is annoying to see edgy dark harry stories, which plague us at every turn, there is a need for well written ones.

***** Then give it a shot. The writing improves a lot as the story goes along too. It's been a while since I read it, but the first few chapters could be a bit rough, from what I remember, though shouldn't be too bad either.
