******* I'd love to see a one-shot where Harry's eyes actually are Killing Curse green. Kick it up a notch by adding that simply being around a Killing Curse nauseates due to the exposure to Things That Should Not Be. This is why people don't throw it around in battles: it throws but the most hardened off-balance every cast.

Whenever Harry is surprised or otherwise stops actively suppressing it, his eyes shine with the curse and everyone feels the effects of being around it.

** Harry smirked smirkily at the sneering slytherins, then responded to Draco with a witty power-play alluding to his daddy issues. Beside him, Blaise, Daphne and Theo smirked just as smirkily because they were almost as clever as Harry himself and were the only first years who understood his stunning machiavellian mind games, while Tracy watched on anxiously. She had just come to the conclusion that every slytherin except for her must have a curse causing them to make ridiculous facial expressions all the time. Realizing she was the odd one out, she tried to smirk smirkily, but it came out as a normal smile instead.

Pansy sneered at her. She looked ridiculous.

*** I don't know. Those fics tend to have smirk more than sneer.

Blaise said with a smirk. Nott said with a smirk. Hadrian finished with a smirk. Daphne smirked.

Draco is probably the only one sneering as he says something about muggles, mudbloods or something Hadrian did.

Snape would be handing out imperceptible nods acknowledging Hadrian as Lily's son and not James.
