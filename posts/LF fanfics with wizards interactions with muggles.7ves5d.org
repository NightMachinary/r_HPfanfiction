Note its wizards gawking at muggles not the other way round.

Essentially, I was reading the great Aunt Marge's even bigger mistake by the great [[/u/FloreatCastellum]]. linkffn(11982933). I loved the small scene of Ginny being so intrigued about muggle stuff.

Is there any other fanfics that address this? If its canon compliant it would be a bonus.

I would guess it will be more of an Arthur thing. '

*** 1. Thats the opposite from what I want unfortunately. I want a curious wizard looking at muggle stuff.

2. Its on my read list already :) but I am kinda waiting for it to finish before i read it. I love canon compliant stuff anyway so Northumbrian stuff is high up my list

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.
