I'm re-watching Ouran High School Host Club and wondered if there are any fics out there where Hogwarts has a host club.

To be clear, I'm not necessarily looking for actual crossovers, though I don't mind the OHSHC characters at Hogwarts as long as the HP characters get plenty of screen time.

I'd also prefer if the fics keep with the teen-rated tone of OHSHC. I'm not interested in fics where the host club is just an excuse for Harry to shag as many girls as possible.

(Slash versions also acceptable, if such a thing exists.)


** Dang, that would be fun ðŸ˜Š The only obvious characters would be the twins tho...

*** I don't know, it doesn't necessarily have to be a direct correlation where HP chars replace OHSHC chars, although I did immediately think the twins would be totally into it.

But I think Cedric would be good. Maybe Oliver Wood if you can drag him away from the Quidditch Pitch for a while. Seamus, Dean... Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, perhaps.

If you went the crack route then Leather-Pants!Draco would certainly fit in.

** Sorry for continually commenting, I just read through [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9075486/1/Hogwarts-Host-Club][this]] incomplete one and it really had me hooked as far as it went.

You mentioned that you don't want it adult, so I should note that it is a little dark, and hints at slash, and sub-dom themes, but there are no lemons

*** I don't mind adult, per se, although I'm not a huge fan of it, but I can imagine a host club fic being used by some as an excuse for Harry to sex it up with half the girls in Hogwarts, which I'm really not into.

As for that fic--don't much care for D/s themes, but a little dark, hints of slash (presumably between Harry/Riddle based on that first chapter) /and/ no magic AU... yeah, I'm into this. Thanks!

*** In the show (an anime), it's a bunch of handsome boys playing host to the girls of the school. They serve tea and snacks, sit and chat with the girls, generally treat them affectionately---calling them "princess" and giving compliments, etc. Often times they dress up to some theme (e.g. in the show they have traditional Japanese garb from different eras or as policeman; in Hogwarts they might do old wizardry or muggle style) and play up to it a bit.

In the show's narration, the club is said to be "where handsome boys with too much time on their hands entertain the girls with too much time on their hands", and the leader of the group has also claimed that the host club "exists to bring happiness to girls". (Not necessarily in a romantic/sexual manner.)

  Dumbledore smiled benevolently. "It is my great pleasure to inform you that Hogwarts will play host to the legendary wizarding tournament and to three schools: the proud sons of Durmstrang, the lovely ladies of Beauxbatons, and the charming students of the elite and prestigious Ouran Academy of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
