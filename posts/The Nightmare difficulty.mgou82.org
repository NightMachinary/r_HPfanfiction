** Addition difficulty: Magical dwarven vikings from another dimension and magic system have come to once again invaded britan, and has been systematicly draining gringotts vaults for years, via the construction of a portal inside of an vault, leading to a multidimentional race to secure the cup horcrux, get Harry's funds back, and to get revenge for that one guy who got shot with an arbelast.

And they have tamed dragons.
