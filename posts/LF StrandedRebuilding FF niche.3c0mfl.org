I'm looking for quality fictions where there's no true enemy but the protagonists are stranded somewhere and have to survive .

Even better would be if they had to settle somewhere else and survive the perils of the new envoirment they are in.

I understand it's not a famous genre given the fact that there's no true villan but i've found a couple that follow this idea and i liked it quite a bit.

(for example : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8176056/1/Why-Time-Magic-Should-Be-Left-Alone][Why Time Magic Should Be Left Alone!]] )

Another one that now seems gone from FF.net (can't find it anymore) was about Harry & Hermione get put in a magical forest by dobby in 2nd year (voldemort is permanently dead)

I would prefer that the protagonists are somewhat mature and no slash please :)

I hope there's something out there , but i wouldn't be surprised if there were nothing =/


** The one that is gone was called "The Magic Words" FYI.
