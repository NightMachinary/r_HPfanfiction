** Interesting little thing that my brother mentioned (I think he saw it somewhere around here), the first 2 books were under 80k words which tend to be too short of stories for me on fan fiction. Even Lord of the Rings was only 177k. Since reading fan fiction, my concept of how long a book should be is absurd when I sit down and think about it.I regularly read fanfics with 150+k which is a mark that only the last 4 books reach. In fact, I set the search parameters to be 100k at least.

TL;DR: Fanfiction has spoiled me on story length. 300k or bust to even begin to call an epic.

*** The thing to remember re: the length of the earlier books is that they were aimed at children, so it understandable that they'd be notably shorter.

That said, I read something once a while ago saying that a novel averages at 90-130k, which from my experience is pretty on point. (I've started logging my digital books and their information, including word counts.) I've noticed that first novels tend to come in a bit shorter (70-90k) while later ones can be longer, but the longest in a series is not often the final one. (OotP, the 7th of 8 Dexter novels, the 37th of 41 Discworld novel). Stories aimed at young adults and teens tend to run shorter, but fantasy fiction sits higher than average (usually upwards of 150k). (When I say fantasy fiction, I mean the action/adventure focused stuff rather than fantasy romance, both of which I've not read a lot.) (Also, don't take my word on any of these or jump on me about errors; I'm only working on what I've seen and what I've noticed in the 200 books I currently have on my list, which I'm still filling in.)

Prefered lengths in fanfic probably vary depending on why someone reads. Most of the time these days I only read fanfiction sporadically, usually a little before bed or while in the lavatory, so for me short fics are better. (If it's longer than 15k but looks interesting, I stick it on my "To Read" list, which is growing longer and longer because I haven't been bothered to actually read anything on it in ages.) Others, like yourself it would seem, are looking for actual novel-length stuff, presumably preferring full plots and world- and character-building that you can't establish in short fics.

**** For me, I'm not reading polished professional works in FF. I'm reading someone's desires in an established world.

Combine that with most aren't able to condense their words as well as professionals I've found that they can't tell a story in less than 80k words.

I've found for the most part (and of course there are exceptions) if the fic is marked complete and is less than 70k words somethings going to be missing. The 10k difference can be negligible here.

If an author does a lot of FF overtime you usually see improved writing so they get better at using less to say more but overall they need the length to help convey ideas.

** Eh, drabbles could be longer than that couldn't they? Just as long as it's one chapter and only is part of a story that's never completed or isn't complete to our satisfaction?

*** Drabbles used to be 100 word counts exactly, anything longer used to be ficlet or vignette.

As with everything, things change over time. Whenever I see someone use drabble for anything longer though, I'm always thinking "that's not what a drabble is!"

** I never have understood how people read fics that are under 100K in length(except for smut) unless it has sequels; I mean as soon as you get into it it's already over.
