** Voldemort happened.\\
Then Shinvolka happened.\\
Then Malebolge happened. On and on and on, one dark lord after another for nearly a century.

Witches and wizards started disappearing en-masse; few who lived through one war were willing to commit to another. They took their family and friends (or themselves if they had none) and disappeared.\\
And there are many ways for a magical human to disappear; blend in with muggles, live in an expanded briefcase, become an Animagus, travel through time, move in with magical creatures...

Magical society could not survive with so few citizens, many of them thugs and bandits more inclined to rape and pillage under their respective dark lords than doing honest work.\\
The remains of the various Ministries of Magic were forced to merge into a world organisation to try and keep the Statute of Secrecy together. But between dragons, anti-muggle rampages by dark wizards, and sightings of innocuous mooncalves and winged horses, they fought a losing battle.

So, the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy withered away.\\
At first, trusted muggle scientists were given the task of researching magic, giving it technobabbly terms like 'remote force' and 'intangible machines' and 'applied exotic matter creating material illusion'.\\
They succeeded in replicating 'magic', developing new and amazing machines. The public was awed, and accepting of these computers that could apply 'complex telekinesis' and 'solid holograms' and so forth.\\
Then, a little more was revealed; how many creatures existed that possessed unconventional biological abilities, how there were species of human intelligence that had the abilities, how they could successfully cross-breed with humans...

Eventually, the dam broke. Uagadou and Diagon Alley and so many other magical places across the world were discovered one after the other. The whole, true story, from how witches and wizards hid themselves from the muggles to avoid bloodshed and genocide, to how a parade of dark lords caused their society to tear itself apart.\\
And, how there were very few magical humans left in the world, the rest dead or vanished.

Time passed. Centuries passed. Scientific research into the matter and forces once known as 'magic' led to rapid development of all levels of society and a doubling of the average human lifespan. Colonisation of Mars is a reality, the rest of the Solar System is within sight. Only a handful of subcultures remain of what was once the magical world. Humans, and other intelligent species born with intrinsic 'magic', learn a little about how to use it, but for the most part they rely on the same tools and technology as everyone else, relegating their personal superpowers to party tricks.

Enter young Harry Rubeus Potter, a half-giant named for his great grandfather and one of his best friends from centuries ago. He's a bit of a nerd, always playing video games and reading superhero comics on his wristwatch. He thinks it'd be cool to have superpowers; he can wiggle his fingers and make stuff float and the dishes put themselves in the dishwasher, but it's not the same...\\
Then, something interesting occurs; while he's helping to clean out his grandmother's house (again, where does she get all that junk?), he happens upon something old, from way back in the family...paper schoolbooks, bleh.\\
Hang on a moment, they're schoolbooks for a magic school, from centuries ago when magic was a thing...what's this, /The Essential Defence Against the Dark Arts/...?

** This sounds more like a prompt, and a really confusing one at that. So, what, do wizards decide twitter and Muggle medicine are better than regrowing skeletal structures and warping reality? Can't buy it. :o

**** If you're talking about a machine that can warp reality then okay. But I assumed OP was not asking for technological magic, just really good tech. Anything less than that will be inferior to magic.

****** I know but what I'm saying is that short of machines that can warp reality, there'd just be no reason to stop using magic, right? Like why join the Muggles when food is easily summoned and replicated, security from the elements is a non-issue, security from (muggle) war and famine isn't even a problem, etc? Like I could make sense of some things like wizards adopting technology on a larger scale than the occasional train and bus, but dropping magic altogether would require something on the level of high technology from sci-fi (and even then, it'd need to be remarkable).

******* Right, and I'm not disagreeing with you. What I'm saying is that you /should/ assume the OP meant reality warping technology because he /specifically/ states that wizards /gave up/ magic.

You're arguing that in order for X to be true, then Y must be the case. But OP has already said X is true. So... So is Y.

*** I can't be too specific or I'll never get anything. To resum it up, we are now in the future. Just how current wizards are stuck in medival practices and outgrew staffs. Futuristic wizards have evolved from using magic at all for the convenience of not needing to hide themselves plus being able to use all the futuristic tech that has come out. They grow less and less dependant on magic as they get used to new tech to the point where magic is forgotten. Here comes in Harry who somehow gets a book on magic and rediscovers what has been abandon

**** I dunno. The problem I mainly have is that wizards would have “outgrown” magic for a reason. In a world where accidental magic can be overlooked as something technological to the point where no one even knows about magic? What would a magic book grant Harry that wizards wouldn't have felt the need to retain before essentially becoming no different from Muggles?

** I had a cyberpunk/HP idea brewing a while back that seems very similar. For that concept, I adopted the idea that magic was dwindling in power due to the rising skepticism of the population. The more they thought something couldn't possibly be real, the harder it was for it to stay real. Globalization was effectively pushing all the magical stuff out of the solid world.

**** Not really. The set up was quite depressing and I already write HP stuff that way. I also realized that the concept could be written up as an original short story without the HP elements, since most of what mattered was being twisted out of shape anyway.
