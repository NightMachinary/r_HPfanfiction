After somehow escaping Gold Experience Requiem's death loop, Diavolo suddenly finds himself in a different reality, where the Arrows nor Stands are non-existent, and within the mind of Harry Potter before he discovers he's a wizard. Harry soon learns about Diavolo's existence and now has to live with a paranoid mafia boss in his head and learn how to use King Crimson and Epitaph.

Diavolo occasionally takes control of Harry during life-threatening situations and to express dominance and strike fear into those he sees who are inferior (especially the Dursleys, Malfoy, etc)

Harry and Diavolo's relationship is complicated to say the least. Harry being uncomfortable with a mysterios man inside his head while seemingly being cared for from him. Diavolo acts as some sort of guardian who wants Harry and to another extension, himself, to rise to the top above everyone just like how he had done as the boss of Passione

Unlike Doppio, who was completely oblivious to the fact Diavolo was possessing him, Harry is fully aware and mentally talks with the mafia boss instead of through a random object as if it were a phone. Harry is also capable of using King Crimson and Epitaph at its fullest instead of only its arms and Epitaph

It also turns out Harry was born as a Metamorphmagus, allowing Diavolo to don his signature appearance (Pink hair with spots, fragmented green eyes) whenever he is in control.

Initially Dumbledore is unaware, but as time passes on, he notices Harry's unusual behavior at certain times and theorizes that there's something or someone sinister hiding within the Boy-Who-Lived

Voldemort encounters Diavolo/Harry for the first time during his attempt to gain the Philosopher's Stone. When Quirell tries to kill Harry, he suddenly finds himself in a different position in the room, having no memory of how it happened. He hears a noise behind him, biut before he can turn around, a white fist connected to a red arm bursts through his chest. Voldemort's spectre form escapes, not before going through a brutal beatdown from the Crimson figure. And he couldn't forget those eyes. It didnt belong to Potter. No, it belonged to a monster just like him, a demon.

Department of Mysteries, 1996

This wasnt how it was supposed to go. Acquire to Prophecy for the Dark Lord, and if possible capture the Potter boy. Plain and simple The boy disappered after they had cornered him. They scrambled around the Hall of Prophesies.

Soon, Lucius heard a scream, no doubt belonging to Bellatrix. He carefully navigated towards the source, and to his horror, the dark witch was on the ground, lifeless. She was surrounded by a puddle of blood with a large hole in her stomach. Lucius then saw something in the corner of his eye. On instinct, he sent a curse at a shadowy figure only realize the person was himself. He suddenly finds himself in the position of that figure.

Struck with absolute shock, Lucius could only freeze as he heard a voice behind him, with a tone as deep and cold as the Dark Lord

"Think of this as a gift, a farewell gift from the heart. In a moment you will cease to exist, so I will allow you to know now. What you witnessed and just felt, was your future self laid bare. Simply put your past self saw a future version. Now behold, know the almighty power of King Crimson. I obliterated time and leapt beyond it!"

Lucius suddenly felt unimaginable pain coursing through his back. He felt blood building up in his throat, and he couldnt help but puke

"It doesn't matter who it is, I shall never allow any cretin to threaten my eternal transcendence, not ever! The time has come for you to fade away!"

Lucius' stomach bulged before a fist came bursting out

"Lucius Malfoy, your position as Head of one the Noble and Most Ancient Houses has just been terminated. Now may the fires of Hell embrace you..."


** Harry, my sweet Harry...

Also, now there's two things in his head
