:END:
Does this ring any bells?

Also, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jh4qej/looking_for_an_old_marriage_law_2000s_fic_era/][still looking]] for that fic where Hermione makes magical education boxes for marriage law teen brides forced to leave Hogwarts. She traded... a skill? A vow? Something, in exchange for a pureblood's secret family spell for copying books.

*** Hurray! I remember liking it but found it overly reliant on people overhearing expositionary conversations to move the plot along. But I also remember enjoying it and so I wanted to reread it.

Thank you! <3
