This can happen Canon....i would accept paradox stuff. But in other cases, lets say Harry enters an AU and there he infiltrates the DE. His behavior for within the Group doesnt matter, but i would like if he kills as less as possible and more goes for intimidation and blackmailing.

Harry might disguise himself, but Voldemort wouldnt know about his Scar or even the prophecy. During the process of the Fic, Bellatrix gets attracted to him.

However, Harry doesnt have to be the MC of the Fic, but can also be an OC one.


** I havent seen any like this but if it involves HP and Bella was a pair.
