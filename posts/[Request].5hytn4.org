Are there any fan fictions out there which have one of the next generation physically traveling back in time to change the future. Preferably, they are young enough to attend Hogwarts as first years, maybe they have taken a swig from the elixir of youth. Even more preferred would be the child of a Harry Potter and Hermione Granger pairing, as the cannon line up has long since fallen out of my favor. The child would be mysterious, perhaps carrying the last name Potter, though more likely wear a false identity. Dumbledore might not know of their existence, it would be easy enough to play off as a muggleborn. Harry should take an immediate likening to them, maybe even ostracize Ron at some point for it. Or maybe, their presence changes everything. I've read the one where Albus Severus Potter travel back in time with some strange pensive. I've read the whole series, actually, though I cannot remember the name of it. Any help with searching for a story which even vaguely resembles this would be appreciated! I'm fine with anything so long as it doesn't tread the line of a Marry Sue, and even then - crack fics are hilarious.


** I was somewhat interested until the bit about ostracizing Ron.

**** Also, thinking on that, I believe I mean to have Ron act less-than favorably toward the daughter or son - much as he did toward Hermione upon first meeting - and Harry say something to him instead of swallowing the need to rebuke bullying at the thought of loosing a friend. This would ostracize the redhead and, unless he up and leaves the school of does something flat, would force him to be a better person or develop into a hopefully interesting antagonist.

**** Bashing? No, I mean to disabuse that notion in favor of requesting a character who won't abandon their friends due to jealousy. If Ron is a human being and not the 2-Dimensional character portrayed in most FanFiction that tends to err along the line of Marry Sue, then I would enjoy reading of him for a change. It's easier though, to simply cast aside those who are more difficult to deal with - though significantly less challenging and ultimately less entertaining.

** Here's one where Dominique Weasley somehow ended up in the First Wizarding War era:

It's a WIP and I'm not sure if anything in the future actually changes yet, but it's the only one I know of like that.
