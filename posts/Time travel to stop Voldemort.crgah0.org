So alot of the ones I see that involve Time travel to stop him involve trying to kill him as a baby. Or being a good influence so doesnt turn out evil. But if those two options arent a choice how else would you use time travel to stop Voldemort ?

Personally my method is to go back and stop Tom Riddle Sr from being magically date raped( love potion is pretty much that ya?). Which is probably easier to do than killing or raising a kid.


** Tell Tom Riddle that he produces a blue-and-silver haired offspring who is so proud of her daddy that she spouts off his slogan, "For Voldemort and Valor", the official Voldemort Day greeting. Anyone who disagrees with the official ideology uses the phrase, "By Dumbledore!".

He will be so disgusted by it that he'll put down his deathsticks, then go home and rethink his life.

*** Well guess whose gonna be inspired to get a vasectomy, which might not save the wizarding world from Voldemort but it will save us from Cursed Child. I consider it a win.

**** A vasectomy might not be permanent in Voldemort's case. Remember that he lost his entire body when the Potter cottage blew up, but after he got his body back in the resurrection, his downstairs parts were apparently back to full functioning.

Face it, nothing can save us from the curse of the Cursed Child.

Dear god... I saw that line in a fanfic earlier this year, and it was actually a pretty damn awesome moment in the fic, but I had no idea it was in Cursed Child first.

**** Let me guess, "No Glory" by ObsidianPen?

It's one of those things that sounds cool, but when you think about it, makes no sense within the actual context of canon.

Voldy was such an egotist that he would hate his magnum opus, his AMAZING ANAGRAM, sullying the lips of mere mortals in a snake-themed pride parade.

***** Yes, that's the fic. Personally, I think it's perfect for that moment. Hermione turned it arround on him in a way that he couldn't protest because it strokes his ego so well. It also fits because the fic is partially about Voldemort gradually being forced to accept that he can't rule solely through fear.

** Give the kid to some family that wants a baby and you are done without becoming a baby killer and helping a new family. Boom instant good karma.

*** Wouldnt that just mean all the future asshole Slytherins just end up in different houses?

If they dont fit into Griffindor and Ravenclaw well Hufflepuff says she has traits she values but will also take the ones who dont fit into a bubble of Griffindor and Ravenclaw.
