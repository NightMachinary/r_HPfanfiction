Umbrus Shade. It's an completed SI story. He gets rather OP eventually if I remember correctly, so this might not be for you if you prefer more grounded oc's.

  I'm not a hero. I'm not even a functional human being. I'm just a living doll that does what it pleases without a care in the world. "Oh? Some more pots that need breaking. Is that a treasure chest? Mine now." OC SI. Gamer ability. Shameless. From the makers of Neville the Gamer is a new story of a sociopath stuck in the HP world with the gamer ability. Tada-da-daaa! Crash!

** Here's one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1784066/1/Armilla]]

There's a whole lot of Snape in it, love him or hate him, but it's very well-written, everyone is in character, and it has a well-developed Ravenclaw OC. There's also an unfinished (apparently abandoned) sequel.

It follows the canon plotline of OoTP but from the perspective of the OC, who has an interesting story of her own.
