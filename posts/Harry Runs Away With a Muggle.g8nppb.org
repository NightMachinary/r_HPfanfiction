He wasn't exactly a complete social pariah in Little Whinging. Harry gets exactly ONE friend in Little Whinging: just as bullied, just as miserable and very much understanding the plight of a boy abused and neglected by relatives. Relatives who loved to let them know they love the other child in the house, and not them.

Against all odds, in that little town filled with hateful people, Harry Potter had one individual whose life lit up whenever he rolled back into it. Harry near always grumpy and far from well adjusted, so they took a brighter more "optimistic" approach to life, if only to put that crooked, goofy smile back on to Harry's face whenever they acted that way. Allowing themselves one of their own when Harry just got them, just listened and empathized and... it was hard when Harry went to Hogwarts and left them alone, but it was if he was never gone when he returned.

And it wasn't as if they were never in touch. Harry's letter were always vague, but they always managed to find their way through their mailbox. They'd eventually brushed off the oddity of leaving response letters out on the grass (where they would mysteriously disappear the moment they turned their back).

But, when he kept returning from school even more injured and even more miserable.

When their own home and school life got progressively worse.

When "ways out" for both of them seemed bleaker and bleaker... proposing the idea of running away with him was less and less of an off the wall idea.

So, on a motorcycle he inherited from a criminal godfather, belongings stuffed in a trunk that shouldn't have been able to fit both of their things, with promises that he'd explain every weird little thing he'd kept from them all these years: July 31st 1996 saw two childhood friends vanish from Privet Drive to parts unknown.

Both out to explore a world they realised was so much bigger and so much brighter than the one they'd been living in...

**** Days passed and it appeared like the light at the end of the tunnel was taking its sweet time getting there. Even if its source was a speeding train, harry and Audrey would be more than happy to meet it - as it was, the little, flickering orb of illumination was what kept them fighting. It kept them waking up, day after day and somehow igniting that spark of enthusiasm "Today will be better!".

As children, it was easy to convince themselves. But now, in the middle of the summer and all alone in the world and at the same time surrounded by a jeering crowd... It was harder to keep the belief alive.

"Let's run away!" Harry didn't remember who said it first. It was supposed to be a joke, something to lighten the mood. It was something that made them laugh, provided a momentary distraction from the weight of the world bearing down on them.

"But how'd we do that?" is what followed, some time later. It was not a serious thought, not then. But still, they were children, they were curious. Following days and weeks and months would see them spend many hours in the library, researching every topic they thught would prove useful - be it wildernes survival, languages, camping or basket weaving. In the brightly lit room, with fellow readers acting respectfully neutral if not friendly, hidden from the glares by tall rows of bookshelves they could almost feel somewhat normal.

The library had become a Safe Place. Escape planning became their favorite game. Swapping ideas, learning new things neither of them would have imagined, seeing the world, if only by proxy... It was incredibly freeing, in a way nothing else was.

"Let's escape!" became less of a joke, and more their greetings. A shared secret, a reminder of good times when things got tough. It was not much, but it was theirs, and theirs alone. No one could take it away from them. No one even suspected. This little phrase, this three short words "Let us escape!", had reignited their hope. With their backs against the wall, they have dug their own tunnel out, and the light at the end had never looked so apealing.

"Let's escape!" for the first time it has failed to bring smiles to their faces. Hers was still red and stained with tears. His, thoughtful. He'd just returned after *insert painful/traumatic/dangerous event Audrey would fear for his life over*

They had actually considered following through with their escape many times, but dismissed the thought, eventually. Now they were truly thinking of it. Plans were reviewed, discarded and remade. Supplies were checked. Harry was still not sure about it - he'd be leaving some people behind. They were not like her, but they were friends still and precious to him and they couldn't leave too, could they? Audrey had an answer ready.

"Why couldn't they?" she asked.

"What?"

"Harry, they have their parents, they have other friends, associates... They started with more than we did. So if we, on our own, could plan our escape... Why couldn't they?" she said, almost asking "We're just kids and we managed. Why can't they?"

"..." Harry had no answer, because it made sense. It would be a different thing to fight for the lives of his friends, but to risk his life for the plentiful strangers who'd ignored him in his time of need? Fight not to protect lives, but their comfort of living? No, that was not something he wanted to do, he concluded. And it's not like moving a house was particularly difficult even without magic. With it, it was a work of hours, even if one wished to take the whole building. No, Harry decided. He'd saved others several times already. It was time to save himself. With a lighter heart he hugged his best friend and got to work. Plans wouldn't correct themselves, alter all.

*/AU suggestions:*(Diminished Golden Trio - Harry has BFF spot filled up, so they are still friends, but in a more normal fashion.; alternative resolutions to First and Third books. Second gets a pass due to friend invlovement; less receptive to Dumbledore - not bashing, but understandably a bit cooler, because Dumbledore is an adult in position of authority, somewhat involved in his life, and as such starts at 0 trust and has to earn some.)//Those are only suggestions. BTW, I'd love to read any drafts you have, if you're inclined to share.

*Note:* I didn't put in much dialogue, because I do not know much about how you imagine Audrey - so I'd be shoooting blind here.

**** Well the question becomes does she know? And does he have too

Who's to say Harry has to stop, with the Motorcycle, Apparition and everything he can do hit and runs on death eaters, he can also be chased by Death Eaters.

As for Audrey it could be a "We always dreamed of it, you got to get us out of hear Harry" Harry through EVERYTHING he's been through and all the pain would be easily pulled away, all he's ever wanted was to escape the hell that is Little Whinging and then he did and it was only a little bit better because he still has to deal with the same shit from the Wizarding World.

***** There is also a possibility that Voldemort would use subtle means - have a discreet observer follow the pair, perhaps even help them settle down and integrate with some foreign community while Voldemort blitzes the British and consolidates power.

I think it would be interesting if Harry was away, 'safe', but kept receiving news on how much stronger the ol' Snakeface was becoming and how despite any training the gulf in power just grew...

****** You have to be careful about that last part, then you fall in the Madara Situation that we had in Naruto. Madara Uchiha was soooo Powerful that even the Main Character with a debateably cheep power up and his Rival who had his OWN debateably cheep power ups were unable to match him. This lead to Madara being forced off stage left by a even bigger Villain and Naruto and Sasuke receiving even bigger Power ups and a dumb win Condition.

******* True, but then again that was main problem with Naruto - Kishimoto took something that could have been beautiful and reduced it to a mindless slugfest with occasional fanservice. With TTGL it was at least fun...

Main approach to a godlike villain is to come at the problem sideways - in fact, I'd love a story where Voldemort won, but got buggered anyway because of some miscalculation rather than heroes doing anything. It can be luck, it can be alien logic, it can be simply leaving - and preventing the antagonist from following, it can be antagonist no longer including the protag's doom amongst their goals... And given that canon Riddle spent at least a decade traveling around the world to collect obscure pieces of magic, pretty much any power-up for him is plausible with sufficient build up.

Applying the same to a boy-hero who didn't have the chance to discover them... less so. Which is why it would not feature in my approach if I was writing the story in question.

** Her nerves were lit up in excitement. She was giddy and nervous at the same time. She was suppressing the smile, a habit that had been ingrained in her being since a child. The smile struggled to stay off her face, a corner of her lip seemed to always twitch upwards.

"Am I finally meeting your friends? The ones from your magician school?" Olivia asked as she tipped forward on her toes. She tucked a wavy strain of dirty blond hair behind her ear as she watched Harry strap their luggage into the side compartment.

"Technically it's a wizard school, and be careful when you say that. You aren't supposed to know." Harry glanced at her through his bent frames.

"I'm not supposed to know about my father's affair with his dentist either but here we are," she mentioned nonchalantly. She looked over the motorcycle once again, "You said this thing can fly? How?"

"Uh, magic?"

"Well, I know that. Do you know the theory behind it? How can magic just defy physics?"

Harry stood up, "I think Hermione is the one you want to talk to about that." He then swung a leg over the seat and sat down. Olivia quickly hopped on after him and wrapped her arms around his waist.

"Ready?"

"More than ready."

Then they were gone. Down the street and along a maze of twists and turns. On and off interstates and one-way roads. The past dog walkers, crying babies in strollers, and a group of mother power walking with brightly colored headbands. They stopped to get gas in Wembley. Olivia had grabbed some snacks and drinks, and they enjoyed them in the parking lot before hopping back onto the road. They hopped on to the M1, following the traffic until they ended up at the meeting point in Sheffield.

Hermione was waiting for them on a bench at Endcliffe Park. She had a half-read book in her hand and her hair pulled back into a tight ponytail. Once she heard the rumbling of the motorcycle the book closed and a smile spread across her face.

"You must be Olivia," She greeted with an outstretched hand. Olivia shook it quickly while Harry checked over the luggage.

"Hermione?" She guessed.

"Yes and that's Ron," she pointed over the girl's shoulder to a tall lanky boy crossing the street with a wrapped sandwich.

"Do you have the documents?" Harry asked Hermione once Ron met up with them.

"Yes," with that she passed over two thick documents. One with the name Harry Gagnon and the other with Olivia Roy. Inside were documents that could pass any inspection with their new names. A gift from the twins and to them, one of their greatest pranks yet.

"Car?" Olivia asked.

Ron tilted his head towards a black Ford. "Right there, under Harry's new name. Had to use some polyjuice to get it."

When Harry grabbed the keys he passed Sirius's communication mirror over. "We'll call you when we land. Make sure no one knows you have this."

"We know," Ron grumbled at being reminded again. He had heard the plan several times. They switched vehicles at this spot so Sirius's motorcycle couldn't be used to track them down. Olivia and Harry would board a plane and leave for North America. Harry was going to complete his education at a small magical school he found and Olivia was going to finish her muggle studies. The fewer details they had the better.

They wouldn't be separated forever. Ron, Hermione, and Neville planned to move with them after they graduated Hogwarts. For now, they had to make sure to foil and attempt to find the couple.

"Be safe," Hermione sniffled as she drew Harry into a tight hug. Ron waited until she pulled back to encase Harry it a spine breaking embrace.

"Take care, mate," He spoke in a strained voice. "Remember, mirror call once a week." Ron frowned at his tone, it sounded a lot like his mother's. Harry laughed.

"Of course, we can teach each other the different spells we learn. Give Snape hell for me?"

"I would be honored." The two started to laugh, Hermione sighed but gave them a smile.

With that, Harry checked the motorbike over once again, making sure to grab the charm that Sirius had wrapped around the left handle before getting into the car and leaving with a wave.

"Ready for Canada?" Olivia asked while she inspected the plane tickets.

"Of course, anyone who hates your parents as much as we do is a winner in my book," Harry smiled referring to the estranged relatives that they were heading towards. No one would look there. Why would Harry move to Canada to live with strangers? If you asked Olivia's family, they would explain that there was no way she knew they existed. They had never spoken of that part of the family let alone communicated with them.

** something that isn't explored in canon but I dearly wish to see in this story or stories in general is alternative magic. All over the world there exist different types of magic.

I always imagine the best place to put such a running away scene is just after the third book where the time turner thing does not happen and Sirius is killed escaping or by dementors but the ministry covers it up and Buckbeak is also killed. I feel that any later in the books and harry gets too invested in defeating Voldemort, protecting his friends, avenging his parent etc to truly cut himself away. In the first and second books harry is not specifically targeted by Voldemort, except for the broom thing in the first book, mostly its harry taking it upon himself to stop Voldemort or stumbling( or is it led in the case of bad Dumbledore) but its the fourth book onward that harry and Voldemort really have direct conflict with the death of Cedric and his torture at the graveyard. Also other that the muggle baiting at the quidditch world cup there is no evidence of the death eaters joining together for anything. without support of his friends, thinking the wizarding world is irredeemable and convinced by his muggle friend to see the world, they have their version of a world tour. the see the good parts of the world, the bad parts , they see opulence , poverty , they see different types of magic from druids to shaman to Hindu sages, harry learns a lot, his horcrux is removed by one of the characters he meets, or a ritual he takes part.

I would especially love if he finds out there exist a whole world outside the British magical world with more stronger wizards that just Dumbledore and Voldemort etc

**** In real life we find that by crossing relatively small distances like the borders of countries we could almost believe that we are in a completely different world. North Korea and south Korea are geographically very close but the people their would find it very hard to relate to each other due to the extreme difference in culture and exposure to the world and that's just a few generations worth of social blackout so imagine how much more different the wizarding world would be with the presence of magic? how easy production and manufacture of materials leads to lack of trade contact? how extreme longevity leads to very orthodox and conservative beliefs ? I believe that this would lead to very extreme forms of isolation with different the wizarding communities being very different form each other. In my head canon I consider the European wizarding world to be almost completely isolated from the other nations so they didn't feel the need to involve themselves.
