** Oh yes! My novel series I am working on, almost done with book 1 at 180k words, is an offshoot of a thought experiment about this.

A few things from JK's world have to be fully expressed first.

1) Magicals are significantly more durable than non-magicals. They can survive entrail exploding curses with the right counter spell. They lose body parts and easily have them reattached during splinching accidents. In quidditch they get hit with iron canon balls repeatedly and come off with minor bruising.

2) Magicals live about 2-3 times longer than non-magicals. Living into you early second century, early 120's, is nothing special. Wizarding Britain has a younger population due to repeated wars. Overall though the books make it clear living past 100 is nothing special enough to take note of.

3) They would have little care for things non-magicals would hold dearly. What is the use in worrying about having the best or greatest mundane objects when you can flick a wand and make something equally as well or better? Who needs to care about making a better mattress when comfort charms can make a stone slab the most perfectly comfortable bed ever?

They simply don't need to collect or really innovate much as they can spend a few hours or days to make something non-magicals spend years or even decades getting right.

4) Magicals really don't have to care about their diet, or exercise. You can count on one hand the number of overweight magicals in the entire HP universe. The staff and kids eat obscenely high calorie foods and are perfectly fine. Harry goes years without proper nutrition at all and comes out mostly fine. The books do not describe him as some thin malnourished young boy. He is just a bit on the small side. After only getting to eat toast crumbs and similar for years.

5) They are stronger, more durable, longer lived, able to turn a cave into a mansion, and can survive feast/famine times with ease. This makes for a powerful warrior across the board.

So this race of super warriors who can bend reality to their whim have no reason to realistically not be in charge.

There is nothing that should have stopped them from straight up mind controlling every major religious and secular leader in existence.

Quite simply the witch hunts and separation of worlds should have never happened.

If you could turn invisible and change the mind of someone trying to raise a genocidal rally against you why would you not? That would be like offering a Jew early into Hitlers reign the ability to stop it all and expecting them to say no thanks.

Makes no damn sense at all.

So eventually magic becomes common place. They become the royalty of the world simply because even the weakest of magicals can study enough to turn a hovel into palace with time and effort.

This leads to a form of worship, the non-magicals going out of their way to marry into these royal lines. Mundane (muggle) born children would be considered a blessing from magic/god. The poorest families instantly catapulted to luxury and ease of living.

Picture how much more powerful the Spartans would have been if they were all also magicals?

So powerful magical families build up more power. They make dynasties enforced codes of honor and behavior by magic itself. You don't have to worry about corruption or idle lazy heirs when you can force them to make magic vows to not do those things to begin with.

Picture widespread use of Truth Serum in courts. Countries and empires formed by magicals would be powerful things backed by magical might.

An army of special forces is great and all, until you send a legion of animated gargoyles at them.

Nukes are cool, until you realize the whole damn capital is unplottable and you can't even target the place.

Magic is the ultimate force multiplier, which has extreme multipliers attached to it. The axiom 'knowledge is power' is literally true with magic.

More knowledge leads to more power which means you can acquire more knowledge with the new power. It's a self sustaining, always increasing (even if slowly at times) cycle of increasing strength.

Magical portraits also means old knowledge is never lost. How amazing would it be to have Tesla, Einstein, or Leonardo Da Vinci available of a chat at any time.

Knowledge would be the true treasures of such a world. It would also be highly guarded and kept safe.

Schools for magic would be many and all of them would require oaths of non-violence at the minimum. Who wants to worry about former students coming back to use the things you taught them against you?

That would be the major defining points of magical countries. The liberalism of sharing knowledge. Old conservative countries hoarding it, requiring extensive oaths and vows before being taught.

Liberal states offering many various schools with far fewer strings. Perhaps even to most liberal even offering magical universities.

So for me magical empires would mostly be old powerful beasts backed by strict magical bonds. They would have many families that were institutionalized into their government. New blood magicals would be subject to far more restrictions than old families. Each generation being trusted more and more as time passed, proving themselves trustworthy.

Anyways that is mostly my take on it, it's a fair bit off from the world I am writing, but mine is a far different world than JK's world.

**** My world started as a fanfiction world. After about 30 pages of notes I scrapped about a quarter of them and rewrote them to an original world.

My world has everything going absolutely completely fucked when the Spanish conquest of Central America starts.

Local magicals use mass sacrifice to fuel huge spells creating wizard killers as a last desperate fuck you to the conquering intruders.

The whole place turns into this death trap that is slowly trying to expand. So magicals have to come forward and help stop the breach. This leads to a whole new world.

*** I like and agree with most of this. The only real thing is the thought that the witch hunts would never have happened. Well, of course they could have. And based on what we see, to the broader wizarding community it was seen as both horrible and an indication that Muggles couldn't be trusted and also somewhat laughed at since, almost verbatim quoting, "Muggles are very bad at recognizing magic" and so almost never caught a wizard. Even the notorious cases turned out to be people getting caught on purpose and using things like the Flame Freezing Charm to make it harmless. But before they became an insular community, they more or less just worked with and lived under the presiding government, like other citizens (except where specifically magical matters were concerned).

Really though, it's that it's wizarding law to avoid using magic on Muggles as much as possible outside of threats to life or the SoS. Of course, sans ethics wizards could trivially take over the Muggle world. Imperius, any kind of Masking or non-detection spell (on a person or location), and Transfiguration is just unstoppable by non-magical means.

So I don't think Rowling's world is really that hard to make sense of in that regard, though the Inquisition should have, perhaps, been mentioned too (I can't recall if the books/side material ever mention that as a major factor for the SoS). Most people, even in stories with superpowers, aren't interested in taking over, even if they technically have the ability to do so. But please let me know your fanfic username and website. I'd love to keep an eye out for this story of yours!

** Do you mean the Empire to be structured in a way that would make a good narrative or a way that would be lasting and workable?

If the latter, somewhat like the Elf Empire in Laundry Files, most likely. A strict hierarchy of enchantments and strict, detailed vows well written to ensure loyalty/efficiency/actions taken for the good of the Empire.

Local authority that answers to regional authority that answers to sector authority that answers to grand authority that answers to the Emperor, each needing to swear vows before taking their positions. Probably some secret police observers around indoctrinated to be loyal to the Emperor.

If the former, probably without the vows (or with far simpler, looser vows) and a lot more political jockeying and such.

** What does 'Empire of Magic' mean?

Is it a magical empire that controls everything? A magical government that styles itself an empire? Something else?

That obviously makes a big difference! For instance, a magical government styling itself an empire could be a magical Roman/Byzantine Empire - in which case, instead of a Minister of Magic, the head of the government could be an Emperor, and working along a magical variation of Roman/Byzantine institutions (I've got a penciled in version of this for a potential fic idea I've been kicking around). But that's just a title, really - it could be a powerful magical nation, but at its heart it'd be an updated version of how we think the Roman state was organized in, say, the 10th century (kinda like the Ministry for Magic is similar to 20th century Britain in its organization, at least in my mind).

** Well, similary to how you would structure a regular empire: A strong military force, a nationalistic propaganda culture, an impressive use of Logistics and civil construction/service system to mantain your empire. Imagine a Sacred High Emperor sustained over a court of Noble warlocks and courtier wizards, below them a highly militaristic culture (every wizard/witch must undergo military training) comprised of support/specialist magical units, below them a huge army of magical creatures. Imagine a warfare doctrine based on this. This Magical army is not only for war, it uses it's might to build portkey/Floo Networks and many magical impresive structures. Add that to an eficient secret order controlling everything in the shadows and I believe you could pull it off.

** Population is still 99% muggles ruled by the rich wizards, with poor wizards somewhere in between. Muggles use magical gadgets and technology. Like guns that shoot simple pre-loaded spells. Or cars with hover charms. With technology enabling mass production of magical items, the population grows and it needs to expand, which is made easy by magic negating gravity and conservation of momentum. Basically it becomes Star Wars.
