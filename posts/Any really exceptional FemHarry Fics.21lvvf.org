I don't mind if it's crossover or based just in the HP world, it's just fun to read about Harry with a different perspective to his adventures or life. Thanks! :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and the Fate's Fool]]. Completed. Harry travels back in time, but fate sucks and becomes female.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]. Only covers year four. The sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9937462/1/Black-Princess-Ascendant][Black Princess Ascendant]] covers year five, and is a WIP.

Edit: expanded description and added second story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]]. Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9081608/1/Fire-Born][Fire Born]] Abandoned at 35k, but very interesting. Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old.

*** Fireborn might not be abandoned; I followed one of her other fics and it would go months without an update but she did eventually finish it. still updates are few are far between.

** I only stumbled upon this one recently which has been up for about a month, but I like it so far: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10110868/1/Scarlet-Gold][Scarlet & Gold]]. However, it is a crossover fic. If you like just regular HP, this one was good: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] as well as: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9509144/1/Fault-Lines][Fault Lines]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A-Butterfly-Effect][A Butterfly Effect]] gets plenty of review, but its kind of 50/50. Most complaints are the characters being overly sexualized.

*** My only real problem with ABE is that it's unfinished and hasn't updated for more than a year. :-(

** I don't read much fem!Harry but this one is good. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/536450/chapters/952621][The Never-ending Road]] It just got updated today.
