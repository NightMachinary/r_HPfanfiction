** More or less all of the better H/Hr doesn't bash Ron.

I thought I'd make an unusual recommendation, linkao3(Spell It Out by Allthatissacredandholy), which is relatively short.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][all my stories]], Ron's a good guy, and in most of them, he's a hero as well. Same goes for the rest of the Weasleys.

** Linkffn(A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool)

I haven't actually finished it yet but it's supposed to be H/Hr and Ron isn't a jerk. Although Ginny isn't exactly coming off well so far. It's okay so far and it starts after Harry's third year. Kinds slow but interesting, in my opinion.
