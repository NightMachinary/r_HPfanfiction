** As a general recommendation I'd say read more Marauder Era stories.

The adventures of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs didn't get caught up in the Indy/Dark/BAMF/MerlinReincarnate/Political!Harry you so often see in stories featuring Harry, and as a result are generally much more age appropriate.
