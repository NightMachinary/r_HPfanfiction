Where Fic satisfies a minimum of one of the following:

A) Explores the political climate of Potter-verse

B) Portrays Death Eaters as opposing Political Group

C) Children are really good at manipulation of other people and politics

D) Explores the political climate within House of Slytherin

Fic should have minimal to no grammar/spelling errors :))

** linkffn(on the wings of a phoenix by makoyi). hits A, B, and D. It's probably for the best that it doesn't really hit C

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** It's like you described [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]]. I haven't read all chapters yet though.

You might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux][Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12278649/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chrysalis][Harry Potter and the Chrysalis]] as well.

Also, I like /Traitor's Son/ as well, but it hasn't been updated for a few months. It's in the WbA section of DLP.

** My series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; The Chessmaster: White Knight) satisfies A, B, and D. It's got a fair bit of world building, and is multiple POV, so it's got a mix of school plot, and politicking.

  AU. When a surprising discovery leads to an unusual occurrence, a centuries long trend is broken and plans whirl into motion. Rumors of a stone, a mirror, and a mysterious door float through the halls of Hogwarts as a prophecy comes into play. Meanwhile, two men fight a shadow war in a vain effort to control the Wizengamot... Sequel now posted! Over 70k hits!

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
