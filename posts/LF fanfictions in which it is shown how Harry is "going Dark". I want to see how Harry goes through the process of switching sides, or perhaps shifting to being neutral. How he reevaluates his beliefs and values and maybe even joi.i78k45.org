** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1637290]] Fic is called Evitative, part of a series called Mutatum. Eventually slash, and only the first story has been completed, but it's a compelling take at Harry being resorted into Slytherin due to a paperwork error after his trial in 5th Year. Leading to an understanding of Dark Magic and a version of Harry which is neutral in his approach; but dark in his use of magic.

Exactly what you are looking for, but dark doesn't necessarily equate to evil in this fic.

  After 5th year, Harry takes charge of his own life. He's making decisions that will change the course of the war, and he's determined to learn the truth about Dark magic. Long, slower-paced fic. Independent!Harry, Dark!Harry, NOT Evil!Harry, No Romance. -ABANDONED-

** You could read Dark and Light. It's on fanfiction.net. The author is Pleasedial123.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4924413]]

"He was a genius. He could paint, play music, talk to snakes, control fire. He was more powerful and intelligent than any knew. He had strong 'friends'. The problem was, he had few emotions."

Harry is dark, but not evil. There is slash (mxm/bl/yaoi, however you wanna call it).

It is really my favourite.

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.

** Yes, the holy grail of fanfiction! Once, I read a story, might be six or ten years ago. About Harry exploring the 'dark' but it seemed to be am aspect of magic that was Ill thought of. Darkk magic was using ambient magic opposed of using innate magic. I don't remember much of this story as the author deleted it in search of 'real authorship'. I only know for sure Harry ignited candles with the dark magic and initiated a ritual in Gringott's that was pretty powerfull. I had great hopes for "the well groomed mind" everything up to the ritual was brilliant but alas it failed to really bring it home. I still haven't found a fic where Harry goes dark that makes me say: yes, this is it. A convincing story of Harry going 'dark'.
