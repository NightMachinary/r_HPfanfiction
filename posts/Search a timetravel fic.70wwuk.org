The things I remember, hope they will help so that someone might know which story I am searching for.

Harry travels back in time in order to kill Tom Riddle and in the end he really kills him. I remember just a few parts of the story like Harry follows Tom to the Chamber of Secrets where he learns that Harry comes from the future. Harry tells him that Toms future self send him and that he is his Horcrux. Tom gets really possessive of him and after a short while wants to touch him because he thinks that he owns Harry or something like that. I also remember that Tom and his inner circle meet Grindlewald, Harry says something 'bad and Grindelwald wants to kill him but Tom interferes. That's all I can remember. I hope someone can help me ? Thank you for your time.
