I have been reading many stories in the ff universe by now and over the years I have seen that rowlings definition of magic lacks structure. I am myself thinking of a structured definition of what magic is. Does anyone know stories that touch this topic? I want to get some viewpoints to make my own idea better and maybe eventually post it in form of some kind of story in the fandom. That by the way doesn't mean it has to be really scientific. I am open for stories that touch magic philosophically or mysterious way or describe advandced appilcations of magic as well :)


** I only read a few chapters of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] but it definitely explores magic in a very unique and interesting way.

  AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.

This might be a good reference if you want to read up on mostly canon Magic.

When it comes to AUs I really like the magical system in Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches:

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

**** Oh yeah, totally. With marriage contracts and all that jazz (if I would summarize that fic differently I would say "Includes all the tropes, but tries to have them make sense" ... like "How do magical cores work?"). But it's 537k words into it and the girls are just starting to have their first crushes... there's really nothing going on romantically except a bit of idolizing Harry.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** Linkffn(The Art Of Self-Fashioning) has some good expansions on Transfiguration

Linkffn(Victoria Potter) adds a bit as well to most of the disciplines but particularly to Transfiguration

Linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) expands on Alchemy as a study

Note that the plots to these stories might not be your cup of tea. Art of Self-Fashioning jumped the shark halfway through, Peace Not Promised is a Snily time travel fic that gets old pretty fast, and Victoria Potter is good, but it's getting backlash on this sub

When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
