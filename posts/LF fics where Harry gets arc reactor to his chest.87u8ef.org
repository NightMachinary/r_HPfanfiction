I recently read a fic where Harry gains the memories of dying Howard and seventeen old Tony Stark and takes over Tony's life. It was rather a unique plot and it was going so well. It was looking like he was going to fix magic and the technology. But so many people started to figure out his secret spontaneously so I dropped it. Unnecessary drama killed my interest in that fic. Too bad it looked like a unique plot too.

He doesn't have to get an arc reactor but he tries cybernetics and he mixes the technology and the magic in his body. Anyway, I'm looking for fics where Harry mixes technology with magic. Maybe he plays around with prosthetics and human body part replacements and his magic accept the changes so when his body heals, his cybernetics regenerates to top condition too. It could be any kind of crossover and

Also, both of my current stories have magitek and iron man style armour as plot points.
