I haven't seen a thread for beta readers in a while, so I figured I'd post one. In the comments below post whether you are a beta looking for new writers, or a writer looking for a beta, as well as a short summary of what you are looking for.

--------------

/An Example/:

I'm looking for a beta that can point out spelling and grammar. My story is an AU Action/Adventure focusing on Harry and Hermione working as counter-terrorism operatives for the Ministry of Magic as they work against Death Eater strikes across Muggle Britain. Please send me a PM if you are interested.

(Optional) A sample: *link here*

--------------

/Another Example/:

I'm a beta specializing in spelling and grammar, though I am also good at general critique. I'm willing to help in any genre besides Romance and Mystery, for any pairing. Please shoot me a PM if you're interested, including a summary of the story.

--------------

Of course, don't feel constrained by the examples, and remember to have fun with it.


** Hello, I'm [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eseigio][Seigio on ff.net]] (please disregard the story I've already posted, it makes me feel physically ill) and I'm looking for a beta.

I'm looking for someone who can help me out with story flow and specific wordings, not so much spelling and grammar, though those would also be appreciated. Punctuation would also be a great help, as I feel that I overuse commas. Don't worry about coming off as too harsh; honestly, the harsher the better.

It would be helpful for a beta reader of mine to be familiar with The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher. I'm writing a crossover of the two, though knowledge of The Dresden Files is not required as I will be explaining the terminology and magic system as it goes.

--------------

The genre is *Action/Adventure / Mystery*, and the story is written in the first person. There is no pairing as of yet, but if one comes along later it will probably be with either an *Original Character* or *Luna*.

--------------

The Summary:

At the start of his sixth year, Harry Potter put both magic and home behind him to seek his own destiny. His life in New York, while not ideal, is filled with freedoms and few worries. That is, until a Warden of the White Council showed up at his diner. Now Harry's life and freedoms are on the line as he races to find out what's changing everyone around him, what's killing people, and just why the Warden seems so interested in him.

--------------

Either reply below or send me a PM if you're interested. I'm also available to beta for any stories, with a focus on spelling, grammar, and plot. Thank you.

*** I'd be happy to beta this story for you, the summary sounds right up my alley! I've read all the Dresden Files books and love HPxDF crossovers.

** I don't write, but I can read an obscene amount in a day or two. Grammar isn't my strong suit, but I can spot basic errors, sentences that don't quite gel, and typos. I'd be more than happy to beta any stories you guys want, but if you don't want to upload yet, you'd need to send them to me, I don't have home internet.

I think I'm pretty good at HP trivia and history too, so if you need someone to power through fifty chapters of novel-length, I have all the time in the world.

** I've been a beta for a few short stories for friends, but nothing major as of yet. I am good with grammar, punctuation, and continuity within stories. I have plenty of free time to read loads and would relish an opportunity to get back into this.

** I'm looking for a beta that will go through the chapters of my story (length roughly at 250k+) and edit the previous chapters for me. I've always been in a dire need of one and currently seek someone who can spot grammar mistakes, awkward verbiage, and general smoothness.

Feel free to PM me or respond if you're interested.

** I am a beta with lots of experience. My strong suit is spelling, punctuation and grammar, and I also help with characterization and wording if you want it. I prefer shorter stories but if you have a multi-chaptered story we can talk about the time frame involved. All genres and ratings welcome except I absolutely do not beta noncon (rapey) stories.
