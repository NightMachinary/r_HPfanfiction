:END:
I don't remember much of the fic. I think it was Dramione, and Hermione somehow ended up in another universe where Ron and Harry were elitist purebloods while Draco was the „nice“ guy. Hermiones alternate self was also a rather mean and dumb girl so the alternate versions Harry and Ron were rather surprised by „real“ Hermiones brilliantness.

**** You're welcome! It's in my top five favorites of all time. Hands down the best alternate universe fic in my opinion.
