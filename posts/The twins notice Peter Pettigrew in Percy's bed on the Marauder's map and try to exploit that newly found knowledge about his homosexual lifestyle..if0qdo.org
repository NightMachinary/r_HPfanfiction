I've recently finished writing a oneshot inspired by a prompt from [[https://www.reddit.com/user/meep-a-confessional/][u/meep-a-confessional]].

The twins find out about Peter Pettigrew and conclude that they have just found out about Percy's secret boyfriend. How to best use this discovery to their advantage?
