I've read a couple of older stories so I'm just looking for any new ones out there or just some suggestions to some really good ones. Preferably the major ship but could also be a secondary one.


** I can't think of any stories I've read with that ship but , though Portkey was mostly for Harry and Hermione stories it also had R/L . So here's 113 of them. Happy hunting;

*** Thanks! I hope by the time I'm done sorting through these there might be some new updating ones out there.
