** Here. Enjoy and try not to snort your coffee straight through your brain and out your ears. It's just a shame the author doesn't seem like she'll ever take these any further than she has, because I would read the hell out of them if she did.

  Harry Potter has a particular set of skills...one of them is NOT killing the stupid people that make it their life's goal to annoy him. And they are really, REALLY stupid. The Wizarding World may regret giving him his Hogwarts letter. First Year re-do. Beware of Smart!Harry Jerkoff!Harry

  What if things went down a little differently that fateful night in the Shrieking Shack? A "Happily Ever After" is probably too much to ask for poor Harry and Sirius.

*** Ah, you beat me to it. This is perfect if you want a somewhat OP, sarcastic asshole Harry. It's written well enough that you still like it and root for him, even though he's a complete jerk.
