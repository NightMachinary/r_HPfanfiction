Obviously, this is a debate about nature vs nurture to avoid OOC characters in fics.

I'm asking for Harry in particular because I feel that he is the one easiest to get wrong as so much of is characterization depended of is upbringing (no real sense of worth, desire for a family, to belong...) so any AU where his upbringing is different (such as with a loving family) risk making him a only-in-name character.

*Edit:* so according to the ones who answered, he's:

-tenacious/determined

-striving to right wrongs (by his perspective)

-charismatic when he want (?)

-not very good at socializing

-easily lead around by people he trust

-resilient

-mildly sarcastic

.

IMO, the only parts that qualifies as the "core parts" of his personality that doesn't depend on the upbringing (or at least not overly so), would be that he's a bit shy and tenacious.

I can be wrong, of course but I don't really see anything else that doesn't stems from his childhood or early Hogwarts years (except the "righting wrongs" thing).

.

Besides, it seems that there is a argument to be made about JKR changing HP characterization around OotP.


** The fundamental core of his personality is that he always tries to do the right thing. He just struggles sometimes to work out what that is. He's a bit stubborn and he used to be extremely curious in the first book but that faded a tad as he got older. He still liked to know what was going on, he just didn't ask as many questions.

Outside of trying to do the right thing he changes a lot. He grows up. We first see him at 11 unaware of his fame. A couple of months before he turns 18 he's a national hero twice over. A triwizard champion who has seen people he knows killed in front of him. If he didn't grow and change over time then it would be odd. He's learning and changing as a person, we all change, we're shaped by the world around us. Harry is shaped by the expectation of others. He pushes against it rather than accept it. This might be because he wanted to be 'normal' which might have something to do with the Dursley's or it might have more to do with him being a truly modest person. What I'm getting at thought here is that you'd expect Harry to be different given different circumstances but any and all changes need to be justified.

The way I'd recommend tweaking Harry to change a story is that you stick with the doing the right thing but you change how he interprets 'the right thing'. If he was raised by people who were more supportive of him but were more pro-authority then often doing the right thing would mean going to the teachers and leaving it be. Dumbledore's right not easy thing really resonated with Harry but it doesn't help with knowing what the right thing is.

*** On the 'Normal' thing I have always viewed it as Harry always saw the Dursleys as the freaks in that house and thus his vision of normal is Arthur Weasley. A honest hardworking kind man who would give you the shirt off his back, that's what Harry sees as normal, and strives to be much like Arthur, at least in the ways that matter

** Harry's scrappy in the 'fighting spirit' kind of way.

That is one of the most essential parts of the character and what a lot of fics diminish in some way. He's determined. He's a fighter. He's smart enough to know his odds but is going to push back anyway. He's got an attitude that could make you want to strangle him. That's the kind of thing that the Dursleys would want to stomp out of him but they never could. It's why the little voice in his head argues so ferociously against the Imperius. It's how he could stand up against Voldemort in the graveyard by deciding that he was going to die on his feet. It's why he just starts mouthing off to the death eaters to buy time in OoTP, It's how he could choose to come back to life in DH despite knowing he'd be returning to pain and fear. I think that's a natural part of Harry and the main part that changes is where he's directing this aggression and attitude.

One thing I'd suggest is not to confuse the ability to fight with having a fighting spirit. Harry could be incredibly OP and still be lackluster. Alternatively, he could be written incredibly smug and arrogant so that 'scrappy' just mutates into 'raging brat'. I guess it's a fine line no matter what.

** nature is the filter that nurture must pass through. what you gain from the things you experience are slightly different depending on your genetics.

that being said if you fold a piece of paper differently of course it's going to look different than if you folded it another way. the same applies to raising a kid.

** Boiled down?

Well...I'd say he's warm and bubbly, but uncomfortable with close relationships. He does need someone nearby to help take off the heat, without that he tends to build a full head of steam and ultimately flip his lid.

(I can't think of any more 'boiling' puns at the moment...)

** - mildly sarcastic

This is a trait I genuinely believe is overlooked a lot when Harry is written in FanFiction. It could be maybe pinned down to just being dry British wit, but Harry's distinct brand of sass is personally one of my favourite parts of his character that go criminally overlooked.

** Too stubborn to die, too stupid* to live.

*by stupid i am talking more about being "raised" as a lamb to the slaughter and never actually having a chance, not actually being unintelligent. Although argument can be made that he is actually stupid for not getting his act together after book 4. But i was't raised by horrible people, then "saved" by other group of horrible people to fight other group of more horrible people, so i can't really judge him that much.

**** it was a phase at some point in my fanfiction reading life, which indeed left me with some questions regarding canon events.\\
most of those fics does not hold up after my initial fascination with the concept of fanfiction was over, but some problems raised in those works, IMO legit ones. although those are, probably, mostly due to J.K.R.(or her principal editor) lack of sufficient powers of foresight

** Well, canon Harry has the following special qualities:

Harry could cast Imperius Curse and resist it, both on his first attempt.

He also managed to cast Sectumsempra on his first attempt and Cruciatus on his second.

I would say he had quite a bit of talent for dark arts.

--------------

His will power was immense, as he was often put in extremely adverse situations and managed to come out ahead. He was basically immune to the Imperius Curse. In the Graveyard, he would have beaten Voldemort if Voldemort hadn't broken up the wand core connection.

His intuition was very good. It was generally Harry who put pieces together and solved mysteries throughout their years at Hogwarts. He identified Malfoy, he correctly predicted a Horcrux at Hogwarts, he realized another in Gringotts, and he correctly solved the riddle of Hallows and Elder Wand.

He was a good leader, someone who inspired loyalty through his actions. Neville and Luna were both serious outsiders, but under his leadership, grew into powerful forces of their own and yet remained fanatically loyal to him. By the end of the Series, he had built up a tremendous following, especially among Hogwarts students.

Finally, he was a fun guy when not under too much stress. I imagine that after the War, he would become significantly more sociable.

While not arguing this point, i'd like to say that i think it is mostly due to him being the protagonist of this story.\\
And stereotypes being stereotypes. Because if Hermione is the "smart one" and Ron is the "dumb one", then Harry should be somewhere in-between, hence him getting "intuition" perk, instead of actually being smart.

Never saw it myself. At least not to this extend. He does have his moments of awesome in regards to inspiring loyalty, but IMO it looks mostly undeserved. But i blame it primarily on J.K.R. being shit writer, tbf, and not on Harry being shit leader.

** His upbringing has very little effect on his canon personality. Anyone who went through the hell that is called Number Four Privet Drive would be seriously fucked up. He does not show the typical signs of someone suffering from childhood abuse or even the signs of a "functional" victim. Perhaps the biggest influence can be seen with Harry's opinion of Dumbledore. The man was an utterly incompetent leader, who basically lost the war and then proceeded to fuck things up again and again. Yet Harry (with the exception of OotP) thinks that the sun is shining out of Dumbledore's arse. He doesn't even question whether it would be possible to remove the Horcrux without taking a killing curse for the team. A Harry with a different upbringing (unless it's by hardcore Dumbledore supporters like the Weasleys) would not stand for that shit.

And i think reason why Harry went along with all the shit that got piled up on him is precisely because he was raised in a horrible environment of №4 Privet Drive.\\
I mean, who in their right mind would be okay with his own fucking parents encouraging them to go and commit suicide on the words\memory of a man, who had proven time and time again(at least from Harry POV) that he can't be trusted? If that's not a sign of something deeply fucked up, then i don't know what is.

Or after hearing bullshit like that:

  Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. *You had suffered*. *I knew you would* when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. *I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years*.
#+end_quote

still be in any sort of cordial relationship with a person who knowingly left you, a child, an infant(!), to suffer. Like wtf? What normal, sane, well adjusted person does this?

**** What I mean is that the abuse Harry suffered only manifests itself in the blind trust towards Dumbledore (but not other figures of authority). While realistically, someone with Harry's potential but who lived at the Dursleys would probably make Voldemort look like a schoolyard bully or become a vigilante who would have killed both Malfoys by the end of PoA. Besides the Dumbledore thing, Harry does not seem overly affected by the Dursleys (maybe the tolerance for Mrs Weasley's behaviour, but that is debatable).

*** So much of what Harry deals with could have been dealt with easily if he didn't have an enormous ego. He wants to be the one to 'earn' he fame. People say that he blindly trusted Dumbledore; he really didn't. Harry only ever went to him when he snapped. That's not trust. Dumbledore gave Harry every opportunity to succeed and thrive if only he set his ego aside. How many more lessons in his 6th year would he have just attempted to actually get the memory. How much could he have done if he actually put forth the effort in any of his classes? Teachers love students who put forth the effort to master the material rather than regurgitate information *cough*Hermione*cough*. Honestly when I was reading canon and in OotP he started yelling at Dumbledore, I kinda hoped Dumbledore would have simply asked him why Harry had done nothing for himself. At every opportunity Harry took the easiest path, until Voldemort shows up and he gets Mithril grade plot armour.

To summarize Harry is:

Lazy

Self absored

Short sighted\\
Gifted in the Dark Arts

Very dependant on others to live day-to-day

Not a deep thinker

Playful

Easily manipulated

Negligent

In short, I wouldn't trust him to rescue a kitten wrapped in bubble wrap. Unless Hermione was there giving him step-by-step guidance.
