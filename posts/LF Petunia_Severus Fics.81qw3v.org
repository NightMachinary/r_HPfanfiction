Multi-chapter stories preferably, but, really, anything featuring the pairing would be awesome.

Thank you in advance :)


** linkao3(To Make an End by JackieJLH) Its more of a one-shot than a multi chapter fic, but it fits. I do have to warn you that the ending is depressing.

  At first she didn't quite believe her eyes. Severus Snape here, on her doorstep, was so far outside the realm of anything she'd ever believed possible that she couldn't fully comprehend what she was seeing for a few seconds.

  An invitation from Petunia's nephew brings bittersweet memories and a revelation. (See end notes for original prompt, which is spoilery.)

** The Tide - linkffn(7867931) is an interesting one. It reinterprets events from the start to have Petunia have a weird fixation on Snape. I feel it draws interesting lines between Snape, Petunia and Lily (which, of course, is at the heart of any story with this pairing), and I love certain aspects of Petunia's character as drawn here. I don't quite buy Snape returning the feelings for Petunia though, and for that reason I can't give myself over to it fully.

  With the death of her husband and son, Petunia didn't think that she would end up losing her sister as well. Now with her death, that leaves Petunia to raise Harry on her own. However, this isn't an issue for Petunia. The only question that needs an answer is how does a Muggle woman raise a wizard baby? Rated T for swearing.

** The few examples I know of are fairly short.

This one's locked to AO3: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/515170][Barking at the Moon]] by rinsbane

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3406496][Every Saint Is an Accident]] by TeddyRadiator is intense and smutty, although the author forgets that Petunia is supposed to be blonde, and neither of them feels quite in character.
