** If you think this sub gets political I don't recommend checking out the rest of reddit. Honestly I think this is a milder one and people reserve their stronger opinions for Snape and the Dursleys.

*** I have read the rules about posting and general behaviour on this sub there was a rule which said no homophobic or transphobic comments,but that's the problem they are not implemented properly....I have seen some strictly enforced subreddits like askreddit or even PewDiePiesubmissions or any other YouTubers reddit ,they tend to be away from controversy by strict application of their rules and some even resort to banning

**** I've only seen no slash requirements when people are making requests which is only fair... people want to read whatever they want to read.

***** Yeah,but that's not the point, you can and should read what you want but my problem is with the fact that people tend to give their biased opinion on your preferences like I saw this in a post recently a guy was asking for white Hermione fics idk why he asked for that but then some random people started on him and began debating with him saying that Hermione was supposed to be black jkr said it ,etc.

*** It happens randomly,like the gay and trans debate tends to start quite randomly in posts which do not even mention anything about it....as for BLM I saw a post where the op was talking about how she/he was inspired by it and Draco and other death eaters deserve a lot worse
