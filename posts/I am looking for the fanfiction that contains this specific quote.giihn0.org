"He was a man to think things through, to taste and analyze each bit of emotion [...?...] that ran through his mind and soul" (about Professor Snape)\\
The only thing I think I recall is the pairing was SS/HG

It must have been a rather long one of that.\\
Does anybody accidentelly have this quote as memorized as I do and also know where it's from or how to find out?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2222389/1/Inevitable][Inevitable]], linkffn(2222389). The quote is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2222389/5/Inevitable][chapter 5]]

**** The quotation marks in a google search tell Google to look for these /specific/ words in this specific order. Otherwise Google will treat all the words individually as keywords that can appear anywhere in the document, and will also look for synonyms and miss-spellings.

  Hermione has always relied on logic, but when she starts having prophetic dreams about a potion that leads you to your soulmate, logic won't matter. She is about to have an encounter with the two things she fears most: Divination and Professor Snape. (Moved to Ashwinder! Please finish story there!)

*** I just found out the story isn't finished on ff net, the author supposedly moved to Ashwinder but is nowhere to be found. You might not want to waste your time with an unfinished story.

**** I found it on Ashwinder, but it has only the one extra chapter, I believe. I decided not to follow through with it, either way, Hermione /and/ Severus were both completely out of character.

You'll need an account to access it if I'm not mistaken. As I said, it has only one other chapter. It is marked as completed, however.

Uhm, yes, Ashwinder is a bit of a Pick 'n' Mix, lol.

******* I do have an Ashwinder account, so let's see whether I will muster up the courage to finally close this case. This quote had been haunting my mind since 2013 - thank you for helping out, I couldn't find the story using either title search nor search by author. So at least the link brought me peace.
