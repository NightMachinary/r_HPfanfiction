I was thinking on my drive home that what i really would like to do is discuss some of the fics I've read with a group of people (as ff isnt something my friends are all that into) and get other peoples views on the perhaps more popular stories out there.

So would anyone be interested in something like that?

** Sure, but what would the rules be? There are an awful lot of fics out there, and some of the best just happen to be either unfinished and/or abandoned.

That's not even mentioning those amongst us that write fanfiction too (such as yours truly) who would be VERY interested in getting some feedback out of this-and might decide to, you know, surreptitiously influence others into reading their own fics.

Not that I would do such a thing, mind you. My account name is the same on both reddit and ff.net, which would make any such attempt an exercise in stupidity, but it could happen.

So what rules would we use?

** It's a really interesting idea. Which ff archive sites do people frequent? I do most of my reading at HPFF.com but I've also found a lot of good stories at FF.net.

***** Oooh A03 (what its called) is so freaking awesome as a site. It doesnt have nearly the quantity as FFN but its growing and I like that it has options like letting you download any story right into any format. For me I can browse stories and download them straight into the Kindle or Ibooks app on my ipad to read offline. Much better story searching and meta tagging and I like the overall format alot better.

Is it sad to be be fangirling all over a fanfic reading site?? Anyhow I read 3 fandoms there, Harry Potter, Avengers, and Sherlock (bbc) and have been pretty happy.

** That sounds like a really good idea. It could help expose people to different ships and styles of writing than they are used to.

** So some rules/framework I thought about today could be

- Only complete fics (so there are definite endings to discuss)
- All genres, but one a week. For example Adventure fic w/1 Fantasy w/2 etc (perhaps starting in alphabetical order?)
- Discussion thread every Friday close on the Sunday with next weeks fic to be read.
- Only freely available fic forums should be used aka sites you don't have to have an account on to read stories (because it wouldn't be fair to make someone sigh-up)
- Only the most reviewed/Favorited/nominated stories and/or controversial stories (I know some sites have competitions, we could use these to make a 'to read list'?)
- No complaining that you've already read the fic of the week, (because its bound to happen) and who knows reading it from a discussion point of view might change your perception of the story.
- Don't not read a fic because you don't like the pairing/setting (it may be excruciating but reading it anyway because you might be seeing something other people are missing/not thinking about)

Ok that's all I got for now, discuss :)
