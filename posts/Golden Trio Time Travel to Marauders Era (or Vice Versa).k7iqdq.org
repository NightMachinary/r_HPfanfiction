I just finished ATYD (im broken. absolutely shattered. first time venturing outside of drarry and i get hit with THIS), and I wanted to know if there were some well-written time travel fics with the marauders and the golden trio time travel to each other? it's a trope i explored years ago when i was too young and naive to know how EMOTIONALLY DAMAGING fanfics could be (once again, looking at ATYD), but I'm in the mood for a fic that gives me at a small amount of relief :)


** All the young dudes? What google gave me. What fic did you read? I has no good recs sorry.

** The Debt of Time!!!!

Edit (I realized that I should explain more probably haha): DoT is an amazing fic where Hermione gets sent back to the Marauders era, but still exists in the Golden Trio era. It's really hard to explain (bc I'm bad at explaining lmao) but it's without a doubt one of the best fics I've read! 10/10 recommend, and the ending is really comforting especially after ATYD. (I just finished ATYD too and am also broken as fuck so if you figure out how to fix the hole that the fic left lmkkk)
