I might be able to do a lot of good on the down-low, but /damn/ it would hurt, and the odds of successfully recreating the exact circumstances that led to Dobby being freed are minuscule. Worse yet, there's a good chance that even thinking about plans to get oneself freed would activate the self-punishment compulsion.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

***** That could have happened so easily.

Basically her urge was to claw her way to the top of the Ministry by whatever means. If Cornelius Fudge had immediately accepted the return of Voldemort after the third task; gone into a Churchillian "fight them on the beaches" mode^{1,} she might well have gone along with it and become an effective force on the good side, while remaining none-the-less a thoroughly evil and self-serving individual.

Saying that, she probably could have still changed sides in a hearbeat if that looked like a better route to power for her.

**** Your comment kind of got me thinking about how a “Good!Umbridge” fic could work out. Start off with some defining childhood moment with her father, skip ahead to Fudge looking for someone to place as inquisitor at Hogwarts and picking Dolores based off a scheming advisor's suggestion, move on to her visiting Hogwarts and genuinely making an effort to improve the school... Hell, you could even write it in a way where she becomes one of the few adults Harry confides in because she takes what he says about Voldemort and the state of Hogwarts seriously. Could end up pretty well written with the right author.

The fact that Voldemort tracked down Karkaroff, who very much did not want to be found, only demonstrates this further -- and also the fact that where Voldemort is concerned, being a competent adult wizard isn't going to stop him finding you.

There was a reason why the Potters resorted to a Fidelius Charm - as Hagrid also notes in PS, when Voldemort decided to kill you, you died. It was just a matter of time.

** :( I would hate to be a self insert for Harry in any of his childhood or hogwarts years. Because he's a boy, and I'd have gender dysphoria forever and in the extreme, and also because I wouldn't be able to stand being abused by family all over again. If I woke up as a self insert Harry, I'd run away immediately and call the cops. Then when I went to Hogwarts I'd get transfigured or take a potion to make my body female again, and then I'd sort out a new name and feminine pronouns with everyone. Then I might be able to deal with being Harry. But even then, there'd be the threat of Voldemort and the Death Eaters going after me all the time as I tried to live my life normally.

I know canon Harry wanted revenge, and he felt a responsibility because of his parents, but if I were his self insert I wouldn't have anything to do with the Order or the Horcruxes, or any of the book plotlines. I'd leave it all alone, ignore it, and just live. Because canon prophecies, thankfully, are just empty words, and not at all binding fates that fanfics always make them to be.
