I'm tired of so many authors hating on dumbledore(although I see where they're coming from I just like dumbledore as a mentor or grandfatherly type better). I'm looking for something like refiners fire. Preferably harry/Ginny pairing. I'm weird don't hate me. I have already read learning to breathe.


** Wow thanks for the recommendations! I realize that it's unlikely but I just wanted a happier fic with the tropes? I like. I'm new to ff is that the right use of tropes? Anyway thanks.

** Any such fic has to be AU because canon Dumbledore was determined to offer Harry as a sacrifice.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11580650/1/Abraxas][Abraxas]], linkffn(11580650), Harry's scar offered to merge with him, voiding the need to sacrifice him, and Dumbledore indeed trained him. This fic remains a decent super Harry/Ginny story until chapter 19, when everything goes off the deep end.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5648259/1/Elemental-Harry][Elemental Harry]], linkffn(5648259), has Harry turning into a storm elemental, while Ginny turned into a fire elemental. Dumbledore helped them a lot to control their powers, and Ginny simply burned off Harry's scarcrux with her Fiendfyre.

Although not personally training Harry, Dumbledore nevertheless played a very positive role in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][The Bonds of Blood]], linkffn(5435295). In that author's other H/G fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]], linkffn(6473434), DoM special agent Gilderoy Lockhart trained Harry/Ginny along with Luna.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is Ron/Hermione centric, but Harry and Ginny are playing important roles. In this extreme AU, Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore after Halloween 1981 and forced him to flee to France with his remaining followers. Sirius raised Harry, and Dumbledore personally trained him later. Also, Harry, Neville, and Weasleys all went to Beauxbaton. They would have their revenge 18 years later.

****** Definitely Dumbledore!bashing in Abraxas. It's in practically every chapter till his death.

Remember the Flamel scene in Bonds of Blood? They aren't kind.

And unspeakable things has bashing comparable to Abraxas.

Bashing is usually grounded in some kernel of truth, but taken to emotional and reactionary levels that betray the authors juvenile thoughts rather than the characters.

As for Dumbledore, Rowling said Dumbledore didn't realize Harry was a Horcrux till Christmas 1995, when Harry had the snake dream. And by then, Voldemort already took his blood and made Harry unkillable.

I understand the desire to see Harry as a sacrifice, but within canon there is literally nothing that suggests there was any better way. Harry could never have realistically matched Voldemort without decades of experience more than in canon. Really, the only useful thing Dumbledore could have done was let Harry have the elder wand, and Harry nearly goes on a power trip in DH just thinking about getting all the hallows, so that probably would have turned out badly or worse.

Edit: I just realized that's a great idea for a fic. Harry races and claims the elder wand first, then in his arrogance it drives him insane with power.

** Ah, how familiar to your other posts.

You have to understand, a canon-like Dumbledore would likely NEVER train Harry, nor should he. His actions seem wrong to people who only look skin deep (he endanger kids, he bad, etc.). Harry is a kid, he stands no chance of mastering the degree of magic necessary to match Voldemort.

H/G fics with powerful Harry (and/or Ginny) /necessitate/ bashing Dumbledore, otherwise they would not be trained, unless you have a completely AU world.

Additionally, a powerful Harry would in all honesty /not/ end up with Ginny, unless the world was completely altered to make the pairing fit, which is bad writing in general as a rule.

Regardless, I will give you examples of powerful Harry with Ginny, but as I said such fics almost require Dumbledore!bashing. Also, stop reading so much brennus (I know):

linkffn(Taking Control): the ultimate Indy!Harry fic, Harry trained up in a /somewhat/ believable way, but he is thankfully still inferior magically.

linkffn(Learning to Breathe): the inversion of the Harry trains to defeat Voldemort story, Harry starts having already killed Voldemort at 16 in this fic.

linkffn(The World I Leave Behind): Harry gets what amounts to an instant power-up (hand wave explanation involving the Resurrection Stone), escapes and plans to take down Voldemort.

linkffn(The Order of the Phoenix by ruskbyte): a pre-OOTP fic, writing is sub-par but on par or better with 90% of fics published with powerful Harry anyway.

linkffn(The Awakening Power): another old fic post-OOTP, Harry just sort of gets powerful (makes me vomit that it just /happens,/ but people just can't write fics where Harry or anyone /earns/ their strength apparently).

The sad thing is I listed the best-of-the-best in all honesty.
