:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry finds an egg from the basilisk in the chamber of secrets and sends a letter to newt to meet him so newt can take the basilisk. When Harry meets newt Harry disguises himself as a women. This is the most distinct part of the fic. It's been on the edge of my mind all day and I can't for the life of me remember the name, any help would be appreciated!

  Harry James Potter discovered he could change his face, so he did the smart thing, he ran away. He lived on the streets for years, learning to hide in plain sight, always wondering just what these powers are and who he was. One day, finally caught by the Magical society, he's thrust into a new world where the answers he wants await him. Oh & please leave a Review, my ego needs it.
