Hey! I thought I'd share with you the fic I'm currently working on ("starring" *Sirius, Remus and an OFC*). It has a sh*tton of views (people like reading it, I suppose?) but very few readers give actual feedback, which is a bit discouraging sometimes...

Despite it being a Sirius/OC fic, I'm told it does fairly well on characterizations - it is written in diary format, which gives me narrative chances I definitely wouldn't get in a "normal" story. Its main conflict is the fact that the protagonist, Lucy Dawlish does minor work for the Order, but general (in)convenience pushes her further and further into Dumbledore's inner circles. Instead of changing canon, I'm trying to fill the holes... (until the end of OotP, at least).

I've always been crap at promoting myself (and feel super awkward doing so), but I hope some of you will give my story a try, and enjoy it :)

** Is it completed? I've been burned way too many times by people who abandon a fic just when it's getting good to ever trust a work in progress again. If it's completed I'd be happy to give it a look, because it sounds like a cool premise.

*** Yes and no: yes, because the story part is entirely ready (and has been since 2014); and no because I keep polishing my English/adding a few details to each chapter before I post them. Since I know where I'm going with the whole thing, I don't see why I wouldn't finish it. I understand, though, if this isn't enough "guarantee" for you to start reading - I VERY often feel the same way about unfinished fics that had grown on me. Thanks for commenting anyway!

**** Yeah if its 5 years and it's still not in completed status, I'm leery of jumping in. What's the exit strategy on this? Another few months?

***** I've only started posting it last May, when I dusted the whole concept off a bit. Normally, I update on every 12th and 21st - I've been off schedule lately, though, because I had the impression that no one was really waiting for those updates anyway.

If you're interested, I have another story which is a prequel to this one, with the same characters: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13036198/1/Gadding-with-Ghouls]] --> This one is complete, so it might give you an idea if you'd like to continue or not.

** I liked this. It's an energetic, nicely written, pretty original take on a period of Canon which doesn't get as much attention as I think it should. It also benefits enormously from a lack of teenagers.

"It also benefits enormously from a lack of teenagers." ~ I laughed out loud.
