I've read "Adorable Violence" with Hermione as a yandere. Now, my question is that is there any other HP fanfiction with similar idea: a yandere-girl getting romantical interest in Harry, and our dear boy says "yes" in the offer to be together.

Kudos if it is horrifyingly humorous.

*** Per [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere][TVTropes]], "a character who is crazy about someone else... often literally and violently." Contrasts with a /tsundere/, which would be someone who is alternately aloof and lovestruck, or who is aloof with a sweet, sensitive center (similar to the "Ice Queen" trope we've seen used approximately one gazillion times on Daphne Greengrass).

*** Yandere is the essence of the Stalker Girl trope.

To a Yandere Sempai (You) is HER'S, NO OTHER GIRL CAN TOUCH SEMPAI. NO OTHER GIRL CAN TALK TO SEMPAI!

Yandere-chan just needs one more lock of Sempai's hair to finish her shrine. Then Yandere-chan going to go and find that bitch whos been hanging around Him, and shes going to stab the Bitch again and again until she understands that Sempai belongs to Yandere. Or better yet until shes dead, after all if Bitch is dead then she will never make that mistake again.

Sempai hasn't noticed Yandere-chan yet? Then she'll just have to show the poor baby the truth of her love. Some chloroform, rope, Viagra, and some fertility drugs should make him see the truth. Then Sempai and Yandere-chan can have their happily ever after, with Sempai Jr. .

And if Sempai refuses, then Yandere-chan will just have to punish him until he finally sees the truth. If Yandere-chan breaks his legs then he gets punished, cant run away, and Yandere-chan can show Sempai her love by nursing him back to health it's /Perfect/!

--------------

Yandere is an anime/manga trope pretty much about an obsessive stalker girl who "loves" a boy so much that she will do literally anything for his affection, and who will not tolerate competition or rejection even if that means a murderous psychotic break and rape.

You just described Stephen King's novel /Misery/.

***** Not quite. She wasn't showing any love or really wanting to nurse him back to health, IIRC she just wanted the story.

****** Ah, OK. I must have added in a subtext to the novel/movie in my mind that wasn't actually there.

** Going per canon, you could make a case for Lavender. And I'm sure there's some Ginny-bashing story somewhere where Ginny is an obnoxious yandere.
