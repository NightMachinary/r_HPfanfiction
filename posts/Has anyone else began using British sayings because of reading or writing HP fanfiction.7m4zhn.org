*** I had to give a presentation years ago on the History of Maths, unfortunately it started as "Hello, I'm talking to you today about the History of Magic." Got lots of hopes up only to be dashed.

I've also been given cough syrups and other liquid medicines and referred to them as potions more times than I can count. People must think I'm a bit odd.

Also ITT people saying 'Brilliant' is a British-ism. As a Brit I did not know this.

  The pride of a Slytherin is in his resource and cunning, and in the serpent's discerning gaze. Slytherin!Harry, assorted ships. Heavy violence. No Lord Potter, no creature inheritance, no bashing - AU plots (no Riddle diary, no Department of Mysteries, no manipulative!Dumbledore, no Horcruxes). Character-focused and plot-heavy. Cross-posted to Ao3. POV between HP and SS.

*** Note that in most British accents, the r-phonic is not pronounced, so it would sound like ə (which an American would most likely write as "uh".)

Sorry to burst your bubble, mate.

**** *Rhoticity in English*

Rhoticity in English refers to the pronunciation by English speakers of the historical rhotic consonant /r/, and is one of the most prominent distinctions by which varieties of English can be classified. The historical English /r/ sound is preserved in all pronunciation contexts in what are termed the "rhotic varieties", primarily including the English dialects of Scotland, Ireland, and most of the United States and Canada. However, the historical /r/ is not pronounced except before vowels in "non-rhotic varieties", including most of the dialects of modern England, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and, variably, some parts of the eastern (particularly northeastern) coastal United States.

In non-rhotic varieties, speakers no longer pronounce /r/ in postvocalic environments---that is, when it is immediately after a vowel and not followed by another vowel.

--------------

*Schwa*

In linguistics, specifically phonetics and phonology, schwa (, rarely or ) (sometimes spelled shwa) is the mid central vowel sound (rounded or unrounded) in the middle of the vowel chart, denoted by the IPA symbol ə, or another vowel sound close to that position. An example in English is the vowel sound of the 'a' in the word about. Schwa in English is mainly found in unstressed positions, but in some other languages it occurs more frequently as a stressed vowel.

In relation to certain languages, the name "schwa" and the symbol ə may be used for some other unstressed and toneless neutral vowel, not necessarily mid-central.
