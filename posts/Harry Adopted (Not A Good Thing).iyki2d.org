Harry James Potter's horrible situation at the Dursley's reaches a peak. Maybe they cross a line, maybe people finally take a look at the blatant signs, maybe he runs away or they just kick him out... Little Harry Potter, regardless of the how, ends up adopted by someone else long before he reaches Hogwarts.

And his magical (maybe not literally) new guardian is NO BETTER THAN THEY ARE.

Harry is adopted by a dashing young woman who sees an adorable little boy with the prettiest eyes and just has to have him. Not because she feels some great maternal instincts towards the shivering boy, swaddled in clothes many sizes too big.

But because a child would look good for her image right now.

Though Harry is no longer treated as a slave by his new "Mum", given three meals a day, toys, an actual bedroom etc. His mum couldn't give two ****'s about him, barely managing to pop her head in to make sure the six year old she adopted is still alive, once or twice a week.

Maybe the neglect made him bitter. Maybe it made him reckless or overly seeking of support or emotion. Cynical, naive, desperate. Facing open hatred in one household and reckless indifference in another, Harry Potter makes it to Hogwarts utterly broken hearted, with the likes of Snape not understanding why a child literally living in the lap of luxury could ever be so miserable and resentful of their homelife.


** Well this could be a super sad sort of story. Especially if Harry is just happy and doesn't even realize it's just as bad in its own way... :( Saving this PROMPT so I can turn it into a real story in my fanfics folder soon.

EDIT: Okay I started the first chapter to this fic idea! I posted it on my fanfic.net account. :) I won't post another self promotion though, because those never do well!!!

*** This amazing so far, both chapters are really visceral and kind of uncomfortable. Harry is obviously adorable and Asha has such a grounded and realistic characterisation thus far.

Really amazing and I'm looking forward to seeing how it progresses from here.

**** Oh wow you read chapter 2 also? Thank you for calling it visceral and uncomfortable! I wanted to go for that kind of effect. That you can tell it's still awful throughout. That Asha is still awful even if she's trying not to be. She has really skewed thoughts and ideas and rationales about things because of her own bad childhood, and it's kind of gross and not okay still. :) That she's a nice person, but her fucked up headspace makes her a bad PARENT. I also made them kind of opposites in a way, about physical contact. Harry is desperate for it after not having it, while Asha associates it with negativity after her one attempt with her mother got her rejected - and the rest of her childhood went the same way. So she just has this huge disconnect and wants nothing to do with it ever.

***** This is actually pretty sweet. It's sad that Asha's mom was neglectful, but at least she has a template of how NOT to be a parent. Of course, looking at it from a psychological standpoint shes going to run into some trouble if that's all she's got going for her knowledge-wise, she might wanna read some parenting books and try to encourage Harry yo be independent while trying not to seem like shes pushing him away. He's been suffering abuse both physical and mental for years now so he'll take whatever affection shell give him but will react pretty harshly when shes being negative, and the way she is right now, there is either going to be a lot of misunderstandings or shes going to get very frustrated with his behavior.

****** Oh thank you, yes! In chapter 2 I already have her thinking she needs to get a book or something to figure out if Harry is even acting "normal," because it's already making issues for her. :( And yes, putting an attention starved kid with a woman who doesn't even really know how to respond to attention or affection is a bad combo. But they will figure it out...sort of...eventually...maybe...

Well, it is marked family/drama! :) That's part of the journey. Ups and downs and stuff.

I read the second chapter, it's becoming very apparent that Asha is averse to any type of kinship. Hopeful she doesn't actually go into a haze and hurt Harry, cause she seems to have an instant reaction of reaching for her wand.

****** Oh no I don't have an Ao3! :( Another Reddit friend asked me about getting one too though, so I guess if two people are asking then I should already... :)

And thank you! I want to write it in a way to show how even unintentional neglect is harmful. Or on the other side of the coin, how TRYING YOUR BEST sometimes just isn't good enough. Asha isn't a bad person, and she's trying, even if she has a lot of issues, but she's still a BAD PARENT. And that's still going to affect Harry. Because her bare minimum is still awful.

#+begin_quote
  Up at the teacher's table, professor Quirrell was talking to a teacher with dirty red hair hanging around her sickly pale face like a curtain. Looking past Quirrell, two poison-green eyes, devoid of any warmth or empathy, found Harry's own brown ones, and he felt a sharp pain on his scar.“Who's that teacher talking to professor Quirrell?”“Oh, you know professor Quirrell already do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's professor Evans, the potions mistress. Don't get on her bad side, the old hag hates students.“Harry looked again, but the teacher was no longer looking at him. Still, Harry could not escape the nagging feeling, which he had gotten just from a glimpse of her eyes and the cruel twist of her lips, that professor Evans did not like him very much.
