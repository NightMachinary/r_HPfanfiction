I'm in a mood for some Veela stories. Anything goes aslong as one of the above is the main character.

Only completed fics, the higher wordcount the better! :)

I have been writing this for a while. Does not meet your completed stipulation but it has decent length by now and I update it fairly regularly.

***** Many times I will see a rec here and just add it to my list, so a week later when I am reading it I don't remember where it came from.

I finished it before I went to sleep last night and I really enjoyed it.

** To clarify are you looking for ones that have Fleur or Gabrielle as the main character or as part of the primary pairing (I.E. Harry/Fleur)

**** I honestly can't think of any with them as the main character...plenty test have them paired with Harry but most stories use Harry as the main character

** Hope by jencais is great so is Harry and Gabby by the same author. His angel is great until about 2/3rds of the way through and is not complete.

*** Just finished Hope before I made this post actually. But, you're saying there are other fics by jencais with similar premises? Will 100% check that out.

**** Yep there is a second one made to be more fairy tale centric. It is very different but still good.
