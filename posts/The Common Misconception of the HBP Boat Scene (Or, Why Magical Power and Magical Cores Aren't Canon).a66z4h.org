There is this common fanon idea that "magical cores", and by extension, "magical power" actually exists. A common and flawed argument is using the boat scene where Dumbledore mentioned the phrase 'magical power', an arguement which is a massive pet peeve of mine regarding the series since its based on misinterpreting Dumbledore's explanation and/or misinterpreting Voldemort's enchantment entirely. However, what those people don't realise is that Dumbledore's statements make the exact opposite point: that magical power doesn't actual exist in canon.

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the *amount* of magical power that *crossed his lake*." ... *"I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underaged* and un-qualified. *Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old* to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will *register* compared to mine."
#+end_quote

Note the aforementioned text I emphasised. Dumbledore actually said that he doesn't think Voldemort's enchantments will even notice Harry because he's underage. What that actually means is that Voldemort's enchantment was specifically looking for adult wizards and ignoring anyone who wasn't both an adult and a wizard. If Dumbledore had took Ron or Hermione with him instead of Harry, then it wouldn't work because both Ron and Hermione had turned 17 by the time Dumbledore took Harry to find the cave. Any witch or wizard who was considered underaged (i.e. Harry) was automatically ignored regardless of how talented or untalented they are. The only reason Harry and Dumbledore are even able to access the cave is because Dumbledore is the only adult wizard there, whereas Voldemort's spell would only react if there were 2 or more adult wizards trying to get to the Horcrux.

What it really show is that the people defending magical cores, magical power, or magical exhaustion merely saw the phrase "magical power" and act like it proved anything, ignoring the rest of Dumbledore's statement. If anything, what Dumbledore's statement REALLY shows is that magical cores don't exist, magical power doesn't exist, and neither does magical exhaustion by association. The actual point of this scene is to show that Voldemort believes that there is such thing as magical power and magical cores... because he's arrogant enough to believe he was born superior to everyone else. *This is proven by Voldemort's enchantment ignoring any wizard who is underaged, even though Voldemort was one of the most skilled wizards in the world even as a Hogwarts student. Voldemort's dismissal of children is hypocritical given that Voldemort should know how skilled a Hogwarts-aged wizard can potentially be, given his own talent at Harry's age.* Dumbledore points out more than once how Voldemort ignores that which he deems beneath him (e.g. not accounting for House Elves like Kreacher). Voldemort's belief in innate magical power is used to justify his own ideology. Even with the boat scene, the only limitations on the boat is that only one adult wizard is allowed.

To say that magical power exists in canon and that some wizards are inherently more powerful (disregarding skill) is to say that Voldemort's definition was correct. That there is only power and those too weak to seek it. *Its almost as absurd as when people try to argue that Snape was obssessed with Lily, ignoring the fact that the only person in canon who ever made that argument was Voldemort, someone incapable of understanding love.* Let that sink in: the only person in the entire HP canon who ever said or implied that Snape was obsessed with Lily was Voldemort... the same guy who also thought that Snape was his loyal follower even up until Snape's death. But that is going way too off-topic.

Back to the actual topic at hand, what canon actually shows is that magical power is non-existent. All that matters is skill, knowledge, and confidence. Case in point: Hermione's Polyjuice Potion in her second year. Making the Polyjuice Potion itself doesn't take any form of magical power or anything. The actual difficulty of Polyjuice would come from gathering the ingredients at the specific time. In the case of Potions, there is so much specifics that its not difficult to make Potions, but instead its very easy to fail Potions. Stirring too much or too little, or in the wrong direction, or not heating it long enough, could result in an easy failure unless the one making the Potion can remember all the little details. We know magical power doesn't exist for Potions either because Crouch Jr's Polyjuice only lasted one hour just like Hermione's in her second year, and even Moody's stash of Polyjuice that the Trio used throughout DH only lasted an hour each. If magical power existed, then the Polyjuice used by Crouch Jr and Moody would be lasting far longer than an hour.

Knowledge is almost as important as skill. Its no coincidence that the most talented wizards in canon were also highly intelligent (e.g. Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort; also Snape, McGonagall, and Sirius to a far lesser extent). For example, Harry's usage of Snape's textbook in HBP. The book never made Harry smarter or more skilled with magic. It just gave him access to knowledge that he didn't have previously and when given that knowledge, was able to follow those written instructions. Even though Harry and Ron were very easily the least intelligent of those in Slughorn's NEWT Potions class (since Harry and Ron got Exceeds Expectations; everyone else in the class got Outstanding), merely having Snape's notes made Harry outperform the rest of the class. Again, if magical power actually existed, then Harry would have been incapable of following those notes Snape made and would have been almost equally bad at performing Levicorpus and Sectumsempra.

Finally there is intent, but really this is emotions/confidence. Neville only really improves at magic once he gained the confidence in OotP after having to put up with Umbridge and then learning of Bellatrix breaking out of Azkaban. Neville was no smarter nor more skilled at the end of OotP than at the beginning. He just had the confidence and intent needed to do magic better. Harry's Cruciatus Curse in OotP was weak because he didn't really have it in him to torture Bellatix the way she tortured others, yet by DH, Harry's Cruciatus Curse on Amycus was better than it was against Bellatrix because he had a greater desire to make Amycus suffer. Harry is better than Hermione with the Patronus has nothing to do with magical theory but due to the emotions needed. Harry can draw upon that happy memory easier than Hermione can, and also, Harry has more experience using the Patronus against Dementors than Hermione did (who never did so until DH).

*TL;DR: Magical power and magical cores don't actually exist. Voldemort's enchantment defines "magical power" as "two or more adult witches or wizards". The only thing Dumbledore statement actually does is remind the reader of Voldemort's sheer arrogance and his plot-induced stupidity. Arguing that the boat scene proves magical power/cores exists is almost as dumb as arguing that Snape was obssessed with Lily just because Voldemort (of all people) claimed so.*


** Agreed that the only thing that really makes sense with the boat given Voldemort's character and what we observe about magic is that Dumbledore does a rather poor job of explaining (correctly) that the boat only counts adult wizards (and witches). This would make sense given Voldemort's dismissal of those he considers lesser.

That said, my gut feeling is still that some wizards are naturally more powerful than others (though without magical cores). Talent and intelligence count for a lot, but they don't account for how Credence got so powerful with no formal training, for example. I may not care for what JKR did in the most recent film, but it is suggestive of what she's thinking. Grindelwald even implies that Credence's power level is a family trait, assuming he isn't lying.

Using terms as mundane and pedestrian as "magical core" or "magical power level" for something that's supposed to be mystical and exciting is just a bad move. Even if those terms perfectly describe what the author has in mind, using them in the work just takes away all the nuance and mystery.

**** I'd also clasify "magical cores" or "magical power levels" as /measurable/ terms, which goes against the general aesthetic of the HP Universe and also changes how power classification works from a retrospective look (Voldemort and Dumbledore are regarded as the most powerful wizards of their generation because they did incredible feats of magic) to a prospective look (Voldemort and Dumbledore were above 9000 on the Wazowski Scale, which puts them in the 99th percentile for magical cores).

Retrospectively classifying wizards as being more or less powerful based on their actions makes sense for a non-logical society like canon and also allows authors way more flexibility. The only reason to use a prospective look at magical power is if you want to immediately establish a character as powerful (bad writing imo, there are better ways to do so) or you intend to subvert the trope by having a character who measures low on the magical power scale become a badass, either by proving the scale doesn't matter or subverting it with intelligence/cunning.

Not necessarily. I think you could use it to establish the character as powerful, but needs to learn to use his power because he isn't curbstomping his actual enemy which is roughly at the same level.

I think your argument, particularly in regards to this passage, is pretty weak. It seems more likely to me that Dumbledore is being diplomatic about his and Harry's respective power levels by emphasizing that power increases with age. Voldemort just doesn't expect anyone below a certain power level to be any sort of threat, which is his mistake.

I like to think of "magical strength" or "magical cores" less like a status bar in a video game, and more like people's physical strength in the real world. Some people can lift more weight than others, some people have more stamina, some are faster, or can recover quicker. Different people are better at different things. But there's still no way that your average sixteen-year-old can lift more weight than a professional bodybuilder.

And the moral of the story is that he /doesn't need to./ Power isn't everything. Think David and Goliath, basically.

** *sigh* lets play devil's advocate then:

#+begin_quote
  “If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted. ... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her ...”
#+end_quote

Diarymort is literally sucking out Ginny's magical core and overpowering her. "I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley". I doubt he's talking about her skills or knowledge here. He /seems/ to be talking about some kind of magical essence.

#+begin_quote
  “We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.”
#+end_quote

A *powerful* wizard.

#+begin_quote
  “Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it --- you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it.
#+end_quote

Maybe Crouch Jr. is lying here. Maybe the only thing you need is hate. I doubt it. I bet there's plenty little sociopaths who can muster up the hate.

Again from GoF:

#+begin_quote
  “Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!” said Moody. “It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament.
#+end_quote

Even objects appear to have some kind of magical core. The concept of magical power being something that is inherent to things or people seems casually accepted by everyone.

And look at that... Dragons have magical cores too:

#+begin_quote
  “Right --- these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. “There's a way, Harry. Don't be tempted to try a Stunning Spell --- dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon ---”
#+end_quote

Here's Sirius musing about the powerful magical core of Crouch:

#+begin_quote
  “He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,” said Sirius. “He's a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical --- and power-hungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,” he said, reading the look on Harry's face. “No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side ... well, you wouldn't understand ... you're too young. ...”
#+end_quote

Is Harry overcoming Voldemort with his skills and knowledge, or his Harry's magic subduing Voldemort's?

#+begin_quote
  As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harry's wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry's wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers ---

  He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed ... and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way ... and it was Voldemort's wand that was vibrating extra-hard now ... Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful. ...
#+end_quote

Dumbledore talking about a young Tom Riddle:

#+begin_quote
  “His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for such a young wizard and --- most interestingly and ominously of all --- he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards: He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. ... ‘I can make them hurt if I want to. ...' ”
#+end_quote

I'm sure there's many more quotes from the books that imply that there's more to a wizard's power than skill, knowledge and intent.

#+begin_quote
  Finally there is intent, but really this is emotions/confidence.
#+end_quote

This sounds to me like you are just substituting "powerful magical core" for "powerful intent/confidence/emotions". That's fine, but if you say someone just needs a lot of intent it isn't that far away from someone else saying he just needs a big magical core.

Also I think bringing up Neville undermines your point. The relationship between a wand and what amounts to the magical essence of the Wizard appears to be very esoteric and not at all explained by intent, knowledge or skill: Voldemort was very intent on killing Harry, but the Elder Wand didn't work for him.

*** The thing about "magical power" is that just because canon mentions the phrase magical power, or in the case of Crouch Sr "powerfully magical", doesn't mean that magical power and magical cores exist. There is no such thing as a witch or wizard who is deemed powerful who also isn't that skilled or knowledgeable with magic. Why is Crouch Sr so "powerfully magical" as Sirius describes? Because Crouch Sr is a talented adult wizard with years of experience in the ministry. Its much easier for Sirius to explain to Harry (a kid largely apathetic to in-universe politics) that Crouch is "powerfully magical" than for him to lecture him on Crouch Sr's skill as a wizard and his years of experience as a politician. Why isn't Fudge and Umbridge considered "powerfully magical" by the narrative? Because Fudge and Umbridge are idiots, therefore they aren't intelligent or skilled with magic, and thus aren't powerful. Why is Bellatrix considered a powerful? Because she is a "prodigious witch with no conscious" according to Harry, therefore she is powerful because she is actually skilled and knowledgeable about magic.

Think about how often politicians in the real world are referred as being "powerful speaker". There is no politician's core or politician's power that makes them superior to their competition by default. Surely you've heard certain individuals (e.g. Hitler, Cicero, MLK Jr, Churchill, etc) referred to as being great speakers, yet nobody in the real world is inherently a greater orator than another based on genetics. Such a quality is a learnt skill acquired through practice. So why are wizards who are deemed "powerful" in canon deemed to have an inherent magical power or magical core, when applying such logic to anything else wouldn't make sense? Its not like anyone calls Bill Gates a powerful programmer, nor do they call famous authors and playwrights like Shakespeare powerful writers, nor do they call Anonymous powerful hackers. They would be considered skilled programmers, skilled writers, and skilled hackers.

Think about it like this: in canon, there is no such thing as a witch or wizard who is "powerful" who is not skilled and not knowledgeable in various fields of magic. This isn't like a lot of anime where you can have a character who is powerful yet unskilled. In the HP series, knowledgeable and skilled wizards are considered powerful because of their skill, not instead of their skill. To the point that knowledge does in fact equal power, to the extent that every single talented witch and wizard (i.e. Dumbledore/Riddle/Grindelwald, Snape, McGonagall, Sirius, etc) is considered powerful due to their knowledgeable that allows them to do more with magic. Even characters like Wormtail, while considered an idiot, isn't actually an idiot and only looks stupid when comparing him to the rest of the Marauders. He was firmly an above average wizard based on feats alone. To a lesser extent, Harry and Ron don't count either since while neither are particularly skilled, both clearly outperform the average Hogwarts students across the board based on their OWLs. I'd expect Neville to be more indicative of the average Hogwarts student skill-wise than either Harry or Ron.

For example, Voldemort is highly skilled with dark magic, therefore he has the talent to cast powerful dark magic unlike almost any other wizard. Such "power" comes from the knowledge and experience of the wizard. Case in point: Crabbe used Fiendfyre and died because he couldn't control it, whereas a more skilled dark wizard (Voldemort, or to a far lesser extent, Snape and Bellatrix), would be capable of controlling Fiendfyre. Yet Crabbe being able to cast Fiendfyre doesn't make him a "powerful" wizard; the only powerful thing about it is Fiendfyre itself, not the wizard skilled enough to control it.

*TL;DR: There is no such thing as a witch or wizard who is considered "powerful" but is also an idiot, nor is there such thing as a wizard deemed an idiot but is actually "powerful". If magical power and magical cores existed, then why is every talented and intelligent witch and wizard deemed powerful? Wizards who are knowledgeable become skilled with magic, and thus gather a reputation for being powerful wizards, despite the fact that they are only deemed powerful based on their intelligence and hard-work and not just being born superior to everyone else.*

  Dumbledore to Harry: "Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical power remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort, even without his Horcruxes."
#+end_quote

When talking about skill or knowledge, it tends to actually be noted as skill or knowledge as seen above. So when talking about magical power, they should be talking about magical power, and they reference Voldemort's magical power as being above average. How exactly do you think wizards and witches are distinguished from muggles then? It can't just be a wand. It is either their inherent magic, or their ability to draw it in from the environment are the two that make the most sense. Either way, some will be able to draw it in better from the environment(concept of a larger magical core but not exactly the same), or if inherent, some should be naturally more powerful for a variety of factors because that's just how nature works(in which nature in HP world very much appears to follow real world unless shown otherwise).

It's clear that you don't like the idea that some individuals are more magically powerful than others, and that's fine. But it most certainly is canon compliant to have some individuals more magically powerful than others. And no that doesn't mean Voldemort's mantra was right, I'm not going to get into why or how some are more magically powerful because I honestly have zero idea.

** I've actually haven't interacted much in the HP fandom, though I've been a huge fan since it came out, so I'm not sure what the magical core part is. I do think this is very sound and makes sense though.

I'd like to add that I always thought that “powerful” witches and wizards were ones that had a stronger affinity for magic- like natural or raw talent/ability for it basically. The more natural talent one has, the stronger witch/wizard they may turn out to be. But I also liked to think a certain level of dedication was also necessary.

I don't really have much in terms of specific examples. This is just what became more of my headcanon the more I read.

** I actually like the way you've gone about this with logical arguments. After reading it, I would actually agree with you and I'd add that- squibs, from what we know, come suddenly into a family, meaning there is no generational change in magical power. If there were magical power, then a line on the verge of producing a squib would have significantly less magical power than a strong, healthy, squib-less line.

Also, I never noticed before that Voldemort is the only one to ever cast Snape's feelings towards Lily as an obsession and I think you're right that he saw it as that because he is incapable of feeling love himself. This also puts Snape in a different light, because rather than being the creepy, obsessed weirdo, he's suddenly just a man who only had one childhood friend, whom he fell in love with. He did what he did, not because of some deluded, obsession fuelled idea that she would love him if he did these things, but because he loved her and decided that her life should not be wasted and that he personally would make sure that it wasn't. By the time Harry's 11, he's had 10 years to come to terms and he's probably actually over Lily, but has decided she and her friends were right, and has come to the side of the light for himself as much as her memory.

** I'm definitely of the opinion that there is some sort of magical power/core/reservoir that is available per individual because there is actual support within the text despite not being written out. I also understand that some people choose to not have the same belief and that's fine. The fact is that it's similar to wards, the word wards is not canon, its something fanon gave to the idea of protective enchantments. Magical power/core/reservoir is the same thing, might not be canon in actual terminology, but it perfectly describes what it needs to. It definitely hard to pull off well though because most people just use it as a big 'OMG you're so magically powerful that knowledge/skill/tactics don't matter just bulldozer everyone' which is a piss poor way of using the idea. Rowling using it is probably the most well done ever; by how ambiguous she uses it, while still having support in the text.

  What that actually means is that Voldemort's enchantment was specifically looking for adult wizards and ignoring anyone who wasn't both an adult and a wizard.

You can definitely take it the way you have and there isn't anything wrong with that. There are good arguments to support your side in the beginning of your post. However, that isn't 100% conclusive and you can just as easily take it to support magical power when you take into account the other stuff within the book and Pottermore (if you choose). You are just choosing to dismiss the other option because you don't support it. [[/u/Deathcrow]] hits a majority of the points in which there is canon evidence for some magic power/core, whatever you want to call it, that extends beyond personal knowledge/skill/confidence. Some things that are being missed out on are the Elder Wand being the most powerful wand, which indicates some sort of measurements, and if you accept Pottermore as canon, the portraits being based on the magical strength of the paintee.

In that same sentence, Dumbledore says compared to his which can mean a number of things considering Dumbledore says "unlikely . . . will register compared to mine".

How the hell does that make sense? There is no indication in canon, that I remember, that the time limit isn't just a set time limit based upon how the potion works. Feel free to show me though, that would be super interesting because it would definitely be a clear indication that magical power/core/reservoir is not canon. Magical power not existing for potions is not the same as no magical power existing. It could just be that how strong you are magically doesn't affect potions.

  Some things that are being missed out on are the Elder Wand being the most powerful wand, which indicates some sort of measurements, and if you accept Pottermore as canon, the portraits being based on the magical strength of the paintee.
#+end_quote

Remember that the Elder Wand, while not purely mythical, has a reputation build up by in-universe legends and fairytales and like all fairytales, the Elder Wand's actual potency would be exaggerated over time. The Cloak doesn't let you cheat death, the Resurrection Stone doesn't truly revive the dead, and the master of the Elder Wand was never unbeatable. The master of the Elder Wand can lose duels just like any other wizard when faced with an opponent more talented than them, as is the case for Grindelwald losing to Dumbledore. Dumbledore never needed the Elder Wand to beat Voldemort whatsoever in the Ministry duel since he is just that much better than Voldemort. However if Voldemort had been more skilled than Dumbledore, he would have defeated Dumbledore during that duel just as Dumbledore himself defeated Grindelwald.

If you compare wands to technology, then saying the Elder Wand is the most powerful wand says nothing about magical power. Its like saying that a particular computer is the most powerful computer. All it really means is that the Elder Wand's materials (Thestral hair and Elder wood) make it more powerful than other wands and even then, how revered would the Elder Wand really be without its even more famous masters?

I always got the impression that the Elder Wand's reputation was inflated by skilled wizards using the wand, such as Grindelwald. There is this common idea that the Elder Wand is unbeatable, that Dumbledore must have won the duel through trickery or getting Grindelwald to not use the wand, or that the master of the Elder Wand cannot lose a duel. While the Elder Wand is better than other wands, that is largely due to being made of superior materials and having its legacy inflated by various wizards throughout history.

Harry and Ron were the only students in the class who didn't have the required textbook. Slughorn had to give them copies of Advanced Potion Making. What it suggests is that with the exception of Harry and Ron, everyone else in that class earned an Outstanding on their Potions OWL and had the textbook because they knew they were taking Potions, but they assumed Snape was still teaching them.

#+begin_quote
  And you know, getting a new wand that matches with him.
#+end_quote

But Neville did pretty decently even before he got his new wand. He still passed Transfiguration, and did well in Charms and DADA, and of course got Outstanding in Herbology. All of that was done with his father's wand.

This may be because we don't get much outside of Harry's perspective, but the only academic subject we ever hear Neville did terrible was Potions. Though since we only ever hear that he took 3 NEWT subjects, he probably barely got Acceptables like with Transfiguration or maybe failed them. I might be wrong, but we never even get told if Neville actually failed Potions: we just know he didn't get Exceeds Expectations or an Outstanding, meaning he wouldn't have been able to take Slughorn's class either way.

#+begin_quote
  Can't tell if you're serious or not here. There is no indication that Hermione doesn't have the emotion needed. If anything, she should have the emotion required as she grew up, from what it seems, in a decent household which loving parents.
#+end_quote

If anything, Hermione having a decent household with loving parents was what held her back. She had been loved by her parents so much and had a seemingly decent childhood that she probably didn't have a happy memory that particularly stood out. So while she has lots of happy memories, I think she probably takes it for granted without realising it. Things like a decent household and loving parents aren't special to her, but are just the norm for her. So while she definitely had more happy memories than Harry, Hermione probably didn't consider them to be /that/ important since she always had a happy life. Unlike Harry, she never experienced suffering or loss enough to value that happiness.

Harry had strong happiness because he suffered all his life and dealt with the neglect and emotional abuse by the Dursleys, along with having no parents. So Harry values those memories more because he came from nothing and never took anything for granted. In an alternate universe where Harry lived a happy childhood with James and Lily both still alive and well, I don't think Harry's Patronus would be nearly as good as it was in canon.

I don't really know how to explain it, but I think Hermione was less capable than Harry at using the Patronus primarily because she had a much better life than him that most of her memories would be happy memories. They wouldn't stand out among each other, compared to Harry's happy memories standing out from his life of suffering.

The Cloak was never stated to let you cheat death. It was, in legend, supposed to hide without Death watching. Cheating death and hiding from death are two very different things.

#+end_quote

Saying that a particular computer is the most powerful is a very valid statement and if anything proves my point as it shows that there is a varying level of power. Saying the Elder Wand is the most powerful wand does say something about magical power. It shows that there is some varying magical power. To be honest it doesn't matter what your impression is because the Elder Wand has been stated to flat out be the most powerful wand. And it doesn't matter about its potency because that still suggests there is some magical power/essence in play that shows varying levels of power. The Elder Wand being unbeatable is probably the exaggeration part, and maybe exactly how powerful the wand is too, but the fact is, it is recognized as a powerful wand, which indicates some measure of magical power.

Everything you've said so far doesn't disprove there being some varying magical power to be honest. If anything it seems that you accept varying magical power levels for individual which is what magical core/power is meant to represent.

#+end_quote

I'm not suggesting power is everything. I very much think skill/technique/etc is very important, but it doesn't discount magical power of an individual. Skill and technique can only take you so far. Raw power can absolutely overwhelm another given enough difference, which ends up being the problem for fanfic writers because that's the route they end up taking and imo is lazy writing because it very, very rarely is done to make a point.

About Neville - We know we wasn't the best wizard because of confidence and an incompatible wand. We know he made a jump because of confidence. We know he made an, arguably, bigger jump because of getting a compatible wand. To be honest, I'm not sure what you're arguable with Neville here, because we know two factors had Neville improve, his confidence and getting a compatible wand as there were two real jumps in his character prowess. A compatible wand would indicate that he wasn't up to his full potential, which again indicates varying magical power.

About Hermione - I honestly cannot even . . . Are you saying then that the only ones who can produce a "strong" Patronus are those who have suffered hardships in life so they can appreciate how happy they had been prior? There has absolutely zero support in canon and so it doesn't disprove varying magic power levels. In support of a magical core/power though is that generally only those that have been canonically recognized as in the upper levels of wizarding world, have been able to produce a Patronus. We don't know what strengthens a Patronus, all we do know is that a suitable happy memory or thought is necessary to create a corporeal Patronus, which Hermione has done.

Yea don't really accept that. You don't have to suffer to understand what would be a happy memory, and to believe otherwise is absolutely ridiculous. You can have bad memories/experiences and be able to appreciate the happy memories/experiences. I think it's reasonable to assume Hermione didn't have the best childhood, likely a young know it all tbh, and that alone should let her appreciate the happy memories she theoretically should have generated with her family. It has to be more than just memories and/or technical skills. Of the DA, during OOTP, only a handful could produce the Patronus charm and there is an extremely low probability that, given Harry's supposed teaching ability, they lacked the memory or technical skill, so it has to be more than that.

It looks like to me, for this other stuff, you are reaching for headcanon to support no concept of magic power/core when there are a ton of references to the concept of magic power/core without being outright stated. For the boat scene, it isn't a "common misconception" because it can be reasonably interpreted either way even when taking the entirety of the quote.

The Hogwarts students buy their textbooks before term starts. Meaning that for everyone except Harry and Ron to have their own copies of the textbook beforehand meant that they brought their book before September 1st. We also know that students don't get told about getting a new professor until either Dumbledore mentions it after the sorting, or in the case of Lockhart, he publically announces his new job. Back in CoS, the trio didn't even know that Lockhart was the DADA professor until he said it on Flourish and Blott. Until that point, they just assumed the new DADA professor was just a massive fan of Lockhart's.

So when the students get their list of textbooks to buy, they wouldn't know that Snape wasn't teaching Potions until it was announced by Dumbledore on the first day. Even when Harry knew Slughorn was a professor, nobody bothered to mention that he was a Potions professor. Dumbledore never mentioned it when they went to get Slughorn. Molly never mentioned that Slughorn was their Potions professor. Not even Slughorn himself mentioned it prior to Dumbledore mentioning it at Hogwarts.

So it makes sense that Harry and Ron got Exceeds Expectations and didn't buy their textbook since they didn't think they were taking NEWT Potions before McGonagall told them afterwards, whereas Hermione and everyone else in that class got an Outstanding on their Potions OWL, and decided to buy the textbook because they just assumed Snape was still teaching Potions.

#+end_quote

Dumbledore mentioned that Grindelwald wanted to use the Stone to create an army of Inferi, however we know that Grindelwald was mistaken because Voldemort didn't need the Resurrection Stone to make Inferi. Even then, he only valued the Stone as a symbol of his pure-blood ancestry linking him to Salazar Slytherin, not even knowing that it was one of the Hallows.

So Grindelwald, one of the greatest wizards of all time, mistakenly believed the myth of the Hallows and paid for it. He thought the Elder Wand was unbeatable and lost to Dumbledore. He thought the Resurrection Stone could create Inferi yet by the time we learn that fact, we also knew that Voldemort already created Inferi without the Resurrection Stone during the first and second wizarding wars. Then again, considering the Inferi only ever appear in HBP, its also possible Rowling forgot about the Inferi, especially since it makes no sense for Voldemort to not use them in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Admittedly, my explanation for Hermione not grasping the Patronus wasn't worded as well as I would have liked. The thing about it is that Hermione outclasses Harry academically in every single subject, and is only outclassed by him in the practical aspect of DADA. IIRC, Ron similarly struggled with the Patronus in the heat of the moment at the Ministry, albeit it was less focused on.

Either way, Harry's Patronus has nothing to do with magical power. Its to do with emotion. Hence why Harry was capable of using Imperio and Crucio fairly well considering his lack of practice with those spells, because at least Crucio requires the user to want to make their victim suffer out of pure pleasure, not out of justice or revenge. In other words, the Cruciatus Curse is more effective by how much pleasure the caster gets in making their target suffer, vaguely similar to how the Patronus is stronger when the memory is happier and stronger (i.e. the whole "love is the most powerful magic" thing).

While the Imperius Curse and Killing Curse aren't spoken of in the same way regarding intent as the Cruciatus Curse, especially since the Unforgivables are merely a legal trinity of spells and don't necessarily have similar intent-based requirements, its very possible that all three Unforgivables have that requirement. I always got the implication that the Imperius Curse required the caster to want to enslave and dominate their victim and that the Killing Curse required the caster to want to commit premeditated murder. In other words, I think the Killing Curse could never be used in self-defence since the act of using it confirms the malicious intent for premeditated murder. So the Killing Curse isn't Unforgivable because the spell kills people or is unblockable, but its Unforgivable because killing someone with the Killing Curse would automatically prove the caster had malicious intent and wasn't merely trying to defend themselves.

It certainly reinforces why Harry, aside from being opposed to murder in general, never stooped low enough to use the Killing Curse. Not even against Bellatrix after she killed Sirius, nor against Snape after he killed Dumbledore. Because Harry would be incapable of using the Killing Curse since such a curse requires the caster to want to murder someone not to protect themselves but simply because they /can/ kill them.

#+end_quote

The thing about magical power/cores is that, logically speaking, it makes zero sense for them to be canon. Think about it like this: if magical power/cores was canon, it would mean that certain wizards are inherently more 'powerful' than others by their nature. In other words, powerful wizards with a big magical core would have powerful children with a big magical core, meaning that wizards with greater magical power would be genetically superior to wizards with less magical power based on quality.

If that were the case, then wouldn't the likes of Voldemort and the Death Eaters be at least semi-correct if the skill of a wizard was predetermined by genetics by some degree of mental gymnastics? Since powerful parents would have powerful children based on this logic. If Rowling actually thought magical power existed then surely it would destroy the intended moral of her story? Since based on common sense, muggleborns would have to have less magical power than any half-blood or pure-blood since muggleborns don't have magical parents to inherit a powerful magical core from. Yet if magical power/cores isn't actually determined by genetics (nature), then it would make /even less sense/ since something like magical power/cores must be determined by genetics for it to be distinguished from effort and practice.

#+end_quote

My understanding is this is completely incorrect. The Cruciatus curse either works or it doesn't. The strength of it does not depend on the pleasure the caster gets in making their target suffer. That intent instead determines if the curse works or not. How did you get to your conclusion? Harry failed to cast it on Bellatrix the first time because he lacked the intent, he didn't cast a "weak" Cruciatus.

#+begin_quote
  vaguely similar to how the Patronus is stronger when the memory is happier and stronger (i.e. the whole "love is the most powerful magic" thing).
#+end_quote

Two parts: happier memory creates a corporeal Patronus as shown when Remus teaches it to Harry. It does not however state that a happier memory creates a stronger Patronus, nor does it really hint at it. A corporeal Patronus appears stronger than the mist form and so a happier memory makes it stronger in that sense, but once its corporeal, there is nothing to support a happier memory is stronger. Second part, love is the most powerful magic. That right there "most powerful* magic" indicates some varying power level.

#+begin_quote
  In other words, I think the Killing Curse could never be used in self-defence since the act of using it confirms the malicious intent for premeditated murder.

That's not even close to being true. Almost every fantasy realm has some power ranking.

Yea they are semi-correct in that some witches or wizards are naturally better. But they are not correct that just because you come from a pureblooded family means you are automatically stronger. Powerful parents do not have to have powerful children, that just isn't how it works, there are a ton of other factors that could come into play. Just as muggleborns don't have to be less powerful just because they don't have a magical parent. Requires no mental gymnastics at all. Taking real life height as an example. Just because some people are very tall, it doesn't mean their children will guarantee to be very tall, despite having a predisposition to be. Hell the magical core could be because magic is sentient and favors certain individuals, we just don't know.

#+begin_quote
  If Rowling actually thought magical power existed then surely it would destroy the intended moral of her story?
#+end_quote

If she didn't intend magical power to exist, she wouldn't have written that thing about portraits on Pottermore which says " However, the degree to which they can interact with the people looking at them depends not on the skill of the painter, but on the power of the witch or wizard painted." There is clear indication that she actually thought magical power existed from this alone. Sticking to book canon, there are already a lot of other things to hint at it as shown by the above comments. Just because Rowling thought that some would be naturally more powerful then others, does not destroy the intended moral of her story.

Honestly having a large magical core doesn't mean much without the skills and knowledge to use it. Like I said before, raw power only trumps finesse when one is overwhelmingly more powerful.

HP world is very much modeled after the real world, and until it is introduced that something completely contradicts how the real world works, it isn't unreasonable to assume that some things in the real world would translate to the HP world.

I'm curious, how do you think witches and wizards are able to be distinguished with wards from muggles? Same with squibs from muggles as squibs can see Hogwarts from our understanding, but muggles cannot.

** Your argument is flawed for one simple reason:

There exists the possibility that Voldemort checked for /age,/ not /power,/ like Dumbledore's age line did. In fact, this makes logical sense, as if you could just measure power, that would have either debunked or supported the pureblood argument, and Voldemort would also have tested his people because no way would he leg someone stronger than him into his Death Eaters.

But, if he was testing for age, as you suggested, you cannot imply from that anything about magical strength. There's no correlation or causation implied.

Plus, how would you test magical strength? Likely the same way you'd test physical strength: stress testing. Apply a force, see how it resists, apply more force. Everything from weight lifting to material science uses this principle simply because you cannot tell by looking at something how strong it is. It's reasonable then, to suggest that magic, if "magical power" applies, would be tested in a similar way.

And intruders would notice that.

So even in a world where magic cores exist, the boat scene could still work and Dumbledore still could be correct if wizards generally get stronger with age. Harry, even OP!Core!Harry, might not be at his full potential or simply might not be old enough to set off the wards. If age roughly correlates to power and you need a simple, stealthy test, testing for age might be appropriate.

TL;DR don't assume it implies anything about genuine magical power. Dumbledore is referencing age.

With canon magic, a wizard can cast any given spell that he's learned any number of times without needing to take a break - which is just flat out weird.

Magical cores can be equivalent to mana in games, and as long as HP or any given character isn't given an abnormally large one for no apparent reason, it isn't necessarily a bad mechanic.
