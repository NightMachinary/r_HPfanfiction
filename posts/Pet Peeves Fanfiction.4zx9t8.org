What are some pet peeves you have concerning fanfiction?

One of mine is when people say "Marauders Era". I mean the Marauders were nice and all, but they didn't do half the shit the Golden Trio did.

The 70s was not the Marauders Era, most people probably didn't know such a group existed. The 70s was the Voldemort Era. He pretty much dominated.

Another pet peeve are when the author makes Harry short, since according to the books, Harry was tall by the end.

Another pet peeve is when authors remove Harry's spine, make him into a crybaby, and have him spill his secrets to random strangers.

Another pet peeve is Ron bashing. I have no problem with stories where his flaws are pointed out, but he is brave, clutch, and reliable when it counts.

I don't like Ginny bashing is horrendous, the result of Harmony fanatics. Ginny is a pretty good gall, brave, noble, heroic, etc. Not perfect, but nobody is.

I don't like Draco-In-Leather-Pants. But it is nearly impossible to find any stories that portray him the way he was in the books: a repentant coward, crybaby, attention seeker, social retard. Most stories just take Harry's confidence, leadership abilities, aloofness, combine it with Riddle's charm, suave nature, talent, combine it with Ron's empathy, humor, then slap on Tom Felton's looks, and pretend they're making a story about Draco.


** I have two big ones.

The first is when the author goes out of their way to make sure their plot lines up enough with canon that they can steal the climax of the main books, even if it makes zero sense. For example, I recently read a story (forgot the name) in fifth year, Harry was able to get enough information out of the Order of the Phoenix that he knew that Voldemort was trying to lure him into the Department of Mysteries for a McGuffin. Yet, towards the end of the year, he ends up at the Ministry for some reason or the other and then wanders off to get lunch, gets lost, and somehow ends up in the DoM where conveniently no other Ministry workers stop him and he ignores all logic just so he can figure out what the McGuffin is. This just breaks my immersion, especially when the first ninety percent or so of every school year is vastly different from the books, but the climaxes are slapped on so that the overall plot doesn't change too much.

The second is a more recent one that I have come across, and that is Luna being a /true/ seer that gets more than the brief glimpses of the future that we see Trelawney has, and her normally charming gibberish is actually intentionally vague /truths/ about the the gang, or their future. It just feels like a shallow way of trying to make Luna feel deeper. A good example of this is the Luna in linkffn(8195669)

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

****** I think it's because they needed a middle name, so they picked the easiest one. Like how Bill's full name is William Arthur Weasley, so they make Arthur's middle name Septimus, due to how many characters tend to have their father's middle name.

Either that, or they borrow from Percy's middle name convention, Ignatius, and name them after literally almost anyone in their family tree.

Or my personal favorite, they fucked it up, and misspelled it Ignotius, causing a lot of different characters to have the name of one of the Peverells.

** This is a work in progress, but I think I've covered all the major bases here. Encountering any one of these is generally grounds to stop reading a fic.

*World*

- Muggles/technology being depicted as able to defeat/get around magic.

- Muggle society being depicted as significantly more “enlightened” than wizarding society.

- Wizards displaying significant interest in Muggle culture or technology.

- Depiction of the wizarding world as stuck in the past, or having Victorian values. Wizarding society is its own unique thing, not Muggle society 100 years ago. In many respects it is more liberal than Muggle society. In some respects it is more conservative.

- Depiction of wizarding society as lacking innovation/static.

- A wizarding world with a functional nobility. A defunct nobility is acceptable.

- Backwater Britain (with respect to other magical nations).

- Backwater wizards (with respect to other magical species).

- A magical population that is too large. I feel like 30,000 wizards in Britain is the absolute maximum, but really it should be significantly less.

- A magical economy that is too large or sophisticated. Magical Britain is about the size of a small town. It shouldn't have billionaires (except perhaps those who hold real estate which if sold to Muggles, would be worth billions), a stock market, or really any kind of sophisticated financial services.

- The idea that “Dark Lord” is a commonly used title, or even a magically real title, as opposed to a made-up title that originated with Voldemort.

- Casual use of the Unbreakable Vow.

- Casual use of Veritaserum.

- Making rare and obscure magic relatively common knowledge, in particular occlumency and horcruxes.

- Depiction of Aurors as magical police who have general enforcement duties, as opposed to specifically elite Dark wizard hunters (and occasionally VIP bodyguards).

- Depiction of Aurors as having a command structure, procedures etc which are reminiscent of Muggle police or military.

- Helpful Goblins who perform a great many functions which would more correctly lie with the government, law firms, and accountants.

*Magic*

- Any kind of magical exhaustion, including “concentration exhaustion”. Physical exhaustion and general tiredness are acceptable.

- Magic as energy, or as working within the same system of laws as physics (rather than overriding/breaking physical law).

- Non-permanent transfiguration.

- Magic which is presented as simple to understand and learn. In particular: wish magic, where all you need is intent and willpower, and dictionary magic, where all you need to do is look up the incantation and wand movements and practice them.

- The idea that a wizard could cast powerful/advanced magic without having studied it in some form, whether that means reading up on it or experimenting with it themselves. Corollary: the idea that a wizard could have studied a piece of magic extensively but not cast it well. The most common and egregious example: Hermione who is an expert in magical theory but not so strong at actually casting magic, as opposed to a Harry who is great at casting powerful and advanced magic but doesn't really understand what he's doing.

- Magical oaths other than the Unbreakable Vow existing.

- A Veela's attractiveness coming from passive direct mental manipulation like the Imperius curse. In canon, the Imperius-like effect only happens when they sing and dance. The rest of the time they're just supernaturally beautiful, to which some people might react by saying stupid things, just as they do in real life, but of which there is no magically compulsive element.

*Harry*

- Characterisation of Harry which ignores his resilience and turns him into a crybaby, a nervous wreck, prone to emotional breakdowns, or infantilizes him.

- Characterisation of Harry that turns him into a genius.

- Characterisation of Harry that ignores the strengths and talents of his canon self.

- A Harry who rants and shouts at adults, and generally comports himself like a 7-year-old having a tantrum.

- A Harry who constantly dispenses “wisdom” to his peers, such as telling Hermione not to believe everything she sees in a book the first time he meets her. It's transparent use of Harry as authorial avatar.

- A Harry who ditches Ron and Hermione as friends.

- Overstating the level of the Dursleys' abuse.

- A Harry whose wealth is overstated. He should be comfortably well off, but any galleon count that goes into the millions should be avoided.

*Other characters*

- Any kind of bashing, especially of Dumbledore. Bashing turns characters into shallow cardboard cut-out villains who exist solely for Harry to knock down easily and thus look powerful/important/clever for doing so. But because the villain has been hollowed out, his defeat of them carries no glory. He's playing on easy mode.

- In particular, stupid/comic relief Ron, evil or incompetent Dumbledore, scheming Ginny, smothering Molly, jealous Hermione.

- Making Harry the only character who is capable of learning. Another common feature of bashing is rehashing the same conflict over and over, where a villain doesn't learn anything from the previous conflict and continues to make plans using their old, now disproven assumptions.

- Genius Hermione. She's clever, hard working, and has a very good memory. All laudable qualities. But she's no Dumbledore, or even a Snape.

- A Hermione who identifies more as a Muggle than as a witch.

- A Fleur whose identity revolves around her Veela heritage as opposed to being a talented witch who just so happens to be extremely beautiful.

- Any characterisation of Voldemort which makes his worldview reasonable or removes his psychopathy.

- Characterisation of Snape that makes him too noble, or affable once you gain his respect.

- Characterisation of Snape that makes him a one dimensional evil villain.

- A Grindelwald who is made a 1-to-1 analogy of Hitler, or has functional connections to Hitler.

*Plot*

- Fics without a plot or plot structure.

- Any change made to the HP world which does not have corresponding changes to character motivations and actions. For example, in canon Voldemort could not penetrate Privet Drive during the summer. If your fanon makes it so that him taking Harry's blood does allow him to penetrate Privet Drive, you should also change character behaviours to match - Dumbledore would know this, and act accordingly. When an author changes the world but keeps Dumbledore's actions the same, and then criticises him in the story for those unsuitable actions, what the author is really doing is having the characters criticise their own poor writing.

- Fics that have Harry pick up a book in year five only to discover the “real nature of magic”. He's been at magic school for several years and has been getting pretty good grades. He already knows the real nature of magic. Authors always underestimate the extent of Harry's knowledge. Just because we're not shown it doesn't mean he's not learning it.

- Romantic partners who do not have their own lives, with their own circle of friends, their own dreams and ambitions which may clash with their partner's plans, their own opinions and beliefs which differ in some areas from those of their partner.

- Naive sex god eunuch Harry. That is, having female characters be attracted to Harry precisely because he's so insecure and freaks out at anything sexual. “You behave completely asexually, which is exactly why I want to have sex with you!” said no woman ever.

- Fics where Voldemort just sits around making pointless terrorist attacks but never actually does anything to try to take control of the wizarding world until a “final battle” with no strategic purpose.

- Inconsistency in the abilities that characters possess, especially their level of duelling ability or the use of any special talents. This inconsistency is more often than not used to force the plot in a direction which it would not naturally go, given those abilities.

- Rehash of the canon plotlines with no significant changes. Especially where the divergent elements of the fic mean that events should logically diverge, yet the fic finds ways to force the original canon storyline.

- Depiction of magical warfare that ignores the high mobility and stealth capabilities of wizards, as well as the relative lack of need for natural resources or land. We should be seeing skirmishes for strategic objectives, not significant pitched battles.

- Time travel/dimension travel stories where the travelling character very quickly ends up telling their life story to people they barely know.

#+end_example

You can't "break" physical law. If you have broken a law, congratulations, it is no longer a law. For me, that fact that magic seems to defy physical laws shows that our laws are not yet a complete description of what is possible and would lead me to abandon the broken laws and search for new ones.

#+end_example

What do imagine to be the function of spell books? Also, the practical instruction in e.g. the Charms classroom is little besides giving the wand movement, incantation and intent.

If I have come accross as snarky, I am sorry. I would really like to know what your version of magic looks like :)

But if you do want to get into the semantic argument, JKR prefers to talk about mundane nature and magical nature as two separate sets of rules, which magical nature having priority over mundane nature. But as I say, this is functionally the same thing as saying that mundane nature is false and magical nature is the true description of the universe. Either way, the magical rules have priority over the body of rules we currently believe govern the universe.

Let's be realistic here. There's no way he's not malnourished from what the dursleys feed him. He's grown up sleeping in a boot cupboard, it's likely he has scoliosis from contortion if not other serious problems. Dudley hits him, presumably a lot, and ambushes him with friends, this may result in fractures of ribs or the like. Then in the second book, they imprision him and are feeding him through a damn cat flap. Where is his bathroom? Ew. This is clearly enough to get arrested for abuse in America, but everybody puts it off as "oh, it's just neglect, it's not that harmful." The most realistic fic I ever read involved Harry actually acting like he'd been abused for ten years.

The problem is that that never happens. He just sees her, figures out that she likes reading, and tells her not to believe everything she reads in a book, without knowing what those books even say. It's authors refusing to realise that their characters are not their mouthpieces and don't know everything they do.

Also if you're talking about pre-Hogwarts Harry - he eats at their table more often than not, his cupboard is large enough to fit both him and Uncle Vernon, and you overestimate both how hard prepubescent children hit and how easily children fracture.

The point being that there's no need to exaggerate if it's as bad as it supposedly is (which it is).

This one is usually handled really badly but I think there is a core of tragic truth in it. It could be handled if the wizards were to make the concentrated effort to tackle the issue but their own insularity and backwards-facing attention makes this a growing threat looming over them.

For all of their history their established methods were enough to protect them - remove the direct witnesses, restore the site or fake a different incident and it is as if it never happened. But accelerated technological development has made that approach insufficient. The information of a magic incident occurring is no longer contained to the direct vicinity of the site, it now for the first time in history can spread faster than the wizards can move, it is held no longer only in the minds of people and on media subject to direct and casual inspection. That is the big issue. They no longer control the information and they refuse to even think about it.

This depends largely on how you conceptualise magic, though. So often magic operates in a way that defies technological solutions. For example, the Taboo spell seems to be cast not over a physical area, like a magical microphone, but rather directly on the word itself. Wherever you are, no matter what magical protections are around you to hide you, if you say the word, the Taboo is triggered. So, for example, I doubt that satellite imagery can get around spells designed to prevent Muggles noticing locations. The spell hiding the location isn't on the physical space of the location, it's on the location per se. It's not a physical boundary where the magical effect takes hold, it's a kind of predicate attached to the thing itself. This castle is 1000 years old, it's made of grey stone, and it can't be seen by Muggles. Magic adds to the castle's properties. So a Muggle 100 miles away looking at a camera image of the location is still attempting to perceive the location so would still be within the effect of the spell, just as the castle remains 1000 years old no matter where you view it from.

****** I think in general they don't need to. Remember the Muggles in the HP universe are not real life Muggles (or at least, they are not how we like to see ourselves). Muggles in the HP universe have an instinct to explain away any magic they witness. From what we're told, for example, it doesn't seem like there are any charms hiding the Knight Bus or its effects on its surrounding environment from Muggle view. It's just so fantastical that they refuse to believe it exists when it goes past, causing entire buildings to jump around.

If you read the side books (Fantastic Beasts and Quidditch Through the Ages) you will see footnotes referencing a book written by a wizard about this phenomenon. I can't remember its exact name, but it's something like "Why Muggles Prefer Not To Know".

However, to entertain the thought experiment, if there was a significant breach of Secrecy, I imagine the response would be for the wizards to use their control over Muggle governments to denounce the breach as a hoax, no doubt using magic to get the entire mainstream media to back up the idea. Faced with a video going around YouTube depicting magic, with all governments and media calling it a fake, combined with the natural inclination to write off fantastical events, I don't think many Muggles would end up believing magic existed.

In a way, the 90s and early 2000s are far from the end of the security of the statute. They might be the one window in history where revelation of magic is possible: technology has advanced far enough to widely distribute information quickly, but hasn't advanced far enough for believable VFX to be achievable. Once VFX are good enough (like now), any video of magic could easily be written off as special effects.

Worst comes to worst, the Ministry could always go back in time to undo the revelation.

***** How you conceptualise magic, yes. And two major conceptual points are:

The Wizard selects the target, not the magic.

And, machines are not muggles.

It helps very little that a muggle cannot see the castle even on an image when the timing in a radio relay through the area shows a consistent error, when GPS mapping comes up with a spot that is not there, when image recognition algorithms are sophisticated enough to apply the label "castle" without a human hand in it. Wizards rely on cleaning up primary evidence and they have tailored their magic to that task, with primary mental effects accomplishing it. They do not target their magic at the secondary evidence that becomes ever more important in the muggle world.

Do not get me wrong, wizards could sort the issue if they set to the task -- but they will not do that. Magic on its own will not will not relieve them of that job.

Which in turn results in an error that will kick off all kinds of other issues.

The only way around it were if the unplottable area were 'not real space', were expanded space. Which can't be as we know that wizards occupied formerly normal areas and turned them unplottable, removing 'real space' from muggle access.

Furthermore I do not believe that at the time the spells were invented to turn places unplottable the wizards were concerned with keeping consistent spatial metrics of muggle-accessible areas. Instead the spells are, like others of their ilk, designed to fuck with people's minds and their perceptions of the areas themselves to hide them. This was fine in an era of direct observation but it is not enough anymore in the age of indirect observation.

Okay, East and West are right next to each other, with zero distance between then. Then go five yards North on both East and West and suddenly there is a distance of ten miles between two points that are supposedly still right next to each other. That kind of disparity is a red flag for any software and tends to result errors, noticeable errors.

But you don't even need GPS, weather stations are already enough. Wind directions that change between two stations with supposedly nothing inbetween to deflect the airflow. Rain fronts suddenly move extremely slowly between two measuring points while showing no difference in speed before and after. A thousand other things that modern precision measurements and automated data processing throw up.

There are many ways to handle inheritance and family affiliation. For instance, everyone could keep the affiliation of their birth; people could choose to change affiliation without marriage, assuming family leaders agreed to it; in a marriage, you could generate a new braided family (Harry Potter-with-Nott and his spouse Theodore Nott-with-Potter) and explicitly choose which side of the braid each child favors; you could have clans separate from families and negotiate for every marriage which clan you will be a part of, with a lesser marriage that doesn't impact clan affiliation...

It would be kind of odd to gauge who in the relationship has more say or is emotionally dominant or whatever and base affiliation off of that explicitly.

** I hate when I'm reading a post-battle fic that complies with canon except they change one minor or semi-major fact. When I read a post-Battle fic, I want to believe that this could realistically take place after the events of the books. Slightly changing certain events takes me out of that.

Along these lines, I hate when they have Harry and Ron go back to school for their 7th years, and even more so when they have Harry be a teacher. It seems like they contrive this scenario to allow Harry and Ginny, and Ron and Hermione to have an easy, epic romance and sleep in the same room. But having them apart for the year provides natural drama and I don't understand why writers go out of their way to avoid conflict in a story.

** My biggest pet peeve is probably where people write any character as the same person they were when they were 17. This includes (no offense, OP!) the Draco-is-a-crybaby-coward trope. Characters are much more complicated than what a few scenes can show you. A lot of really big shizz was going on that year. If you cry over something major, it doesn't make you a crybaby. You're just a breathing, feeling human being going through some tough times.

** i don't like ginny bashing either, even if i don't like her. i just think people should fill her lacking character in cannon with something that isn't fangirl if they don't want her as the pairing.

not very into 'tech is just better'. there's no reason to think that there isn't similar stuff in magic. computers weren't much of a thing when i was in the school, which is the same time harry was at his.

when authors go through the plot in the wrong order. harry is walking towards dumbledore's office and decides to go back over all the weeks events leading up to this point in his head; often not even internally moving forward within itself. why do you need those two sentences and then 30 paragraphs unrelated to it ffs.

** Well, Golden Trio and Silver Trio (Ginny, Neville, Luna) bother me. I forget who, but some author had a very good rant/explanation why no one would think to call them that.

I don't really have a current fanfiction pet peeve I'm raging about. But if I had to pick one, I'd say it's the idea that Fleur never integrated into the Weasley family and that Ginny still calls her Phlegm.

** Character bashing. Especially gratuitous Dumbledore bashing, hell ANY Dumbledore bashing. I HATE Dumbledore bashing so much, instant "back button, never read again" in my book. I mean sometimes it can be funny but 99.95 percent of the time, NOOOO! We get it, you hate the guy! But did you have to write him as a mustache twirling villain who gets brutally pwned? It's way worse when they DON'T write him as a mustache twirling villain. When he's his normal canon self (who isn't evil AT ALL) and somebody gets "revenge" against him, destroying his entire reputation, ruining him and having the entire friggen' world hate him in the process. Not giving a damn that they just rolled out the red carpet for Voldy.

And here's something that's even worse, y'all. Dumbledore bashing when there is NO. WARNING. I always lose it when I'm trying to read and I see bashing and the author didn't TAG that shit! For the life of me, I can't stand this. When I start reading a story, and it's friggen' EPIC, and I'm really getting into it. When all of a sudden, Dumbledore bashing! Out of literally NOWHERE! And that's really irksome, I hate it. Seriously, as a writer myself I thought there was a rule in fanfic. Tag. Your. Story. It's really not that hard.
