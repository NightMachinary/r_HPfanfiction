Just finished reading Broken by SongAngel, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11770086/chapters/26534340]] , linkao3(11770086). A not so slow burn Dramione romance. Story combines lots of warm and fuzzy, luvvy duvvy romance with lots of anxious angst for most of the story and a very happy ending. I'm a big fan of WAF so I really enjoyed the story. Made me smile a lot. ðŸ˜ŠRecommended. Also has lots of utterly adorable baby Scorpio!!

  Hermione and Draco are some of the best healers that St. Mungo's has to offer. When they are forced to work together, Draco finds himself surrounded by wizards who were once enemies. Soon he realizes that Hermione has a secret that could kill her, and that all of the wizarding world could be at risk.

** Okay, but how does it resolve Draco's canon characterisation? Because In the books Draco is a turd whose only virtue is his cowardice, and book Hermione has no time for that.

Is it technically a different, less awful Draco or do they just gloss over what a shit he was during school and the war?

*** Good question. I've never read the HP books or seen the movies, so I don't have any context in that regard. In this story Draco is greatly softened by the recent death of his first wife. So, for this story, that event took a lot of the sharp nasty edges off of Draco and made him more humble and empathetic.
