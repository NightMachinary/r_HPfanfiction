The main thing I remember about it is that 'dark magic' was really relegated to being more 'pagan magic' rather than bad in most cases, and that Draco gifted Harry a necklace that was a clover and some hair in a tiny honey pot that was meant to make him like Draco's company a bit more. Supposedly it was a common gift between 'Dark' children.

I don't recall if they end up as a couple so I don't know if it was a drarry fic or not. there was a lot of exploration of 'dark' magic though, and I really liked the concepts it looked at. the Malfoy's may have also turned on Voldemort? Not sure.
