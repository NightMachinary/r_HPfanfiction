harry x katie bell pairing (we need more authors to explore this pairing!) with 1 chapter per year starting at third year and focused on christmas time. not yet finished but it sounds like it will be in a week or 2. its quite sweet and well worth a read this christmas season, chapter 3 in particular was very enjoyable.


** It has way too many damns, hells, smirks, and broom cliches for my liking.
