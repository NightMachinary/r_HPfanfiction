** I could see Harry wanting to be the bigger man, but since when is Ginny a push over?

*** Since half the fandom decided that she had every negative quality ever because she "stole" Harry.

*** I think they meant to call Harry a push over, and Ginny boring. I think whether it's true or not depends on your headcannon. Though Ginny isn't meant to be boring, she seems like that because we hardly got any scenes with her actually talking.

**** Because she's a background character that barely crossed the threshold of side character. Luna is the same, but she is interesting, so she stands out more.

I've long since accepted that JKR can't write romance to save her life. So I'll read any fic that has any pairing that isn't canon.

***** Agreed. All of it. (I'm actually a Harmony shipper and was trying to be objective.) I don't like the pairing Hinny. I like Ginny, though. She's really fiery, from what we've seen.

** But Ginny hexes people just for annoying her? And makes fun of Fleur behind her back constantly? She wouldn't be a bigger person about it; she'd be as petty as Hermione!

** Just read Hermione centric fics where Harry is a background character, more satisfaction for you there.
