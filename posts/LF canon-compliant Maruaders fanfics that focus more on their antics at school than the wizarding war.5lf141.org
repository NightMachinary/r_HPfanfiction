I don't want no feel trips anymore, i just want some lighthearted Maruader humor.


** I'm not very big on Marauders fanfics, but I seem to remember that "The Game" by NamelesslyNightlock was pretty fun. It depicts a week-long game of Truth or Dare between the Marauders, Lily, Frank, Alice and Hestia Jones -- and hi-jinks ensue. It does have some emotional parts, but it's mostly just lighthearted silliness.

  Seventh year Gryffindors all decide they need a bit of fun and Sirius suggests Truth or Dare, but with a twist. Will it really go for a week non-stop? And what is with the parchment?

  Inside this story you will find the chronicles of the 7 years of torture the staff of Hogwarts had to endure, from their point of view, due to 4 boys. That's right. None other than James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew.
