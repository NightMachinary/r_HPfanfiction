** I like Forging the Swords explanation of the 'binding magical contract'.

There are plenty of things in canon I don't like, but I can't stand the idea that things should have happened differently. It is what causes shitty authors to try to 'fix' canon instead of just making something AU. It's responsible for H/Hr being a complete shit show. Because the shippers are trying to show how things /should have/ been.

** It's magic. So pretty much none of it makes 'sense'. Obliviation is completely 'dark' in my mind, along with viewing others thoughts is being evil, yet one nobody cares about, and the other is either so rare, or difficult that nobody cares or teaches defenses against it. Love potions are taught how to be made in schools, bought from stores, even treated as a joke. Love potions have a ridiculous degree of abuse potential. The fact that Molly Weasley joke about them is rather terrifying when she's supposed to be this wholesome protective housewife. Slavery of an entire race (house elves), mass discrimination of multiple races (werewolves, vampires, merpeople, goblins, centaurs) women who can bend people to their will (veela) and the widely accepted racism that leads to death camps. Pure bloods seem to be crazy, and the entire idea of involuntary magical contracts is one of the most terrifying ideas in the story. I always thought it bizarre that tom riddles name wasn't put in the goblet of fire the year after book 4.

**** The idea that wands can play such a huge role in the relative effectiveness of individual witches and wizards with regard to their abilities in magic is anathema to the general theme of magical ability setup in the prior six books.

While it was clear that a poorly matched wand was ineffective, there was a clear distinction regarding the relative abilities of witches and wizards with magic in general, Barty Crouch Sr. is magically powerful - GoF, to certain individuals, for example Harry's parents have varying skills within the paradigms of practical magic application. And though it is mentioned that their wands favored such magically it could be inferred that such affinity was a sort of prescient awareness on the wand's part.

Instead, it seems that wand making is the most important possible trade and that having the best possible wand is the an important element in being a great practitioner of magic.

I don't know if it is shit really, but it is an obvious mistake in hindsight, even from a "stories for kids" perspective. If you really want to be great, you need the best thing, preparation, perseverance, intellect, and hard work are nothing in the face of the best thing.

From that angle, Voldemort should have won, Dumbledore should have lost, and inherited items like the ring and the cloak are more important than anything a normal wizard could achieve.

In terms of egalitarian philosophy, the Elder Wand may in fact be shit, despite my earlier beating around the bush. Even in terms of internal agreement it is poor.

That said I'm not British, and the having of a monarchy and also the titles, land rights, wealth and power distribution of that culture may play a part in the formulation of this tale which is lost on me.

Whatever the case, the above is my issue with the elder wand, namely that it feels like a cheap device rather than a missing puzzle piece, precisely because it is a cheap device, in the best tradition of fanfiction, rather than a worthwhile anything else.

***** My way of looking at this issue is by thinking that belief plays a large part in magic. We see this in the books such as when Harry casts his patronus to save Sirius in PoA because he knows that he can cast it because he already did.

Another example of this is Neville. At the start of the series he can Beauly get spells right. While part of this may may be due to a badly matched wand, when he starts to get more confidence in OotP and his belief in himself is greater, his spell casting gets better.

This also ties into how I believe Harry survived the killing curse initially. As Voldemort believed that Harry would be the one who could possibly be the one to end him, and therefore doubting his abilities and in conjunction with Lily's sacrifice caused him to fail .

In terms of the elder wand, it makes the wielder believe they cannot be beaten and therefore it is more difficult for them to be beaten, especially if their opponents knows they have an unbeatable wand and believes that because their opponents has that wand they cannot win. In cannon, Voldemort learns right before he dies that Draco disarmed Dumbledore before he died and therefore doubts that he is the master of the elder wand and since Harry believes that he is Harry ends up victorious.

Or even, you should have different wands for different tasks. Ollivander also mentioned Lily Potter purchasing her /first/ wand, which suggests that it's reasonably common to purchase a second. Task-specific wands would be a way to make that happen.

** Halfbloods.

Think about it. Rowling has said that the majority of wizards in Harry's time are not pureblooded, and muggleborns aren't incredibly common, which means most wizards are part muggle. That means that wizards and witches have been successfully integrating into muggle culture to the point where they can have relationships and children with muggles. Arthur Weasley works in the department of misuse of muggle artifacts, so he should at least be an expert in muggle objects, but he doesn't know how to pronounce electricity or what a rubber duck is for.

Personally, I can see Lucius maneuvering to place Arthur in his position, if only to get rid of a potentially much greater threat.

Especially since you can broadcast games from all over, with your own English-speaking commentators.

But filling up the rest of the week with what, scripted content, talk shows, etc.? The number of magicals in Britain is debateable but is probably in the 5-20k range.

** Timeturners.

The way timeturners work in canon is by creating timeloops that seem to be an immovable fact of the universe. Since time seems to be a singular point in the universe on a never splitting path, these timeloops have always existed. They're like a loop on a street the universe follows. When Hermione got the idea to use the timeturner by Dumbledore, it has always been a fixture in the universe that Hermione and Harry would use the timeturner to safe themselves and Sirius so that she could use the timeturner.

Timeturners as they exist now are the anti-thesis to free will. Much like a prophecy, the moment a timeturner is made every timeloop it will ever create is made a fixture of the future, like the outcome of a prophecy will always come to be, one way or another. (I, of course, completely ignore Cursed Child here.)

If I gotta be honest, I'd prefer them to not exist at all.

But if I had to redesign them without scraping their concept completely, I'd make them "Reset Buttons". Turning them is to reset the universe by a certain amount of time based of the rotation of the third planet in the solar system of Helios, based in the Milky Way galaxy in the Orion-Cygnus arm at an orbit of 217km/s. By reseting, the timetraveler can then go ahead and act with the world as normal, changing outcomes at his pleasure.

I'd also change that a tool like that can be handed to a third-year student to manage her coursework. It would be in the hands of Dumbledore, a mage capable of controlling such magic, who uses it to right the wrongs as he perceived them, making the story of Harry Potter one of a loved boy of two loving parents in a world that has never seen the thread of Lord Voldemort as the young Tom Riddle is known as Tom Dumbledore, adopted son of the great archmage.

You see why I want this thing gone? It makes 0 sense, in its original form as well as its redesigned form.

** 1: Wizarding economics makes no sense. How can someone be "rich" or "poor" in a world where you can just transfigure anything you want other than food or (useless) money? Sure there are some things like food or wands that you probably can't get another way, but why would you need money to have a nice house when you could presumably create one? There's no evidence in the books that transfiguration or conjuration are time limited. Even if they were, you could still make your house out of real materials and just use magic to avoid labor. Similarly for clothing and household goods, etc.

2: The Wizarding population makes no sense. Is it large or small? We know of no other wizarding schools, so can we assume that there are only 40 or so children born a year based on Harry's class at Hogwarts? There were about 4 million children born last year in the US on a population of about 300M. Being very, very generous about multipliers, and assuming most families are about the size they seem to be in Harry Potter (that is, not very different from the US or UK other than the Weasleys) we'd have at best a population of under 10,000 people, not nearly enough to sustain a government bureaucracy that has enough people in it to regulate cauldron bottoms and the like.

(This of course combines quite a bit with #1. Lets take just one example. Harry's wand cost seven galleons. Rowling claims a galleon is worth about £5. That means that the wand cost £35, or something like $45. Assuming 40 new Hogwarts students a year, plus generously a couple hundred replacement wands for older folks, Ollivander is selling maybe one wand a day. Is Olivander really getting by on maybe $10,000 or $20,000 a year of revenue on the outside, with one of the most skilled jobs in existence in the Wizarding World? His expenses have to be pretty high, too, as we assume that dragon heartstring and the like isn't easy to come by, not to mention the cost of keeping his shop open etc. so he's clearing less than minimum wage by far.)

******** And yet it's the one specifically mentioned and also foreshadowed. After the graveyard scene in GoF when Harry is telling Dumbledore what happened, there is a line mentioning a 'flash of victory' in Dumbledore's eyes. Total victory for Dumbledore wouldn't have been anything less than Voldemort vanquished, and Harry still alive. Combine all of that with Dumbledore's intention to have the Elder wand not be won through conquest, but for it's master to die by his own choosing, and you get far more evidence that it was purely the sacrificial blood protection that kept Harry alive and not some last minute dues ex machina wand lore.

Overall the central theme of the books has always been about choices and the consequences of those choices. Voldemort lost because time and time again he made choices that revolved around selfishness and causing fear. He never understood the power of caring for others or self sacrifice the same way that Harry and Dumbledore did. The Elder wand's ownership falling to Harry through chance, instead of Voldemort, being the main reason everything works out in the end is contrary to the main message of the story.
