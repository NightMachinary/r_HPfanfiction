****** You really should check out C'est La Vie if you haven't before though. Harry wins the war but is super depressed so 'fate' sends him back to the beginning of 4th year to have a better life as Hadrian Evens. Neville is the BWL, Lily and James live, Harry Potter is an asshole.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/The-Dark-Lord-s-Equal][The Dark Lord's Equal]] is a good one. Fair warning, the author borrows a lot of ideas from other authors but manages to tie them all together beautifully. Personally I don't care because it works so well but some people might.

**** Well it stays first person for the remainder of the story and sticks with just Harry for the most part instead of jumping between characters but the scene jumps mostly remain. I would say it gets better past the first chapter but if they bother you it probably won't stop bothering you.

I personally think the story is best from the third chapter onward when it's just a straight awesome ride to the end. Honestly thought it's just not that long of a story so to get to the third chapter you have to read a good chunk of it... Personally the POV and scene jumps didn't bother me too much so I'm sorry I can't give you a better analysis of if you'll like it.

**** It is one of my favourite AUs, which is surprising because I normally hate gender-bent characters. They usually are just there to be either just super-awesome or because somebody wants "slash without the slash", so to speak. - I would never have even looked at it if it had not been recommended on TV Tropes, so I can definitely understand your doubts.
