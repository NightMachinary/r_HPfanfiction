** Crackish fic. Tom Riddle centric. When Dumbledore meets him and sets his closet on fire, Tom's just like: fuck, this guy's cool! Like, Tom is still this psycho kid, but his greatest dream is to become a like Dumbledore. He idolizes the man. He finds all about him and tries to emulate him. Only, he goes about it all wrong.

I can imagine him talking to the sorting hat: listen, you fucking little shit piece of old cloth, you put me in Gryffindor or I'll use your sorry self to make professor Flitwick some new underwear. And the hat's all like: yep, no, not happening. Off to Slytherin with your little threatening ass.

But yeah, too busy with my current fics to even consider expanding this.

**** And Dumbledore really, really not having a clue how to deal with it.

"Can someone give me a non-ovbious example of an exception to Gamp's law of elemental trasnfiguration?"

Tom raises his hand high, eager to answer, Hermione Granger style. Dumbledore sighs.

"Yes, Mr Riddle?"

"A dead body, sir." At Dumbledore's confusion, he adds, "It is /technically/ food."

Class is dead silent. Dumbledore wonders where he went wrong in life. Is this karma? Is it because he almost joined Gellert in his dream of world domination?

Worst part, he has to award five points to Slytherin, because the kid's /technically/ correct.

***** Dumbledore smiled softly to himself as he watched the second-year Ravenclaw and Slytherin students file into his Transfiguration classroom. Teaching such eager, young minds was always a joy.

"Would you like a lemon drop?"

He turned toward the door to see who had decided to be kind enough to share sweets with their fellow students.

But then he did a double take, his eyes almost popping out of his head.

There was young Tom Riddle in the doorway - dressed in rather splendid (in Dumbledore's mind) purple robes decorated with orange stars and yellow crescent moons.

"Lemon drop?" Tom asked again, extending a bag of sweets to young Myrtle Warren.

The girl grimaced and looked at Tom with suspicion.

"What did you do to them this time?"

"Nothing! Slytherin's honor!"

"Hmpf!" Myrtle exclaimed before striding off to her seat.

Tom turned and his eye's met Dumbledore's, and huge grin broke out on the boy's face.

"Professor Dumbledore! Care for a lemon drop?"

"I... err..." Ablus stammered.

"I sent away for them by special owl order!"

"Mr. Riddle," Dumbledore began once his brain started working again, "what have you done to your uniform?"

"Well," the young Slytherin started, "after you taught us those excellent color-changing spells last week, I figured that I would make my robes into something more stylish."

"I see."

"That reminds me..."

"Yes?"

"How do I learn to make my eyes twinkle on demand? I think that might be a good way for me to sow confusion amongst my enemies..."

Dumbledore sighed internally.

"Please take your seat, Mr. Riddle."

I think these ideas need their own writing prompt thread.

*** Canonically, Ron was the one to explain to Hermione what "mudblood" meant. And before book 7 there really wasn't anything that showed Hermione being especially aware of blood purism compared to the two boys. It's actually a bit implausible that in book 6 the Muggleborn members of the DA just go back to school, quidditch and dating instead of planning some sort of underground railroad or resistance. Also, Draco and many other pureblood bigots have insulted Harry's mother for her Muggleborn status throughout the story. Hermione not coming to Hogwarts would have huge changes for the story, but I'm not sure Harry and Ron being unaware of blood purism would be one of them.

For example, I know that racism against black people exists and that it's bad, but I didn't realize that they're discriminated to the extent that they have difficulty looking for room and board in my city until somebody I knew told me so. Before that, I thought racism in my city was "simply" hurling slurs and insulting people's heritage (what Malfoys et al. were doing).

He would have won multiple times if not for his battles on the Fourth Front: A semi-mythical team of fighters operating behind enemy lines with insights into most of the enemies operations and sabotaging anything the other fronts would be overwhelmed by. Turns out this is just a battle-hardened Harry fighting alone and doing all he can to save the world.

The fic starts with a muggleborn on a prison camp, trying to beat the others freaks and enter the witchhunter's division.

Meanwhile, the resistance tries to resurrect Voldemort since they are scared as hell and think the powerful evil wizard could save them. They are right ! Unfortunately, Voldemort doesn't want to win the war. He's having too much fun fighting. He taunts the witch-hunter division to high hell, but he always allows some of them to escape.

The muggleborn gets more powerful with time, and Voldemort has to get serious. Collateral damage skyrockets and the resistance surrenders. Betrayed, Voldemort swears revenge on them all.

Dudley Dursley celebrates his victory and then dies from cocaine overdose.

Voldemort goes traveling around the world, liberating muggleborns from the camps and then creates a new hidden kingdom. They eventually make contact with other hidden magical villages.

The muggles think they successfully won the war against magic, and they start to kill the witch-hunters.

The muggleborn flees to a hidden magical town and finally understands that he was working for the wrong side all along.

** A muggleborn is a huge fan of alien invasion movies and tries to create his own race of necromantically created aliens, gives them enchanted spaceships and blaster guns, and starts a staged alien invasion. Wizards don't realize what is going on and believe that the attackers are really wizard aliens from another planet, and since they use magic the poor muggles have no chance, so wizards reveal themselves to help the muggles fight off the invaders. Wizard/muggle relations are good because of a common enemy and after destroying all the 'aliens' they start a space program using merged technology and magic to find the planet the invaders came from to exterminate the threat. Decades later humans have colonized half the galaxy with futuristic magic tech and the wizards have become a cult-like organization that keeps the peace. The creator of the aliens never revealed what he did so that the governments of the world stay united and continue exploring. A few centuries later a dark lord emerges who manages to take over the galactic senate using a faked civil war, destroys the jedi order and starts construction of the Death Star.

** It's not so much a plot idea as a premise and a series of scenes (which is why I would never write it).

three words: Umbridge. Malicious Compliance.

I like the idea that the incompetence of Minister Fudge, or, rather, Umbridge and her manipulations / blackmail resulted in educational decrees that were, shall we say, not proofread properly.

For example, the decree banning student organizations? The way it's actually written bans regular gatherings of 3 or more students because that's how it defines a student organization.

This means that a) meal times, curfew, and classes are all banned student organizations and b) the DA is /not/ a banned student organization because it doesn't have a regular schedule and thus isn't technically an organization under the decree.

#+begin_quote
  An Organization, Society, Team, Group, or Club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more students.

Similarly, the ban on broomstick flight outside of approved quiddich practice also bans the first year broom riding class.

There's all /kinds/ of chaos that could ensue with poorly written decrees like that.

** This is an idea I've had for some time

- Something (a misguided time traveler who wanted to give Severus a happier life, or just a butterfly that flapped slightly differently) prevents the completion of Snape's Worst Memory. The fallout never happens
- Being right before summer, and thus the last significant Marauder confrontation for the year, this finally gives Severus and Lily the opportunity they need to resolve their misunderstandings and restoring their near-destroyed friendship without peer pressure from Gryffindors or Slytherins
- The main point of the story: Severus, never losing Lily's friendship, never becomes a Death Eater (Whether this develops into something more, or if Jily happens anyway, matters little overall)
- Eventually, the prophecy happens. Barty Crouch Jr. takes Snape's place as Voldemort's attempt to infiltrate Hogwarts and overhears the prophecy, and delivers it to Voldemort. Due to things having happened slightly differently, this unfortunately ends up being just another failed prophecy...
- While Barty Crouch Jr isn't suspected as a Death Eater, the Longbottoms and Lily's family go into protection eventually anyway, to keep their boys safe, being potential Prophecy children
- October 31, 1981: Voldemort, somehow, tracks down Lily's family and kills the entire family, /never creating a Boy Who Lived/, since he never had a reason to keep Lily alive (Barty Crouch Jr doesn't care, and none of the other Death Eaters would have been given Lily as "reward")
- Shortly after, the Longbottoms are also killed -- just to cover all bases. In the end, the Prophecy, having detailed events that ultimately never transpired due to different circumstances, ends up being just another failed prophecy.
- Ultimately, with Voldemort never losing his power, and his Ministry control being too big, and with Order morale being low after the deaths of the Longbottoms and Lily's family, Voldemort "wins" in the end
- (I think Voldemort eventually loses due to ICW interference in the end once he inevitably tries to expand past Britain, but Wizarding Britain is basically in ruins in the aftermath -- this would happen after the story's conclusion anyway)

** Title: 'Hermione lost her compass'

Summary: Hermione wanders the globe, delving into alternate perspectives on magical culture and generally getting into trouble by being herself.

She's been shunned from the UK because she was arguing that the best way to increase the magical population to recover from the war with Voldemort would be for the Ministry to encourage everyone to marry muggles.

This was received by many to be somewhere between 'prey on the handicapped' and 'force everyone to have sex with dogs'. It might not have been a disaster but that she insisted that her logic was sound and she defended it at any opportunity. She lost her job in the Ministry. She was censured. She was black-listed at all sorts of magical shops. In the end even Harry didn't stand by her, as his experiences growing up made the proposal distasteful at a minimum. Having been cornered into saying such while in the company of reporters, his public condemnation gave Hermione's enemies enough courage to toss her out of the country entirely.

Her reception in France wasn't much better. Anyone recognizing her treated her like an escaped criminal. At several points she was mugged and abandoned someplace unrecognizable, having to find her way back to civilization. Even avoiding the magical hideaways wasn't suffiicient, as any sighting of her by a wizard or witch would result in some form of harassment.

Within a few weeks, she'd lost everything. Wand broken. Identity stripped away. Even her parents were unable to help her, as some intrepid ex-Death Eater or such had Obliviated them of her survival from the war (and confunded them about her appearance, to boot).

Luna finds her at some point, early on. Hermione falls into old patterns, which pisses off the otherwise noncommittal witch. "I was thinking I would help you get a wand, but now it seems a better thing for everyone if you were without one. Perhaps you'll stop talking long enough to hear something that'll help you."

She's wallowing in her situation when she hits bottom. She gets advice from a stranger, Lila, a squib (half-vampire, actually) who recognized her but chose to approach her instead of turning her in for the bounty. Hermione gives up her identity, and begins to build a new one: Maia Tan. Lila thinks it'd be cool if she calls herself Cretaceous Zappa. Or Maia Sharona. 'Maia Jean Tan will do, I think.'

Lila's fake ID's for her say Maia Sharon Tan.

She is often harassed by a black-wing pigeon. It never says or does anything to her (except an occasional bout of psittacosis); just shows up to look at her, occasionally pooping on her clothes. She calls him Perkins, after Mr. Weasley's partner in the office of controlling muggle-enchanted items or whatever. [Not sure why I want to do this, but I do]. She talks to him when he shows up, hoping that he's an animagus or someone's familiar. At most, he's hot for her because she's a pigeon animagus, not that she knows that.

Lila makes an appearance, trading Maia's blood for help, information and a few trinkets that might be meaningful to her, like a knife to defend herself. Lila forces the sex issue into uncomfortable territory, but it awakens in Hermione a new perspective. She could use all the help she can get. Lila also tries to teach her to be savvy, but Maia rejects most of the ideas as being rude or even cruel. As if assuming everyone is lying and using passive legilimency to give her insights wasn't justified for the persecution chasing her around the world.

Speaking of losing the compass, I can't remember what the endgame was supposed to look like.

** I've been chewing on writing something like this for years.

2010s, the Statute of Secrecy has fallen, mostly because a whole bunch of muggles who had stumbled across hints of the wizarding world, as well as the parents of muggleborns, found new ways to share and disseminate information over the Internet, faster then the Obliviators could keep up.

The muggle government tries to enforce muggle law and order, when it is discovered that the wizarding world had been going a bit rogue. Hogwarts, for example, is an unlicensed school. None of the prisoners of Azkaban got proper trials, according to modern laws. St. Mungos treats it's patients with potions made from poisonous flowers and heavy metals. Some property owners haven't been paying property taxes. How's a troll rancher supposed to fill out his tax forms without breaching the Statute? A lot of purebloods didn't have birth certificates, having separated themselves from the surrounding muggle culture before birth certificates really became a thing.

Fleur is completely ignorant of modern immigration laws, and gets deported back to France. Bill and the kids are having trouble leaving the UK to reunite with her, due to a lack of documentation.

Andromeda set up a boarding school as a place of refuge for marginalized children of the wizarding world, in memory of Remus Lupins' hard life. A lot of her students are werewolves and squibs. A number of teachers were werewolves. She couldn't tell the local authority that she wanted to found a school for werewolves without breaching the Statute, so she simply concealed the schools' existence. Post-Statute, the muggle authorities discover the school, inform her that she is breaking the law, and shut it down. She faces legal repercussions, the werewolf teachers lose their jobs, and overwhelmed families have to struggle for alternative arrangements.

Millicent reacted to the unfavorable end of the second wizarding war by breeding more pureblooded babies. One child was a squib. Her husband wanted to abandon the child. Millicent argued him down, and sent the child to Andromedas' school. When the school closed, her life fell apart. Bigoted friends and family shunned her, her husband took his anger out on the squib child, her other kids were traumatized, and she couldn't resolve the situation by taking the kid to a muggle boarding school, because she hadn't known that she was supposed to register her kids' births. Social Services got involved, missed the cultural context of the familys' home life, and dropped the ball by not removing the squib child.

Greyback is released from Azkaban, and immediately sets out to reconstruct the cannibalistic werewolf cult he had been running up until the end of the second wizarding war. He is fascinated by Teddy Lupin, and targets him for infection and assimilation. He'll also want Bills' kids, fascinated by Bills' reaction to getting mauled while Greyback was in his human form. Some newly jobless werewolf educators join Greyback. Wizarding children start disappearing.

I had absolutely no idea how to resolve all this, or what the end goal should be.

** I have a two, I'm reluctant to post these since I may actually write them in the tuture (I will probably at least do one of them) let me know what you think of the ideas.

Dark Lady Narcissa Malfoy (I may actually write this one day)

Voldemort never creates horcruxes and dies for real the night he tries to kill Harry. Bellatrix and Lucius go to Azkaban as does Sirius. With everything but her pureblood beliefs taken away from her Narcissa seeks revenge against the leader of the light, but somewhere along the way realizes she wouldn't mind ruling the opposing side and tries to do what Voldemort never could.

Tom Riddle Defeats Grindelwald

Long story short, a prophecy is made detailing the defeated of Grindelwald. Grindelwald never finds out about it and only fears Dumbledore. The child of the prophecy is Tom Riddle, who finds out about it upon graduating Hogwarts and goes off for many years to train and build his army of death eaters. When he returns though his mission is different. Defeat Gellert Grindelwald.

I may actually write both of these in the future. The Riddle one is actually the first fanfic idea I've ever had, so I'll probably write it eventually, to fulfil my childish fantasies if for no other reason. I honestly just haven't gotten around to this one yet and it will probably be written but there you go. There is a twist that I have left out of the description but I want to keep some cards close for if and when I actually write it.

As for the Narcissa one, I think it could be an amazing story, but it would be VERY DIFFICULT to make. I am actually planning to write this one, and I think I may create a challenge forum and list this as the first challenge.

I know it was supposed to be ideas you'll never write, but I figured these would be more interesting and I never really like to say never when it comes fo fanfiction.

** Title: Pygmilion Dark!Harry or Grey!harry Potter whose power he knows not is pottery magic. People assumes that making pots is all it useful... A useless family magic. The truth is just they will be hunted if they knew what it truly entail.

Pottery is shaping earthenware, clay and other mediums for sale. They were sculptors of not only enchanted items such as bowl, couldorons, pots, vases, but rather it was forgotten they made thier money with living statue, stone sentry Golems, Gargoyles, terracotta armies. From waxen wings to lifelike sculpture. As wards fell ito favour, earthen sentinels were out dated. No one wanted living stone... Until a young necromancer saw the beauty and quality of the product. The potters had married the necromancer family, Peverell.

It was a simple school project, just get some clay sculpt it and put it into the oven. A young Harry, alone and wishes to have a family that will love him regardless had created a porcelain doll with so much meticulousness so much yearning for a family. A wish so strong that his magic seeped into the very clay that he molds. Every detail is sculpted ignoring he pinpricks of blood that fell onto the clay form. Once baked in a kiln, the most exquisite doll shape was formed with extreme attention he painted on a work of art. Like the frenzied magic that turned Galatea to life, a Soul Doll was created. A doll that connects to the souls of past ancestors. And this haunted doll is not happy that thier last decendant knows nothing. A soul vessel that safely conduits to the dead.

Basically I imagine Harry toting around two dolls, Iggy,and Iacomus/Lillium. They are advisor to Harry and has all the powers of a haunted doll. Everyone assumes the poor traumatized boy has imaginary friends as coping mechanism. Until they started get haunted and noticed that it teleports.. of sorts.
