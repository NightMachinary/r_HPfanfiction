Shameless self-promotion here. Please read this and tell me what you think. When I'm finished, it will probably be novel length [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10385204/1/Where-Eagles-Dare]]


** Its a decent start. However there are major plot holes in your story. Why is Harry that mature? Kids dont grow up that fast. Whats the point of bashing Nevil or Alan? If you are trying to make Harry look good than make his enemies strong so its even better when he overcomes them. What made Harry and Alan hate each other? Brothers are brothers, they fight some times but they will cover each other and wish the best for each other. Whats the point of introducing OC like Alan and Stephanie?

*** Good point about Harry being mature, it does seem a bit over the top, i will try and tone it down a bit. Neville and Alan aren't Harry's enemies(No prizes for guessing who will be his enemy). I can't reveal anything without spoilers about them, or about the point of Alan and Stephanie, but i do have a plan for them. Harry and Alan don't really hate each other. They're just very different people and spent their childhood doing different things. Thanks for the comment, you gave me a lot to think about

** Just a quick question, what do you mean by novel length? Most novels are ~80k-120k words, but the phrase as it is commonly used in Fanfiction seems to mean ~200k words, for some reason.

*** Probably 150 - 200k words. It's probably too early to say accurately though
