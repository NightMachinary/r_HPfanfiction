Hi! I'm interested in any fic where Wormtail's character is explored. Can be Marauders or Harry era, no bashing.


** I would be interested in reading this as well. What caused his betrayal?

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][HP & Prince of Slytherin]]/ (this one felt like it borrowed some plot elements and devices from the former)

There was also this memorable scene with PP\LE in a title I don't remember:

- Lily first suspects, and then confirms for herself that Peter is a DE, but let's him betray them anyway, because she thinks it'd be their best way to work along with the prophecy and try controlling its outcome. She and Peter have a sad little chat right before his betrayal.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** It's not necessarily the same Peter, but there is a Peter being explored in “Coexistence” (linkffn(1097925)).

Outside of that there are “End of the Line” (linkffn(3673824)) and “Happy Birthday, Mr. Dark Lord” ([[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/after_the_rain/HBMDL01a.html]]), though the former only has one of the chapters about Peter and the latter one is a fairly short one-shot.
