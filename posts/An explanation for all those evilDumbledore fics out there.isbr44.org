The real Dumbledore was defeated in 1945. He has been kept in prison ever since. Grindelwald took Dumbledore's place. The reason the fake Grindelwald AKA Dumbledore was imprisoned for life instead of killed is that Polyjuice only works if the hair used is from a person that is alive.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** Dumbledore is rightfully associated with Death in the Voldemort, Snape, Harry reincarnations of Peverells fan theories. He is neither good nor evil. He does his best to teach his students as much as he can but he will ultimately not care about themselves more than they should. He is not a parent so he has no moral obligation towards anyone, but he gives everyone the tools to succeed to the best ofhis ability.
