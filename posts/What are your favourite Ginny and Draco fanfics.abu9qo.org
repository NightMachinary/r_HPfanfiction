I've read so many over the years but I'm interested to see if anyone else likes this ship and if they have any particular favourite stories


** linkffn(the albatross did follow) is pretty much the only Draco/Ginny fic I like and would recommend

  Treasure. Secrets and espionage. A mysterious oil painting. Draco Malfoy has gone missing, and Ginny Weasley has been hired to find him. It's the perfect storm for adventure---one with a dangerous outcome that no one, not even Ginny, could have predicted.

** Myanceris's Exquisite Irony on dracoandginny.com is a personal favorite of mine - arranged marriage in a Voldemort-Wins AU. Alas, it is incomplete and will likely remain that way. I also love What Ginny Forgot as a post Hogwarts evaluation of what marriage would be like for this couple, with some angst involved

** I absolutely always come back to "there is another sky" by terra. It's on multiple archives. Believable in how their relationship grows, how Ginny and Harry fall out of love, and she gets Luna just right, which no one ever seems to do.

  Ianto has some secrets, and some talents, and he is more than meets the eye. He was a Junior Researcher at Torchwood One, but that's not the whole story. This is.NOTE: THE 11TH CHAPTER IS THE OUTLINE FOR THE REST OF THE STORY WHICH WON'T EVER BE WRITTEN
