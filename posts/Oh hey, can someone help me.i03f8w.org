:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific time travel fanfiction and it's drarry, so I don't remember it very well but I'll try ...

Draco Malfoy already an adult with family (I remember him quoting Scorpion) decided to travel back in time and help your father in the department of mysteries incident, so he doesn't get arrested and such, only after passing his conscience on to his younger self he comes across Harry, Luna (and I think Ron and Hermione?)...

So he went with them still in the vibe of helping his father, but in the middle of all the mess of taking the profession and the Death Eaters appearing, draco in an impulsive act ends up helping Harry in front of the Death Eaters ... in the end i just remember that after a season he started to forget his memories of the future to the point that one day he woke up and thought "why did i go to the ministry that day?"

I loved this fic so much that I can't find it again

Sorry my bad english, i don't speak that very well
