Think debt of time (sirmiome), ultima ratio(tomione), pet project (snamione). Would appreciate smut, captivating story line, any time period, (preferably marauders in hogwarts), and hermione paired with anyone, as long as she IS paired. Not a big fan of love triangles.

** “The Winds of Time by ausland” linkffn(6531542) is rather decent Harmony story (both Hermione and Harry get to the Marauders' time, except one comes half-a-year later).
