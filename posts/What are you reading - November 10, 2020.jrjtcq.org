** This week I've started "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15737409/chapters/36591009#workskin][That Awful Snape Boy]]", rated T. It's an AU where Snape ends up under McGonagall's guardianship in his third year. I'm only a couple of chapters in, but it looks promising as it explores Severus's early history at Hogwarts and the opinions of staff on him and others, such as the Marauders. I'm very curious to get to the actual incident that leads to him being put under McGonagall's guardianship and how that relationship between them changes and developes.

Another story I read was a one-shot "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8592676][pretend you don't have one]]", T, that's kind of a character study of Snape's in a slightly AU universe. It's not exactly told linearly, but it's easy enough to follow and looks at his life and relationships at Hogwarts and how they shaped him and lead him to make the choices he did and live the life he does.

** I'm currently reading "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012016/][Partners]]" by muggledad, a Haphne fic written 10 years ago. It's a well-written fic that I am finding incredibly enjoyable.

Harry and Daphne get together in a unique way during the summer between 5th and 6th years when they were both going through significant issues. Romance, friendship, politics, and Voldemort ensues.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9614855/chapters/21721490]]

Currently reading "Relief from Nightmares"by ArielSakura and it is a really good fic so far. I remember reading it multiple years ago, but can't remember when I finished it. It is rated M and has the interesting pairing of Blaise/Harry. I have not read many fics that go into detail about Blaise, so this is refreshing

I am also in the process of reading The Little Bat by elvirakitties and it is good. It is rated for general audiences and I have found to really like the character development of Snape, Harry, and suprisingly good depictions of Draco and Neville. Be warned there is heavy Ron Weasley, Dumbledore, and Molly Weasely Bashing in here. There is also some bashing of Hermione, but not as much. I am not the biggest fan of bashing, but I just read over it and ignore it for the plot.

** I've just finished a good Sherlock crossover called 'Whispers in Corners'. It's masterfully plotted. I loved the way the author slowly feeds you smidgens of backstory, with the whole not revealed till the very end. The Sherlock characters were well handled and believable. It's the first believable Harry as Master of Death story I've read. There were some downsides IMHO - Harry felt very OOC and while explanations were (eventually) provided for it I'm still unconvinced. I also struggled to believe that Mycroft and Harry would be attracted to each other. Despite these misgivings, I recommend this story to anyone who enjoys a good crossover or Master of Death story.

** I am reading Fremione and the Weasleys which is rated M on the FanFiction website/app. It is probably the best fanfiction that I have read because of how in depth it is. It is set after the war and there is a new marriage law set. Muggle norms have to marry, so hermione gets to choose between the Weasley boys. Fred and Hermione confess their love for eachother and it is very sweet. It is so well written and has 117 chapters. It is a bit smutty but you can skip those chapters because nothing important really happens. I really recommend this!

** I am currently up to chapter 16 of Makes the Wind: A lamb before the slaughter

linkao3(a lamb before the slaughter by cricket_girl, merrymandolin)

It's an AU sixth year and I really like it and the various OCs this fic has.

Harry, although he is starting to grate my nerves with his hero complex, is a little more realistic in terms of his PTSD and how he reacts to the adults around him. And I fear things will get a whole lot worse for him as he is desparate to prove himself worthy to join the Order.

I love Snape in this, and this is partly why this fic drew me in. He is still a snarky bastard but I love the interactions between he and Harry and also the OC, Cleo.

Cleo is a wonderful fleshed out, flawed female Muggleborn Slytherin who has come back to Hogwarts to finish her schooling after pulling out for a couple of years. Her family life is complex and while I tend to skip these parts as it really isn't my cup of tea, I still appreciate that this is who she is.

I also just updated my reading with linkao3(clementine by shy_one) and omg that last chaoter was an absolute cracker with Harry having dinner with the Dursleys.

This fic is a gem. Harry is smooth and witty and up for no bullshit as he nagivates a tumultuous wizengamot case and deals with his cousin Dudley's magical daughter, Clementine.

  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

** I had to catch up with the new chapter of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/][Grow Young With Me]], naturally :). Linking directly instead of using the bot, because the summary is quite misleading. It's about a widowed Harry (with his three canonical children) meeting a quirky Muggle woman who helps to draw him out of his shell and begin to heal from Ginny's death. Lots of tugging at the heartstrings, especially the flashback to Ginny's accident.

Instead of the summary, I recommend reading chapter 1 and deciding whether you like Abby; that should tell you whether you'll like the story.

The first time I tried reading it, I liked book 1 but gave up partway through book 2, because it was leaning into Hermione being overpowered and constantly pulling out new spells as the situation demands. But the second time, I finished it and decided that it's still worth reading for the world building and exploration of magic.

The author doesn't pull punches with killing off named characters, either, especially in the final battle.

**** Hmm. I wouldn't say that preachiness is her defining feature here. Constantly developing new spells and other new magic is more her thing. As a character, she's not particularly balanced, but if you treat her as a plot device for exploring the magic system, then I find it's still an interesting story. Like the effect of Ravenclaw's Diadem, which makes you fully aware of everything your senses are telling you and gives you total recall, thus requiring very strict mental discipline to use without your brain dissolving into a puddle. Or her dabbling in ritual magic, which balances the Horcrux creation ritual to free Harry from the soul fragment - with side effects, because ritual magic is not a toy.

** Just read the boy who died a lot by star-crossed girl. Dumbledore gives Snape a time turner and tells him to stop Harry from dying (which he does, over and over). Hilarious, I love the Snape character arc.. it's somewhat true to cannon to begin with but it does evolve into slightly unrealistic slash at the end. Authors summary: Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)

** The Debt of Time. It's rated M and it's a time travel fic but I haven't gotten to that part yet (there's a lot of foreshadowing). I'm only on chapter 13/154 so if long fics and time travel aren't your thing, then this probably isn't the story for you. But so far it's extremely well written and I was sucked in immediately. Basically, the main question of the story is: What would happen if Sirius hadn't died?

It's also been heavily beta'd so if grammar and spelling mistakes turn you off, you won't have that problem with this story. I know that can be a huge turn off for me if it's constant throughout the story.

I expect I'll be reading this all the way through so I may update in future weekly threads.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

** I'm reading linkffn(What If Snape Died by witowsmp) which had a great start and an interesting premise, but the over-infantilizing of the younger kids' dialogue in the story is really difficult for me to get through. Maybe it's just because I have experience with children, but it's hard to read five and six year olds talking like toddlers who can't make full sentences yet or use pronouns or tenses in an elementary fashion. It might not be a problem to someone who doesn't know kids very well, so take my complaint into account.

I'm a parent and a preschool teacher, so I am very familiar with the fact that kids as intelligent as the ones this author is trying to write would not speak like toddlers who are just mastering how to speak in full sentences.

Good story otherwise if you want something for killing time!

  What could've happened if James Potter had been unable to save Snape's life? This story follows what Harry's life could have been.
