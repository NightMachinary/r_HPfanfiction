** Most of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]]'s fics have very different Horcrux locations or implementations, and Canon Horcrux hunt would generally fail in those situations. The most scary one IMO is in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542).

Marauder Era fics usually have Hocruxes hidden in different locations, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]], linkffn(5511855;3735743).

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.
