As the title says I'm looking for a non-sociopathic or psychopath I'm not really sure the difference since I'm far from a psychiatrist. In a ton of gamer fics I read I swear Harry or the main character has no emotions basically a robot of badassary and grind. And to be perfectly honest most of them are very cringeworthy and edgy beyond belief. However I really do love the gamer system especially when done right it's quite fun to witness and an OP character makes more sense and it feels way more fair. Also if you do recommend anything good I'd really appreciate it. I'd prefer if their was a pairing since I feel like no good story doesn't have one since a life partner is so essential in a persons life and common place. I really hate harems in general again they're pretty cringeworthy but I'd prefer Harry to truly cherish the person. Also please have it not be Ginny or Hermione. Anyway I know that is quite of lot of requirements but I'd very much appreciate and cherish anything of worth. Thanks in advance and if you're reading this far have a great day!


** I think you'll be hard pressed to find them, because the very premise encourages is.

  With his life turned into a Game, Harry now has to raise a Phoenix, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets, deal with political manipulations and live through Hogwarts all while trying desperately to not swear too much.

** linkffn(Might and Magic by Astroman1000) No romantic pairing. He's more of a pet/sibling to Tonks than anything resembling a love interest.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game of Death) It is Harry/Hermione and doesn't seem like it's ever going to be a harem, despite the synopsis. But it is a pretty good story that's deviating nicely from canon.

  Little Harry Potter was not the biggest fan of his own life, but what could he possibly do about it? Escaping to play video games in the dark of night helps... but only a little. A Gamer Fic.
