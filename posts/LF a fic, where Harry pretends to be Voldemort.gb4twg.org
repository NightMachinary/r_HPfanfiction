:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I am looking for this fic I read a while ago, where Harry goes back in time (I think..), and then to confuse some Death Eaters lurking near Privet drive pretends to be Voldemort reborn in Harry Potter. Lucius Malfoy at some point adopts(?) him or something.

Thanks for helping :)
