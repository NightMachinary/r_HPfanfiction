/I'm looking for stories that have:/

- Strong female protagonist

- Smart characters who actually make good actions in the situations they find themselves in (characters who simply know a lot or are great computer hackers don't count if they do stupid things all the time)

- Overall feel similar to Applied Cultural Anthropology or the other fics I linked below:

Examples:

-Applied Cultural Anthropology, linkffn(9238861)

-Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation, linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew)

-Reign of the Serpent, linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19)

-The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House, linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House)

Non-HP examples:

-In Fire Forged, linkffn(10263221)

-Walk on the Moon, linkffn(Walk on the Moon)

A bit less qualifying, but I still liked them:

-Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah, linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah)

-Alexandra Quick series, linkffn(3964606)

/I've read most such stories I like in the HP and Naruto fandom, so I'm looking for suggestions in other fandoms; I'm asking here since I can best give examples of what I'm looking for with HP fics./


** [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm]]

One that is missing from your list.

As for the other fandom part, have you read Worm? Fits your description perfectly, and there's a lot of fanfiction too, it is the second largest fanfiction sub (this one is first).

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/]]

edit: I forgot to mention, the author of ACA has also written Worm fanfiction.

** linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky) might qualify and doesn't get recommended very often, so there's a good chance you haven't read it.

You might enjoy [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]], a /Twilight/ fic featuring a rational!Bella.

** All of these are adult women, sorry. :/

Sherlock(BBC) The only Mycroft/OFC I've ever liked: Cate is an English professor with a quick mind and a backbone of steel. It's a series, now featuring their awesome teenage children. The first story isn't quite as great as the rest of the series, so here's the second: linkao3(579030)

Thor(MCU):

Frigga arranges for Loki and Sif to be married during the events of Thor 1. Sif is amazing and their relationship takes work but is worth it. Linkao3(361346)

Loki is reincarnated as a female magician from Midgard. Lucy is a Chaotic Neutral who loves picking fights with her villainous allies, playing pranks on entire cities, annoying Phil Coulson, and trying to avoid her prophesied destiny to Save the World. Comedic villainy x1000. linkao3(534937)

Twilight: linkao3(928015) basically Leah Clearwater goes home with the brothers from Supernatural and triumphs. Twilight bashing, the Designated Bitch character ascends to new level of awesome and sets herself free from her emotionally-abusive werewolf pack.

  Post-Thor, canon-divergence. Loki doesn't survive his fall from the Bifrost and winds up reincarnated on Midgard as a mortal magician named Lucy with no memory of her previous life. Her decision-making skills have not been much improved by the transformation._____“Do I even want to know why you think I'm your missing brother?”“The similarities are startling,” Thor managed. She looked pointedly down at her chest, then back at him, her lips pursing. He knew the look in her eyes, the set of her mouth, the tension in her jaw. Oh, how he knew that sharp, angry, hard face. He could practically hear Loki hissing “You idiot” in his ear.“You deny it, then?” Hogun asked.“Seriously?” Lucy's left eye twitched slightly. “I have at no point in the last thirty years seen or experienced anything that would lead me to think I'm a dude, an alien, a god, or any combination thereof. So yeah, I'm going to have to go with denying it.”_____Irregular updates. Thanks for reading!

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged?

Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** There is a great Hermione POV fanfic that is currently unfinished by the name of Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky. Hermione is tired, struggling, and dangerous, and while there sre many...unlikely pairings (however brief) the story as a ehole is insanely dynamic and engaging, and I keep checking every month or so for updates. I would check the author's warning first, as ther is some gender and body dysmorphia.

Edit: just saw someone else already mentioned it! Maybe the double rec will double the chance to read it? ;)
