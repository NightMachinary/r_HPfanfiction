As he was Junior Minister in 1981, the HP Wiki rightfully reasons that he must have been born in 1964 at the latest. However, that's obviously way off the mark. Now, the question is, how old /is/ he really? From my [[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z96a3S2voAU/VintNPNKYcI/AAAAAAAADoU/tH5NWM4-9iQ/s1600/Cornelius%2BFudge.jpg][go-to illustration of his appearance]], I've always thought of him as in his seventies, and the movies certainly don't go against that either, but then there's [[https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-abcd5add0ebc5e20be7e7243f767d284-c][illustrations like this]] that make him out to be in his fifties. What do you all think?

(I'm not asking this just out of random curiosity, for the record; I've been featuring Fudge quite heavily in a story, and I'm going to need some hard numbers here.)


** I'd rather believe he's in his early fifties to early sixties; I don't really think he'd be going to such great lengths to act all authoritarian or be so afraid of Dumbledore usurping his power if he were older and didn't still have a sizable amount of his career left

*** Remember this is the wizarding world. Assuming he's in good health, Fudge can easily have fifty years left in him even if he's seventy-five. Don't forget 120 is about Dumbledore's age, and Fudge clearly believes Dumbledore would have a future in politics if he ever started.

***** Indeed; I think it's fair enough to say 115 is "about 120", and Dumbledore seemed quite healthy --- dare I say sprightly? --- right up til his death, save for the Curse. I could easily see him live to 200 if he hadn't picked up that stupid ring.

**** Rowling once said that the life expentancy of a wizard is around 150, so Dumbledore would indeed still have at least one or two decades more to go.

Makes me wonder whether wizards stay young for longer than muggles, or just spent more time as an old person.

I think it's that --- I see their longevity as a direct consequence of the fact that magic can cure any Muggle disease. Their aging as such is the same, but magic can cure heart failure or cancer or anemia or all those sorts of things.

** I always thought Fudge was like in his 40's. Because when he said he was the junior person in the department in prisoner of azkaban and he was first to the scene with Sirius, I always picture like a super young 20 year old Fudge.

**** Oh, he was junior MINISTER? Was that the same position Percy had? Because if it was, that might be why I imagined him being a really fresh-faced guy like Percy's age in the flashback. :)

***** Percy was actually a Junior /Assistant/. This is kind of what makes me think Fudge might not have been so young as a Junior /Minister/ --- the fact that "Minister" is higher than "Assistant" by far leads me to think Fudge had already a bit of a career behind him at that point. Certainly, he could still have been in his twenties, but I find it unlikely that Junior Minister was his first job with the Ministry.

***** Definitely fanon. If there was even a hint of such a detail, I'm sure the Wiki would have it, knowing them. Heck, I don't believe we even canonically know what House Fudge was in (though considering his powerlust, friendship with Lucius Malfoy, and green clothes, Slytherin is almost certain).
