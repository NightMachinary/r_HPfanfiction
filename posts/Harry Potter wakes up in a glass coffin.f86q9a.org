:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So the fiction I am searching for involves harry time traveling to a different dimension where he is the bad guy, got caught and executed by the wizengamot (I think) and then placed in a glass coffin. The fiction begins properly with him escaping from that coffin and from them house. Don't really remember anything else.


** Are you sure it was a dif dimension? I remember a fic where he was a bad guy in his home planet so he was drawn into a trap by Hermione and then a team of ward crafters and rune masters locked him in a crystal coffin and shot him into space. However there was an error with the runes to sapp his magic and he slowly regained consciousness when he was picked up by a science ship and they tried to scan the crystal which he sensed and then broke out of after pirates boarded the science ship and he killed like basically everyone.

*** No. It was either dimension or time travel, but he for sure woke up in a glass coffin because his counterpart was caught, sentenced and then executed for being a death eater. The good Harry wakes up in that coffin. When he exits the coffin, there is a crash heard and somebody comes to investigate

**** I remember exactly what you're talking about now. Wasn't he Voldemort's right hand man? His family kept his dementor kissed body in a glass coffin then Harry has to escape and is confused by everyone's hostility.

**** The Star Empire by RaXephon.

The author has a new site where he has original fiction listed, and re-uploaded it there as well, but I can't seem to find a link for it. Will update if I do.

***** The new site has not got any of the fics he promised on it. But I am in the process of talking to someone who helped me out a year ago into getting a .txt file of the fic.

**** I think it might have been The Star Empire by RahXephon, but it's been scrubbed from the internet so I can't double-check.

I read the first few chapters and it wasn't for me.

** It's not the Star Empire. Everybody is on Earth. Harry's soul was indeed in a Dementor's stomach.
