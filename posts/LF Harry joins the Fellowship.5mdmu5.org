Harry joins late (Helm's Deep), so you might not consider him as joining the Fellowship intact. But it's probably one of the best crossovers in the fandom; Steelbadger does some excellent work.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.
