Hey guys. I'm looking for a specific Harry/FemHarry fic. Basically, Harry finds some kind of mirror or something in Hogwarts, and winds up seeing a female version of himself. He falls in love with her, but it's clear she's just toying with him until she finally stops coming. He starts obsessing over her, learning dark magic, and eventually finds a way to cross over.

It turns out his female self sided with Voldemort, and Harry winds up going to her dimension when she's about to kill Dumbledore on the Astronomy Tower. Harry saves Dumbledore, and gives him a story about being James' bastard son.

I remember Harry threatening and placing Neville's grandmother under the Imperius or something in order to get access to the Potter vaults, because Augusta was FemHarry's caregiver.

  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE
