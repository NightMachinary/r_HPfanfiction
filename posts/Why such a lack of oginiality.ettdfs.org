Why, in such a rich world that has a complete history, a complete knowledge and full of different places and schools of wizards, do fanfictions always focus on the same characters and the same story?

I distinguish 3 types of works :

1. Sequels and prequels:

You can do like the Stars wars 7, 8 and 9 movies and continue the story by doing shit. At least they tried to make new characters...

1. Reboots :

You can make the same movie over and over again like Spiderman. That's 90% of the fics.

1. Original stories :

You can make your own story, even a rather simplistic one like The Mandalorian.

​

The Harry Potter universe is so rich, there should be so many more original stories. Yet there is so few. Rich universe of fiction like LoTR, Star wars, Harry potter, Mass Effect and others should have much more original stories in their universe and not 1 millions fanfics following 80% of the canon.

I tried to search for Original Character or crossovers to find original stories in many fandom but it's always hard to find something good and creative. I know it's probably harder to write something entirely new, from nothing but I find the lack of interest in original stories strange.

When i play a game like Mass effect, i'm often thinking "It would be nice to play an asari born on Illium in a different time, a Krogan during the rebellion or a Quarian after the Morning war" and it's the same with HP, i was often thinking "What are the other schools like ? and also how many houses do they haves ?"

I never dreamed to be Harry Potter, John Shepard or Luke Skywalker, the chosen one, they're too nice, polish, fight for others and everything is too predictable. I'm often thinking of a Sims game in Mass Effect, Lotr or Star wars, "every day" people living then rising to become someone, not being someone before actually doing something.

If you know of any Harry Potter fanfictions, for example, that take place in a completely different school and have as little to do with the story of the canon, can you link them together, please?

*** Not OP, but original works lack the familiarity of the universe. I got into fanfiction because I wanted to read more in the HP universe. Same for GoT. Give me stories which explore "what ifs" in the universes I already love. And Mass Effect for that matter, but that fandom is basically limited to retelling canon with character-driven divergences rather than plot changes.

*** I do as well, i read a lot of Sci-fi and Fantasy novels but I also really like thoses universes, it make sense if you're a fan of Mass effect to check the new game that they'll launch even if it's a new galaxy with new characters.

They're already establish and if there were more original stories inside establish universes it would be great.

There is this community doing fanfics for free on thoses universe so i check them. I don't mean i don't enjoy reading canon fics but i think i would prefer original story and i was wondering why such a lack of original content for thoses universe ?

They keep going for the canon story 99% of the time and i don't understand why. Aren't they tired after reading 150 different Harry enter his first year again and again ? It's nice to read them but canon represent such a huge portion of the works, can't they do something enterily new, once in a while ?

Don't you enjoy orginial story yourself in fanfiction or did you never really look for them ? I guess i'm really a minority looking for thoses story.

** I feel like I am pretty qualified to answer that question because "That twist/decision was annoying, I'm going to write something to explore the alternative" is the motivation behind almost all of my fics. That applies to both stations of canon and elements I've read elsewhere.

The really tricky part is to decide what will change based on your divergence and what not. And often, it is not nearly as much as you'd think at first. Let's look at GoF for example. Let's say that Sirius adopts Harry. That will not change the attack on the World Cup or the TWT being held. It could prevent Harry's participation, but not necessarily. There are still avenues for Voldemort to return and come up with a similar plot. Namely, that Ministry witch in Albania.

Not to mention that you have to ask yourself what kind of story you want to tell. If you diverge too much, it will stop feeling like Harry Potter. I mean, let's say that he does not end up in the TWT. That means that nothing happens in that year other than maybe him getting a girlfriend. And year 5 would be devoid of conflict because he would not be going on about Voldemort's return, which means that Umbridge won't be there and there will be no DA either.

You could come up with an original plot, but that will always be measured against canon (and the potential you get from using the same general idea with your own spin on it). Let me tell you from experience that coming up with original antagonists is tricky as hell because you need to figure out how the rest of the world would react to them, what motivates their goons and so on.

tl;dr: It's bloody difficult to come up with something original because it is a lot more work than just making a few smaller changes (or you end up with sloppy writing).

Well, you can always do it as a hobby. Over the past three years, I've written some 300k words. That averages out to ~270 words a day, which is like 20 minutes of actual work and an hour of thinking.

**** That's where I'm at right now. I had this nearly 20k word document building this grand Harry Potter world. Then I realized with a few hours work at most I could cut the HP content and use it to publish my own work.

It would really be an amazing HP world and part of me really wants to publish it. Still the practicality of it wins out for me.

***** That's a repeating pattern, I think. Finding your something special in other people's work and what you add to it.

I have a few original ideas brewing in the back of my head, but I just don't think I'm in a place where I can do them justice because I neither have the talent yet, nor the time. So, I take a few notes here and there, expand upun few ideas and character themes. Story building is almost as fun as writing.

*** Yes, I think difficulty is the main reason. Creating a whole new plot, an antagonist and many new characters is much harder.

But I think there is the lack of famous original fiction that could inspire other people as well. I see a lot of similarities between the fictions, they certainly inspire each other.

I find more original fiction in the Mass Effect and Star Wars universes than in others, space universes make people inspire them more for new possibilities, maybe?

But even when looking for posts of people looking for fics, there's not much demand for that either and I find it quite strange that I'm a minority who wants original works in a universe that's already known.

Sometimes I spend an hour looking for fanfictions with the criteria I'm looking for but I don't always find what I want and I end up choosing another fanfiction that has nothing to do with it.

Demand is always a tricky bit. I wrote a HIMYM themed fic (Harry and Ginny as the happy couple, Ron as Ted, Hermione as Barney) which got 0 attention (deleted it after a week) and then I wrote a cracky "Hermione gets knocked up through +Asari+ Veela magic" and that did pretty well. Even with a large follower base, it is kinda hard to tell which original ideas will go over well and which will flop. It will only kickstart good ideas.

#+end_quote

I don't. Mass Effect fanfics are either crossovers or retell canon with more emphasis on the chosen pairing. There are very few which have an original plot, and I remember three. One where Shepard builds a coalition outside of Council space, one where the Quarians make first contact and defend the humans against the Turians (And the Meek shall inherit the galaxy; great feels in that one) and one where the Quarians uplift the Third Reich (so bad that you can't stop reading because you want to see where this trainwreck goes next).

** I'm really curious how many people would read something very original. I saw fics that,for example, are AU and have a canon character and an OC paring. And those already had fewer reviews than those with popular pairings. Something that is completely original would not get much support, I think. I can only speak for myself, of course, but HP characters are just as interesting as the world. I had 7 books to get to know them. It's difficult to care about an original character and I think authors know this. I've read many books where I simply didn't care what happened to the protagonist or found them so insufferable that I wished them dead. So then you turn to the characters you already love because you know you'll love the story.HP magic is fun, but it always felt just like a nice adition rather than the basis.

** I've just updated my own fanfiction. So is it alright if I do a bit of self promotion? If not just downvote and I'll remove the comment, anyway.

Pinkie Pie goes to Hogwarts is a crossover fic that will see Pinkie transported to Hogwarts during the the Harry Potter years. Although Harry Potter will be featured in the story he is more of a side character.

The main plot focuses on Pinkies family history and other stuff that I don't want to spoil. I think it's funny, though that's hard to define when you wrote it yourself.

Maybe some knowledge about the my little pony universe is handy but I'm not really certain of that.

Pinkie is going to be super Mary Sue at first but I try to do it for comedic purposes only.

I try to update the story monthly.

** I started writing this stuff only recently because I was taking a memoir writing class and dealing with a lot of stress in other aspects of my life, and I needed to escape from my own issues somehow. So even though I focus on other characters besides the main heroes, I just want to hang out in a fictional world where I feel comfortable for awhile. It's a hell of a lot cheaper than a lot of other vices/therapy bills lol

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** I mean, calling Rowling's threadbare quilt of a setting a 'rich world' with a complete history and knowledge is a bit much (eg. what does schooling in Latvia look like? We have no idea), but the basic gist is that most people don't go to fanfiction to read about Bobbius McSmithius the random Italian wizard working in a Law Enforcement office we've never heard of. They wanna read about the characters they love. They wanna read more of the story. They wanna keep going with the world, plot, and characters they have experienced and grown affection for. This fandom has a rather strong antipathy towards OCs too, so that makes it doubly difficult. The closest things you'll get are canon characters in different schools or countries stories. A good example is When A Veela Cries by E.C Scrubb. A tonne of OCs that were really well fleshed out and a new situation, it's just Harry was still the protagonist.

It's also familiarity to get a reader to buy-in. Basically, the purpose of a first chapter is to introduce your characters and get your reader to keep reading. The best ways to do that are to give them something familiar to chew on that they can relate to and thus question. (Side note - It's why I'm actually really impressed with Rowling as a writer. She might be an utterly fucking awful worldbuilder, but her tour-guide introduction to it was magnificent.) So, yeah. Familiarity gives you a starting point that gets readers interested, dangles the lure and gets them to bite, so to speak. An easy way to do that in fanfiction is to use stuff from canon. To give an example - "You're familiar with Harry? Well, this is like that, only it's this new thing too!" is how most fanfics work. It lets you get your feet in the world, work out some rules, and what things are new so you know what questions reading the rest of the story is going to answer. Doing that with new characters in a new section of somebody else's world is really, really difficult and most people in fandom that can do that tend to move onto actually publishing their works so they can make money.

** Because people are stupid and read just rehashed Stations of the Canon stories (and I am one of those stupid people ... urgh!). So, I am just reading linkffn(Harry Potter And The Bonds Of Time by Vance McGill), which looks reasonably nice, so far so good, but almost the first thing Ginny says to Harry is that they have to protect Voldemort to be reborn, otherwise he cannot be defeated. No, you don't, you dolt!

Canonically, Horcruxes (or whatever is the plural) were called “anchors tethering the soul to the Earth” meaning that without the soul would go wherever it is intended to go. Destroy the anchors, the soul is gone. Of course, the real reason is that the author wants to protect The Stations of Canon, but that is very lame reasoning (and the bad reason). And yes, I am sorry, that so few authors took the challenge and made their story completely different (happened only in some stories published before the last books were, but most of them are not that good; I like linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities), though).

And of course, this is exactly the reason why I like post-war and next-generation stories so much: they just have to invent their own story.
