I remember reading a rather funny oneshot or at least the first chapter of a Story where Mr.Granger is at home lamenting the fact that Hermione is dating Harry post war. I believe he was named Dan in this one, but Dan not knowing much about wizarding culture thought Harry to be a poor motorcycle riding ass all the while wishing she had gotten together with that other fella Ron Weasley.


** ...Eh, motorcycle riding ass?

Great, now you've got me imagining outlaw broom clubs. Clad in dragonskin leather jackets, rip-roaring across the skies on otherwise quiet Sundays, getting into dust-ups with other gangs, celebrating freedom, non-conformity, anti-authoritarianism and loyalty to the club alone in the wake of the Second Blood War...

** The only one I can think of where Mr. Granger disapproves of Harry is "An old and new world" but Harry and Hermione are not actually together in that one and I cant even find it anyways.
