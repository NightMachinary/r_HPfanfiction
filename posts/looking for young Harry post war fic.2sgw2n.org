Do you know any good fanfics where Harry doesn't behave as is expected of him (marrying, becoming an Auror) right after the war, but actually takes advantage of his new freedom and/or has somewhat of a rebellious attitude (that the Ministry/people who know him are opposed to)? 8th year fic or Harry after he left Hogwarts is both fine. If you know one with an older Harry that fits this criteria, I'd be interested too.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9364319/1/Escape][Escape]]: A little something that has been bouncing around in my head. Has the whole range of emotions and starts after Final Battle and changes the whole Epilogue. Definitely Harry/Hermione

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9004333/1/Starting-Over][Starting Over]]: Just a little plot bunny that wouldn't let go. There are a lot of twists and turns along with several surprises thrown in. Basically a story of two people who have lost too much and need something new and fun in their lives. Harry/Andi/?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizards Fall]]: A different spin on the Potter Verse featuring a manipulative Dumbledore and an evil worse than Voldemort. A look at what could drive three people to destroy the Wizarding World.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8585967/1/The-Dark-Side-of-the-Sun][The Dark Side of the Sun]]: "Great! So I'll pick you up within an hour for the date. Yeah?" without waiting for an answer, he disapparated. There goes my chance of catching the 'Dark Auror', she thought bitterly. She was pretty sure Harry Potter just escaped through her fingers. OOC, Grey Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8554615/1/The-Lost-Summer][The Lost Summer]]: Harry won the war! So, why is he sitting all alone at Grimmauld Place while everyone else is off celebrating, or planning his life? Well, maybe it's time our hero took a little vacation and enjoyed the lost summer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]]: Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover. (Read it, trust me. It's great.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7251575/1/She-ll-Tell-You-It-s-The-Only-Way-To-Be][She'll Tell You It's the Only Way to Be]]: One-Shot. After the war, Harry Potter just wants to find somewhere, anywhere, where he can exist. He finds it rebuilding the Rook, with the Lovegoods.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5998729/1/The-Valley-of-the-Kings-Massacre][The Valley of the Kings Massacre]]: An adult Harry finds his destiny as an independent curse breaker in Egypt.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5324173/1/Why-Won-t-They-Leave-Me-Alone][Why Won't They Leave Me Alone?]]: Harry defeats Voldemort but those in power don't want him to leave. Read about the lengths they go to achieve their goal. Takes place after Order of the Phoenix.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3808497/1/The-Road-Not-Taken][The Road Not Taken]]: Post DH. A tale of what might have happened after the final battle that might have explained lack of interaction between Harry and Hermione in the scene at the station in the epilogue of Book 7. And what might have happened instead.

*** The Lost Summer is IIRC the third fic with nudist!Hermione that I've read. I didn't know this was a trend.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3212519/1/Reach-the-Open-Space][Reach the Open Space]] is a one-shot that might interest you.

  After defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter was about to become the most adulated wizard in the History of Wizardkind. But he ruined it all. And he's damn proud of it. Mild violence

Rebellious is an understatement here.
