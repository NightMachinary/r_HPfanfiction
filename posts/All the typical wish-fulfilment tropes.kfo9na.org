Hello there.

So I'm planning out a fanfic, which is supposed to be a parody of your typical wish-fulfilment fic, with Harry willingly or not defying the tropes. Problem is, I lack a handy list of those tropes. Would you kindly help me out?

Edit: maybe an idea on how some tropes could be defied/averted? You don't need to list all of them, just the ones that you would like to see tampered with.
