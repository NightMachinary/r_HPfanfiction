Apparently the Ministry is a racist, unfair institution. Who'd have thought? When Hermione Granger finds out that in order to get the internship of her dreams, she'll need to pay the expensive tuition for them to, in their words “justify letting a muggleborn into the Ministry's esteemed program,” she needs to find a job that will pay quick. Unfortunately, there aren't many jobs open to muggleborns. Fortunately Hermione would do anything to get the best results. And anything might just mean murder.
