What's your process for plotting? Where do you store half-written or completed fics? How do you get in the "mood," so to speak?

*** I followed that Neil Gaiman quote when writing a fic recently. I wasn't inspired a single day of writing.

I pumped out 100k words.

** I try to plot everything out, at least roughly, then I just start chugging out chapters. But I have a pretty good psyche profile of every character in my head to make sure every action they take is character appropriate, saves lots of time figuring out where to take the story next.

Pretty much, I put the characters in a situation and start writing what THEY Decide to do. I don't write so much as record whats going on in my head.

Problem is, when the story just stops flowing, or the characters don't want to do anything. We all just give up and browse netflix or reddit instead.

** *My Origin Story*

I got started in creative writing by throwing myself in the deep end during NaNoWriMo 2011. I just wrote 1700 words a day, no (few) excuses, and mandatory catch up if I did slack. And I made it, over 50k words in a month. I didn't plot ahead for that, didn't write it sequentially, and didn't have more than a vague idea what I was doing when I started. I also didn't end up with a complete novel, just 80% of the barest bones of one, but it was a heady experience. I was hooked.

After that, I took what I wrote during the NaNoWriMo and put it in a folder so I wouldn't have to look at it anymore. I have hardly touched it since. It wasn't very well written. I may do a rewrite someday, as I still kind of like that idea.

--------------

*Storage*

Now, working on three active fanfics (I am stupid), I have set up a writing directory and a folder for each story, containing:

- one Open Document (.odt) file for a calendar slash timeline (both written and planned)

- one file for notes on the plot of the story and things I want to write

- one file for notes on what I've already written, in summary format per chapter

- one plain text file just containing notes on things I need to fix, listed per chapter with copy-pasted references to the surrounding text (this is VERY important) and maybe /very/ short notes on what to fix. Making the process of creating these notes as painless as possible is /critical/. I collect these notes while proof reading my chapter during my NON-writing time. It is very important to my process not to get bogged down while proofing, just to push on through and fix things later. I then usually just reread that section and see the problem immediately.

- and finally, one ODT file for each chapter of that story, labeled with the name of the story (in case the files go rogue somehow) and the chapter number. I add stuff to the end when I make a major revision or take a major action, something like "_v.3" or "_PUBLISHED". Yes this screws with my software versioning system. Shutup.

The top level writing directory is also a [[https://www.dropbox.com/][Dropbox]] folder. I am an insane programmer in real life, so I also have them version controlled with Subversion. I keep the SVN repository folder in another location, an Amazon Cloud Drive folder. As I previous stated: insane. But that means I can restore previous versions of files even if every HDD I own blows up at the same time and if one of two major international companies decides to delete all my files. Also at the same time. Not just belt and suspenders, but also some kind of genital piercing holding up my pants.

In this analogy, that is. I don't have those in real life. Except for the belt, and only sometimes.

--------------

*Plotting*

I'd like to say I plot everything in advance with detailed notes. But mostly, I have a vague outline (sometimes mostly in my head) for the main plot points in the fic and more detailed stuff for the next few chapters. I usually take notes of important "beat" points, cool things I want to do or thematic points I need to hit in the plot at just the right time. Sometimes, I write those scenes ahead of time and slot them in (after heavy editing) when I get there in the published story.

When I try to plan ahead on chapter layout and content and such, I almost always end up changing it when I actually get there and start writing. This means I mostly do a plot-as-I-go thing, which isn't healthy for "real" writing I've heard. Or maybe it is. But in any case, I've sworn not to start publishing any new fanfics until I've got a finished story (at least a first draft of all chapters).

Because working like this is rough and frantic. I miss too many self-imposed posting deadlines simply because I decided that I needed another scene /before/ what I've already written. And then I can't seem to figure out a specific ending scene, so I write stuff for the next chapter that happens after that. And now I see I didn't really finish something in the middle and need to add more to explain it. And then I realize the original chapter is too long, so now I've got three chapters worth of material with a hole in the middle of the first chapter. And now it is three months later with no updates and I have a beautiful mess of words I love and three huge unpublishable chapters.

Not fun.

So yes. Do detailed plotting ahead of time. Unlike me.

--------------

*Mood*

When I sit down to write, it is because I have the time to write and I'm not physically incapable of writing. This is usually once a day, which I can almost make a hard requirement. Every day is my goal, for at least half an hour, whether I think it is a great idea or not. I've never hit this lower time limit, once I've actually started writing.

Please note that this is writing time, not staring at my previous work time. I proof away from my writing time. I think one needs to make that separation, or everything turns into casual proofreading with your feet on the desk and nothing getting done but one paragraph receiving a dozen non-substantial edits.

The only "mood" thing really for me is whether to write new stuff or edit old stuff I've already basically finished and started editing and proofing (usually this is at least a mostly completed chapter). At the point I actually sit down to write, I've usually already done some casual proofing on things I've written previously and sometimes have lots of notes on that material. If I don't have anything I've already decided needs editing work badly, I /have to/ (this is not optional) write something new.

A new chapter on some story, an outline for a brand new story, something. Write every day.

--------------

*tl;dr* backup your shit in the cloud, maybe do a plot outline and keep it in a file somewhere, fucking write every day

*edit for more

**edit for ugly

** I tend to write notes down by hand first. I will do a summary, once I'm inspired, and create the characters from there. I've been into post-war stuff, so I usually try to figure out what everyone is doing, who they're doing, and so on and so forth. Which means that I create character outlines.

Then I might do point-form summaries of chapters. If I have a quote or an idea that suddenly spawns, I always write it down.

Once I've done that, I need a quiet space to write. I feel that creating a mood is important to an extent because it will affect your writing. So I tend to play music that creates the mood I want to write and then write. I always read over stuff, make sure I'm happy, edit a bit, and then it's done.

I always remind myself that it's okay to go a little off /away from the outline so long as the story flows and makes sense. I also always tell my readers to add constructive criticism if they want. That way I can see what they're seeing, and getting into the minds of the readers is very important. I don't get betas because when I want to post, I want to post. I don't want to wait on someone else to finish editing my work. There are those who might disagree, and I totally understand. I just don't like having a beta, especially since I always go back and edit.

So yeah...outlines are handwritten, betas not wanted, and I like to set a certain mood using music. I find that, so far, it has worked well. Fanfiction is meant to be fun, a creative way for people to share their work/ideas. Which means that I like to have fun when I write.

So the most important thing is that you enjoy the process. Because if you don't, it feels forced and won't be as beautiful as it could be.

** Generally I get ideas by reading other fics, books or watching a movie or a tv series but i don't write it down if by two or three days i don't remember it then it wasn't probably a very good idea.

Wen i have an idea i cant get out of my head for a few days i open Q10 and start typing a very rough outline of the first few chapter and the ending. then i start writing on the same file and delete thing i already expanded

I use sites like Google, Google Translate and Theasaurus.com to find words i need also i use the HP wiki as reference.

I use a google drive folder to keep all my files on the cloud as a backup

*** The whole "if I don't remember" thing is dangerous and provably wrong. Maybe your cat gets run over the day you have a blockbuster idea. Not logical. Please record all ideas and sort later, unless you /literally/ couldn't care less.

I'd suggest keeping a plain text "idea file" and just stick things in there the moment they occur to you. Just a single sentence note, nothing complicated. Make sure you can access and edit it from your writing computer and any mobile devices you might always have on you.

Kudos on the cloud storage. Remember that that isn't actually backup for "live" files, though. If you don't notice deleting half of your file, then save it over the cloud storage file location, you lose all that data unless your cloud solution or your local system has its own file versioning solution. I don't remember if Google's system does this or not, or how granular it is if they do have one.

** I've written four partial fics, so far. Two fell into writers-block limbo after canon events rendered them AU and I couldn't bear to continue. The third, thought not chronologically, was a Harry Potter/Redwall crossover that completely train-wrecked, so I scrapped it.

My problem: I didn't plot structure. I almost fell into the same trap with my forth, and current fic. A WIP post-DH titled "Harry Potter and the Concept of Freedom". I started almost 2 years ago (first chapter was published on FF.net in 10/2011) and I managed to get about 17 chapters published almost completely off of my brain-case in 1 year, working in bursts when inspiration and desire found me. However, I did also make heavy use of good-old pad an paper back when I first started. The other problem I still face is a lack of a beta. I tried submitting to MuggleNet Fanfiction sometime in 2012, and got rejected because I had gotten my dialogue punctuation wrong in several places. I was pretty irked, but it forced me to go back through all 15+ chapters in my Master copy, which is in a folder in my Dropbox, correcting every instance of the error, and rephrasing sections to make a bit better sense. I also pulled the last 7 chapters I had published and am in the process of republishing the first part of Act I of III.

Today, I finally sat down, opened a new Word document, and thoroughly dumped my 3-act plotline, original character bios, and extensive head-canon to support plot. Most of it won't make it's way into the published story. However, when I'm done, I think I may publish all of my notes and other stuff as a Lost Chapters Edition, along with explicit scenes that can't be published on FF.net. Canon pairings, with fluff and drama interspersed.

If anyone wants to beta, I'm taking applicants. PM me. If you want to look at the first 10 chapters, search my handle on FF.net. EDIT AGAIN: Also bear in mind that I'm still renovating those first 10 chapters. Pardon the dust-bunnies.
