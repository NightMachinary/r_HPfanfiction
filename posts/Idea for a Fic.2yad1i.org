I was thinking about what hasn't really been done in fanfiction (as far as i know) and while in that soul bond thread I thought has anyone done a fic where everyone is soul bonded. In all the stories I've seen its just Harry/ random character, but what if every wizard had a soulbond. It would change wizarding society immensely. Marriage contracts that the purebloods use would be gone. There would be lots of potential for OC's because of all the new relationships that would end up happening. I am not a good enough creative writer to create this world but it is something I would read if someone wrote it.


** I don't know. I think the only reason we haven't seen such fics is because it inevitably turns out to be unbearably bad that we never really took at it.

Because I can't see a good story coming out of that setting.

*** I think it could work if you didn't make it the main focus of the story, but a peripheral worldbuilding thing that's just there.

** Just FYI, unless I am forgetting something important,

#+begin_quote
  Marriage contracts that the purebloods use

is whole-cloth fanon. There are no arranged marriages or betrothals in canon, explicit or implied.

** "Marriage contracts" aren't canon at all. I think you read too much fanfiction and started mixing things up...

*** I think he meant betrothal contracts. Which i think they are canon? At least they are canon-ish , one is implied between draco/astoria isn't it?

**** Nope.

Astoria featured in exactly 1 scene: the epilogue.

Draco never mentioned or even hinted at being betrothed to anybody.
