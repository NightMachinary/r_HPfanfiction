#+begin_quote
  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

#+begin_quote
  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

*** Most of it take place during school but it does have some after school moments.

Just got done rereading it recently. It is HP/FD but well written and several excellent quidditch scenes.

Also and alternate ending if your not a fan of that pairing.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

1. How many people downvoted because I recommended a Starfox5 fic?
2. How many people downvoted because I was snarky about it?
