#+TITLE: Looking for a fic where the self insert character was born as Tom Riddle's female twin. I seem to recall her teaching Tom advanced Math. It was a work in progress the last time I saw it. My Google Search was unfruitful which is why I'm asking here.

** I don't think this is the one you are looking for, as I don't remember much about her teaching him math, but it does have a SI as Tom Riddle's female twin.

  Elizabeth Riddle knows too much about things that prove to be both out of time and mostly useless as her twin brother searches for the castle where eternity dwells and the revolution which must open its doors. AU SI insert.

*** Thanks. I read the first chapter and it is the one I'm looking for. I wondered where my memory about math came from and it's right there:

"Maybe it was because she was so bored in school. She knew everything they taught before they taught it, had taught Tom reading, writing, and mathematics long before they even attended."

"Tom was almost holding breath, wondering if he was going to say how Tom and Lizzie were so far ahead, how Lizzie had started telling him things about 'multiplication' and 'division' and 'fractions' when they were still talking about numbers and adding in class."
