The title says it all. I want a Harry Potter who is creepy. Spooky. Maybe even a Spook. I dont know, I just want a story that gives me goose bumps, that makes me jump, or spooks me out.

Please be either WIP or complete. Thanks!


** linkffn(When Harry met Wednesday) is fairly creepy and disturbing.

You don't need a background in the Addams Family lore to understand the story. I don't think I'd really heard of them outside of my mother's reminiscing before reading it.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

** linkffn(that which holds the image) was creepy! Has Harry facing creepiness but he isn't actually creepy. This spooked me.. its a doctor who crossover but you don't need to know doctor who to read this. I actually read the fic then became interested in the episode of the TV show.

linkffn(evil be thou my good) has a kinda spooky Harry. It's a hellraiser crossover but you don't need to know hellraiser.

linkffn(the strange disappearance of sallyanne perks) has kind of spooky vibes as the trio solve a mystery, but it doesn't have a spooky Harry.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
