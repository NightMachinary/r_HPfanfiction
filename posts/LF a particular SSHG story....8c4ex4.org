Hi all! I have been, unsuccessfully, looking for a story that I read ages ago and, in doing so, stumbled upon this sub. I am hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction. I am looking for a SSHG story that I believe was on ff.net. In the story, Hermione is unhappily married to Ron but can't divorce him because (I think?) something about Wizarding Law prevents her gaining custody of Hugo and Rose. On a holiday with just her, and possibly the kiddos, I believe in a beach type locale, she stumbles upon Severus. I feel like they are both Glamoured and pick up what starts as a harmless flirtation and then becomes an affair. Somewhere during it, they discover each other identities and they fall in love. This continues on for many years, until the kids finally finish their seventh year at Hogwarts and she can divorce Ron. Ring any bells for anyone? Written from my memory, this sounds quite convoluted, but I remember it being quite good!

  Who would Severus become without his burden of self-loathing? And how will that Severus react when Ron Weasley's widow comes seeking healing of her own? DH compliant, save for Snape's survival. SS/LP followed by SS/HG M for later chapters.
