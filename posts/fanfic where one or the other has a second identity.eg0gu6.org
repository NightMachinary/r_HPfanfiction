like if you have ever read the book whitney my love? where MC doesnt know the love interest is a powerful person (royalty?) and treats them like a normal person and calls them names, i love this dynamic but i cant seem to find any fics.

or

when MC gets betrothed to a person, runs away and falls in love with someone who also ends up being the person the she was originally betrothed to? am i good at explaining it gud?
