I'm not necessarily talking about cliches, although that is definitely included in this. I'm also not talking about stupid tropes that you'd find in any Gary-Stu/Mary-Sue stories, though again, those are included.

What I'm asking is this: is there something you see often that you don't want in your own works?


** Magical Cores.

I never use them. I find their concept to be too "anime". Harry having a powerlevel over 9000 and all that.

Occlumency being something akin to a mindscape is also something I don't include.

**** Yes, in most fanfics that is the interpretation I go for as a reader, since otherwise I'd have to disregard 90+% of HP fanfiction.

But there are some out there that have scenes in which Pomfrey uses special charms to measure the amount of magic in Harry and behold, he is the uber-magic-reservoire. Its very clear where those authors take their storytelling from, namely Naruto, Bleach and other Shonen-Anime.

On the other side it is also an attempt to create a power list for the reader and the author themselves. Humans crave measurements, lists and data. Having a magical core pulled magic into a measureable realm.

I personally like the idea that magic flows through the body, like blood flows through our veins. There are points where it is more focused - the mind, our hands, but you can't pin it down and you can't measure it. Or as one of my character says "Magic doesn't do measurement. Its mocking any attempt to make sense of it, by becoming something completely different the moment you stop looking. Spells work, because magic wants them to work, not because there is a rule that says they must work by natural law."

***** I dislike the idea of cores meaning some wizards have naturally higher power levels than others, since it completely contradicts canon and on how certain wizards aren't inherently better than others. I do, however, like the idea that a core functions as your magical signature, though, a unique identifier of the soul.

****** There was one great fan theory I read about how wizarding genetics worked. It basically said that the magic gene had a repeating segment in it and that the length indicated the amount of power a wizard could control; muggles were the shortest, followed by squibs, weak wizards, and then strong wizards. Squibs were born when a mutation deletes part of it, while muggleborns appear when the segment is unexpectedly replicated.

It's totally unrelated to the core theory, but it provides a reasonable explanation for stronger or weaker magic users. It would be like someone who has naturally stronger muscles or better lungs beating you in athletics.

** The convention of drama or plot over characters acting like real people. Or just people being portrayed in outrageously unrealistic ways.

This isn't constrained to fan fiction. Jupiter Jones was thrust into a position of wealth and privilege, and horrified by ongoing genocides, but as soon as Earth was safe, she was back to cleaning toilets -- and happy about it. Thorin Oakenshield spent a year of travel and probably not an inconsiderable amount of money, and also planned to risk his life, to reclaim Erebor, but when the path to Erebor doesn't open at /precisely/ the appointed time, he's ready to give up. (Sunk cost fallacy doesn't come into it; he spent the time and money because he was dedicated to the cause. But if he were dedicated, he wouldn't have given up so easily.)

I'm reading /Neuromancer/. Apparently, if it results in the protagonist having sex, no editor cares whether a woman is acting in character or not. Professional relationship, just met you, you're recovering from surgery -- a new pancreas, even -- my duty is to ensure you don't injure yourself -- let's bang! Ejakulo de la diablo.

That's the thing, though. Do basilisks even petrify? Or rather, are they /supposed/ to petrify? Because if you look a basilisk in the eye, you die. You just straight up die. How often do people look a basilisk in the eye, /in a reflection/, and afterwards live to tell the tale? It's quite possible petrification by reflective/see-through proxy is a very rare thing when dealing with a basilisk.

#+begin_quote
  Basilisk (also known as the King of Serpents)

  M.O.M. Classification: XXXXX

  The first recorded Basilisk was bred by Herpo the Foul, a Greek Dark wizard and Parselmouth, who discovered after much experimentation that a chicken egg hatched beneath a toad would produce a gigantic serpent possessed of extraordinarily dangerous powers.

  The Basilisk is a brilliant green serpent that may reach up to fifty feet in length. The male has a scarlet plume upon its head. It has exceptionally venomous fangs but its most dangerous means of attack is the gaze of its large yellow eyes. Anyone looking directly into these will suffer instant death.

  If the food source is sufficient (the Basilisk will eat all mammals and birds and most reptiles), the serpent may attain a very great age. Herpo the Foul's Basilisk is believed to have lived for close on nine hundred years.

  The creation of Basilisks has been illegal since medieval times, although the practice is easily concealed by simply removing the chicken egg from beneath the toad when the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures comes to call. However, since Basilisks are uncontrollable except by Parselmouths, they are as dangerous to most Dark wizards as to anybody else, and there have been no recorded sightings of Basilisks in Britain for at least four hundred years.

And any such system can be easily improved by making House-Elves able to pick their master/owner/whatever. Any of the shitty "they need masters or they die"/"They would become evil of free"/"They want to be slaves" drivel made up to excuse slavery do not require slaves stuck with a cruel master to work.

And once a slave can pick their master/owner it's not really slavery anymore, since that power alone means they'll have to be treated as they want to, or they can leave for a better owner.

Basically, elves were not enslaved, they were the last edition of the experiment to tame the Wild. Previous attempts to do this resulted in garden gnomes and doxies. And as such they are not really creatures, but aspects of Chaos, given form and identity. Some feel the draw of the Wild and want to fullfill its requests in shaping the world (Wild=Fate), which usually requires for them to be free. Others don't. But at any moment they might --- Wild never gave them up, they are still a part of it. They just do not require independence at the moment.

TL;DR --- they are AIs, programmed to serve. But if another huge AI that made them, wants them to do something, it adds additional commands to their programing. Sometimes it requires a desire to be free, and thus it gets added too.

Why they don't simply write Dobby and co. out of the story and ignore house elves altogether, or remove the slavery part and make Dobby stay voluntarily with the Malfoys so he can spy on them, I don't understand. Probably another case of "it's canon, so it must be used!"

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

*** I'm fine with Harry and Hermione made for each other, as long as authors spent some effort changing their characters.

Canon Harry and Hermione don't even enjoy each other's company that much. When Ron left them, Harry was drooling over his (ex) girlfriend's dot on the Marauder's Maps for hours, while Hermione was pulling out Phineas Nigellus Black's portrait for company! I mean how more awkward can things get between them?

Hermione can be very tactless too. For example, when Harry cut up Draco with Sectumsepra, she was almost gloating with self righteousness. In year 5, there were several instances where Harry blew up at her for endless nagging and pushing.

I'm actually far more interested in knowing how Harry worked with his boss Hermione later. At least from JKR's description of their future jobs, they must have been very successful as a team. Unfortunately, I haven't found a SINGLE fanfic that addresses this topic.

*** Snapery aside, fanon notice me nots are shit because fanon notice me nots are hilariously broken. What you need to do is put limits on it.

I call it the Distraction Charm. Its purpose it to distract people from the person/thing it was cast on, but it only works if there's something necessarily important enough or immediate enough to distract them with. If put on Harry in the middle of a crowd in Diagon Alley, it will work gloriously, because Diagon Alley is a shopping district and everyone is there for their own -more important- needs. It will distract them from the fact that Harry Potter is doing his own shopping.

If put on Harry in Nocturne Alley, it will fail more often than not, because people who know what Harry look like will find him being down there important to know, and what they were doing is likely less important.

If put on Harry in a No Trespassing area, it will completely fail, because the very fact that /anyone/ is standing in that area is important to those watching.

Rowling's input), if you really are irredeemably evil, you cannot cast a Patronus; maggots burst out of your wand and eat you alive. Thus, he couldn't have cast the doe Patronus to help Harry if he was really bad.

So seeing Snape do things like that in fanfiction is horrifying on an entirely different level. Mpreg is just gross (and stupid) because of the anatomical impossibility of it.

** I avoid the trope of head boy and head girl having their own rooms and bathroom. I find it unrealistic and it wasn't supported by canon at all. When Percy became Head Boy in PoA, it was right after the reveal he was dating Penelope Clearwater. Surely Fred and George would not have passed up the opportunity to tease him about having his own room for her to visit.

Anyways, the point of being a prefect or head student is to kind of keep an eye on everything that's going on, as we know from what Lupin told us. I know if I had my own room after 6 years of sharing with 3-4 other girls I would never leave.

Also the trope of the Yule Ball happening every year as an excuse to set up characters. It only happens when the Triwizard Tournament happens, and in my story I subverted the ship teasing by having most of the champions and their dates not care about the ball at all. They found the entire process kind of tedious.

**** One of the reason (not the main but it's just popped my mind) it's how she was jealous that Harry had better grades in the sixth book.

The same book where all she did was crying because Ron was with Lavender. (Btw did you notice how she attacked Ron because he had a girlfriend. No it's not normal. In my country we can sue you if you do this.

Oh and how everyone think that she is clever when she only know how to read books. For example in The Order of The Phoenix, do you remember the list? Why the heck does the list punish you AFTER you spoke of the DA. Why doesn't it unable you to talk. Or make you forget if you want to talk. And why was Harry almost expelled when it was Hermione idea? Does the punishment fit the crime? A girl [Mariette] is going to have mark all her life because of a mistake she made at 16? And can we talk about the attempt murder she did on Umbridge? While guiding her to the giant and centaurs?+

I still have many more reason, if you are interested don't hesitate to ask me :)

****** Well for the first book I don't think she showed any great logical skills, because of two fact: 1) The riddle was more or less simple. 2) How she solved it was also bad. Wasn't it cleverer to conjure birds (Avis) and to make them drink a little bit of the potion and then to go through the fire? Or just to freeze fire?

For the second book, the basilik. As I said she just read a book about Magical Creatures and made the connection. No need to be Einstein if you remember the book.

So I stay on my point. She just read book and memorise them (wand motion and incantation).

Oh another point I forgot earlier: She obliviated her parents without them consents. Do you think it's normal. I'm pretty sure no parent want to forget their unique daughter.

******** I think we will always have different point of view for the two first points because while Hermione use this spell in the sixth book we aren't sure when she learned it for example. So let's talk about the last point. What I don't find normal is to why they don't know about the threat. And it exist so many alternative. For example, a house protected by Fidelius Charm with her or Harry/Ron as Secret Keeper?

Another question: Why didn't Hermione believe Harry when he told her about a) Draco being a Death Eater wanting to kill Dumbledore? b) Harry wanting to go to Godric Hollow? (She only accept after Christmas leading to their near death experience and Hermione breaking Harry's wand and c) That the Deathly Hallows are important?

I think I have the answer. Hermione think that she is the brain of the 'golden' Trio and that any deduction not coming of her brain is false.

Your turn :p I really love the discussion we have :3

********** Well to answer your question it was for a romantic/sexual attraction for Ron's case. Harry, he, never had any friend before and know that his first friend (Ron) like/love Hermione. So he never cut his friendship with Hermione so he doesn't loose his friendship with Ron.

And yeah you are totally right most people just say to me 'How can you don't love Hermione she is the most awesome character of Harry Potters book..." And I also agree with the fact that I/You will always hate/love Hermione except if JK make a total rewrite of her. But it still interesting to have the opinion of the other side of the argument :3
