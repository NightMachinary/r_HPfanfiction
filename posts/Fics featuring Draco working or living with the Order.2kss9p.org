I'm interested in fics where, during the time of the HP books, Draco ends up invovled with the Order in some way. He doesn't have to be on their side, he just has to interact with members of the Order. One scenario I'd especially like to see is where Draco takes Dumbledore's offer for safe haven and then has to go live with the order.


** It's not the focus of the story, but The Wise One trilogy has that element, if I recall. Draco taking refuge with the Order and reluctantly coming over to their side is a main plot point in the later books. The trilogy is a bit angst-y for my tastes but it's well written and it has its moments.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][760,000 words.]] 96 chapters and a sequel. Harry-centred but heavily featuring Draco, he doesn't really accept Dumbledore's offer but close enough I'd say..

*** "A Year Like None Other" was one of my favourite fics several years ago. Gonna reread it and catch up on the third part in the near future.

The third part is in progress [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=17466][here]], btw.

Light Dumbledore bashing, but otherwise good Dumbledore. Harry x OC.
