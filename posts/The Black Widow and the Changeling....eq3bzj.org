7 husbands, 7 deaths. Ms Zabini is known to the public as a Black Widow. But, apparently, she is just incredibly unfortunate.

In a rare interview (done in the Quibbler of all places) Ms Zabini claims she is abstaining from romance due to the belief that not just her husbands, but her "romantic partners" are being targeted by one of her former lovers. The possibility that Zabini is being framed and men are being targeted for being with her

Involvement with Ms Zabini is dangerous. Marriage to her is a death sentence. But Junior Auror Nymphadora Tonks, wife and mother, is going to crack this case wide open.

By going undercover and getting hitched herself! Desperately trying NOT to recognise how gorgeous and alluring the "Black Widow" is along the way...


** For some reason I expected this to be a crossover hookup between a Slytherin Ginny and Natasha Romanoff.

** I'd set it during OotP. That way, you can get some banter between Sirius, who is trying to live through his cousin and Tonks' desperate attempts at maintaining professionalism. And maybe some "advice" from Moody ("if I still had all my limbs..."). Maybe a running gag that Tonks is missing all the Order meetings because she is "watching" Mrs Zabini.

Compared to that, a postwar setting gives you grief, responsibility in the shape of Teddy and possibly infidelity.

*** The way I envisioned it WAS for the infidelity. Specifically for Tonks to have a multitude of mixed feelings and conflicting emotions when dealing with Zabini:

▪︎ Is she a murderer or is she innocent?

▪︎ Am I falling for her? I'm married to Remus!

If I were to actually sit down and write this, I would base it in an AU after the war where Remus and Teddy are in Tonks's life AND factor in to the plot.

**** I've written an outline, but it's based upon the changes I've suggested above. Not sure if/when I'll get around to writing the whole thing, but I'd estimate it would end up around 10k spread across OotP. No infidelity, no Lupin attraction, no Teddy (duh). Rather than dealing with fidelity, the main theme would be loyalty (Tonks' to the Ministry and the Order).

I honestly don't think that it'd work in a post war setting because the entire plot of DH is one big mess which would require a lot of retconning unless you want everyone look even more incompetent than the camping trip. Not to mention that a postwar setting would require you to deal with a lot of wartime stuff at least tangentially if you're involving the Ministry because, to be blunt, they were the ones who did Voldemort's dirty work under Umbridge. Which means even more retcons unless you're fine with most people being dicks if you want to be kind on them.

***** That sounds great, I'd love to read it if you write it. But again, my take on it would be in a post-war world where Remus, Tonks and Teddy (at least) survived.

I have no issue with working with a post-war Ministry in the background, the red tape of which helps and hinders Tonks in her investigation (and is the reason why she took things into her own hands and made the extreme choice to disguise herself as a man to seduce Ms Zabini).

It's easy to work with this as the actual political landscape of the HP world does not need to be at the forefront and liberties can be taken (as this is, by its very nature, an AU).

Again I like your idea, it just isn't how I envisioned it, but I still think it sounds awesome and hope you write it.

****** Perhaps it's because I'm German, but we are rather sensitised to topics like guilt and genocide. And given that the Ministry played a major role in Voldemort's atrocities and the Order was practically reduced to a radio station, it raises the "Where were you? What role did you play?" question for most people who would appear in a postwar story. How many did collaborate? In how many deportations and executions did X participate, even if only as a paper pusher?

The big failing of DH is that there is no denazification equivalent. The "all was well" ending sounds a lot like "Let's pretend that never happened" because after a civil war, not everything can be well. Just look at Malfoy, who committed countless war crimes in HBP, being able to show his face in public. Or the fact that in the end, only 5 Order members were left alive (+trio). That would NOT be enough to enforce any changes, especially given that the Auror Corps either died or collaborated. Same goes for the entire DMLE.
