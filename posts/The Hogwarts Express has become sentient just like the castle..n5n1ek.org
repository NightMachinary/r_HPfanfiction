*** While I definitely agree that James's color is more appropriate, the Hogwarts Express is almost certainly based off an LNER design, which would make him kin to Gordon and the Flying Scotsman.

Now there's an idea...

For all the times James exalted himself over his red coat of paint and reacted extremely hostilely to the idea of being painted blue...can you imagine the temper tantrum Gordon would throw if he were painted red?

**** the Ministry stole the blueprints for several engines, merged them together to look the way they wanted it to, built the engine with magic, went back and fucked up the blueprint so that no-one could build another engine like the one they made, then sold it on the black market, where it is bought by an aspiring loco manufacturer. This leads to Henry's Old Shape.
