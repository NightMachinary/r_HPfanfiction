And dementors are described as immortal by normal means, so either get flamethrowers or something like silver bullets (or whatever works against them).

Also, why a Quad .50? Wouldn't a Quad Bofors or an eight barreled PomPom (we are in Britain after all) be more suited for a fixed position?

** Not only starting with, but containing it anywhere. The same applies for "How will [...] ?", "What happens when [...] ?", and any kind of question, really. Rule number 1 of writing a summary: NO FREAKING QUESTIONS. Summaries are for telling people about your story, not asking questions. As a matter of fact, addressing the reader directly in any fashion is a very bad idea (“read and find out!... anyone? ...please love me...”).

As a general rule, if, when you read it out loud, your summary sounds like a teaser for a shitty direct-to-DVD comedy of the early 2000's, you did something wrong.

*~Made up example~*

Crappy:

Mentor for her eyes, violence is a dish best served in the morning, by UzumakiPotter-Black03

"What happens when a sombre potion teacher we all know and love finds himself locked in a room with his most hated pupil? Dark secrets are revealed as our unexpected duo finds themselves dragged on a very unexpected journey. Will they find a way to work together? Will anyone walk out alive? Read and find out!”

Passable:

The Bat, the Boy and the Bogeyman, by NomDeScript

“The door was sealed shut and his wand was missing. Still, he had endured worst conditions in the past. “Sna- Professor?!” said a shocked voice from his back. Potter. Of course. “I suppose you do not have your wand with you, Potter?” he managed to erupt in a dangerous whisper. “Er... no... do you know what is happening... sir?”. This was going to be a very bad day, and by the end of it, somebody would suffer a slow and terrible death.”

It ain't rocket surgery.

Well, there is no accounting for taste I suppose, and I'm definitely not saying that the second one is a masterpiece. But summaries are not really supposed to be perfect "summations" of the story, I think they are supposed to show the setting and entice the reader to "read and find out" more... preferably without telling it to their faces.

I'm not going to make an in depth analysis of why I think the second one is not only more tasteful, but also contains more important information than the first in a more subtle way, but yeah... that. Also, "Show don't tell" and stuff....

Furthermore there are plenty of places, even on Reddit, that'll help you with a summary, all it takes is for you to give a damn and to put in a bit of effort. 'What if' summaries are a true cop out, and a sure sign of laziness when there is help out there for those who need it and want it so you don't have to resort to a shit summary because your brain is too small to handle putting 200 words together in a coherent statement. To not reach out to get some help from anyone knowing you're bad at summaries, and struggle at them, is a sure sign of lack off effort and care. It's the same thing as those people who can not bother to google a major character's name and spell it wrong the entire fic. Or like one story kept going between Blaise and Blaize.

Yes I think you have way too much expectations for people who just write a story for fun and throw it online, and then slap a summary on it. And maybe they DON'T slap a summary on it, maybe that's legitimately the best they can come up with for a summary! Maybe it's lazy and maybe it isn't, but it's also lazy to sit on your couch playing video games, and lazy to use a remote instead of the TV buttons. Nobody gets up in arms about that. So why is it a big deal for a fanfiction writer to be lazy with a summary?

And besides that, I don't think you can judge someone on "NOT CARING" about the story they're writing if they've gotten like 50000 words in it, JUST over a little blurb thing they throw up. That doesn't mean they don't CARE, or even necessarily that there wasn't EFFORT put into it. It just didn't result in something you wanted to see.

******* I could write 'Shackles' 50,000 times. Word count means nothing. And in your world writing Shackles 50,000 times, slapping a bad summary on it and calling it fanfic, well hey I enjoyed it so it must be good fanfic. woo yay me.

***** If you can't even summarize a story, I'm not going to trust in your ability to fully write one. It's the very first thing people see when they see your piece, so a special amount of care should be made into making it equal to your full work. How am I supposed to know if someone is a good author if I don't even read past the summary? The summary brings people in, while the story keeps them there.

***** If you can't properly write the single most important sentence of the entire fic, the public face that determines whether or not most people even bother to read it, then I don't have high hopes for the rest of the fic.

**** No I don't think that's true at all sturmund, and it's mean to just absolutely say someone isn't good because they can't write a summary!

And here is my argument for why that is bad to say and think.

Yes because okay, some people are good at being expressive and stuff when speaking, but are terrible at writing anything down. And some people are way more better at communicating through writing, but can't speak in front of anyone! Also some people are better at coming up with ideas and DESCRIBING THINGS than they are at actually WRITING THE THING. They are called think tanks and "idea guys".

And yes, that means some people are going to be a lot better at actually writing something than DESCRIBING IT TO OTHERS. And I know that myself, how it is very hard to actually tell someone about my story or idea than to actually sit down and write it. So yes. :)
