** What do you mean getting revenge on her? And how? What did she do that deserve revenge? That and at best he could try to tarnish her reputation but the worst could be rape and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to read that.

*** She Confunded him at Quidditch tryouts, if I'm remembering correctly. She also took him as a date to the Slug party purely to get back at Ron, which was a scummy thing to do, but hardly revenge-worthy. The Confunding thing probably warrants some degree of reprisal, though.

**** ah yeah I only remembered the date thing. Yeah well he would have to know but if he knew just report her would be amongst the worst revenge for Hermione with her being a prefect and everyone knowing about it. For the date thing well same he would have to know about it and she could just say he was annoying (which he surely was)
