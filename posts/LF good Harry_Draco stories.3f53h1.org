Okay I'm looking for some slash stories as the title says, but with few requirements / restrictions:

- Takes place during Hogwarts (no pre/post)
- Believable characters. This is really important. So many slash stories there where I have to suspend everything I know about these characters from the books. So they must be believable canon compliant characterisations. This includes interests, character quirks, imperfections (No Draco is not a veela Sex God), likes, dislikes, looks, etc.
- no Veela / mpreg / creature nonsense. Just normal teenage boys that they are.
- Supporting characters are alive and deal with the unexpected issue of Harry / Draco in a realistic and believable way. Ron would no doubt assume Harry's been fed Love potion no doubt by Voldemorts orders or something like that ... What would Draco's parents and his house mates think, feel, do? I think vast majority of slash stories seem to down play or just ignore such implications.
- I want a rough, gritty and realistic. Not over the moon, shiny eyes rainbows ponies from every orifice story.
- well written, structured and good grammar (reasonably good. I know many great fiction writers aren't native speakers)
- If there is sex ( I don't mind, in fact even prefer ) - then it has to be written by gay guy writer. Sorry and no disrespect, but so many otherwise great stories are ruined simply because girls don't often get the way boys react, think, feel. I can tell many such stories written by females and it makes me cringe. So this is kind of a must. So realistic R rated content between boys.
- Not entered on 100 other "ships@ I want to read story about these two and any other pairing should be secondary and in the background.
- Characters deal with personal issues. For example Harry confront possibility of him being Gay, or Draco. I imagine Vernon would not have a favourable view of those "homosexuals". I imagine he would rant about them from time to time between complaining about Harry, I think stuff like that leaves a lasting effect on young boy. Even if he can't help it.

I don't care much about the plot device used, but it should be believable, realistic and somewhat compliant with magic rules as we know them from books. Don't care about the length, but longer the better, preferable not too much AU, but I don't mind that. Ideally canon compliment, but it's fine if story was written before later books were released. So yeah, looking forward what you guys might recommend.
