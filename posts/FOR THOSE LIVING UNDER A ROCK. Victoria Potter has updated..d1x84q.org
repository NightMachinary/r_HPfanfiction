*** For once, it isn't a 13 year old mastermind politician. Just a regular above average kid with regular teenage tendencies such as jealousy, naivety, and of course the beginning of hormone fueled infatuations.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
