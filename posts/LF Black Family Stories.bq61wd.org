I'm looking for stories that celebrate the Black family. I love reading about all of the pureblood traditions and Sirius taking his place as heir/head of the family.

Bonus if it has dark/grey!Harry or any Dumbledore/typical good guy bashing.

I have read Ellory's Pure-blood Culture series, Growing Up Black, and The Beguile and Devotion of a Black Heir.

Thank you in advance!!


** Everything by TheDivineComedian is wonderful, including this:

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

** First time posting on here, although I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while, so I hope I'm doing this right. ^^

â€‹

I've really enjoyed /In The Black/ and the sequel /Black Mask/ by izzythehutt, both of which have some great Black family interactions and Sirius being pulled back into the family:

  Regulus Black survives his adventure in the cave and brings the locket to an unlikely ally: his estranged older brother. The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety. Sirius Black is faced with his toughest mission yet: managing Walburga and Orion Black---who, to his surprise and dismay, decide they rather enjoy having both of their sons back, and very quickly scheme to make this temporary family reunion permanent.Or: the story of how one night completely changed the course of the war and Sirius's life.[AU of the First Wizarding War in which stealing part of Voldemort's soul brings a broken, dysfunctional family together - Winner of 2018 Shrieking Shack Society Silver Marauders Medal for Best Sirius Characterization]

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** There's an author called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/8024050/][TheBlack'sResurgence]] who does good Black family stuff.

Also, I remember neither of these but they're on my follow list somehow: linkffn(All The Stars In The Sky; Black Luminary).

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?
