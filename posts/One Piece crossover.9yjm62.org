Are there any well done crossovers with One Piece out there?

Maybe something with Harry/fem!harry being teleported to the OP universe as a baby and then is forced back to England?

I have read The Emerald Rose and enjoyed it but I couldn't get myself to enjoy it's sequel.

** I have looked in the past and sadly haven't found many I thought were particularly well written except maybe this one which only has three chapters. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/810256/chapters/1529757][It's a Mad, Mad World]]

I at one point read these two that have basically the same premise. I remember one being better written than the other, but don't remember which is which, or even how good the better one was.

** I have read only one, - it featured a Harry that became a swordsmith in the One Piece Universe.\\
Short but well worth the read.

  ONE SHOT "If Mihawk was going to become the world's greatest swordsman, he would need a sword to match. Luckily, he stumbled upon the peculiar green-eyed man named Harii who was the best smith he'd ever met. It started off as threaten-and-irritably-obey, and now it was more like give-and-take (though Mihawk still threatened sometimes.)" Drabble fic,no pairing, long, T for swearing
