When Tom Riddle is killed at the end of Deathly Hallows, instead of dying normally, he is moved to the body of Mark Watney from the Martian, immediately after Mark wakes up stranded. He has a wand, and Mark's knowledge. What happens next?


** Let's assume he doesn't go nuts immediately and kill himself by destroying his suit.

Alright, first things first, he'd assess his situation. Where is he? Some sort of red desert. What is he wearing? There's no magic in it, so it's a muggle contraption. He doesn't know anything about future tech, so he likely can't read or maintain it. He's smart, and chemistry was around when he was a kid, so he likely DOES know what O2 means, and he will eventually notice it going down, and deduce a limited oxygen supply.

There must exist spells to test the atmosphere, but if not, I'm sure he can rig up a spell before the air runs out. Let's say he invents or uses "Aer Revelio", which shows if the caster can survive in the local atmosphere.

At this point, he would deduce that either he is on Earth, but at a time when the atmosphere was different, the atmosphere will be different, or he is not on Earth anymore. He likely won't try to apparate without knowing where he is regardless.

His first concern is obviously air. We don't know how a bubblehead charm functions, but alchemy is real and able to truly transmute (transfiguring air may or may not be possible) elements, so the first thing he does is conjure up or transfigure some of the desert sand into a shelter. Thick glass walls, anchored to the bedrock, interior furniture. If he's smart, he'll make it modular as well, to be added onto later. No need for an airlock, he can apparate in or out.

The next concern is water. Aguamenti works, but depending on how it works, may not produce enough. However, we know that in the movie, Mars has ice under the surface, which he could likely use or invent a spell for to detect as well. So he casts "Gelum Revelio" and then pulls a sizeable quantity of pure elemental ice from the ground.

Water and air now achieved, the next step is food, as well as introspective. He was thoroughly beaten. All horcruxes destroyed, all followers dead or betrayers, and he appears to be somewhere where he won't be recognized, based on his muggle suit. He won't make another horcrux, there's noone to murder and I don't think he can split his soul any more.

At night, he looks at the stars to divine his position as well as time. Extreme temporal differences in either direction would be signified by warped constellations, and a different position would be signified by unrecognizeable constellations. He notices Mars and the moon missing, but a series of three bright spots on the night sky. By day, he sees that the sun is smaller, and makes the deduction. He is on Mars, and those other spots were Earth, Phobos and Deimos.

Food starts to become an issue. He explores for the muggle vehicle that brought him to Mars, and eventually finds it. Inside, he sees muggle tech he doesn't know how to use, as well as supplies. Food, gear, etc. He takes it all, including the ship.

He now has sustainable water, air and food. He can now begin researching a way to go back home - perhaps a floo bonfire, or an interplanetary portkey, or just spinning on the spot for an hour to twist space enough to apparate the distance.

Once on Earth, anything can happen.

*** Op said that he has Mark's knowledge, therefore he would know how all of the equipment works, or at least what it does.

**** yeah but that's pretty boring. He just does everything he does in the movie except magic takes all suspense from it.
