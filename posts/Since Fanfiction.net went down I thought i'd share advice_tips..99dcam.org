A few tips for the uninformed, download all stories that interest you. Use Omnibuser.com, or Fictionpress.com, or including mobile devices use Fanfiction.net app, it syncs through all devices. That's just my tips. If anyone has other advice/tips feel free to comment them below, hopefully with this, those that don't know about such things now do, and maybe other people who do can pick up new ways to download, and store stories.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Perhaps create a Google drive and store them for later...

Could also be used for archiving lost stories (run into quite a few recently and haven't been able to find them in any archives.)

**** I think perhaps somehow it varied- it hasn't been down for me- it just hasn't updated in the same time frame.

** [FicSave](ficsave.xyz) is a pretty good option for downloading fanfiction as well. Beautiful layout and slightly cleaner format than omnibuser.

** I have used [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] with with FanFicFare plugin (previously FFDL) for years because I read fanfics on e-reader. Really recommend to anyone, even if you don't read on e-reader. Helps with keeping track of what you have read, what was good, what bad, personal tags, series and a lot more.

** [[http://fanficfare.appspot.com/][FanFicFare]] - works on multiple sites. Web app or Calibre plugin.

And they'll even show you a list of the most popular and most recent downloads, if you want to try something new and random.

** Thanks to everyone here. With over 2,800 views so far, and 34 upvotes this seems like it's going well. Hopefully the next time Fanfiction.net goes down(which we all know it will) everyone, or at least most people won't mind-too-much. Either due downloading the story earlier, or they have one of many unread stories to occupy their/your time.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
