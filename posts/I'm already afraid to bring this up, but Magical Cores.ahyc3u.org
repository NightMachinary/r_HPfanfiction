RUN FOR THE HILLS! I'm just kidding. I'm trying to write a story, and I'd like it if people weren't immediately turned off by it, so I'd like to avoid the cringy bits. Can you wonderful people help me list what makes you gag about magical cores?

My idea is that there isn't a singular core that creates and stores magic that can expand indefinitely. The magic is ambient, and the body conducts it somehow, but before I start to flesh out the hows and whys, I thought I'd first ask for the don'ts.


** The absolutely worst thing you can do with magical cores is to add the concept to "romances" as another "big-dick" thing to have for the MC. You would be surprised how often you will find something akin to:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione: "Wow, Harry is such an awesome lover. When he was nailing me with his twelve inches..."

  Daphne: "What were you expecting, his magical core is 5684 of arbitrary unit."

  Hermione: "I knew about the correlation between core and penis size, but I never expected Harry to be that big"

  Daphne: "He had to be because he defeated Voldemort and Dumbledore, who were 4981 and 5147."
#+end_quote

I feel like [[/u/UndeadBBQ]] might disagree because his objections are more towards the overall balance and mechanics of the HP universe, but to me, random power wanks, or "stats" which show how "awesome" the MC is, are way worse than simply breaking the balance. Especially since they are often added unnecessarily. Harry is an awesome character, but that comes from the "everyday hero" archetype, not him being some kind of superhuman. Also, the depiction of the role of women in such fics is often very off-putting because it goes way beyond D/s and straight into servitude. And the concept of magical cores is often just a paper-thin justification for that, because witches are often attracted and submit themselves to a wizard with a big core (seriously, this is a surprisingly popular thing).

*** That impromptu quotation honestly made me laugh out loud.

Let me put your worries to rest - I'm not looking to write a powerwank harem fic. I'm really just curious about the inner workings of magic so that I can flesh out how one might improve their own ability, and so that I can introduce prosthetics and augmentations that help restore/enhance their abilities within reason. Emphasis on the restore. Specifically - If you lose your hands and get fake limbs, can you do magic with them, or are you screwed? Maybe that should have been the question I posted, but I felt a general query might bring more results.

I don't really know the answer to the thickness bit (lol), but we know that, for example, if you wanted to make a wizard levitate with the Levitation Charm you have to direct it at their clothes since that spell doesn't work on people directly.

#+end_quote

An analogy I like to use is to think of the ability to cast magic as one's ability to paint (or draw, or your artistic medium of choice). There's no 'painter's core' in someone which governs how good their paintings are, just their ingrained experience and knowledge. Children are able to finger-paint, but they have neither the tools nor experience to make anything even approaching the same level of a master artist. (This would apply to wandless magic as well, you can certainly paint something without a paintbrush, but without specifically training for it means you'll get results not much better than the child's).

Then, losing one's hand isn't so apocalyptic. Obviously it will affect them, as you say some impairment is inevitable, but it shouldn't restrict one's ability to do magic, just the immediate quality of the spells which result. It's not unimaginable that after re-training themselves to either cast with their off hand or with a prosthetic, the wizard or witch would be back up to their former level, or even differ somewhat due to the different method of casting (like maybe they develop a proficiency for Charms, when they were previously best with Transfigurations?) Just my two cents.

** Three fundamental problems with magical cores:

1. Wizards being able to run out of magic. Generally used to nerf the capabilities of wizards (often with wizards only being able to cast a truly pathetic number of spells before they get tired, even though we see them relying on magic to do everything in canon).

2. Magical power being in some sense equivalent to physical energy, so that you can say how much energy a wizard has access to and what amount of energy therefore can overcome the wizard. I much prefer the system of magic simply overruling the physical universe, with the limits of magic being set by magical law. Again, generally used to nerf the capabilities of wizards.

3. Magic as fuel being "burnt" to do work tends to result in authors conceiving of magic in an overly physical way - brooms have an invisible source of physical thrust, or a curse creates its effect through biological processes (e.g. Cruciatus Curse something something nerve endings). This tends to blinker authors to the more abstract and wacky aspects of magic (which are often the most powerful magical acts) and so in turn nerfs the capabilities of wizards.

TL;DR magical cores generally results in much weaker wizards than in canon. I /might/ be satisfied by a system in which each wizard's magical core contained at least as much energy as makes up the physical universe, but even then I would probably have in the back of my mind the niggling disappointment that wizards had been unnecessarily weakened.

**** This is rather the point - your question illustrates the absurdity of treating HP magic as energy. Because HP magic can do things that would require huge amounts of energy to replicate through physical means, and can do other things that no quantity of physical energy would allow you to do. But at the same time there are some things magic cannot do which would not necessarily require a very large amount of energy.

The reason is of course that magic's capabilities are dictated by magical law, not physical law, and magical law largely ignores stuff like energy.

On balance, if a fanfic absolutely must treat magic as physical energy, then I would prefer a level of energy which preserves as many canonical magical feats as possible, which means giving wizards access to huge amounts of energy - a single Aguamenti requires significantly more energy than the largest ever nuclear bomb, and wizards can cast it casually. That's not even starting on time travel.

** Magical signatures are a bigger turn off for me than cores. Like I can see the cores and all, maybe make it so that the magic core is directly connected to the soul/body, like a person can do things to make their magic flow better. I liked how A Cadmean Victory did it. The only time it was acknowledged was when something was done regarding it. Magical signatures on the other hand, I can't see how that could work seeing as there are death eaters who were never caught or even suspected. Also I avoid stories with a passion that have the MC meditating and “looking inward” to find their magical core and suddenly their master occlumens capable of doing anything because reasons.

Are you talking about magical signatures regarding tracking a person? It was a bit unclear to me what you tried to say. What that brings to mind is Dumbledore can sense powerful magic being present in canon, or at least he could decipher the intent behind the spells guarding the locket horcrux, so I imagine it's just an obscure and hard to muster skill that's not directly applicable to identification.

Oh, don't get me started on the master occlumens trope! The mindscapes in those kinds of stories have me rolling on the floor laughing. I mean, sure. Okay. Be an occlumens. But that has to also have a power curve! And telepathic speech just... no.

**** What I'm saying is the idea that everyone has a magical signature that is recorded and can be tracked and everything from lumos to fiendfyre from the same person would have the same magic signature that could be detected and tracked, including the exact spell used. I always loved the idea of talented wizards being able to sense magic with a lot of practice and skill but even then be more generalized, like you said with Dumbledore being able to sense the intent of the magic and figuring it out. I think I saw it best done in a scene of Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived by The Santi. I can't remember what stories I remember it from but my favorite idea of magical cores has always been where young kids legitimately can't do things like protego or the stunning spell because of their age, whether it be because of raw magical power or skill.

** I'm probably one of the most vocal anti-magical core advocates on the sub (as the flair would suggest), so have this disclaimer before reading what I have to say.

As far as I can tell, the source of magic in Harry Potter are the wizards and witches themselves. They don't soak up magic like a sponge, they don't have to harvest it from the multiverse, they just, simply, /have it/. An infinite amount of magic within the infinity of their soul.

In theory, I don't have anything against magical cores. In practicality, however, they are often synonymous with a few things I */hate/* in fanfiction with the burning passion of a thousand suns.

The great part about HPs magic is that the only limitation at birth seems binary. You either have it or you don't. What follows is your own dedication, willpower, hard work, intelligence and wisdom that determines how "powerful" a wizard or witch you can be. There are no limitations on the magic itself. So when I then read about "magical exhaustion", or powerlevels, or the equivalents of manapools you can deplete, my eye starts to twitch and I nope out of a fic at the end of the sentence. Its no longer Harry Potter at that moment. Its just some garbage spinoff, second rate copy of Harry Potter.

There are no magical muscles you can train up to "lift more magic", or whatever. There are no DragonBall-esque powerlevels. There are no videogame manapools you can deplete. The magic is infinite. Your knowledge and handling of it is what limits it.

Not to nitpick, but wouldn't it be possible to call exhaustion from doing too much magic "magical exhaustion"? Not in "Out of Mana", but simply "did too much of activity X, it was taxing and now they are exhausted".

*** I think your rendition of the canon magic works is accurate - at least I can say I agree with everything you say about how it seems to work in the books.

The whole point of the fic I'm trying to write is my own curiosity about where and how the magic comes to be. To expand on the whole thing in detail without changing the outcome (-ish?). So it's bound to get a little more meta then "they just have it" - but I'm a biologist, so that's understandable. I look for answers. An infinite source of unimaginable power that you get from basically the void brings so many questions to mind that I can't even decide where to start on it.

I find your reasoning interesting. And don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be a bitch and argue for the sake of arguing, I really just want to discuss this peacefully. You kind of come off as if you were saying "it just is, don't go meta, just accept it".

If you have, as you say, infinite magic, it would be logical if in the beginning, everything you do with magic is wild and scary and uncontrolled, because you don't have control over it. This sounds a lot like accidental magic, but more volatile, so I can concede this is canon. But either the accidental magic goes away on its own (as we don't see adults having accidents), or at the very instant you pick up a wand. What happens or what changes there? Does your ability to do magic change the instant you get told "you're gonna have a magical education, just calm down now"? Is it puberty? Or do you kind of "tame" the magic by understanding it better? And what makes wantless or silent casting so difficult? What happens when you improve your skill in something? What changes?

These are the questions I'm looking to flesh out.

Those are interesting questions to ask, and I hope your answers makes for a good fic ;)

My point really is that a lot of the usual ways magical cores come into play eradicate one of the most wonderful parts of HP magic - the part where there is no limit by birth. Nobody is just born powerful. Your own efforts, interest and dedication bring you to power. It was a great message back when I first read the books.

Which also means I'm less argueing against them on a in-world logic, but more a meta-level where I critique them for being detrimental to the story and the feel of the HP world as a whole. You'll notice on my other posts that I have very little against extreme AUs otherwise.

My in-world take on all this is that the less your mind is driven by blind instinct (note: instinct, not emotion), the more you have it under control. A baby or toddler has bouts of accidental magic when very basic desires are threatened or unfulfilled. Children have them too, but less and sometimes they restrict their magic, but once they reach a certain age of maturity, they can be trained to control it better, with the final step being full maturity at (apparently) 17.

And as to where it comes from: Maybe from the same """place""" gravity and time come from? Maybe magic is just a force of the universe that so happens to concentrate in some people, animals, plants and objects. I don't know, but maybe you'll find an entertaining answer while writing.

**** I've always liked the idea of accidental magic being you trying to protect yourself essentially or responding to deep desires. Because little kids typically, for lack of a better explanation, feel things more strongly than older people, their magic manifests more often. Like comparing when your a little kid and when you get older being you get told you can't have a cookie but you really want a cookie. The little kids magic gets it. As you get older this happens less often. I also like likening it to belief. Wizard raised kids only see magic done with a wand and all magical kids get a wand at eleven being told “this is how you do magic” so the mere knowledge that you use wands and learn how to cast spells means your controlling your magic. I see wandless vs wand magic being like an artist using a shitty paintbrush and a high quality paintbrush. Both work but one works better with control. The wand being a conduit to help you shape direct and power your spells the way you want whereas wandless is more primal or basic.

*** The thing with infinite magic is that it makes the fic infinitely harder to write. I mean even JKR didn't really do the duels well. It's hard for an author to try and be clever in their usage of magic when they're trying to portray literal geniuses with unlimited power like Dumbledore or Tom.

Magic cores work as a bit of a crutch. Instead of having to come up with this crazy battle where two gods with infinite magic available to them get in a fight, you just have these two dudes who fight until one gets tired. It's a lot easier, and I think that's really the heart of why magical cores are common.

That plus some people wanna be like Brandon Sanderson and quantify the magic system.

** imo, everything is fair game as long as you integrate it well with a good explanation.

just try to avoid those “MAGICAL AWAKENING! MC'S POWER IS OVER 9000!!! ALL BOW DOWN TO THE MIGHTY GOD” cliche.... it's not bad, but so many fics use this badly that it just gives off a crap ton of warning signs about the fic's quality

*** Pre-determined strength is a weird concept to me too. It sends the wrong message, and an 11 year old noob OP wizard is a recipe for disaster anyway (chaos magic, doom). I'd rather they work or train to get better - and even that has a very resonable limit, like with athletes in real life. I'm leaning more towards the concept of capability increasing with age, but even that has to truncate at some point, and then you have to work reasonably hard to get better on top of that.

You do bring a valid point up by aptitude, thanks! It's only natural that some people are better at A, while others are good at B or C. Thanks for the pointers!

*** I always think of the core as a magic mussel. Some people are born with them just bigger then others, but it is possable to work them out and make them bigger and less resistant to stress (heavy use). When there is anything done in the real world one gets tired, so I think magic cores are good since they are just another mussel. I think that giving all things magic cores are a good idea (minus humans and squibs, since if someone is born without an arm they cannot use the arm mussel). For magic creatures and plants I would make how the core works differnt in the same way ours and hourses leg mussels are different. They are used differently.

Well thats my 2 cents.

***** *Mussel*

Mussel () is the common name used for members of several families of bivalve molluscs, from saltwater and freshwater habitats. These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams, which are often more or less rounded or oval.

The word "mussel" is frequently used to mean the bivalves of the marine family Mytilidae, most of which live on exposed shores in the intertidal zone, attached by means of their strong byssal threads ("beard") to a firm substrate. A few species (in the genus Bathymodiolus) have colonised hydrothermal vents associated with deep ocean ridges.

** There are various reasons for the instant cringe-fest which starts up at the mention of magical cores and I can honestly relate to most of those sentiments.

My thoughts on the concept and its inclusion are thus:

Firstly I think that most authors use them to somehow formalise the nature/working of magic and furthermore make it something quantifiable. It is already debatable, if even the formalising part is wise. I think one of the most magical things about the world of Harry Potter, is that you don't exactly understand how magic works. What's more, it is depicted as something unknowable. But even if you want to make it knowable, understandable, it is a worse mistake to make it quantifiable. That just creates the bad RPG/anime-esque easily understood power-levels, which can turn a fic into a bad shounen. Anyone should try to avoid that.

I've seen magical cores done in not instantly cringy ways, but that's rare, and no fanfics immediately come to mind.

If you wanna go with the body-is-a-conduit idea, go with it, but what I don't get is why do you need magical cores then. Invent your own terminology, and keep in mind that it pays to keep a lot of things vague. Gives you more freedom, and if you do it right it keeps magic magical. (I'd advise against the using the 'magical sight' trope though. That too, often feels like a shortcut for the MC to become God.)

I've seen various approaches to the interpretation of Harry Potter magic, but my favourite ones were always the ones which dealt with this inherent anomaly, with the unknowable-ness of magic. Also read Taure's guide to the canon magic system, it helps at to get an idea of what's there, and maybe will help you determine what do you want to change, where to elaborate, to expand. It is a very tempting to revamp the whole thing and then get to a point where 'Wizards (or maybe British Pureblood Stupid Wizards) just don't know how to magic', and that's very easy to fuck up -- I mean if you disregard canon, do it in a smart, believable way.

Takes on HP magic I liked (these are of the rare variety where 'wizards don't know how to magic' is done well):

HPMoR -- there was shitloads of obnoxious critique going around, but it was still well grounded.

Deal with the Devil -- the new take on wand dependency and the components of casting magic in general is also very interesting.

Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus -- here magic comes from the slow disintegration of reality. it is essentially reality-glitch manipulation (lol).

The Weapon -- here the magic sense / wandless magic thing is done reasonably not-terribly.

Another thing to consider when going the conduit route is that why are there muggles then? And why are there a lot of creatures, which don't have the muggle-wizard-duality? What determines if a life-form is a conduit or not? The more fleshed-out your system is, the more of these kinds of avenues you need to consider. If you go toward consistency, there should be consistency. ... I know I'm just rambling now, but I hope there are some helpful things here for you.

** Is it really relevant to the plot? Is it to explain why your character is suddenly so badass or weak? Or do you want to do some world building and explain magic in more detail? Frankly I like the idea of magic being ... well magical. Unexplainable. In some ways always unfathomable. I think person's magical strength is influenced by intelligence, strength of will and emotions. You can take any of these 3 "components" if you will and build your theory from there.

** I find it more of an easy way out. As it stands in canon, there is nothing that indicates why exactly some wizards are stronger than others, or why spells themselves have various degree of difficulty. Magical cores easily explain this by making it intrinsic to each wizard, much like Midichlorians in SW. I am not opposed to this idea per se, but I would like to see more interesting/creative ways of doing it.

*** For something I have been casually writing on/off, I explained the purebloods' idea of 'purebloods are better and stronger' as them simply being around magic and using it before they go to Hogwarts. The more you use magic, the more powerful you get.

In that passage, I compare it to regular muscles in the way that more exertion creates bigger muscles, whereas less usage causes atrophy.

Because muggleborns don't (or hardly) /actively/ use their magic before Hogwarts, they are weaker. However, since purebloods (in my mind) seem to have a tendency to be lazy, they use magic less when they get out of hogwarts, at which point the muggleborns are still in love with what magic can do, and are therefore using it more.

Beyond that, I find the idea that using more magic, to the point of exhaustion, a better way of showing who is more powerful or knowledgeable, instead of simply saying "Oh, I was born with a bigger magical core than you, therefore I am superior." I feel like that takes a way a part of what could be characterization.

** If you're describing magical cores like some sort of chakra kind of deal I don't mind; I might not believe in it, but some people do and some people experience things. So I guess, magical cores as a type of wizarding mysticism is cool, magical cores as midichlorians is not cool.

** In my headcannon. I think Magic is a force that gives the ability for someones mind to alter reality. Magic is just the the instability to allow it to happen. Some people are naturally attuned to magic and it allows them a easier time to manipulate this force. All wands do is give focus on the intent of how you are trying to manipulate this reality force. As more magic is used in an area the easier it is to manipulate the reality of that area. Conversely, even if the area is devoid of magic it really isn't. It is always there and present, just that magic is like a force of nature. And using wands allows them to be conscious of manipulating it. And a very few can do some very basic things like wandless summoning but that is all.

** [[/u/UndeadBBQ]] is the only unbiased person on this topic. :)

The main problem it they're treated as DBZ-style power levels that can be introduced so Harry has an immediate excuse for becoming OP. Not to mention they seem to go quite against the grain of how HP conceives of magic and magical power. In canon some wizards are at times said to be more magically powerful than others in some way that is not entirely unquantifiable, but making it just some ever increasing reservoir of magic sauce makes it feel way too concrete. Why can Harry do that awesome magic now? Intense emotion? Long study and practice? Nope, he just " unblocked his core".
