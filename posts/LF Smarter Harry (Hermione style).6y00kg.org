Hey Reddit. Hope you can help find some nice stories.

I don't get: - How Harry could know that Voldemort was after him, but doing nothing to research it - How he knows he's the BWL, but does nothing to research how or why - Knows he had a wizarding family, but asks zero questions about said family. - Enters an entirely new world, and doesn't seem to actually care. - Is being attacked by V and DEs, but doesn't even consider learning useful healing spells. - Is being threatened by a known DEs son (Draco), and doesn't bother to research potential enemies.

And so much more. His life is on the line, and he asks no questions.

So. I want a Harry had resembles Hermione. Someone who bothers to take notice of the world he's in, and asks questions.

I don't want him OP or dark, just smarter than he is now.

I mean, it wouldn't take much research to discover that his mum and Snape came from the same town.

One last requirement: the story must be completed.

Hope you can help :)


** I sympathize with you, as do many others. That's why there are thousands Indy!Harry fics that have him out researching Hermione.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620), is a short, but a very enjoyable story, and my favorite in the indy!Harry category. Another fic by the same author depicts a super!Harry with Hermione as his research assistant.

*** For completeness, the other fic mentioned is linkffn(10937871) and is also quite good, though much longer than Ruthless and not complete.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** The central concept in these fics is always wish fulfilment and everything else, especially the female characters exist to show how cool Gary Sue is. Having them acting as companions/damsels/trophies instead of people.

This is especially bad for Harry Potter fics because the female characters in Harry Potter are usually quite well written.

**** I don't like that genre either, but "Ruthless" was done very well.

I like the characterizations in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363), very much. Harry is of course intelligent, proactive, and strong, but the girls, even including Lavender and Parvati, have their own strengths and show good initiatives.

***** Well, he isn't at the start...I tried reading that twice and I reviewed some chapters for the writer and I always notice that Harry (maybe that changes later on!) is freaking lazy (canon is bad enough (Frankly I agree with Snape's assesment of Harry and that makes it even worse because I don't like Snape either, because while he isn't wrong he's also part of the problem with his pettyness and his grudges against dead people! (Lily and James, because I think that Snape didn't forgive Lily for selecting James either!)), but you can explain it away through Dursley abuse ("Don't you dare be better than Duddley at school or we will hurt you!"), not wanting to outshine Ron (who is a slacker, he might not be stupid but he's the prototype of the lazy jock who looks for a smart GF to compensate for that and do his homework!) or compete with Hermione (who is very insecure because people have trouble with her lack of social graces and her bossy behaviour) who probably wouldn't take it very well!)

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.

** I've wanted this for a while and still haven't found it. In my opinion the perfect story goes along the following lines:

-Harry takes ancient runes but not arithmancy (let's not get carried away here -Harry gets close to Bill and shows a massive talent for runes and wards -Harry is considered dark: parseltongue, someone should die in the chamber and dumbledore covers it up which raises questions. -Harry develops a close relationship with someone other than Ginny or hermione. I like the idea of a Slytherin like Tracey or daphne, but really just not the typical tropes. -in the end Harry realizes that no 17 year old is going to defeat someone with as much experience and training as Voldemort -Harry discovers a runic sequence that if someone willingly sacrifices himself for this he loves, a large explosion will take his life but also those around him (I.e the killer) -Harry goes into battle (with the deathly hallows) and when he makes sure there is nothing he can do to save him self he casts a ward and let's Voldemort kill him (Harry's scar-crux is already destroyed so he definitely does) -epilogue: whoever his love interest was is standing at the veil with the deathly hallows and says, "I am <insert name>, conquerer of death. And she steps forward into the veil.

So first I can't write well enough to make my story so idc if someone sees this and runs with it just tel me so I can enjoy. Secondly, I think the hunt for the horcruxes and deathly hallows can be a super interesting story if done right. Thirdly I imagined a group like Bill, Fleur, Harry, love interest, Neville as a group hunting them down. Finally, the wizarding world as a whole would likely think Harry is dark if he is to apply himself and still get involved in all his shenanigans if spun the right way, so his sacrifice is all the more heart wrenching.

Does he get pulled back through the veil? Who knows but that's a better epilogue instead of a child with the most unfortunate name Albus Severus.

*** Interesting, but if Harry is intelligent enough he might also get help (it's not like he has to fight Voldemort into submission! He just has to deal the killing blow! So in theory someone else could do the actual fighting (as long as Harry knows enough magic to cover that person's back and defend himself against the occasional spell coming his way!) and if no wizard can do it, then why not look elsewhere? There's the Veela, the Vampires, the Werewolfs etc. who all might help if he later uses his influence (he could, if he plays his cards right, be a second Dumbledore after all with tons of influence!) to help them? Well, at least it's a bargaining token!)

ps: I agree on the name (especially since neither Snape nor Dumbledore IMHO deserve forgiveness! Both deserve condemnation and having their reputation destroyed - both are abusers (Dumbledore is by proxy on multiple counts from the Dursleys to the "Potter Stinks" badges and even the smear campaign in the Prophet and Snape is directly!) and both wouldn't know how to be honest with other people and laying their cards on the table! They are only honest if forced to! Dumbledore is kind of responsible for every DE who got off on the imperius-defense, he is responsible for Sirius being locked up (I don't buy that he didn't know who the secret keeper was, especially since he probably cast the fidelius - it's not a well known piece of magic after all! Hell, even if he didn't know he should have called for "the traitor" being questioned with the potion, who knows what else a traitor might be guilty of after all?) etc. etc. - so no, they don't deserve forgiveness and no child deserves that horrible name! Tom Marvolo Riddle would be a nicer name, even if people knew about Voldemort's past!)

**** I've become even more disenchanted with dumbledore as I've read more. I don't know if JKR intentionally made him to be this super manipulative guy but I just don't buy that he had Harry's best interest at heart.

As for the ending yeah Harry could have had help for sure I just like the idea of him possibly dying to save everyone and defeat Voldemort. Too many fan fics end with a super easy victory for Harry which bugs me. Just my opinion
