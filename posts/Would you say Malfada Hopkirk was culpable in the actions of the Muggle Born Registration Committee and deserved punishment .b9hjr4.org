** She is the archetypical soulless bureaucratic Ministry minion.

In Nazi Germany, she would be one of those loyal state servants who dutifully reported Jews to the Gestapo and happily put them on the train to Auschwitz.

Too many such willing henchmen got off in postwar Germany, and I suspect she got off here too, by loyally serving her new master.

*** Exactly. You can't just start a genocide, Nazi-style, with a handful of Death Eaters. You need the Snatchers, the bureaucrats, the judges and the law-makers, and a significant part of the population being bigots already.

** She is the "I was just following orders" Type, but yes, she's culpable, unless there's any evidence that she sabotaged things where she could. She's in the sort of position where she could have warned Muggleborn by Muggle Post, without getting caught.

** Percy and Arthur continued to work at the ministry, as did many other wizards. I don't think it's something she can be punished for ultimately, otherwise the entire wizarding world would be punished

I don't think we know enough, or really anything about her to say whether she was a willing participant. I always personally presumed she was an unwilling member of the regime, quietly plodding along and keeping her head down. Not an evil person, not someone that hates anyone, but afraid and ultimately a coward. She wasn't received like Runcorn was and her polyjuice wasn't disgusting like Goyle and Crabbe, which indicates something about her character.

*** Exactly. You'd probably go quite a bit past what your moral compass says too when it's a situation where you'd fear for your and you families lives; it's the smart thing to do.

**** Yeah, although we can sit in judgement of her, the horrible, terrible reality is, how many would do any different? Knowing your life was on the line, knowing in particular that your family's lives were on the line. Experiments and even history have consistently shown that by far the majority conform.

Mafalda is unfortunately not distinct or different, but sadly an example of human fallibility.
