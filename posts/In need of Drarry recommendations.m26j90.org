So I've recently been looking for Drarry fics that start of as enemies, however, it's only a rivalry, Dracos isn't insensitive or an asshole. They flirt constantly and Draco continuously turns almost everything into a sexual matter so sexual tension is a must. I'd prefer if Snape was exceptionally sassy towards Harry. No Mpreg, MCD, suicide, eating disorders, heavy topics, rape, kinks or anything of the sort. Smut isn't required but it can be included, in that case, either both of them are switches or Draco tops.

If you know of a fic like this, please, I beg of thee, link it, whatever the platform, it doesn't matter.


** Maybe try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]? This request seems fairly specific and I cant think of any fics that fit.
