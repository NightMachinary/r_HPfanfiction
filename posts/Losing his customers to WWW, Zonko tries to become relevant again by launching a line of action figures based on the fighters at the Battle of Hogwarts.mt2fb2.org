There's a Harry Potter action figure, there's a Ron action figure, there's a Hermione action figure, there's even a Voldemort action figure which is quite controversial itself as no parent wants their children to play with Magical Satan Hitler. Each of these action figures have a button which enables the toys to shoot their signature spells. They don't work on people but for example action figure Harry's expelliarmus would disarm another toy and action figure Voldemort's avada kedavra would make another toy useless.

One day, Auror Harry gets called to a crime scene. Apparently a child was killed by a stray killing curse shot by his friend's toy Voldemort while they were trying to re-enact the final duel between Harry and Voldemort. There is no visible sign on the victim which indicates that it's indeed the work of a killing curse. The children are too young to own a wand so Harry concludes that the friend is telling the truth. He takes the toy Voldemort for investigation and he confiscates all the other Voldemort action figures.

After multiple tests, he confirms that the toy killing curses are inoffensive to humans and there's no malfunctioning toy, including the one considered responsible for killing the victim. But then how did the victim die?


** If it is inoffensive to humans, then one of the parents may have killed the child.

Or Harry's tests are flawed, because he tested it on himself and for some reason, though he doesn't realise it, he is immune to Voldemort's power, whether facsimile or real.

*** That's a good point... I didn't have that in mind. I was thinking of other causes such as George poisoning him with an untraceable poison or the Harry Potter action figure's disarming spell acting like in real life and redirecting Voldemort's curse back or even a disease or even George sabotaging the toy in that particular moment. There's no answer to it. Just looking for suggestions.

** The kid who dies wasn't a real kid, but an animated figure or golem like being who was made to cover up the real death of the kid.

** As a moral person, Harry Potter tested the toy killing curses on adults, because running murder tests on children is never okay.

What he doesn't know is that his life/love sacrifice at the Battle of Hogwarts, the one that prevented Voldemort's forces from harming all those in Magical Britain, did not apply to the babies born *after* the battle.

He's about to have a rough next few years as these unprotected children come of age.
