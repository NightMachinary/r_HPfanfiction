:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic a while back, it didn't have too many chapters but it was fairly long. It could have had six, but I doubt. Anyway, it was about Harry realising that he wasn't ageing and finding out he was the Master of Death. Harry was convinced by Tom that he wasn't actually the MOD. Eventually, a seer came to him and told him that a baby was the only one able to kill him. And Harry, liking his immortality, very regretfully kills the baby. He ends up meeting ghost Voldemort, looking like Tom, and Harry brings him back. As it turns out, the seer was actually working to bring Tom back. But Tom ends up killing her for trying to hurt Harry.

I remember that there ended up being smut, and Harry went to Grimmauld and visited an elderly Ron who was visiting the place.

If anyone finds that fic, I'll be very thankful.
