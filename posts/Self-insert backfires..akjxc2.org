** I feel like this is a request that's created in response to a lot of SI fics where the character just breezes through everything. Do a lot of those exist? Tbh I'm having trouble thinking of more than one or two SI fics of any sort...

*** Most aren't very good and they get a bad rap, so you don't really see them all that commonly if you're only reading highly recommended stuff and they've fallen out of favor in general since people realize that SI fics don't tend to gain popularity. And there are plenty that are pseudo-SIs, i.e. many fics where Harry crosses over to feeling like an author mouthpiece or Hermione is superwoman Mary Sue. Nowadays, if you see something specifically called an SI, then the author probably thinks that it's a good enough story to overcome the negative connotations of the trope. For whatever reason, Naruto fanfiction has a few more "good" SI stories.

Not a fanfic, but Worth the Candle is probably my favorite SI fic.

*** The only one that comes to mind is that Hufflepuff one that gets recommended a lot, but that doesn't have that problem.

In later chapters the SI definitely finds himself in some trouble with Voldemort... not saying anything else because spoilers :)

*** It wouldn't necessarily need to be the end of the story. I like seeing characters struggle against meaningful challenges, and challenges are not meaningful unless things go right when a character is unusually clever or skilled and go wrong when a character makes a mistake. If they overcome the challenge, great! If they don't, that possibility is part of what makes the challenge interesting.
