Usually im not the Malfoy/Hermione type. I cant imagine them even in Fanfiction or even if its just for the smut/lemon stuff. But i was imagining recently that they make a bargain with each other (or alternatively are "forced" to have a relationship by law or whatever, but the bargain thing seems to be better). The Malfoy i imagine, however, is not the arrogant asshole, but more the silent type. Hermione on the other Hand is blaming him for their Situation...or that he didnt do anything (or not enough) to avoid their Situation. He tries to calm and comfort her (but without any hidden agenda, he really wants to be "friendly" with her. One of the reasons might be to atone for his Behaviour in Schooltime). At some point, they are on the Point of sleep with each other and he is very considerate, a thing that she take by suprise. Its not really a Draco/Hermione Pair fic that im looking for, but they solve their fightings for years during such a situation.

As for Harry/Hermione, same situation. Both(or one of them) are arranging a bargain (to live with each other or some financial or whatever). Their Situation might be not so frustrating, but more embarassing. But also in this fic they sooner or later sleep with each other and (after a time) develop feelings or fall for each other. Doesnt matter if they are with their Canon Partners (married or engaged) or Single, i accept both.
