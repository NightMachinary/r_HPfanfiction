I always thought it was a bit boring that Harry was only a parselmouth because Voldemort somehow transferred it to him. Are there any good fics that explore other sources for the skill?


** There are definitely some out there that explain the parselmouth as because he's a descendant of Slytherin, either though Lily who was secretly the daughter of a squib of a lost line of pureblood wizards/witches or through James and the tangled mess that is wizard ancestry -- but those are usually in powerhouse all-knowing Lord Harry fics where he inherits a dozen other nobility titles as soon as he approaches Gringotts. The power trips can definitely put people off from those types of fics, though.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** Well this fic is one of my favourite HP Fanfiction. Here we get to see both Lily and Harry speak Parseltongue as Lily's grandmother was a squib from the Gaunt Line. The fic in overall is a good read especially the author's take on the Manipulative Dumbledore genre and the entire Voldemort killing Lily and James fiasco were my personal favourites here.

** *Stepping Back* linkffn(12317784)

It's said in here that it was in the Black Family line. Harry goes on to say that the new infusion of muggleborn blood cleansed enough of the inbreeding for his parselmouth (from his mother) or Tonks' metamorph (from her Father) abilities to show. Arcturus wasn't amused.

They didn't explore into it beyond that though.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
