** I posted a story on an alt account and one of my favorite authors was the first to post a review saying it was brilliant. So naturally i cranked out 10 thousand words the next day.

*** It's an amazing feeling isn't it? Happened to me too. One of my favourite authors reviewed my story a few days ago and it made my day. An icing on the cake was when I went and checked my Followers list, I realised that he had been following my story since 6 months ago. How cool is that?!

** I tend not to get many reviews on FFN, negative or otherwise. In fact, it's like a running gag for me whenever my fic gets mentioned here or elsewhere, because the title is always preceded by something like "underrated" or "overlooked" or "occult/esoteric/hidden-as-fuck" - even though it's been linked several times here (which I appreciate immensely).

Because of this, my favourite "review" of the year so far was posted here:

#+begin_quote
  I second The Untitled Tome. That shit is so cash.

  In fact while reading it I noticed something extremely strange. I usually don't care much for romance and almost skim through the relevant parts.

  However, in the Untitled Tome, the characters felt so lifelike and compelling, that I found myself giddy about crushes and hints of teenage romance.

  I can honestly say I'm reading this like a soap opera, just to see who ends up with who, the central plot is an afterthought at this point :D
#+end_quote

I never really considered that people might be reading my fic for vastly different reasons until finding this post, so many thanks to [[/u/T0lias]]!

*** You write The Untitled Tome? It's one of the most interesting AU's I've seen -- I love the current blood supremacy plotline.

** /wow. just... this... this story is great. dark, depraved, maniacal. See, its stories like this that are the reason i wade through mountains of crap on FF, just looking for these little gems. Cant wait to read more./ Always feels good to get a positive review, when I first started writing I expected a bunch of flames since my MC is pretty fucked up.

  How laughable, to be reborn a muggle in a world of magic, unknowing until it was too late. Now, muggle society lay in ruins; a wizarding golden age has begun. Once again reborn, she couldn't wait to burn it all down. SI/OC

** This one, by lejf on FFnet.

"I'm writing a long review, because you deserve it all, man. This is fabulous in all the right ways. Original, with the incorporation of interesting new elements but not quite enough to become overwhelming and unrecognisable of the original HP. Not to mention Harry's characterisation! A touch more cunning and jaded, with what comes with age and witnessing death and being locked up alone in the darkness, but still absolutely, absolutely recognisable as Harry in that his loyalty to his friends remains true.

We're also fed the subtle changes in the world as we go along, and it's lovely. The writing flows as though it's been painted over with a sheen, the imagery is probably richer than I am, and just. Wow. I'm blown away. I look forward to seeing you write more [... etc] "

While I do enjoy some hard concrit, I have to say it feels pretty good to be thoroughly praised.
