** Alan Rickman managed to put dry wit and humour into what was meant to be bitter and spiteful lines. Instead of being the most petty man we see what the movies get is the exasperated teacher, people can relate to his frustration with slow students and arrogant teens. You miss the sheer nastiness that book Snape has. Its been a long time since I watched the movies so I might be wrong here, but an example of his nastiness going missing is I don't think the Hermione hexed teeth thing happens in the movies. In the fourth book its one of the times Snape is a petty twat for no reason. A student clearly in distress is not even left to suffer but actively mocked.

*** I think a pretty good example of this is the "one might think you're... ^{up} , to something" line, which should've been a lot more Filch in motivation than the way rickman delivered it.

*** This also ends up fucking with how Harry's reactions /to/ Snape are characterized as well. In the books - at least in my opinion - Harry's resolute belief that Snape is being proactively evil or harmful, as well as his reactions to him, always felt like an extension of how adults treated him outside of school, which is to say poorly. For book Snape, this might not justify all of Harry's actions against him, but it does at least explain /why/. For movie Snape, however, a lot of Harry's actions can come out of it feeling far less motivated by his past adult interactions and more simply due to sheer childishness.

** 1) They chose an actor with charisma and a certain level of attractiveness.

2) They simplified Snape's character drastically, making him more noble on the one hand and comic relief on the other. There's never really a moment in the movies where you feel Snape could actually cross a line in viciousness. Also, Rickman's performance and styling allow for a vaguely aristocratic/Byronic interpretation, and a lot of fans are weak for magical aristocrats. I also think his age and solidity made him a less threatening figure.

3) He's a minor antagonist in the movies, up until the point where they romanticize his presence at Lily's death and pave the way for his redemption. His death scene is also softened up and his memories are visualized as tears for maximum pathos. In the same vein, I'd be surprised if people who only saw the movies understood what it meant that he'd been a Death Eater, and there's no clue at all that he provided Voldemort with the information that led to the Potters' murder.

Movie!Snape is drawn in broad strokes and follows a stereotypical mean-and-amusing-jerk-with-heart-of-mush storyline. I'm not a fan of the movies and avoid depictions of Rickman!Snape like the plague. Book!Snape is far more interesting: darker, more troubled, tense, spidery but also graceful, younger and angrier, more subordinate to Dumbledore, self-hating, actively malicious, obsessive and emotional in general, a child of poverty and violence who continues to interact that way with the world for the rest of his life, someone whose redemptive arc is better reflected by the line "Lately, only those whom I could not save" than by dying to expiate his guilt.

Book!Snape is difficult and at least somewhat complex; movie!Snape is a stock character played by a beloved (and much too old) actor.

** Alan Rickman.

And some scenes that did not make it into the movies. A lot of characters have character defining scenes missing when compared to the books. Snape is a good example, same as Hermione. But there are more. It is of course understandable that not every important scene from a book can make it into a 90 minute movie.

*** Yup, this.

A lot of Snapes genuine cruelty and abuse didnt make the movies.

For example, the time he told Neville that his potion would be fed to his pet at the end of class, and did so. If Neville had made the potion incorrectly, his pet would have died. So messed up.

*** He does have some actions in a similar vein, but you have to read between the lines a bit:

-refereeing the quidditch match in the first book to protect Harry. It's pretty clear he's incredibly uncomfortable, and he's dealing with the Twins and even Harry deliberately buzzing him or sending bludgers his way

-in the fourth book, after Harry snuck into the prefect's bathroom to use the egg, he dropped it causing a shrill female voice to absolutely SCREAM. Snape booked it up multiple floors, in his underclothes, ignoring an in progress theft of his ingredient stores, with no idea that it was actually Harry. He thought it was a student in need.

-in the sixth book, after Harry fucked up Draco in the girls' loo and Myrtle went screaming "help help attack murder", again Snape came roaring in, with no idea who was involved or what the situation was, just that a student was in trouble

-In PoA, while he doesn't stand directly in front of a werewolf, his presence at the shack has a bit more going on that 'wanted to catch Sirius/Lupin in cahoots". Basically he saw Lupin booking it on the map to the Womping Willow, knew that Lupin hadn't taken his potion, and thought that he was going to meet Sirius. So the prudent thing to do would have been to tell the Dumbledore and the other professors, or a dementor, or something, and. So why would he go into the tunnel, to confront two very dangerous people who he had good reason to fear? Because upon investigation he saw signs of a scuffle at the Willow and Harry's dropped cloak- he went to save the trio.

** Apart from what everyone has already mentioned, his redemption is much stronger in the movies. In the books, he cares only about Lily, and not her family, to the point where Dumbledore quite literally says "you disgust me." In the movies, he's distraught and wants to save the whole family. He begs Dumbledore. He seems like he'll do anything to help. And then he goes to the cottage and is weeping over her body...when he wasn't even there in the book.

Even Snape's Worst Memory is played so quickly that the focus is on James being terrible rather than what really mattered in that scene: his calling Lily a slur and ending their friendship.

** For me the main difference is in how movie!Snape was written as book!Snape sees himself.

Book!Snape believes himself to be sarcastic and quick-witted. He wants to look cool, collected and in control. He tries to look like he has presence, and that he basically is someone important and respected. And he fails miserably and hilariously at it, looking at best petty and petulant, or just spiteful and nasty. Even the way he walks around and speaks feels forced instead of natural. It makes him a bit of a drama queen, especially when you compare him to the genuine presence of McGonagall or Dumbledore. And he knows it, and that makes him all the more spiteful.

But in the movie all of that is played straight. Movie!Snape has presence ; when he speaks, people listen. He has genuine dry wit, and is always there with quick sarcasm looking composed and in control of himself at all times. Of course the visual medium helps at lot, plus Alan Rickman himself, but they are really written differently.

Movie!Snape is basically everything book!Snape dreams to be. He would be jealous if he could (or deluded enough to think that's really him). To me that makes book!Snape more interesting as a character (there's more to play with), but that's just opinion.

** I would say that -depending on mood- i like both parts. Give me evil bastard book!Snape, and i wont consider him ooc, and will happily root for his downfall. Give me sarcastic secretly!helpful and decent-but-still-a-grouchy-asshat!snape and i wont consider that ooc either. As long as Snape isn't suddenly sexy, smiling, loving, or anything of that sort, i will happily read about the 2 versions portrayed about him.

Though we know Snape is an asshat, so my headcanon is that he gave the marauders as good as he got, and both sides escalated things. And that James wasn't a bully. Then again im also firmly convinced Snapes doe patronus shows that its James he is in love with, and not Lily. (Because why the hell would a doe represent Lily, when it's James that is a stag animagus???)

** In addition to everything others have mentioned, I also don't think the movies really covered as much about why lily pulled away from snape so much. I'm a little fuzzy on the movies after so long, but I think the movies just mentioned that lily stopped being friends with snape and started dating james. I dont remember if they actually mentioned why that exactly was. While i do remember the books going into exactly why she pulled away from him, after he called her a mudblood to her face and then joined the death eaters and everything.

Its pretty condemning for someone to be actively racist and willingly join the wizard nazis even after his closest friend/supposed love tells him how bad of an idea that is and why, especially when said friend/love is the thing he's being racist against.

*** When it comes to Neville's boggart, the reason people are so against snape about that isn't just because neville is afraid of snape as a teacher of his. Yes many people are afraid of their teachers for no good reason at that age, but not usually to the point where they are their absolute greatest fear, especially if they have some other major trauma in their life like Neville with his parents.

** I mean the thing with Snape was it wasnt like Umbridge where it was this constant barrage of excessive awfulness the likes that had not been seen before this point.

Rather while he was cruel it was always small moment but it was just never ending and no escape. And because the books went through a whole year and gave you the experience of going through the year with Harry including the normal class experience you felt that with him. In every book in every year ( with the exception of 7). Movies have to be alot shorter there just wasnt the time to get this feeling to come across. There just isnt enough time for all those short scenes. And on top of that alot of his worst moments are cut out or take a more comedic edge. In book 3 he even does something actually heroic by jumping in front of the kids when he sees wolf Lupin.

Sure he is still Nevilles boggart but you see very little of Neville being bullied by Snape before that. While in the book when this happen youd seen alot of it already in passing in the background it doesnt have the same impact hes not as frustrating. He just seems like a bit more strict. Hell apart from book 1 and 5 his grudge rarely comes up.

** I'm almost certain that my personal view of Snape (being mostly sympathetic with his unfortunate upbringing and considering him redeemed DE-wise in the end -- but not really a fan of his behaviour as a teacher, but not to the point of "he is evil" like some) is a result of me reading the books over a decade ago and watching the movies only a year ago as the most recent time.

Movies remove a lot of the scenes portraying his cruelty. It also /added/ a scene that shows the opposite -- the Lupin protection scene.

This, however, doesn't mean that I don't acknowledge some of the things he did in the books at all. It simply means that, while I like reading stories featuring Snape -- if they're going to portray his behaviour as similar as his worst offenses in the book, I'm not interested in reading it. I prefer seeing him owing up to it (if acknowledged at all) and generally behaving as he did in the movies.

There's also another common reason that is completely irrelevant to me: a lot of people have a hard-on for Alan Rickman. While I think his acting is good, I don't really care for Alan the actor beyond the fact that he does the job well here.
