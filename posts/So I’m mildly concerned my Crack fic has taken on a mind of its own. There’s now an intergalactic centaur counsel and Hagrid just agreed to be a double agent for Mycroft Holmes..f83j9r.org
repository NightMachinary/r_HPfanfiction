I'm half way through writing the next chapter and Harry is teaching a Legion of gnomes to do the Macarena every time Charlie Weasley's Quidditch team scores a goal. I think I may have let the plot bunnies get out of control. I need help ! Please call J.K. Rowling or Animal Control! I'm strongly considering giving Neville an Enchanted tiger named Galileo. Please help it's already 40000 words !

**** Dude this fic is probably going to just keep going, It has 42 chapter already and I don't think it's going to be done for another 100 or so, but if you Eventually do read it let me know what you think of the gnomes.

****** As the author I'm kind of bias but I would Recommend getting it a try, most people know by chapter 14 or so if they Will enjoy the fic or not . After Chapter 14 if it isn't making you laugh then you probably won't enjoy the rest of the story. I hope you do give it a read!

******** The ghost of James Potter and Sirius Black are both on the The board of governors for Hogwarts. I've already got these chapters written just, lets just say Snape is a big part of Harry's Hogwarts experience, he won't be leaving the school but that doesn't mean that James, Sirius ,and even Harry won't have a hell of a time messing with Severus. Everything will be have to Be Lily approve of course but pranks and a few other things maybe in the works. Just wait, the Holmes boys are going to put the Marauders to Shame,
