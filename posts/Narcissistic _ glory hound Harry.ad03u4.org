As far as I know, neglected and abused children sometimes develop this as a coping mechanism. Are there fics where Harry is full of himself and wants the world to acknowledge it? Can be anything from a harmless version of Lockhart to full-on malignant Tom Riddle 2.0. The 7th Horcrux is a great example, but I've already read it.
