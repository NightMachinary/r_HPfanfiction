:END:
I think Harry was visited by his guardian angel or something? They said he only had 24 hours to screw around so he went back and threw a bunch of names into the goblet, one of them was Barty Crouch I think, and definitely Rita Skeeter. Except a first year Hufflepuff of the same name had to compete. And then I think there is an epilogue, where the angel visits Harry again in June and Harry says hey thank you but I don't need a wish, my year was actually a glorious mess and I loved every second of it, but thanks for offering anyway or something along those lines.

** I'd have loved someone to put Lucius' name in that shit, let him sweat a little bit. Also provides a subplot that includes someone less careful than Snape who might let slip that his Dark Mark is getting clearer.

** I would have put Ron's name in too. That temper tantrum he threw should allow him some of the dange- err... I mean spotlight. Yes, that one.
