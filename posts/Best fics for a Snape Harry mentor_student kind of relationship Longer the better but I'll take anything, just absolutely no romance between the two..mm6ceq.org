I find that Snape mentoring or even growing close to Harry as a guardian figure is usually my favourite dynamic in HP fics, slowly going a little soft for or warming up to James' son who Snape hates at first, only to find that he's perhaps more like Lily or simply letting go of old grudges and seeing him as his own person.

Bonus points if it's Slytherin!Harry, also, the dynamic doesn't need to be the main element as long as it's still featured! Even more bonus points for Fem!Harry but that's certainly not necessary still. ^^

Any length is okay but longer the better, and as mentioned in the title, please don't recommend a problematic relationship, and ideally I'd prefer little to no romance in general. I'd certainly prefer to avoid most explicit elements as well.

I've read To Shape and Change and Prince of Slytherin.

Thank you!

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  When Harry finds an injured Snape on his doorstep and must hide him from the Dursleys, he has no idea that this very, very bad day will be the start of something good.Harry and Snape are thrown together by annoying relatives, a series of strange dreams, and Voldemort's latest hunt for Harry, but their greatest challenge may well be surviving each other. This will be a long summer unless the two can find a way to work together. A slow-burn enemy-to-mentor story. Alternate 6th summer (and part of the school year): post-OotP; ignores HBP and DH. No slash, no romance. NOW COMPLETE!

** I second the rec of The Pureblood Pretense, that's a great series.

If you don't mind outright guardian Snape (and self recs) I have a Slytherin female Harry series where she is adopted by Snape pretty early on. It's a completely gen series, no romance, and it starts in the first year.

Linkao3(Swiftly Falling Snow)

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** If you're ok with older fics that were started pre HBP, I recommend Harry Potter and the Enemy Within and its sequel, HP and the Chained Souls. They work together and develop a mutual trust and respect, but don't always get along. It's a natural sequel to OotP and one of the few that doesn't have to rewrite pre existing canon to make it work. There's little to no romance and absolutely no Harry/Snape. Linkffn(3417954)

The Pureblood Pretense and it's sequels are awesome, you should totally read those as well!

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.
