Write a short fic in which Harry, Sirius, Fred, and George are all in the Wizengamot and essentially prank their way into reforming the government.

*REQUIREMENTS:*

- Short scene, 200+ words
- Harry, Sirius, Fred, and George are all members of the Wizengamot somehow
- The four of them work together to pass various reforms and rights

*BONUS POINTS FOR:*

- Remus being exasperated and/or embarrassed
- a non-OOC Luna being cited as Harry's lawyer
- The four of them gaming the rules of the Wizengamot
- Filling their proposals with so much blatant innuendo that people vote for whatever they're talking about just to shut them up
- Sirius just walking into the Wizengamot and acting like he's not supposed to be in Azkaban for murdering 13 people


** "... and so, as you can see, the only solution we have to the homeless werewolf problem is to restrict the vicious half-breeds from Diagon Alley entirely." Umbridge smirked smugly as the majority of the Wizengamot nodded thoughtfully. And then-

"I have a counterproposal!"

"Lord Potter has the floor."

Harry stepped onto the central floor. "So, as you've heard, homelessness for lycanthropes is a real issue. The problem here, though, is that we fail to think of them as our citizens. Werewolves are only wolves on the full moon, people! Even /muggleborns/ know that! The rest of the time, it /literally does not matter/. This," Harry brandished a scroll, copies of which appeared in front of each member of the body. "Is a law that says such. Pass it."

Silence for a moment.

"yeesh, tough crowd."

Suddenly two voices rang out in unison. "We have a counterproposal!"

Chief Warlock Marchbanks sighed. "Lords Weasley and Weasley have the floor."

The Twins each bumped one of Harry's fists on their way to the floor. "Our proposal is thus:"

"Clearly, the problem here is werewolves not having jobs. Now, normally we'd ask why that was,"

"But we're /wizards/, we don't worry about silly little things like reasons. We deal with /solutions/. Our solution?"

"The first ever,"

"Ministry-sponsored,"

The words "Werewolf Brothel" were spoken with such an elegant harmony, that not a word was spoken for a full ten seconds. Just as Lord Greengrass opened his mouth to object, the Twins continued talking.

"See, we've got us some statistics from good old Mister Ollivander,"

"On the subject of average... /wand size/ in relation to certain demographics."

"This includes muggleborns, half-bloods, purebloods, lycanthropes, and anyone of magical creature descent."

"Interestingly enough, werewolves have purebloods beaten by an average of two inches."

"That's five centimeters of solid wood, ladies and gentlemen!"

"We also have it on good authority that werewolves have increased endurance and larger than average trouser snakes."

The Chief Warlock, along with the now-reddened Wizengamot, let out a gasp. "Lords /Weasley/!"

"Your Chief-Warlockiness, we only present the facts!"

"Nonetheless, Lords Weasley, please try and restrain yourselves!"

"Yes, ma'am."

The Twin on the right brandished a scroll, a copy of which appeared in front of every Wizengamot member in the room.

"This beautiful bit of parchment right here,"

"Is the permit and funding paperwork,"

"For the Ministry-Sponsored Werewolf Brothel,"

"to Weasley Wizarding Wheezes,"

"Affectionately Titled,"

"/The Bestiary/"

A voice rang out from the back. "I have a counterproposal!"

"Lord Black has the floor."

Sirius fist-bumped the Twin as he made his way to the floor.

"People, people, people. The real problem is that we're allowing these /beasts/ to infiltrate our society. Locking them out, giving them rights, forcing them to have sex for money to fund the government, these are all the things they /want/ us to do! We need to show these monsters who's in charge of this country! This," Sirius brandished a scroll. Everyone in the room now had three scrolls. "Is a wonderful form I found in the Archives, filled out to grant one Sirius Orion Black full authority to use the Killing Curse and Other Dark Spells to cull the growing werewolf population."

"I have a counter-proposal!"

"Lord Potter has the floor."

"C'mon, people, violence is never the answer - unless we have a psychotic mass-murdering snakeman on the loose, which we don't, so it's still not - what we need to do is /educate/ them. Teach them how not to become a psychotic mass-murdering wolfman, and actually become a constructive member of society. This," Harry waved a fourth scroll, "Is the paperwork for funding said school, including facilities, teachers, and supervisors, it would cost us about 2 billion galleons."

"We have a counterproposal!"

"Lords Weasley and Weasley, I apologize but we have reached the counterproposal limit for this issue. WIll everyone who supports the initial proposal light their wands?"

about 20 wand-lights shined in the body.

"The proposal fails. Will those who support the first counterproposal light their wand?"

About a quarter of the room lit up.

"The second counterproposal?"

Five wands were lit - Harry's, Sirius', The Twins', and one man in the back of the room.

"Lord Warren what the fuck-/Ahem,/ will those in favor of the third counterproposal raise their wand?"

about a third of the room's wands lit up. "No proposal or counterproposal was passed. What is the next topic?"

"Werewolf rights."

"Lord Potter we just did that."

"No, we just did Werewolf Homelessness. This is Werewolf Rights."

"You cannot propose the same bit of legislation twice in a session of the WIzengamot, Lord Potter."

"I know, I changed the name of it."

The Chief Warlock sighed. "Lord Potter has the floor."

Harry stepped back onto the floor. "Well, you guys have heard about this," a fifth scroll appeared, "but I changed the name, see? Before it was '/Werewolf Rights Act/', now it's the '/Werewolf Rights Act: The Movie/'."

"Lord Weasley would like to make a motion to go directly to the vote!"

"Lord Black seconds the motion!"

Griselda Marchbanks sighed. "All in favor of the proposal?"

About a quarter of the Wizengamot lit up.

*==========[ 8 HOURS LATER]==========*

"This one is titled '/The Vote-For-This-And-I'll-Let-You-Go-Home-Already-Unless-You-Lot-Actually-Want-A-Werewolf-Brothel Werewolf Rights Act of This Shouldn't Even Be A Problem/' I also had an opportunity to spellcheck everything this time."

"Motion to vote."

"Seconded."

"All in favor?" sighed the Chief Warlock tiredly from under a massive pile of creatively-titled scrolls.

Funny enough, that one passed.
