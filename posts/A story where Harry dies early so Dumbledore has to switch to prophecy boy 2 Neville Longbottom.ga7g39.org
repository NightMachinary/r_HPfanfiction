Since Neville Is quite fitting to prophecy I though it would be interesting.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

** That wouldn't make sense even if you consider the prophecy not to be self-fulfilling because Neville haven't been marked by Voldemort.

*** Might remember that prophecies are fluctuating thing, nothing in the Prophecy says that the Dark Lord is Voldemort, Nothing say that Harry would be the Chosen one, LV could have "marked" Neville years later in another fight even with Potter already being "marked" and in the case Op asked being already dead.

All of this to say that even if LV already marked HP, if he thinks that Longbottom is his equal and marked him after Harry's death the Prophecy would still work, "The power he knows not" is super vague so it's doable no?

**** Couldn't be because the power he knows not is a mother's sacrifice, and Alice would be hard pressed to sacrifice shit in the state she is. At the end of the day either you consider the prophecy to be self-fulfilling (which is all but stated in canon) in which case replacing Harry makes no sense, or you take it at face value and the part that Voldy doesn't knows about should still happen if he marks Neville.

***** Always thought that the theory about the power he doesn't know being mother's sacrifice was completely bollocks or Rowling forgot herself.

Riddle and death eaters butchered tons of family where parents must have sacrificed themselves for their kids and it didn't save them from the killing curse or way of dying. So either the concept is true and it only worked for Lily and Harry because of protagonist plot armor, or it's not the mother's sacrifice and Lily was just a brilliant witch where she managed to trick Voldemort into a magic pact where he could only kill one person is the room without him realizing what he agreed to respect, and when he chooses to kill Harry after killing Lily, the pact interferes and the Killing curse bounce toward him, end of story.

****** Do you really think Voldemort would often go in person to people house to kill kids ? And even if he did he wouldn't give the mother a choice, so Lily's sacrifice is not unrealistic.

******* True, but it doesn't need to Voldemort or any deatheater, someone sacrificing themselves for another loved one is something that must have happened before in the magical word prior 1981, and they (and we the readers) never hear anything about the saved one being unkillable because of the sacrifice, Rowling never made true rules for her Magic system, so we don't know if Lily's sacrifice is something that is reproductible or a one case scenario, that why I don't really agree on the concept of the power he doesn't know is the mother's sacrifice, especially as it only helped Harry to protect himself against Voldemort and not "vanquish the Dark Lord".

******** The reason Voldemort can't kill Harry is because Lily sacrificed herself for him. Voldemort hadn't intended to kill Lily because Snape asked him not to. Lily refuses to step aside despite being given the choice to survive. That's how Harry is protected by his mothers love.

****** No, it's that Lily was given a choice, which is a theme of the series.

******* I prefer when Lily uses ritual magic to create sacrificial protection for Harry, much more believable than some random play on their conversation having by chance created that because Voldemort was on a good mood to give her a chance to become Snape's prisoner.

**** Exactly, the prophecy is quite vague so Voldemort actually never had a clue about the "true" depositary of it. In fact he marked Harry by chance if younthink about it

** linkao3(The Ilvermony Champion) is one where this has been assumed to be true. Harry and Lily show up for the Tri-Wizard tournament as part of Ilvermony's delegation.

It bogs down in politics at points though.
