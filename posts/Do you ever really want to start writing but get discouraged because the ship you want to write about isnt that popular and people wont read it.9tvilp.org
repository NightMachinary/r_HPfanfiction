Well, the people interested in it will, and they are your target audience after all. You don't want some hardcore canon shipper to read it and leave a review telling you that Harry belongs to Ginny instead of having a triad relationship with the Patil twins because that's not their OTP.

You can get a lot of attention with background ships as long as you "market" things correctly (and your story allows for that).

Take my own "No Longer Alone" as an example. Harry/Lisa Turpin (who?) as a pairing and still nearly 1000 favourites and over 1500 follows. And why? Because the story also includes popular characters so it automatically gets more exposition than without those involved. The "Harry P" tab updates very quickly, no one checks "Lisa T" regularly, but "Andromeda T" and "N. Tonks" are also pretty popular and do not have that many stories, which means you stay on page 1 of the results way longer.

The pairing choice was inspired by "Call Me", which, in my opinion, is a great story and, despite a similar length and being around 3 years longer, only sits at 422 favs and 310 follows. And I am willing to bet that the main reason is that the author did not include popular characters besides Harry.

Tl;dr: Try to fit Harry in somehow, that gets you a lot of potential attention which "Milicent/Marcus Flint" won't get. Additionally, try someone popular in the fandom like any of the Black Sisters, Tonks, Sirius (or Snape and Malfoy if you want attention from that crowd).

** Don't give up. Even if the majority of the community won't read doesn't mean nobody will. That and some may find this ship interesting after reading your story. I know I didn't care for HP/KB before and after a fic where it was well done well here I am.

** The Harry Potter fandom is so large and diverse that there's always SOMEONE who wants to read just what you've written, be it an X-rated multi-kink ficlet starring Uncle Vernon and Dobby, or a 500,000 word chaste slow burn between Padma Patil and Terry Boot.

That said, I did once write an obscure pairing in another fandom. I started with the knowledge that only a few people would read it. And only a few people did--- but they were the best sort of readers who always left thoughtful reviews. More importantly, I got the story out of my system and wound up with a fully developed headcanon that enhanced the source material for me.

There are lots of good things you can get out of writing. The pseudo-validation of thousands of favorites and follows is just one, and not necessarily the best.

** Sometimes it's ok to write for yourself and not at all for others. I wrote a Padma/Astoria fix for a challenge and it's a piece of work I'm really proud of, though obviously it's my least read fic by far.
