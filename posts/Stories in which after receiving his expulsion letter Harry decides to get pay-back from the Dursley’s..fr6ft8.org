Something like, in fifth yer Harry received the letter from the ministry. His uncle and aunt are gloating and then he goes like: Oh well, nothing to lose. And promptly curses the hell out of them, maybe actually kills them or crucios them. After this he would probably have to run away from the country, but to be fair, Hogwarts is the only home he knows and he was expelled from it, so not much to stay in Britain for.


** I read this as Harry gets back-pay from the Dursley's and my mind went somewhere completely different.

This story does involve an element of Dursley baiting, at least in its opening chapters.

** I'm now imagining a scene where, upon learning that Harry's been expelled and assumedly has nothing to lose from hexing them, Petunia and Vernon (and Dudley) panic and think that Harry's actually going to do it. Cue a screaming panic that wakes up the neighbours, just in time for a couple of Ministry wizards to swoop down on the house...

*** Would be funny at the Dobby incident at the summer between first and second year if they had known beforehand that Harry couldn't use magic during the summer.
