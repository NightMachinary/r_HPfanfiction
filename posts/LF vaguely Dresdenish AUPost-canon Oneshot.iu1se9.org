Hi, wondering if anyone here can help me find a oneshot I vaguely remember. Pretty sure it was on ff.net or Ao3, maybe DLP, but searching hasn't turned anything up.

As I recall, it's massively AU, but being a oneshot much of the backstory was only hinted at. Harry and Ron were killed in the war against Voldemort, who remains in power. Draco Malfoy is now part of the resistance alongside Hermione, who has undergone a massive personality shift due to the situation. Draco becomes suspicious of Hermione's willingness to take drastic action and changes in behavior, snooping around her room in Grimmuld Place. He discovers her notes hidden in a polarized mirror, which reveal that she's researching a Dresden-style bloodline curse that'll wipe out all purebloods, revenging herself. Forgot how it ended, perhaps reading it again will jog my memory.
