:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am searching for a fic that stranded Hermione and Severus in a world without magic. They also only remember sometimes little bits on there search for what happened to them.

I really like the Fiction and would love to read it again

  She knew it wasn't good for her, standing here like this, waiting for something that wasn't there to appear. Something spectacular to happen between misnumbered houses. Something to prove that magic was real. Eventual SS/HG. AU with purpose.
