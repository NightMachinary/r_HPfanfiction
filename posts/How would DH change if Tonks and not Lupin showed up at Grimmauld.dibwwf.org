Having an Auror along would be a boon, even if she'd have to leave a few months in to give birth. Because let's be honest, the dynamics of the encounter would drastically change if the trio was comforting a deserted, pregnant wife compared to what happened canonically. Telling a runaway husband to get his head out of his arse and beg his wife for forgiveness is a lot different than telling a woman who has just been left by her husband to wait for him to return. Comforting Tonks would probably boil down to "he showed his true colours, you're better off without him". Which might not necessarily be the truth, but while comforting someone, objectivity isn't what matters the most.

Obviously the outcome also depends on if and when Lupin shows up, but I feel that almost any scenario between the trio and Tonks would widen the rift between her and her husband.


** Hmmm depends. I think you're only looking at it from one point of view and it's not called canon.

Harry in canon was pretty wise by that point, because plot required him to be. He would probably try to talk Tonks into forgiving Remus for his moment of weakness and seek him out, so that they can be proper parents to the little spawn in her belly. Canon-wise it fits. Harry was all about compassion and forgiving faults. Hell, he even saved Draco Malfoy's life while the little shit almost brought the whole war down by following Ron, Hermione and him into the RoR. Just because Draco wanted to be informed and wanted to find out what Harry was doing. There are more examples in the DH that show Harry's immense compassion and frankly insane level of trust, good will and the belief that the best thing in the world is love, especially familial love.

TL;DR If you consider Harry's canon personality, he would most likely try to persuade Tonks to find the father of her baby and make a proper family.

*** He wasn't the only one around. I can easily see Hermione take charge of the situation since she can be rather pushy and lacks social grace. She also has a vindictive side (eg Marietta) and can be cold as ice (eg Umbridge's fate in the forest and not giving a fuck about her).

Also, Harry reacted very negatively to Lupin's desertion due to the reasons you have stated. He wanted Teddy to have a family. However, if Tonks and not Lupin was there, that might manifest a little differently than what you have predicted because due to his attention on family, he could easily react negatively if he was comforting the other side. He could be very cold at times if he is on the "betrayed" side. He wanted to have Pettigrew kissed by the dementors after all, a fate worse than death and a horrible act to witness.

**** All good points.

I can counter the Hermione one with the fact that in DH she took her ques from Harry, not even from Dumbledore (Godric's Hollow for instance) so she might be mum on the subject, but I agree your argument has some merit, but I don't think it's enough. Harry was clearly the leader and his viewpoint would be considered the most prevalent (Ron is a non-entity in such matters, as canon basically makes him a non-entity in DH anyway).

Although you have a point, I don't think Hermione's influence would be strong enough to work against Harry's convictions.

Your idea could have merit, if Harry didn't have any relationship to the spawn. If, for example, Tonks came to them in Grimmauld Place and didn't tell them that the child was Remus' (which would remove any emotional attachment Harry could have) then I can believe Harry just comforting Tonks. If he thought that the father of her child didn't want anything to do with it, he might get all-holier-than-though on the issue (as he did with Remus in the DH).

Well, if Tonks told the story, that would logically be the picture she would paint. Harry might have been somewhat sympathetic because he could guess that Lupin left because he wanted to protect his child from the werewolf curse (misguided as that was). But if Tonks showed up alone after Lupin has been gone for a week, possibly without even a note, well, that looks a lot different.

****** It's a bit wishy-washy scenario you paint. Why would Harry believe Tonks, whom he knows very briefly, over Remus who he knows as a good man, even if prone to weakness? I would think he would treat Tonks like Remus, but in a different way:

"So you want you child to raised without a father? Do you think Remus would abandon you truly? Go see him and pour some reason into that thick skull of his! The child deserve both of his parents! I won't let anyone to be left an orphan again!"

Harry's compassion and reasoned logic in DH was so OOC for Harry before that it beggars belief.

Although, as I think about it, yeah. If his arguments didn't work and Remus remained to be a dick, because he was confronted by Tonks and not by Harry, I can see your argument working. But it would require Remus to disavow his child in some way. Which is unlike canon, but possible in the right circumstances.

******** Despite all of Remus' shortcomings, Harry still considered him a part of the family, as did Remus. He did name Harry godfather to Teddy after all. So that point is moot. Harry deeply cared about Remus regardless of all his issues.

Hermione is a tricky subject for me, because her depiction in canon is so inconsistent, that I can't get a good read on her. She's the intellectual friend in the first 5 books, completing the traditional trinity trope of the King (Harry), the intellectual (Hermione), and the doer/worker (Ron). How she would behave in the DH is beyond me, she was mostly used to cast spells and not progress the plot.

As to horrible characterizations, yeah. They were. It's like JKR didn't know how to write a war. :D

Risking his life many times over went well beyond fulfilling any debt to Dumbledore. If he was continuing the fight after so many years of being ignored by Dumbledore, it was because he believed in fighting for the cause of defeating Voldemort.

** Maybe. If she had lost the baby /and/ broken up with Remus, then they might make use of her or have her along.

But Harry, Ron and Hermione are all still young people who have various close attachments and guilt to their mothers. (Ron who spends a lot of time with his, Hermione who feels guilty about not being closer to hers and what she has done to her, and Harry who had his ripped from him.) I can't see any of them encouraging a young mother to leave her newborn to risk her life when they have already spent months planning to be a three-piece and when they have been a three-piece for the vast majority of the other threats they have faced - and a three piece actively ostracized by the Order adults, at that.

**** We aren't talking about leaving Teddy behind. Teddy wouldn't be born for another 7 months. And his future depended on the success of Harry, so joining him is the safest way to ensure that he won't grow up in Azkaban or randomly killed. At least until the end of winter, Tonks would be a boon for them. She can always leave if the stakes get too high or if she is too far along to be useful.

** I think DH would be almost the same, because I don't think they'd let Tonks come along. Harry already tried to convince Ron and Hermione not to join him at first because he didn't want to put his friends in danger. As useful as having an auror along would be, I doubt Harry could justify endangering a pregnant woman and her unborn child.

If Tonks were to suggest she join the group, Harry would think it was a good idea for a second, and then realize that he was asking a pregnant woman to go on a mission that would likely end in her death. The group would regretfully refuse Tonks' offer of help, and encourage her to go home, knowing full well that they were passing up a valuable resource.

Since Lupin didn't get the chance to get yelled at by Harry, it's reasonably likely that he wouldn't go back to Tonks. The first time they see each other might even be at the Battle of Hogwarts, which now gets additional family drama as Percy returns at the same time.

They were endangered either way. Death Squads roamed the land. Umbridge was running the racial hygiene committee, which deported people if found guilty. Tonks' (and Lupin's) best bet at ensuring their child's future was to fight, as odd as that might sound.

**** He knows it's dangerous in Magical Britain at the time. But it's more dangerous to directly associate with him.

Harry wants to protect the people he loves, and to do so he tries to push them away. We see this time and time again. He broke up with Ginny to keep her safe. When he was told the Polyjuice plan, he didn't like it at all and didn't want his friends to risk their lives for him. When he arrived at the Weasley's in DH, he wanted to leave immediately because his very presence was putting them in danger. He initially wanted to go Horcrux hunting alone, because he didn't want to put Ron and Hermione in danger.

I highly doubt Tonks wouldn't leave. If she insisted, the group would likely tell her that Dumbledore wanted it that way, that it had to be just them. If Harry said that he needed to do something that Dumbledore ordered him to do, and that Tonks couldn't help, I think Tonks would acquiesce. The Order still greatly trusted Dumbledore's judgement even though he was apparently wrong about Snape.

***** I feel like you can easily justify a break with previous doctrine after the horrendous flight from Privet Drive. Their plan betrayed, Moody dead, Dumbledore's plans and judgement proven wrong at least 4 times (Sirius and Pettigrew in 81, keeping Harry dark in 95/6, Malfoy's harmlessness and Snape's loyalty) and the remaining Order useless or neutralised. And Lupin's desertion as a more personal one.

It would be easy to argue for Tonks to join them. Here are just two possible arguments:

"So only you can defeat Voldemort. Alright. But my child's future depends on your success, and I could undoubtedly help you. If you fail, I will still be killed. So the safest thing to do for my child is to join you, as you are the key to my child's future."

"So you want me to go back home and hope that you succeed in your mission? So I shouldn't fight for my child's future but rely on a plan made by a man who was wrong more often than right?"
