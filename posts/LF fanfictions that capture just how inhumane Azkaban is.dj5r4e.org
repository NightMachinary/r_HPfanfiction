Chapter 62, Harry speaking to Dumbledore

#+begin_quote
  "Tell me something. What does a government have to do, what do the voters have to do with their democracy, what do the people of a country have to do, before I ought to decide that I'm not on their side any more?"

  The old wizard's eyes widened where he stared at the boy with a phoenix upon his shoulder. "Harry... are those your words, or the Defense Professor's -"

  "Because there has to be some point, doesn't there? And if it's not Azkaban, where is it, then?"

#+begin_quote
  And that was when Harry heard it.

  It was faint, and it grew louder with every step they took forward.

  A woman's voice, distant, indistinct.

  His ears, automatically, strained to make out the words.

  "...please don't..."

  "...didn't mean..."

  "...don't die..."

  Then his brain knew /who/ he was hearing, and in almost the same moment, figured out /what/ he was hearing.

  Because Professor Quirrell wasn't there to keep the silence any more, and Azkaban was not, in fact, silent.

  Faint the woman's voice, repeating:

  "No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"

  "No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"

  It got louder with every step Harry took, he could hear the emotion in the words now, the horror, the remorse, the desperation of...

  "No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"

  ...the woman's worst memory, rehearsing over and over again...

  "No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"

  ...the murder that had sent her to Azkaban...

  "No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"

  ...where she was sentenced by the Dementors to watch whoever she'd killed, die and die and die in an infinite repeating loop. Though she must have been put in Azkaban recently, from the amount of life left in her voice.

  The thought came to Harry, then, that Professor Quirrell had passed those doors, heard those sounds, and given not the slightest sign of disturbance; and Harry would have called it a positive proof of evil, if Harry's own lips hadn't remained silent in the presence of Bellatrix, his breathing regular, while something inside him screamed and screamed and screamed.
#+end_quote

And a few chapters later:

#+begin_quote
  "What was that place?" Harry said hoarsely, in a voice pushed out of his throat like water forced through a too-thin pipe, in the darkness it sounded almost as shattered as Bellatrix Black's voice had been. "/What was that place? That wasn't a prison, that was HELL!/ "

  "Hell?" said the calm voice of the Defense Professor. "You mean the Christian punishment fantasy? I suppose there is a similarity."

  "How -" Harry's voice was blocking, there was something huge lodged in his throat. "How - how could they -" /People/ had built that place, someone had /made/ Azkaban, they'd made it on /purpose/, they'd done it /deliberately/, that woman, she'd had children, children she wouldn't remember, some judge had /decided/ for that to happen to her, someone had needed to /drag/ her into that cell and lock its door while she screamed, someone fed her every day and walked away /without letting her out/ -

  "/HOW COULD PEOPLE DO THAT?/ "

Although part of the story focuses on how Harry and his interactions with Draco, it's just as much focused on him and his interactions with Azkaban as an institution. It left me shaken at some points.

There are a few chapters that focus on Azkaban, but it is only part of the story.

In this AU world the dementors don't rule Azkaban anymore, but corrupt Aurors, and 'rehabilitated criminals' called Atoners terrorise the worst prisoners. Warning, it is a very dark fic.
