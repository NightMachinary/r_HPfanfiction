What are some good fics where Harry is an artist? He can paint, draw, carve, craft, etc. Basically any fics where he makes artsy stuff with his hands and that's a big thing rather than just an offhand remark that one time. Think Muggle-raised Hero or Ingenio ab Artifex with the painting being an actually present thing.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

** Blurred Realities has Harry (and others) as a dancer (technically a form of art) ,if that's your forte.

I'm pretty sure Prince of the Dark Kingdom also had Harry as an artist.

Hope you find your looking for.

*** I couldn't find anything called Blurred Realities, so I'm assuming you're referring to Blurring Reality?

If so, looks good and I thank you kindly for the rec. :)

Is Prince of the Dark Kingdom the ridiculously long AU thing people keep recommending?

**** Ah sorry ðŸ˜ž I just woke up so my brain isn't working lol. Yes, that was the rec.

Also yes. Harry being an artist is quite a large part of the plot, he draws out all of his memories and uses different mediums (watercolours, graphite) to display how he feels. Truthfully I never finished it (Its bingeread in one night or nothing) but it is quite good.

***** No biggie. It happens to us all - that's why Nature gave us glorious, beautiful caffeine and hands to make Coffee Machines. :)

And really? Huh. The people who normally rec that need to highlight that more. It sounds a lot more interesting put that way than the usual.

For posterity and other people, the link to that is here - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]
