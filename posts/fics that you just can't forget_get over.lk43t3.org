**** They write amazingly well about trauma (almost too well tbh) but I kept waiting for there to be some way out of it and a conclusion, maybe even with some hope. I got teary at parts but was so frustrated at where it ended as it felt like the consequences of different people's actions hadn't played out fully.

***** here's the bio: "Harry's doing just fine: being Quidditch Captain and 'the Chosen One' doesn't leave him with time to worry about much besides school and the growing threat of war. He's especially not worrying about the fact that Sirius is dead. Or about an embarrassing, uncomfortable night with a classmate he'd rather just forget. Really. He's fine." (set in year 6, canon compliant but obviously follows an extra story line.) i suggest reading the warnings inside as well. the characterization and the reactions they have are so well done, it truly is an amazing fic.

CW: NSFW, and spoilers for the story: It's really, really rare to see sensitive depictions of female on male sexual assault in Fanfiction, so I'm really glad I found this. Harry is so in character, and even just two chapters in, I'm glad to see Ron being himself, and Hermione herself.

** All the Young Dudes rips my soul out every time I think about it. It's a really gripping Marauder's Era retelling. Very canon complaint, with a Remus/Sirius main pairing. It follows them all the way from first year to the end of the war, with a few little sequels that button things up nicely.

At the same time, it gives you this feeling of "it can't be over. It can't be." It does such a great job of tying you up in the storyline. I have only read it twice because it is such an emotional ordeal.

******** I don't know why you're having such a reaction to this. No fics are entirely canon compliant, because only what JK Rowling writes is really canon. It does not take place in an alternate universe is all I meant, and it does not change anything we learned in the books. Maybe Sirius and Remus aren't clearly bi in the books, but honestly, we don't have enough information to say they aren't. Gay and bi people look and act just like "regular" people.

I apologize if I mislead anyone with my original comment.

************ I meant that it's misogynistic. You're fighting ignorance with ignorance. And it implies that it's wrong for men to be emotional. Not every man needs to be aggressively masculine.

I do appreciate your frustration with the way gay guys are often depicted, however. I acknowledge that it's a problem and I've noticed it as I read fanfics and original literature alike. And on TV and in movies. I just don't agree that Sirius' characterization in ATYD is terribly OOC.

** Probably the Pureblood Pretense series and the Alexandra Quick series. I just find their world building really interesting. Also several of Carnivorous Muffin's fics. And The Boy Who Lived by Santi, RIP sweet fic, you ended too soon. Maybe 0-800 Rent A Hero. Never seen such an interesting take on divination before. It's something that has the potential to be so useful if it was usable in a practical manner, and I wish there were more non abandoned fics exploring that.

Actually now that I think about it a bit, one fic comes to mind. It was on Ao3, I have it bookmarked but don't remember the name offhand, but it was a HP Naruto crossover where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the same people as Sasuke, Naruto, and Sakura, and were living both lives simultaneously. Unforunately it was a short fic with only like 1-2 chapters per person, and only got about to the point where canon starts for both franchises. The author mentioned eventually wanting to do a sequel longer fic that would actually cover the canon time periods of both, but that was a few years ago, and would in any case presumably take 10x-100x as many words as what is currently there, so is probably a pipe dream. But this might be my favorite concept for a crossover ever.

** Eyes of Gentry Green. It had AMAZING original ideas, characters were well thought out and original while still being Canon compliant.

The writer lost all interest due to some horrible reviews and bullying and it will never be finished. I reread it occasionally and it just kills me that it will never be done.

Which is part of why I am adamant that writers take care of themselves and offer no explanations and readers can fuck off with their entitlement and bullying.

The Marriage Stone is another one that was new and original and amazing and wasn't finished. Its inspired a least a few attempts by other writers to wrap things up.

** I have one and I don't know how to link so trust me. The fanfiction is Captured and Dying. It's basically a oneshot where Harry and Remus get kidnapped by deatheaters. They get stuck in the same room on the full moon. I want you guys to read it yourself so I won't spoil the ending.

It's very unique, extremely well written and it just stays in your head. Voldemort goes back in time and raises himself. Everyone is true to their cannon form, there is no bashing, it gets a little dark in some places, but not too much.

It's a great character study of Voldemort, through the eyes of his younger self, who doesn't know who Voldemort is and is spending the story trying to find out, more and more obsessed and fascinated with this very odd man that took him out of Wool's, saving him from a bad life.

** linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7)

Antithesis has a way of staying with you longer than you expect.

I'm not sure how to explain why without going into spoilers, but it had a believable representation of the consequences of child neglect, and some of my favorite characters in HP fanfic. Its by far the best WBWL fic I've read, and apparently the only one of reasonable size that's been completed? At least as far as I know.

Its also quite dark and depressing. Don't read it if you're not in the mood for that. As I've mentioned, it tends to stay with you.

** I hope you're still looking for recommendations! I saved this on mobile last month hoping to come back when I had time.

Top Three of All Time. These are the three fics that I keep open on my phone's browser so I can easily recommend them.

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. It is complete.
2. Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.
3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. It is complete.

These are unranked but I love them all

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1471166][HEX]] is a series that takes place in an AU. I can't quite catch where the point of deviation is, but it's just too fun to matter. It's more of a series of character studies than super plotty and it's very much coming of age. Hermione is a black Muslim activist and daughter of immigrants. Harry was adopted by Remus/Sirius when he was ten but still struggles with issues regarding food and control from then. Ginny struck a chord with me because, when I was a teen, I definitely let my boyfriends subsume my identity. Definitely recommend this one.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. This was also one of my gateways into the Harry has a Horcrux in his head that talks.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is perhaps the most unique fic I've read in the fandom. The writing style and concept are just totally different than anything else I've read. You'll note that I'm not giving up any information; it's best to go into this one blind. oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15834660][Little Deaths and How to Avoid Them (or Draco Malfoy's Guide to Stop Dying and Start Living Instead)]] is a great, nuanced look at an ace character struggling to come to terms with his identity and learn how to set and maintain boundaries.
- A new favorite of mine is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]]. There is a potions accident that causes Harry to be deaged to the age of ten. Draco has to take care of him. This teaches Draco quite a lot about Harry's childhood that he wouldn't have otherwise known. I'm not super familiar with the de-aging trope, but I have heard that some fics use the concept to inappropriately pair characters of vastly different ages. That is NOT the case in this one.
- Actually, I've loved most things by the author [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/lettered/pseuds/lettered][Lettered]] (same as Away Childish Things). My favorites are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22062673][By the Grace]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2780708][Another Mask Behind You]] (fair warning: there is SO MUCH sex right from the start), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1343047][The Fall of the Veils]] (after war with Muggles and Draco is ace), and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/392764][The Pure and Simple Truth]] (Slytherins and Gryffindors are all grown up and off to pubs in various combinations).
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11547009/chapters/25929084][Modern Romance]] is a lovely, touching, original work. Every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters. It is complete. The writing really stuck with me, especially a poem towards the end
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2209675/1/And-So-Life-Goes-On][And So Life Goes On]] is an oldie but a goodie. It's 15 years young. Harry spends his days volunteering at a children's shelter. He doesn't remember magic or anything about his old life until he sees a familiar face.... It is complete. It's kinda weird, maybe, but I thought a lot about a part where one character is surprised that another helps him, to which he responds, "I said I would, didn't I?" It made me think about my reliability and if I could honestly say that.
- Like And So Life Goes On, I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] when I was in high school. I haven't read it in a while, but it sparked a long love for the poetry of Yeats, which inspired a tattoo.

The characters are so well written and true to how they are in canon IMHO. I tend to skip the post-war chapters (which the fic begins and ends with) just because they depict such horrid events. While I managed to watch the Handmaid's Tale series, I have trouble reading about a similar scenario here, even though it's expertly written.

Oh but if you are going to try to read it I have some things to note:\\

* Yes, James and Jim start out really shitty. They do improve (that's definitely not saying they become perfect, but they do get better).\\

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

I'd say it's written like a traditional novel. I also really like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14513535/chapters/33531078][Belladonna]] Which is Fred Weasley x OC. WIP Another that I enjoy immensely is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5203025][The Destiny You Sold]]. I cannot begin to describe this. It has got to be one of my favorite Drarry fics. Another I liked is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21788248][The Calm Before The Storm]] well written WIP though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25248820][No Magic, No Life]] Even though I know next to nothing about Naruto, I couldn't put down this Fic until I had finished it. Sadly WIP. Some that I am currently reading are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28512861][Becoming One]] TW: suicidal thoughts but it's pretty good so far. I also really liked [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1078809][An Unexpected Universe]] it was so good. I could go for hours but I shall spare you.

Grow Young With Me is one where you really need to ignore the summary and just try chapter 1 to see if you like it.
