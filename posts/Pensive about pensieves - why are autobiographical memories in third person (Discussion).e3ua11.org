So, I can't find my copies of the books to check, but as best I recall the pensieves are in third person there as well as the movies. I don't really understand why. Best I can find online, it's basically to give greater depth when reviewing memories. I'm not sure if that's just fanon, though, so I'm asking if there's ever a canon reason given for them to be from that perspective? Given that our memories happen to us, and would therefore mostly be in the first person view we get out of our eyes (since we're not all video-game characters with cameras floating behind our heads), it would seem more likely that a record would be in the first person. I know that anything that isn't directly related to the plot is never expounded upon in the books, but even an offhand mention of something would be good.

I can't really back the 'it's for dramatic purposes' argument, given that she (Our kind benevolent mistress, Madame Rowling) writes first person viewpoint drama from Nagini's perspective quite well, so I'm hoping there's some other reason she chose it that I'm missing.

If there's nothing as I suspect, my humble suggestion would be a mix between the 'magical intent-visualisation-will' trope and the Schwitzgebel (2006) paper's suggestions that people who talk about reality as if it's two-dimensional imagery would attribute more 'flatness' to what they see around them. Essentially, Rowling-Magicals talk about memory and visualisation in a third person perspective, and then magic makes it so, and then that reinforces the initial view which becomes more and more true as more people come to believe it. A muggleborn coming late to the magical world (post-Muggle Education) might then see memories in first person still.


** A Pensieve is a magical device that specifically allows to view memories in 3rd person objectively, that's its purpose. It's not like a movie; more like virtual reality where the person using it can walk around and spot the details that the memory owner didn't see or notice. When Harry was in Snape's memory in the OotP, he was able to walk over to his father's desk and look at what he and Sirius were doing while Snape himself was still focused on his exam and wasn't looking in that direction at all.

#+begin_quote
  Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters “L.E.”
#+end_quote

Snape certainly couldn't have seen this.

I don't really understand what's Nagini to do with that; do you mean when Harry had a vision of her attacking Arthur Weasley? But that was because of his connection with Voldemort, and if he were to rewatch this memory in a Pensieve, it would presumably be in third person.

That raises an interesting question. How does a Pensieve piece together the external appearance of the person who lived the memory?

Hypothetically, if at the time when Harry's memory is extracted for use in a Pensieve he has no idea what Nagini is or what she looks like /and/ he still feels as if he committed the attack because that was his perspective during the event - what appearance would 'his' body have when the memory is viewed in 3rd person within the Pensieve? Would it be a generic depiction of a snake drawn from Harry's imagination? Would it be an amorphous mass reflecting Harry's own confusion about 'his' body in the memory? Or would the Pensieve magically know that the snake is Nagini even when the owner of the memory, Harry himself, does not?

Magic :P

Just came up with a theory:

It's time travel magic. The memory is only the marker of when/where to go. When you enter the pensive your mind travels into the past.

*** The Nagini thing was just an example that Rowling can write drama from a first person 'viewpoint' well. So, if she did write a pensieve experience where you saw from the eyes of the person who the memory belongs to, she'd probably have been able to do it.

That's kinda the outcome of my question. Being in third person instead of first (like how memories of things that happen to you would be), you see things you couldn't possibly have seen at the time. How the heck does it fill in the blanks for things that aren't in the head of the person giving the memory? If the memory is drawn from the head of the person giving it (see Dumbledore's 'siphon the excess thoughts' explanation of the pensieve), how does it give information that simply isn't there? It's like you rip a movie of your life from a DVD and then plug it straight into a VR headset and there's suddenly stuff there that wasn't ever in the movie. Is there ever a canon explanation given?

I know I'm probably looking too hard for logic in a Rowling novel, but I'm curious.

Probably some temporal magic. For me personally, the whole appeal of HP magic that it is well, magical instead being this advance technology that cannot be explained logically.

Legilimency, on the other head, would probably give much more unreliable results. Memories viewed directly from someone's head are likely much more subjective, and might well be in 1st person.

** I'd see a few problems with writing it 1st pov. Where would Dumbledore be? Would he and Harry occupy the same head? Would they be able to hear each other? Would you then have your own thoughts and feelings or those of the person from the memory? If you then watched the memory of someone tortured would you be able to watch it without feeling the pain?

*** True. Thinking about it, that multiple-person thing wouldn't work terribly well with a first person viewpoint, unless it ended up something like Inside Out, with Dumbledore and Harry sat in a room looking into a screen to see the memory, but that would be less dramatically interesting than being in the memory-scene itself.

It might make for some interesting issues with the process though. Imagine if watching Ogden go meet the Gaunts meant that you'd have to combat his irritation and fear to actually focus on any details in the memory. Could add a dash of verisimilitude to the whole thing, given that memory in reality is so strongly associated with sensory experience (think the smell of Turkey bringing back memories of particularly good or back thanksgivings, to give a topical example).

** maybe because magic =/= technology. you probably don't use the electrical signals that make up a memory in the brain. you use the concept of a memory.

*** Technically electrical signals aren't memories, they're the neurons the signals run through - the electrical signals are how we 'activate' those stored memories to recall them. Still. Huh. That concept idea is an interesting take on it - very 'the hat goes on what trait you value, not what you have'. It'd be a thematic fit with the more schematic-representative/structuralist-abstract viewpoints on memory, anyway.

The nodes in our brain representing various things that are connected by associations (like 'a trial is a criminal proceeding' and 'I had a trial' and 'there was a woman in pink at my trial' and 'the woman in pink was Delores Umbridge' and 'Delores Umbridge doesn't like me much') aren't removed so much as the abstract summation of all those points. That glowy memory crap they extract could be that summation, which then plays in the pensieve, hence why it would be in third person and why the parts of the scene the person doesn't see aren't entirely blank because those extra bits are filled in by association.

This ramble might be a bit disorganised, I'm running on very little sleep, and if so I apologise. So, TL:DR - I'm nitpicking your neurology, but cool idea, fellow internet-person. :)

This is also something i believe.

Yeah i just wanted to differentiate between what a memory is in real life and what i think pensieve memories are. It might have been an uneducated description.

I just don't think magic has to work based upon science. It's magic. Sure it should be consistent internally but over all it is something beyond science in my headcanon. It is imposing your will upon the universe. Hence the sorting isn't cut and and dry "you are this" rather "you want to be this". Magical ability doesn't have to be related to evolution or genetic heritage. And pensieve memories are not meant to be camera recordings in first person.

Anyway have a good night, fellow HP enthusiast.
