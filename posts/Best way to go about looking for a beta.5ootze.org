So, I've been a long time writer, and am a good part way through multiple fics right now. However I've stalled in a big way as I keep going back and editing and changing things. Would be nice to have someone help me with that and tell me to leave it alone and carry on writing fresh stuff! What's the best way to go about doing that? I can imagine finding a good editor is tough going.


** There are a few different ways you can go about looking for a beta.

- You can browse some Beta profiles in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/book/Harry-Potter/?genreid=0&languageid=1&rating=0&field=&ppage=1][official FFN Beta listings]]

- You can say that you are looking for a beta in an AN, asking interested readers to PM you. That way, the people who PM you will be more likely to be familiar with your story and will find it much easier to help you maintain the feel that your story already has.

- Alternatively You can handpick a reviewer of yours that posts really complicated and detailed reviews and seems to really be invested in your story and PM them with a request.

- You can also post here on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] as well as [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] with an excerpt and description telling people that you're looking for a beta. [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] has some very smart people well versed in HP lore, and [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]] has /loads/ of writers who frequently beta for each other. Between the two, I'm sure you'll find someone that'll fit you well.

The one thing you should always remember to do is to have a long conversation and get a feel for their grasp of grammar. If they have some stories written, take a look at those too. Make sure you know their skills before you finalise anything. Good luck.

** If you're updating a story, posting an Author's note and asking for a beta reader might help as well since you're addressing people familiar with your writing.

** DarkLordPotter is a brilliant resource for aspiring writers. There's a section of the forum that allows you to post your current (unbeta'd) WIP fics, and get feedback from some of the best authors in the HPFF community.

You need a bit of thick skin (though not nearly as much as in the past) and the ability to accept criticism though. If you're not ready to have your writing picked apart, probably best to avoid it.

*** Oh this sounds like a great resource. I'll have to check it out.

I'm actually quite easy going about being criticised as long as there's some feedback to work with, so that doesn't worry me.

Thank you!!

** The two main fics I'm working on right now are:

1) A Next Gen where the Department of Mysteries has fostered four cloned children with trusted families, and their adventures at Hogwarts, dealing with fame, and discovery of their origins.

2) A Marauders meets Jane Austen fic where Lily and James' story might be one you've read before...

For an example of my writing style, here's some one-shots:
