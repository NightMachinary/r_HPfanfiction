So early on Harry/Hermione go to a newly formed club to learn muggle subjects. Hermione never went back, but Harry continued going in secret. Astoria was involved somehow. In a few years the leader graduates and Harry is selected to take their place. Harry eventually develops some sort of technique to let squibs do potions/runes and demonstrates using Lucius' daughter, who is a squib. Lucius gets rid of Voldemort soon after.


** It's Motivations by the same guy that wrote White Knight, Grey Queen the name is eluding me right now
