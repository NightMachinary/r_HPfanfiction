I really enjoy reading Blue Wizard, but seeing as it's not been updated in nearly a decade I think I should find something a bit more complete.

So, - At least 2 Potters survive Halloween 1981. (Preferably all 3) - No slash/Yaoi -Rating doesn't matter

Thank you all for any assistance you can give.


** A HP/hentai anime crossover. Where have you been all my life.

*** It's pretty good since it takes La Blue Girl super serious, some bits of Potter not so much and crafts a nice story out of it. It sucks it hasn't be updated since I could be considered a teenager
