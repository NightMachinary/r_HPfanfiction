** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9106972][Glass of Water]] linkao3(9106972) is from Lily's POV, but the Whomping Willow incident features heavily.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801][The Age of Lies]] linkao3(13281801) involves some aftermath of the incident, though it's rather distant aftermath.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1110486][the lost generation]] linkao3(1110486) covers it, though it takes 70-odd chapters to get there.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus...Regulus is alive.No-one is more surprised than him.

  The Marauders era at Hogwarts, Voldemort's rise to power and the subsequent war, family loyalties and dishonour, and the struggles of friendship in a difficult time.Ch. 101: The boys try to one-up each other. It doesn't go to plan, but Remus doesn't care.

** Anytime anyone wants a Marauders fic: linkao3(all the young dudes by mskingbean89)

The Whomping Willow incident does occur about 100 chapters in. This is /the/ Marauders fic and it was recently completed and my heart is empty because of it.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! COMPLETE!WINNER of two 2018 Marauders Medals Awards:- Best Characterisation of Remus- Best Characterisation of James2017 Marauders Medal Awards:- Best Work in Progress
