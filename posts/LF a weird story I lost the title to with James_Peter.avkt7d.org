In it, instead of Peter giving up the fidelius, it was actually Remus, who then blamed Lily, but she got a trial and so didn't end up in Azkaban. It was very strange but surprisingly good. Last time I checked it was mid-way through Harry's third year?


** You do know you can search by pairing in fanfiction.net right? There wouldn't be many stories with such a pairing, maybe do that instead.

Thanks,\\
