I'm very curious about the non-Britain Wizard World and magic shchools. I've red some - Snape in Salem after 5th year, Hermione in Salem before Hogwarts, Harry in Japan after 4th year. Can you recommend me something in this way?

PS: Sorry for my poor skills but English isn't even my second language


** Well there's the Alexandra Quick series, which takes place in America with a young female original character.

I liked Looking for Magic, which involves Hermione graduating and going to a Wizarding University in Chicago. But it's eventually Hermione/Severis, and really really long. Because it's so long though, we do get scenes like Draco Malfou goes to Walmart.

** The story 30 Minutes that changed everything includes a very large chunk set in a magic school in Japan.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) has amazing worldbuilding for Durmstrang. The downside is that we see it from the point of view of Harry Potter's badass Gray!Genius!OC brother, while Harry himself goes to Hogwarts and has canonish adventures. (Well, technically, the OC is named "Harry" and it's "Nathan" Potter who goes to Hogwarts and has canonish adventures.) Snark aside, it really is very good.

linkffn(Harry Potter without Harry Potter by Nim-the-Lesser) has Hermione trick her way into Durmstrang. Not as good worldbuilding, though.

linkffn(Alexandra Quick by Inverarity) is a whole series taking place in the US, which has its own magical school system.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
