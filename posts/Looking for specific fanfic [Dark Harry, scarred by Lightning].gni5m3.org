** Is it this one [Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7]? I have blocked most of it from my mind. I know most people love it, but for me, it worked like a month in Azkaban near Dementors while wearing the locket. I was a mess for days. (Apparently I have issues, LOL.)

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?
