Hey guys, i'm looking for a story in which Harry, Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus have a really strong friendship where they are almost like brothers. They would be kind of the next generation of Marauders or it could even be like some of the Harry and the Four horsemen of the Apocalypse stories but the four horsemen would be Harry's dormmates instead of random students from all over Hogwarts. Basically a strong bond between those 5 character. Are there any stories similar to what i'm asking for?
