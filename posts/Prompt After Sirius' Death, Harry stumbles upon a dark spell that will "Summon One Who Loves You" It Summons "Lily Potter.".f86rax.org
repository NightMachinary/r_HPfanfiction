"M...mum?" Harry couldn't believe his eyes, their standing right by his bed, was his long dead mother. The book that had made this possible was nowhere to be seen, but Harry didn't care, his mother was alive!

"Oh, my poor sweet baby boy..." Lily slowly took a few steps towards Harry, her arms held out inviting him to come hug her "Look at what they've done to you."

Harry let himself be hugged, the smell of lilies and something else he couldn't place calming his excited heart. All of it, His Mum coming back to him, Sirius' death and the prophecy all came rushing towards him at once as he finally allowed himself to bawl and cry into his mothers bosom.

"It's alright now my sweet..." His mothers voice reached his ears as she moved her cold hands through his hair "They won't hurt you anymore, not after we finish our work."

Harry sniffed and looked up at his mum, taking off his glasses and drying his eyes before asking "Our Work? Do you mean Voldemort?"

Something flashed through his mothers eyes at the mention of the dark lord, but it was gone before Harry could really get a good idea of what that something was, She just smiled that serene smile at him and spoke "Yes, and much more...their are many who have harmed you my son...they must atone for what they've done."

Harry snorted "Mum, The death eaters don't really seem like the beg for forgiveness sort."

Lilly giggled at his response, it tinkled in his ears like bells "Oh no, our job isn't to forgive my sweet, our job is to punish, the forgiveness comes after." with that she stood and began walking Harry out the door, down the stairs and out the front door of Number 4 "Now come, we have much work to be done..."

The Next day Number 4 was found burnt to the ground, all three Residents were found in the wreckage, and Harry Potter was no where to be found.

** [] Brewing in the casket []

‘Bone of the... mother, unknowingly given, you will renew your child'

For the next step, Harry asked for the knife, but Snape already had it ready and cut off a finger.

‘Flesh of the servant -- willingly given -- you will revive your... mistress.'

They roused Macnair, and then let him know he would be losing some blood for their cause.

'Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken; you will resurrect your foe.'

Harry's scar flared. It rose to a pain spiking into his forehead. It was worse than the last time he had been involved in a resurrection. Soon he could hear at least two people, male and female, screaming, and he heard an echo of these from the back of his mind as well.

He felt a pulling, yanking sensation, as if his skin were being peeled away from his face. His eyes burned and they felt stretched. Vertigo swept over him and only the unbreakable clenching of what seemed like every muscle in his body kept him from vomiting. His throat had closed shut and he couldn't breathe...

[[]]

Snape watched as Potter's forehead split open, releasing a spray of red mist. It turned into a dense fog, which then shrieked in two voices, like how he thought a Nazgul might sound. The mist separated, with a portion flowing away in a non-existent wind while the rest slowly collected at the ground, rolling down the excavated grave to settle into the casket.

The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white. The contents were still roiling, sending diamond sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness. This continued for several minutes.

And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron flared into ash. The liquid turned dark. A surge of sooty smoke billowed from the cauldron instead; no one could see anything but the black fog hanging in the air. But then, through the mist in front of him, he saw a figure stand up from the casket. A slender woman with long dark red hair.

She parted the damp strands of hair away from her eyes and looked up at them.

[[]]

She looked up out of the pit to see two men. One was tall, thin, dressed in black with stringy black hair curtaining his face, except for the large nose parting through, like a shark's fin. The other was a young man, doubled over from just being sick. His hair was dark and tufted out from his head. Blood ran down his face from his hairline and his glasses obscured his eyes, but the build and bearing was familiar.

"S-severus? And... James?"

The bloodied young man choked out, "Harry."

The woman stepped back, eyes wide. She then squeezed them shut, took three very deliberate breaths, and then said, "Does someone have, in this order, a warm robe, something even warmer to drink, and an exhaustive explanation for me?"

"Lily?" Severus gasped out.

"Mum?" said the one who looked like a sickly James.

Between them they brought her out of the casket and wrapped her in a spare winter cloak and some shoes, retrieved from a magically extended knapsack.

A voice brought them all to attention.

"I have wondered if anyone would ever come to desecrate the graves of the Potters to some foul purpose," the Headmaster idly mused. "But I never would have predicted it would be the two of you. Never."

The Headmaster had his lit wand held up, but otherwise didn't seem threatening.

** Lily Potter nee Evans was dead. Very dead. She had been under ground for the past 14 years. After Sirius Black died, Harry was exploring the Black Library, the epitome of dark magics. As he was looking through one book, he discovered something. "Summon the One Who Loves You." It was a ritual, to be done on a Waxing Crescent Moon. It would be done just a week later, and during this time he would prepare, gathering the necessary ingredients to perform the ritual.

Harry was performing the ritual, and during the last step, he would have to chant in Latin. During his chant, he had his eyes closed, the runes surrounding him were glowing, as a person manifested in front of him. This person, magic had decided, was a woman. She had deep, yet bright, red hair, emerald green eyes, a button nose, and almost pouty lips. This woman was skinny, with a body similar to Harry's own, but clearly not malnourished. The woman let out a gasp, seeming to take breath for the first time in forever. "Harry..." She spoke, voice raspy and sounding deep. At his name, Harry's eyes snapped open, and he looked up to his mother, seeing her in person for the first time, in person, since he was one. "M... Mum?" He asked, the runes completed their magic, as Lily Potter walked towards him, giving her boy a hug. Harry, in his shock and not being used to hugs, stood there. "My poor boy... Do not worry, I've been watching you, and I promise nobody will hurt you ever again. I swear it." She spoke, voice giving away her anger, eyes flashing red, as thoughts flashed through her mind about revenge. Harry was looking at her, although he was taking in what most took for granted, his mother. "But how? How can we defeat-" "Leave that to me. For now, let's get some food into you. I have to agree with Molly that you are far too skinny." She said, leading Harry to the kitchen, where she cooked. The next day, in the muggle newspapers, was a report that Number 4 Privet Drive, Harry's old home, had burnt down. With all of the family inside. Although, the fire was so hot, that it completely demolished the house, and the Muggle police claimed Vernon Dursley, Petunia Dursley, Dudley Dursley, and Harry Potter dead on arrival. Over the next couple of weeks, the Death Eaters were dying. In more and more excruciating ways. Only two were killed with a wand, and Tom Marvolo Riddle, a.k.a Lord Voldemort, knew he was next. It was only after all of his death eaters had died, that he saw a woman in his room. All he had seen were emerald eyes, flashing red, heard "Hello Tom, remember me?" Then he was brutally murdered, tied to a gravestone, and left to bleed, left to scream where nobody would hear him. For the first time in his life, Tom felt something other than the joy of ruling over others, the fear of being ruled by others.

** This kind of reminds me of Steven King's “Pet Sematery” where the people you resurrect are out for vengeance towards everyone, especially the person who resurrected them. Maybe have something like this where resurrected Lily goes homicidal on everyone, but less so on Harry.

Bonus if it is a secret, hidden Native American ritual hidden in the Black library.

**** Meh. People downvoting are lying to themselves. Porn and fanfiction sites alike are thriving on kinks and taboos. And they wouldn't be producing so much if there wasn't a need for it. Supply and demand and so on. You know how it goes.

Personally I find underage and non-consensual stories much more disturbing than some incest roleplay. Yet many people would step forward and defend those stories.
