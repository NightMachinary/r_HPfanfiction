Lemme preface this all by saying that I'm aware the characters in the books are children and, in the case of many young purebloods, were bred from a young age to be hateful and prejudiced. Breaking out of a hateful family is really difficult, and those who attempt to change should have an avenue to do so. This is also not about adult Death Eaters. Fuck them. I'm talking about supporters who were classmates to the Golden Trio (Blaise, Pansy, Daphne, Theo, Draco, etc).

I've been reading fics for about 10 years, with the majority of them being Drarry & other fics where Slytherins are redeemed. I love myself a good 8th year fic where other students give the Slytherins a hard time for ~2 months before accepting them, or those Ministry fics where coworkers ignore Draco until he proves he's a nice guy, etc etc. I always got annoyed/bored if the ostracization happened for too long in the fic, or if Harry was particularly stubborn about accepting them; like, they're trying their best, let them move on and heal. But ever since the BLM protests and election drama of 2020, I'm really seeing these "redemption timelines" in a new light. I'm Black, and while I know Harry Potter deals with racism, I never really thought to equate the hard time the Light gives ex-Death Eaters post-Second War to /my own/ /attitude towards Trump supporters and white supremacists right now./

And I KNOW America didn't experience an attempted genocide that rested on the shoulders of a teenager. I'm not THAT dramatic lol. But over the past few months, I've just noticed that I have very low patience for fics where this redemption arc is rushed over or dealt with very poorly, when before, I was excited to get to the fun romantic parts of the fic. Like, HP boils down to a race war, and those who were complicit deserve to be heavily scrutinized in the months/years following its conclusion, just like those complicit in white supremacy these past 4 years should not expect immediate acceptance. Has anyone else been experiencing this, or am I just being overly critical from having CNN on 24/7 :) ?

​

EDIT: I'm not interested in debating whether what Draco & friends did was justified. Racism is racism. My post is about how we heal from it!

SECOND EDIT: Though my political stance seems to be making some of you very animated, I don't plan on debating anyone. However, if you have something to say about Draco and his redemption arc in fanfiction, I would love to hear it.


** I get you. I think there should have been serious repercussions for all of them. Actual Marked Death Eaters like Lucius Malfoy should be imprisoned for life as the rule. The only exception I might make is if they're barely of age, like Draco Malfoy. I'm not comfortable with the idea of deciding that a teenager is wholly irredeemable and the best solution is to imprison them for life. There should be accountability but to me that's not the way to go about it. I'd guess that for unmarked sympathizers you'd have to take it on a case by case basis.

But it's not just the actual punishments of individuals that needs to occur. They should have gone over existing legislation with a fine tooth comb, repealing and nullifying anything that results in disparate impact on people who aren't purebloods. And there should be severe social stigma for expressing blood purity opinions. They wouldn't necessarily eradicate it but they could take that shit somewhere else.

**** This is one of the best points I've heard, I didn't think of this at all. It would be very naive to assume everyone who supported Dumbledore/Light did it to protect Muggleborns, just as it's naive to believe everyone who supported Voldemort/Dark did it out of hatred of Muggleborns. This is not to minimize the racism of the Death Eaters/supporters, but clearly the entire Wizarding World is in desperate need of reform. Even the idea of Muggles being exotic and outlandish (ex. Mr. Weasley's cute fascination) can breed some not-okay actions towards Muggleborns. Reform should not only be a way to condemn Death Eaters, but fully squash ignorance of it in the Wizarding World.

The other aspects of reform you present are why a redemption arc done well is sooo interesting to read! What /is/ the appropriate punishment? How do you prevent this from ever happening again-- like, for real this time? How do you go about re-integrating former supporters into society again if we don't address what started the war(s) in the first place? How do you go about forgiveness without minimizing actions? It doesn't at all need to be the focus of a fic (when I want smut, I. want. smut.), but I've become much more sensitive to fics that are unable to answer these questions.

... and how do you re-integrate /dozens of millions/ of people who have been literally brainwashed? Psychological therapy can work, but the US doesn't have /nearly/ enough experts, time and money for this.

In the HP world, the solution is easy-ish: obliviate them or deport them to Azkaban for the rest of their days... but the real world is in for one of a hell of a ride, and not just the US but also /other countries/ like the UK (where Brexit may at least be enough of a reality shock to wake a lot of people up on their own), Brazil, Hungary, Poland or France...

***** I think one has to differentiate between supporters, collaborators and actors.

Those who did crimes are easy to deal with, because punishment is justifiable. It ought to be done within the framework of existing law- or within war that you're willing to apply to yourselves. This is a good principle from Nuremberg that I think we got right.

Then there are those who didn't commit crimes but who obliquely acted in a way as to support those who did, or those who merely thought that those who were committing crimes were right.

The issue here comes with punishing them. They're not the extremists- they're embedded in society. Punishing them- either with obliviation or deportation (so corporal punishment or incarceration) is going to start to look a lot like screening for ideological purity.

It gets very dystopian very quickly if you can literally have your mind wiped for thinking the wrong thing.

Changing, and winning, hearts and minds, mean both of those need to be in play.

As long as the cultures are separate and the government advocates hiding from muggles and effectively punished interaction with them, there will be negative opinions of them.

(Even bringing him back ffs!) He could have maybe strived for “redemption” (even a weak one) if he expressed any kind of remorse or accountability for his actions. Instead he murdered innocents and framed someone: not much to save here.

sometimes nothing happens and he just goes on with his life.

​

sometimes he is never punished in a court of law but is essentially blacklisted from society and no one wants anything to do with him.

And while the assassination order was illegal, using that as a legal defense is futile since it was established at Nürnberg that exactly this kind of defence is not valid. It was especially established that, if given an illegal order, the person has a moral choice to carry it out or not, and that he should be punished according to the choice he made.

Sure, you could argue that Voldemort scared him enough to reveal the Secret, but the Order members had already suspected a spy. Plus his actions to frame Sirius speak of planning and foresight, not someone panicking out of fear. Then, Pettigrew manages to escape when Remus transforms, but then seeks out Voldemort? And then willingly helps him regain his body? Does his hesitation at Malfoy Manor, which ended up killing him, plus the possibility that he only revealed the Secret under great distress outweigh that in terms of possible redemption?

***** Umbridge delighted in it. She used a quill to basically torture Harry and didn't hesitate to threaten torture and send dementors even pre- Voldemort, with no outside pressure influencing her. There are witnesses for that.

We aren't shown much of Peter's life after joining Voldemort. What we do know is that he wasn't liked by either side: his best friends constantly mocked him and he didn't belong in that group (which isn't to say that they were evil or cruel or anything, he just didn't fit in), and Voldemort and his Deatheaters wouldn't have liked a traitor of friends either, even if he /wasn't/ constantly sucking up. His heart never seemed in it. He never struck me as the type to actively go looking for the weak and helpless remnant of Voldemort; far more likely that he was just running away from Sirius and co and stumbled upon Voldemort, isn't it?

Now, him framing Sirius... all he had to do was be in a place with witnesses and shout something to the effect of you killed them. It doesn't really require a lot of planning and foresight, in principle.

** I've written Draco Malfoy fiction since I was a teenager. At first, it was because I found the 'bad boy' narrative compelling (and only the first 3 books were out. Things weren't as grim to my teenaged mind).

As I've gotten older, I've realized it wasn't just the 'bad boy' narrative that was compelling about his character; it was the fact that I saw him in myself. I grew up in a very conservative environment. I grew up believing that 'liberals' were a threat to my country and that my faith was being 'persecuted' and that we were in a 'spiritual war' against the devil. I was part of a youth group that met weekly that said 4 pledges at the start of each service, in this order: pledge to the American Flag, to the Christian Flag, to the Church Flag, to the Bible Flag. I believed what they taught; I defended the teachings; I even debated evolution and global warming with my classmates in school because I was given 'alternative' science books to study. I believed it even when it detrimentally impacted me (conservatives aren't big on women's rights). When I saw the attack on the US Capitol, I wondered if some of the people I grew up with were a part of it, or supporting it from a distance (I have looked through some of the photos, just to see if I can identify anyone).

I started questioning my church more as I got older, around 17, which is also when I started writing fanfiction. I realize, looking back on it now, that I was writing 'good Draco Malfoy' because I didn't see my story reflected in Harry Potter. I wanted to see a redemption arc. I wanted to think that someone raised in that environment could still manage to break free. I wanted it because... well, that's what I was trying to do. As I've become a better writer, I've think I've been able to encapsulate more of that struggle, and show the real consequences of hate and bigotry. I think I've been able to show the struggle of challenging a world view that has been, quite literally, brainwashed into someone.

This is not to say I am sympathetic to the Death Eaters. Let me be very clear about that. Racism, prejudice, bigotry are all terrible and are moral failings; and hate crimes are horrifying. I think new writers and young writers have trouble condemning these values while showing how someone changes - and often default to minimizing these crimes because it is a tricky thing to write. I know I didn't do it well the first time I wrote a Draco fic. And yet, I will keep writing this kind of fic because I need to know it's possible to change; I need to show other people that it's possible to change. In the words of Hamilton, "I picked up a pen and wrote my own deliverance." Writing fanfic has helped me become a better person.

It must've been really difficult, and I will not pretend to imagine what it must've been like.

I saw a lot of myself in Hermione growing up (especially being Black in the south), and when I began reading, redeemed!Draco represented a lot of the people who bullied me for my braids and big nose realizing they were wrong and wanting to be my friend.

I'm glad that you had her as a role model growing up. I'm also really glad that you made this post. The parallels of Death Eaters and today's society in the US are getting clearer and clearer, and it's good to call it out. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and experiences, and hopefully your post gets a lot of traction because I think it's an important one.

I'm actually re-writing/editing my main series, trying to make the redemption arc a little bit more realistic. It's The Code over on Ao3, pen-name AduroWrites. Would love to know what you think of it.

*** can I ask you something?

How did you feel about the Black brothers in the books?

I personally always felt that it was a lost chance that Sirius was shown in the last book as always wanting to break away from his family, even before Hogwarts. I think it would have been more impactful if he had to learn not to be like his family after he was sorted to his own shock into Gryffindor and forced to see things from a different perspective.

**** Yeah, it sort of seemed that anyone who was 'good' (e.g. Sirius) was always good. Like he was inherently born with a good value system, instead of showing how value systems are taught and how value systems can develop. Regulus was an interesting character, but underdeveloped and seemed to be treated like a plot point instead of a full person.

So, yeah, I agree with you. Those were two characters that could have been more impactful if their character journey was more developed. I mean, I get it. Rowling was writing a good vs evil middle grade book series. How much detail can she really go in? But still, I think there were definite missed opportunities.

***** One of those unwritten plot bunnies... how he is the perfect little Black heir when he arrives at Hogwarts and is expecting maybe even demanding Slytherin, but the hat to his endless shock sends him to Gryffindor and is at odds with James (who pulls the other two Marauders to his side or they try to stay out of the way as much as possible) and their prank carrier started with those two going after each other and then when Sirius is starting to maybe question his own belives when confronted with a different world or when his parents turn away from him in shame he starts to see that those beliefs judge people for no fault of their own, James sees those questions and reaches out to teach him. At the beginning quite harsh, then with more and more care...

in a way, this leads to James and Sirius fighting Snape harder. Sirius because he feels he has to prove that he is no longer having those kinds of beliefs and James because in his eyes Snape is doing the reverse of Sirius. He should know better already and is falling into that crowd out of his own desire for power and that stuff...

​

But I'm just not sure if I would be the right person to tackle such a delicate topic because my life was never so extreme, sure some unconscious biases, but never that hate or that oppression. Never that much of a conflict with my parents or anything like that

** I live in areanof the UK that suffers a lot of racial tension. Its split white/muslim right down the middle and neither side is particularly fond of the other, so I was brought up on a LOT of casual racism. It was normalised and I never saw issue with it because its simply what I was brought up on to believe was normal. I would use slurs regularly without even understanding thats what they were, instead thinking that was just the word we called them. And don't get me started on how much I hated "SJW culture" because they were telling me pretty much everything I knew was wrong and I was a bad person when I hadn't dont anything wrong. It was a part of my life that happened, I'm not proud, but there is no point in denying it. I'm glad I'm not like that now and I use my experience to try and edcuate others.

While I have been writing my trilogy of Haphne fics, those experiences in my youth seriously helped me build (what I believe to be, anyway) a realistic version of the world they inhabit. Daphne has been brought up on the dark arts, mugglephobia and blood elitism her entire life, thats just how her world exists. And seeing her break out from that mindset through experiencing life first hand is a very slow process, it takes a lot of work and is full of relapses, just like real life. I'm specifically taking my time with her "redemption", utilising every second of it being a trilogy, as opposed a lot of fics that seem to gloss over it all very quickly.

So, I totally get what you mean. A lot of fics seem to treat redemption like it is a reward, when really it requires a lot of effort. Evil (or rather, racism) is not an object that can be given or taken away, its a mindset, a mental structure and belief system, and a very difficult thing to change if the person is unwilling.

Through life experiences I was able to change that mindset (I'm actually IN an interracial relationship now), but unfortunately, more often than not a lot of people never achieve this extra level of self awareness. I think that's partially why the boomer generation have held onto such beliefs into their later lives, because they've never lived through anything to conflict it in any meaningful way.

Then, of course, the protagonist finds out, gets angry, and confronts them. But instead of the Slytherin being force to change its the protagonist who has to learns to forgive. And then it rinses and repeats for 20 chapters till they finally get engaged. And never forget the saucy scenes thrown in the middle.

I do agree that bad writing contributes to it, as well as certain tropes not leaving a lot of room for a good redemption arc in their nature. Better writing yields better character development, both with Light and Dark characters/relationships.

***** Is that not on the society though? How do you integrate into a society without any information or opportunity to learn its customs? And I'm not just talking about someone in the wizarding world offering to teach - I'm including the opportunity to just observe, absorb, and learn.

As far as we know, there's not much of an introduction to the Wizarding World beyond a visit from a professor for muggleborns. I'm guessing the professor accompanies them to Diagon Alley but we don't know since Harry isn't a muggleborn. Based on canon alone, the students are more or less just thrust into the wizarding world while simultaneously trying to adjust to a new school and live away from home for the first time. (That last point might not be of as much significance unless you're American, where the vast majority of schools, regardless of type, are day schools.)

I'd like to think that there is a more substantive introduction than that. During canon, I would assume that introduction is more informal, performed by older muggleborn students and adults that want to make things easier for younger students. But there would still be some attempt at teaching them what they need to know, or at least giving them a chance to learn it themselves.

*** Being honest, with Draco/Harry, anything beyond book five, without major changes, is too late for it to ‘work'. I can easily forgive and forget some of what he did. Children often parrot their parents, which is why churches and religion push for them to join as young as possible. You will not question something if you grow up with it -- even when flaws are presented. Now, it can be done, but it takes an extraordinary circumstance for that to happen. Harry, for example, did not parrot the beliefs of the Dursleys.

Book five is where he could wise up just a tad. Getting Prefect could make him realise that he is growing up and has to be mature. Hell, make it an ancient tradition of pure-bloods or something. Or, have him get wind that his own father was behind book 2 and have him dislike that. Hell, have the Basilisk petrify him. Tom Riddle would hardly care, so it would work out either way.

Essentially, in order for it to work, something has to happen early on. I get that opposites attract. Hell, I had a slight crush on the school bully back in my youth, but if he did nearly as half as what Draco did, I would not even look at him. However, a lot of male/male slash is written by women. It is not a realistic take on an actual relationship.

As for Harry Potter/Tom Riddle. Only if they go to school together and are actual buddies. I do not care if Harry is manipulated. Hell, that works as Tom Riddle was said to be masterful at it. The second Tom kills Lily and James, it should not work. I am sick of those. “It was a war, I do not blame him” arguments. Just stop. Even if I hated my parents with every fibre of my being, channelling the teenage angst of every teenager in the world, I could never date the person who murdered my parents. I could never date someone who accidentally killed my parents.

** I really worry about people who get the Dark Mark tattooed on their left arms in real life. I get that it's fiction and it "looks cool" but still. Red flag.

A large part of why it took me a while to make the connection between "mudblood" and actual racial slurs is the way the adults treat Draco like a spoiled brat instead of a Hitler Youth. "Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, mudbloods!" And... no reaction from the teachers. They act like the problem is the crowd's presence being disruptive and hustle them off to bed. One of your students just made a death threat with a racial slur! But the adults don't act like that happened so it's tough to see that it did.

Plus, they make Draco a prefect. I've read fics where this was part of a plan to redeem Draco and make him take responsibility. But /still/. What message does it send to the other 299 (or however many) students of the school? At this point in time, Draco is a bully, openly racist, and occasionally violent. But he's rich, his daddy's famous, and he's a Quidditch star so suck it up, kiddies.

It's not until Draco attempts to kill Dumbledore that the adults finally act like there's a problem with his behavior. And even, they don't do anything! The cursed necklace that nearly kills Katie Bell and the poisoned brandy that nearly kills Ron, and they don't punish him. They might not have known that he used an Unforgivable on Rosmerta but they're still responsible for knowing because they didn't investigate. But the adults let Draco continue to create collateral damage. The takeaway is that the moment on the Astronomy Tower where Draco doesn't use the Killing Curse is the pivotal moment in his moral development, instead of the two times he did choose to commit murder and nearly killed Katie and Ron.

Wait wait wait... how do you think adults treated brats in the Hitler youth during the 30s in Germany? They don't care about racial slurs against Jews (muggleborns) because they hold resentment themselves or at least don't care much about what happens to those folks.

This (talking about HPs magical britain now) is a society in which a large percentage of society is wary of muggleborns, in favor of racial profiling and unfair treatment and all the upper echelons of society own household slaves.

Of course they are not going to stand up against racism! That's the point. It's a shit society, in which Voldemort can rise and have many fans and admirers.

Yes, it sucks that the teachers all look away and are inept in protecting their charges, canon doesn't criticize them enough for it, but it's not weird. It makes sense in context. Umbridge's inquisition squads should make this very clear. HP is not subtle.

** I remember in recent years seeing the obvious parallels between muggleborn/purebloods with black/white racism. I especially love the mixed opinions towards half-blood and it's similarity towards POCs. And then the most obvious "mudblood" insult and how in the Harry Potter world, it's similar to the n-word.

Seeing these parallels also gave me a newfound disgust towards people who shipped dramione because it the books (and even movies) it's clear that he hasn't improved his bloodist attitude, he just doesn't approve of people dying. I'm fairly sure he /still/ holds onto his prejudice towards muggleborns by the end of the series, and it probably takes a good few years to get rid of them (those kind of attitudes take time to let go even if you think you've gotten over them), but people ship them together /based/ on his canon character - which is really weird and messed up! Maybe it's also because I've never been a fan of the bully and former-victim romance, as we can forgive former bullies if they've truly atoned but to pursue a relationship off of that is ridiculous, so I don't like it, but imo it's very hard to make those fics both non-toxic and semi realistic to the characters.

I think it'd be nice for more people to see the series through these lens and even reevaluate tropes they'd find okay previously but might take some more time to accept in a different context. I know I have!

** Thanks for your post! It's very interesting to read how recent events have changed your mind. I think, as a subreddit, we should be able to discuss these types of topics without any name-calling involved (I'm looking at you down-voted posters).

The reason Voldemort was able to return at all was because the ministry never cleaned the slate in the first place. Voldemort was defeated, but the tensions in society that led to his rise were never properly addressed, by Dumbledore or anyone else. Dumbledore predicted that Voldemort would return again, but never did anything to attack his power base.

A mass arrest of any kind post war probably have exacerbated tensions. Even so, who's to say that another figure wouldn't have appeared in Wizarding Britain 10-20 after the events of the last book? Fanfic authors could definitely take a more realistic approach to this. There's just been a war; people are dead. It's unlikely that anyone would be jumping at the chance of holding hands and singing kumbaya.

I think the Muggleborn's in wizard society are a scapegoat for the miserable circumstances some wizards are probably living in. They definitely need reform, if not just getting rid of the ministry altogether. Their population is maybe 1000-2000, what do they need a large bureaucratic institution for? I think a council with democratically elected members, and a few offices at most could to the job just fine.

For sure. The first war resulted in decades of tension, the second war would be no different. In terms of redemption, I think that would be a cool second gen fic. If Potter and company manages reform that prevents more brainwashing in the next gen of purebloods, maybe I can see their kids form a radical movement for change.

** I can only speak about US racial issues from a very outside, less than educated, purely observatory standpoint, but here's my two cents on how it can maybe alleviate some part of how you're feeling.

Harry Potter's war does not really boil down to race war, or rather, a purity war, at least not to him. Harry certainly isn't one of the persecuted, and since the book is from his perspective, the purity aspect is often secondary. Voldemort, while the instigator of the radical purists, also has higher priorities, namely his immortality. Does he believe magical blood is superior to non-magical ones? Absolutely. But he's not die-hard enough to consider himself less worthy for being half-blood. Harry and Voldemort's motivations jointly drive the whole story, and they deal with the purism only when necessary, as in when it benefits or hampers them. That might explain why many fanfics don't touch on the issue as heavily as our depressing reality, Harry was never personally targeted because of this prejudice. If anything, in his life he received more bigotry for his wizarding side, from the Dursleys of course.

That said, I don't think you're being unreasonable at all. Maybe some of the fics just aren't that good, who knows. From my experience, good writing can overcome a lot of obstacles. I'm Chinese, and sometimes when I watch "Grave of the Fireflies" or "The Wind Rises", I think "it's cool that you can build your dream plane, but I'd rather you make one that doesn't drop bombs on my country dude", but I get over it quickly because the story is engaging.

Lastly I just wanna say, they're fanfics after all, and fanfics are often idealistic. It must be terribly hard to feel idealistic recently, to resonate with them, nothing wrong with it. I want to say it's gonna be just a phase, but there's no guarantee, some wounds don't heal 100%. But HP fanfics are vast so I'm sure there're cynical ones that fit your current mood. If not, you can always get writing.

*** Thank you for reminding me to step away a little bit and remember why I interact with HP and other forms of media in general, your perspective was really great to read :)

You're right, I think it's super important to draw it back to Harry's perspective in when discussing canon events. I believe when I read the series, the race/purity (they're one in the same to me; something you can't control that others have a historical problem with) was only secondary because Harry was meant to be the hero who rose up and advocated for those who could not. He had to focus on a lot of other shit because of his role as "hero," but for the rest of the Wizarding World fighting in the war, I always pictured to race/purity aspect to be very relevant to them. This may have just been that it was very relevant to me, and I assigned it more attention than it was meant to be given. It's very likely.

** I've thought about this a lot recently in reading fics. I'm not generally drawn to good guy, happy-ending narratives anyway (really love Crime & Punishment, Bonfire of the Vanities, "mind of multi-layered villain" type stories).

To me there seems to be a stronger element of classism than racism in DE comparisons. Consider someone like Blaise Zabini, a Black boy with a "famously beautiful" mother (who's killed half a dozen husbands) in Slytherin, so likely pureblooded.

I think that American readers see the stories through an American lens, where race is a bigger issue than class because there's no real American nobility (Kennedys, Rockerfellers, maybe, but they're so rare they don't permeate society, on average you're never going to come across someone 'higher born' than you if you're from the US, just richer). It's different in the UK, where there's still a very real sense of class divide, there's a bigger focus on heritage and who your family is.

** Yes, I agree.

Now let me start this off by saying, I love Draco Malfoy like a son. I empathize with his position, and have buckets of sympathy for the boy. He wasn't even really old enough to understand the full consequences of what was going on. And when he was 16 he was forced to become a Death Eater and go on this suicide mission. He was basically content, or as content as you could be in his situation, to become a murder, probably even die, to protect his family. He was selfless and brave; a fucking Gryffindor till the very end. Although he very much had some Slytherin traits. Thank god for that.

Let me also end that by saying that I constantly educate, write essays, and debate. and everything else I can do for feminism, blm, equal rights(this includes POC, queer people, women, etc.), and any other cause I support. I might be more willing to forgive, whether its because I'm white or because I grew up in the south or because that is just how my personality is, but if you aren't, for lack of a better phrase, over it, then you can bet your balls you will never be treated with anything but contempt with me. I respect your choices and opinions, except when they disrespect someone's very existence.

I know the family he's from. After all, it's a bit like mine. Not as dramatic of course, but still. At base, we're all a bit like him; growing up conditioned to certain views and beliefs, never understanding consequences until it's screaming in our face.

Anyway,

But I absolutely hate it when someone pulls an 'he was good all along'. Like, girl, what the fuck? No he wasn't. Sure, he wasn't evil, just a bit of a git. Sure, he got over it. Mostly. I mean, you can never really fully get over something like that. Not when it was such a pivotal force in his childhood.

Think of it this way

If we are told something over and over again, if someone important to us that we trust is preaching this thing, from our birth and up, then you are going to believe it as gospel. That's just basic psychology. With time and a bit of therapy you can break away from that mindset, but it will be damn difficult.

So this is why I prefer fics where he actually gets an arc.

If that's your thing, then I recommend:

linkao3(Men Who Love Dragons Too Much)

linkao3(Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer For Delinquents On The Run)

linkao3(The Man Who Lived)

linkao3(Temptation On The Warfront)

I was never a fan of how The Man Who Lived is written, it's hard to get into, but it's */THE/* story if you want a realistic arc for Draco. Drarry doesn't come in till much later, but its definitely worth checking out. I'm not exactly sure about Men Who Love Dragons Too Much nor Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer For Delinquents On The Run, but regardless of arc, they are brilliant stories that I definitely recommend. Hermione Granger's is also a bit hard to get into, but mostly because of the fact that it's completely au in the sense that he never went to Hogwarts. However, it is still a brill fic that's worth a read. Temptation is such brilliant all around, check it out.

*** Firstly, I would just like to say you have excellent taste in fics. The Man Who Lived in actually next on my list to read! Temptation on the Warfront is one of my favorite fics of all time, I recently read Hermione Granger's and thought it was pretty good, and I enjoyed Men Who Love Dragons Too Much. I know it's recommended everywhere, but I also love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]], especially the second half of the fic. The way the Wizarding World treated Draco in this fic sat well with me (even though I obviously felt bad).

I think the "good all along" approach to Draco is such a gross copout. I like what you said about the conditioning he went through for all his formative years. It's unfair to expect a teenager to turn their back on everything they grew up with for...what? That was another reason the "good Draco all along" route doesn't work, and simultaneously a reason why I really feel for canon Draco. What did the Light have to offer him, other than a less murderous leader? It's a lot to ask a kid to leave his family, his world views, and his friends behind because...he was afraid of murder? It was a war, and he would've been killing people regardless of what side he was on. There was never a true way out for Draco (yes I know "everyone has a choice," but come on), and I'm honestly not sure he would've taken it even if there had been.

That's what makes a good arc so great to read. I agree, he wasn't truly evil, but I would say it went further than being a git. Where does he fall between these two? I think it depends on how an author has him act and respond following the war, when he has the chance to break away from his family and become his own person. It's really great to when fics take time to think about it, and give an answer.

#+begin_quote
  However, if you have something to say about Draco and his redemption arc in fanfiction, I would love to hear it.
#+end_quote

I rarely, if ever, see any real 'redemption' in those kind of fics. It's always more along of the lines of "let bygones be bygones" and "it was a crazy time with death eaters, a dark lord and my parents made me do it anyway". It's all very superficial and the desire of the *author* to move on from that and get to *their* story shines through.

IMHO it's a very profound question that you ask: How can someone like Draco be redeemed?

I don't have a step by step answer for that, but I think it's very hard to do it if you work from 100% canon of the 7 years in the books. There's so much water under the bridge, and so many (missed) opportunities for Draco to take a different approach. He's not going to be redeemed by being nice to Hermione in the Ministry and feeling sorry about himself. You'd need way better writing than that.

What makes it worse is another thing that you mentioned: This idea of immediate acceptance after showing the first sign of regret. Apologizing after losing the civil war (which involved torture of inncoents and planned genocide) is like apologizing for getting caught. Of course they are going to apologize and try to play nice at that point, even non-Slytherins would. How could anyone tell if they are genuine?

Personally I found the idea that someone like Hermione or Harry has the moral obligation to give someone like Draco "a chance" after the canonical ending absolutely laughable. Actually it's the opposite: They have the obligation to be witnesses, give public account of his crimes and not let him get away with it by giving everyone puppy dog eyes. The idea that Harry should put in a "good word" for the Malfoys and downplay their numerous crimes is morally abhorrent to me.

Redemption during the war is more interesting: It makes a lot of sense to be wary of Slytherins, because they could be spies or planning betrayal. On the other hand, refusing to use these resources, because you hold a grudge at them is stupid (and a Harry who refuses them just because he's stubborn makes me incredibly mad). In any case: If their motivations are genuine the redemption is almost a given in those scenarios, because they actually risk something and have to endure hardships.

In this context it's not about whether black lives matter- it's a given that they don't, it's about whether mixed race lives matter or the lives of super genius black people could potentially rise to the level of being considered human.

Within this- most of the people who we see redeemed in fanfic are children. Draco and Friends- they're children. Seventeen is so so young. They've not DONE anything yet. They've been told a lot of things- they've been brought up to believe a lot of things- and believing those things has never stopped benefitting them. Why would they change- especially if the nearest thing they've met to a 'black person' is either someone who is at least 'white passing'?

It's actually an interesting question as to whether or not pursuing magic is effectively pursuing whiteness in this scenario. It poses the question as to whether or not Hogwarts is a particularly luxurious versions of the Canadian residential school systems to ‘educate' the First Nations people to isolate them from their culture and thus eradicate them.

The question then of ‘do you want to be a wizard?' is like ‘do you want to be white?'. Which, (and I note here, I am the whitest whitey who ever put mayonnaise on a sandwich) whilst I suspect that everyone would take the offer not to be in an oppressed group, there is a lot in the concept of ‘blackness' that I suspect that people wouldn't want to see dismantled. There is a culture- many cultures- there that is its own thing, and worth cherishing. That is to say- I don't think black people want to be white- they'd just like to be treated exactly the same as white people, so race isn't even an issue.

The Statute of Secrecy is literally a law in the HP-verse that keeps the worlds separate. You can't choose to be a muggle who can do magic. You can't come into the wizarding world on your own terms. Effectively, you have to choose between your blackness and white acceptance. Once you choose white acceptance, a degree of othering, micro aggression and stereotyping comes with the territory. Which is also why I suspect the wizarding world forgives.

The pure bloods don't really feel the problem, those who have links to muggledom are so used to being a minority that they don't feel secure enough to really hold anyone's feet to the fire.

That "Former" Death Eaters get to do or be anything but dead is an example of, well...privilege. Magical Britain still thinks, on some level, that the death of muggleborns isn't really a crime. Lucius Malfoy hosted a torture dungeon in his basement and willingly joined Voldemort the first time. His head should be on a pike.

Simple fact is: enabled or not, terrified, abused, or otherwise: anyone that ever bore a dark mark should have been brutalized at minimum. Student status be damned. Kids fought on both sides of the war, and I'm not particularly sympathetic towards Hitler Youth.

Lucius: Life in Azkaban, no possibility of parole. Good riddance.

Narcissa/Draco: Heavy fines on the Malfoy fortune, and Ministry seizure of a large number of "family" (Dark) artifacts from the Manor. Wand restrictions for 5 years (not rendering them completely Muggle, but at a pretty severe handicap). House arrest for 2 years, monthly check-ins with an Auror until 5 years of restriction are up.

They were one of, if not the, most prominent Voldemort supporting families, and while Narcissa and Draco should not go to Azkaban, I believe the Ministry will need to make an example out of them.

**** I don't have the links to back this up rn but I'm pretty sure in canon (if you consider JKR's post-publication writings and interviews canon) Lucius gets a very light sentence by giving information on pretty much all the other surviving Death Eaters.

Cursed Child also supports this-- the super powerful time turner is a result of Lucius's collaboration with Theodore Nott, which suggests Lucius was 1) at home (so house arrest isn't out of the question, but prison is) and 2) not under close surveillance (doubtful the Ministry would have okay'd that sort of project).

Jason Isaac's take on the character was that he drank himself into an early grave, but that he wasn't imprisoned because money protects people (sadly very true).

** I think of the Voldemort War and the post-war settlement in terms of Germany and the de-Nazification after the war. In canon we actually see none of that process, we just see Draco at the station in the epilogue, and people bitch and moan here about how unrealistic it is that he wasn't still in prison.

It is realistic. Most members of the SS - which is broadly equivalent to what he was - were held in POW camps for a bit after the war and then released. There was a notion of stripping them of some civil rights but that didn't last. Some Nazis were imprisoned for a handful of years. A few were imprisoned for longer, but only a very few. The number still imprisoned 19 years later was /really/ small. Go on, try to guess how many, I'll wait ...

...

...

3.

People here criticise stories that have someone from the winning side get into a relationship with an ex-Death Eater. "It's utterly unrealistic" they cry. Again, it isn't. There are so many post-War relationships out there between German soldiers, even SS, and citizens of the territories they conquered.

I knew someone (he's dead now) who was in the SS. He volunteered as a teenager, because he loved his country and had been told from a very young age that it was in danger from evil forces. He believed the lies, and did what he thought was right. Also, girls liked the uniform, which /really matters/ at that age. It was only later that he learned what he had been part of. He thought at the time that he was doing the right thing by guarding those who were hell-bent on destroying ordinary Germans like him, and by fighting resistance groups.

I see Draco as that misled teenager, who believed the lies. Yes, he loved the power, but couldn't see what it meant outside his own small world. And it's absolutely believable that he could be free, prosperous, in a happy relationship, and even (as he is in some stories) a politician.

Germany healed from its self-inflicted wounds by quickly and sincerely acknowledging what it had done, but also by not going down the route of ferreting out and harshly punishing the slightest infraction. Also consider the Truth and Reconciliation process in post-Apartheid South Africa. The situation in post-Voldemort Britain appears, from what little we know of it in canon, as if it could be similar to one of those, and I'm a bit disappointed to have not found any decent fics that deal with it.

Unfortunately I can't see the Trumpistas acknowledging their errors, which is I think a pre-requisite for what happened in West Germany and South Africa. Mind you, people would have said the same in early 1945 and early 1990.

*** I agree completely with you, that the post-Voldemort situation in magical Britain can be comparable to the post-1945 situation in Germany.

I have read accounts of family members from that time. All young boys went to the Hitler Youth. You and your family faced consequences that weren't worth it, if you didn't. If you didn't agree, you kept your head down and still went. You could /get/ "volunteered" to the Waffen-SS, if you were unlucky (making teenagers sign contracts under duress). Everyone who was of age and physically capable fought in the war in some capacity. You got out of that if you got injured enough, or if you worked in a job that was relevant to the war effort, say, an ammunitions factory.

Since a lot of people were involved in the war somehow, it wouldn't have worked out to punish every single one of them harshly. Yes, there should have been more of an effort to find and punish the worst offenders, instead of going back to normal as quickly as possible (and it's ridiculous that they're trying /now/ in a hurry before the last of them die. You missed your chance, guys). But not the young people who grew up under the regime and never knew better. Not the ordinary soldiers, or people who were just trying to get through a shitty situation.

But the most important statement I have read from one of the family members I mentioned is that his (pretty bad) time as a POW after the war finally taught him what the Nazis hadn't managed before. He came back broken, bitter and hateful. That's what I would imagine happening to a harshly-punished Draco. Instead of having a job, a family, and being a good member of society, he'd come back after 10-15 years of prison to nothing, and he'd hate and blame the Ministry and the Light side, instead of Voldemort as the actual culprit.

**** Not OP but harsher De-Nazification would have been probably immediately worse but better for Germany and the West overall.

Because of political reasons (the Soviet Union and communism becoming the next big enemy), many high ranking Nazi officials and war criminals got off scott-free and were allowed back into government service which led to a proliferation of far-right and Neo-Nazi elements in the police and military.

Worse, is that the image of Nazi Germany, ecspecially its military has been rehabilitated in popular Western media. The Wehrmacht and the SS both performed atrocities, but only the later was declared as a criminal organization while the former, as part of a campaign to justify forgiving war criminals I just mentioned earlier.

The Wehrmacht went from being a overstretched, bloated military with a reliable core, that frequently participated in war crimes led by overly ambitious tactically smart but strategically foolish generals having to constantly be reeled in by Hitler to achieve manageable goals (at least while Germany was on the offensive until 1942), to being the best military in the world which did not commit any war crimes with the best generals who were extremely hyper-competent but lost because of the Soviet “Asiatic Hordes”.

** I honestly don't think this is a great comparison, for myself. If you look at the history of the wizarding world in a vacuum, sure, but if you look at it more widely, I struggle. If you look at the history in combination with the real-world history of the witch hunts, and sources that say a lot of people died -- including in further sources from the HP world.

If you're talking about purebloods who grew up with this knowledge, where the entire year of a generation in four countries can fit in four dorms of ten people, and the majority of their population was wiped out, that's terrifying.

In real world comparisons, the Jews. The majority of our population was wiped out in WWII, some entire towns were lost. Multiple dialects were lost. We will likely never recover our numbers. The hate I've gotten for being half in my own community is severe. Jews who marry out have parents who worry about their children keeping the culture.

In the wizarding world, this ends up going to an extreme, where new blood is seen with fear and hesitance, leading to the blood purity issues. So you have a society persecuted against, then societally persecuting the people who come in from the society that persecuted them, and reacting against it. When you have Hogwarts teaching that "Witch Burnings didn't work and here's why,' when most were killed by hanging, while at the same time saying that the very great majority couldn't cast wandlessly, in a school with so many abandoned classrooms, and the two House ghosts who were killed by Muggles for witchcraft (Nick and the Friar) that begins to sound like propaganda.

Are the blood purity wars right? No, it is absolutely racism. It is racism /caused/ by racism. No one's right, but when you grow up on stories about how the Founders founded Hogwarts in the first place to protect the children, or hear stories about X relatives who were hung by muggles, this will lead to the kind of defense that's there, especially with how long-lived wizards are. Dippet, the headmaster before Dumbledore was born in 1632 and died in 1992. They then acted out toward the people coming from that society.

I think it's a struggle as to how people heal, but I think it will depend on how the writer is taking the muggleborns and half-bloods who were hurt and injured. Are they going to turn on the purebloods or not? Can they come to a satisfactory agreement? Or is the wizarding world doomed to a cycle of this? Discrimination against muggleborns leads to discrimination on purebloods, leads to discrimination against muggleborns...and on and on.

I honestly don't know, I don't have a good answer.

I'm a bit cautious on that take. I'm half German half Croat... evidentially, Germany has managed to redeem itself after WW2 pretty good pretty fast (although, I admit, we do have a growing Nazi problem since a decade or two), but the Balkans are still fucked even thirty years after all the wars.

What I don't know for sure: what did the world and Germany do different that it worked out? My only explanation is that there was one thing associated with "healing" - that perpetrators of violence and injustice /got brought to justice/. Jail times, asset confiscations, death penalty for the really serious high level Nazis, and that /fast/ - where the Balkan ICTY trials are /still ongoing/, after all these years.

**** Well. In the case of Germany, the first solution was to paper it over, and by "it", I don't mean trials for high ranking officials, but an entire people that went along with them. The second solution was a bit of spring cleaning in the late '60s, which together with the dying out of the old generation, resulted in good things. And of course, that "new generation" thing only works if this new generation is not taught the old grievances by their parents, which the German Erinnerungskultur and appropriate teachings in schools since then managed to do somewhat decently.

I would argue it's that combination -- the perpetrators honestly (or, as honest as possible) reckoning with their doings, and the rest of the world accepting this and /their/ new generation choosing to forgive. The European unification is a rather wonderful success story, yes.

As for the Balkans, my knowledge is more limited, but given the nationalist rhetoric in not a few places that can't be conducive to introducing a forgiving spirit in a new generation, plus, perhaps, /only/ 30 years having passed, this might explain the difference?

** There's the question of at what point people should be considered responsible for their own actions. There isn't a straightforward answer to this. If some toddler happens across daddy's gun and shoots someone, obviously the toddler is not the one at fault. But what about 11-year-old Draco being a racist? He never really had an opportunity to learn anything better. 17-year-old Draco obviously had qualms, but he was in too deep to see a way out at that point. He wasn't reveling in evil like Greyback and Bellatrix.

Now consider Lucius. We don't know the details of how he joined Voldemort, but we know that at one point he was an ignorant 11-year-old racist just like Draco. We like to think that we're inherently better than these villains, that if we were in that situation we'd do the right thing, but in practice most of us just follow in our families' footsteps without thinking too hard about it. I don't like this tendency to sort people into villains over there and good guys over here, because once we start thinking of ourselves as the good guys, we're less likely to question our own actions. We just assume that whatever we're doing must be right because we're the good guys.

*** I agree that the point a person becomes responsible for their actions can be contested, and that the consequences of an action may depend on the context of said action and events leading up to it. This is a heavily nuanced idea that is very relevant, but I fear it can easily be used as a way to pardon horrific acts (outside of HP, just look toward arguments made in defense of school shooters). I personally do not believe we are given enough details from canon to dissect Lucius, Bellatrix, Greyback, etc. and determine their own possibility for redemption, and nor do I particularly wish to do so. I think comparing them to Draco & friends is going to result in some pretty big assumptions. And like I said before, fuck adult Death Eaters.

Draco was in fact indoctrinated from a young age, pressured into a cult, and protected Harry from discovery in Malfoy Manor, but he /did/ take the Mark, attempt murder MULTIPLE times, and ultimately subscribed to racist ideas that played out as violent acts until the conclusion of the war. These should all be taken into account in creating a redemption arc! My problem is when an author glosses over it in an effort to get to romance, that's all.

And lastly, I do not believe war is a case of good vs. evil, but *let's be verryy cautious of our rhetoric when discussing the sides of a race war.* I hope you understand why /I/ am not interested at all in debating the morality of racism, only what we do following its effects for those who wish to be forgiven.

** This is harder than I initially thought.

On one hand, I want to say, "Dude, this is only occurring to you now?" and reference, for example, the Hitler Youth.

On the other hand, most of the really bad stuff Draco did he did under the threat of not just his life but also his parent's.

But then I remember:

#+begin_quote
  Harry, in contrast, is best friend's with one the major targets of Draco's racism, is a victim himself of the dude Draco's family works for and he almost lost Hogwarts due to the whole Basilisk incident in which I must remind you Draco was on the side of the basilisk. Oh, and Draco also deliberately persecutes Hagrid at every opportunity... although it must be said Hagrid is one of the most under-rated characters in fanfics so this probably isn't particularly relevant when looking at the fandom's evaluation of Harry's issues with Draco and/or Drarry. It might also pay to mention the whole Inquisitorial Squad thing and how much everyone hates Umbridge... Draco clearly didn't!
#+end_quote

That stuff doesn't go away. Draco chose to be like that. He may not have had much of a choice when it came to being indoctrinated by his parents, but he chose to be like this. From what we can tell Blaise Zabini has exactly the same attitudes as Draco and expresses them to other Slytherins. But does Harry even notice Blaise otherwise? Nope! It rather positions, therefore, Blaise as a Draco who chooses to do bigotry different.

(Of course, perhaps Blaise just bullied different people to Draco... and Harry doesn't notice that due to his social circle consisting of two people, four if you include Fred and George, with a small expansion after OOTP.)

I think it's unfair to treat Draco as being no different to Bellatrix, Umbridge, Fenrir or people like them. But I also don't think he deserves redemption. He's not like Dudley where the problem is focussed on Harry with a side order of generic bullying; Draco systematically incorporates his political attitudes into his behaviour.

So... to my mind, redemption for (a canon resembling) Draco stops at keeping him out of prison. There's too much baggage on Draco's end and on the part of Harry, Ron and Hermione. If you want Draco and, I dunno, Seamus to become buddies or even to hook up (again, assuming canon resemblance), /maybe/... but beyond that? Draco isn't like Zuko

With the other Slytherins? Well, it depends. I could see something with a Blaise/muggleborn ship where the tension of the romance storyline is that the muggleborn thinks Blaise was a good Slytherin/pureblood, but obviously we (and/or Blaise) know differently. It still seems best to avoid actually completing that pairing as a conclusion of this kind of storyline... it speaks of rewarding characters for meeting the barest of standards of human decency. It's like Juliet, Naked (a film) where (spoilers) Chris O'Dowd's character says to Annie that he wants kids as though the film's just been about how not wanting kids was the problem with the character and therefore where saying this makes it all better. But, really, that moment is just highlighting the character's almost total absence of redeeming features and Annie says, thankfully, "no".

The moment of redemption wouldn't come, therefore, with the kiss/a wedding/sex/other standard romantic crescendo, but instead where Blaise is honest and forthright and accepts that the relationship failed because of his problem/s rather than the muggleborn's hangups or because they were a muggleborn. I guess the redemption could be "telling the truth" but then I sort of feel like we're making the story about dishonesty and thus we're not fixing Blaise's racism but, instead, his dishonesty. Or, alternatively, we're giving him a new reason to need redeeming as we're trying to redeem him.

(Obviously there are alternative characters to Blaise who we can use for this purpose. Some of whom are less problematic or, at least, where we can suppose the extent of their issue was being friends with bigots.)

That being said, I have read Manacled where... ooh, boy... I'm not exactly sure Draco is redeemed but my point is that, contrary to what I've said, it's a Dramione story that is even more fucked up than canon compliant Dramione. But, I guess, at least it's a Draco who is a double agent for the Order.

*** Thank you for responding to this. I've seen the WW2 parallels for a while in the context of understanding the actual gravity of what Voldemort was trying to do, but I think it took my personal experiences of this year to really think about what comes after the villain has been defeated. This may also have been some naivety, but I came into the fandom very young, and am trying to reassess my views of it.

I do ultimately think that for canon Draco, dismissal from Azkaban is the way to go. Beyond this makes me a bit more hesitant, especially because there is never any discussion of him ever fully dropping these world views (I could be forgetting things from Cursed Child it's been a while since I've read it). And, as you said, Draco has /been/ upholding these beliefs for years. Him joining Voldemort was never far-fetched or shocking.

I think your argument about Blaise is one that I see mirrored in every fic with a Slytherin who received little character development in the canon. Canonically, we can try to guess based off snippets of dialogue where they fell on the spectrum of Voldemort supporting, but because this would be a guess, their punishment following the War would also be extremely up in the air. There's less for these characters to apologize for, and it makes the fic easier to progress when you don't have to deal with as much of the "sorry I was racist and promoted violent actions against people like you for 7 years."

I'm actually in the middle of Manacled right now, and it kinda inspired me to make this post lol. It's my first Dramione fic, and it was the one I was recommended to read the most. It is, quite frankly, difficult to read, and if I were not reading so I could discuss with my book club, I would not finish it. I hate that that form of Draco is supposed to be redeemed. Like, hate hate hate hate it. That may be because I'm used to the Draco Drarry puts out, but fics that make him WORSE than he was in canon do not elicit any sympathy from me.

response was because I forget that not everyone reads mostly canon compliant stuff. When I wrote the Drarry comment I quoted I was (outside of that paragraph) quite careful about disclaimers like "canon resembling" but it just didn't occur to me now (even though you pointed out that Drarry is something you read). I got a little better towards the end of that version of my comment (I deleted what I'd initially written and started over) but I didn't really reflect on what that meant. And so:

#+begin_quote
  This may also have been some naivety
#+end_quote

It's not naivety... it's the limit of what a conditional reasoning machine is capable of. As you say, you came across Harry Potter in one context and then exposed to a new stimulus, updated how you thought about it. That's how reasoning is meant to work (just ask Rational!Harry from HPMOR... no, I'm not being ironic here, this is something I think HPMOR gets right, it's just that HPMOR doesn't really follow through on that). We can't expect ourselves to draw links between disparate things we know /by thought alone/... at least, not in every case. There is a strong tendency among moralisers (including those who write in peer reviewed journals) to forget (or even outright reject) the relevance of what humans are actually capable of... and I suspect this would be true even if they're the same people who say an otter's eating a sea urchin alive isn't evil, just the state of nature (or, heck, the circle of life).

(Aargh, dammit, it was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/discworld/comments/a6vjia/my_husband_loves_this_vetinari_quote_so_i_had_it/][salmon not sea urchin.]])

To be clear, what I'm trying to say is that every time I tried to justify my first response ("dude, Hitler") all I could really do was find reasons why that was incredibly unfair. All of us are stuck in our own heads, not because we're self-absorbed, but because we cannot use someone else's head to do our thinking: we're trapped by our experiences and the present stimuli.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

As far as I remember, published books (counting CC here) do not establish this. What CC does establish is that Draco behaves differently and Harry, Ron and Hermione moved on from him mentally (they've clearly heard of but never had anything other than a passing curiosity about Scorpius in the Epilogue, for instance).

Another oversight on my part. Even though I had that little Blaise theory and thought about, for example, Pansy, Flint and Theodore a bit in that context, I never took it that next step that this is maybe the sort of fic you were talking about reading.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I've never read (nor watched) The Handmaid's Tale but somehow I doubt it's quite as... focussed on the mechanics of the regime as Manacled is. I suspect (or remember? e.g. from an author's note) the author's intention was to make everything seem pretty procedural to make Draco seem less bad. But, like, I don't think you can do much about that set up without imperiusing Draco.

But as I said... I can't actually remember if Manacled's Draco is redeemed as such. Having just skimmed the last normal chapter it would seem that he gets what he wants and Hermione excuses everything which is redemption... based on the principles of (a) he had to do the bad stuff and (b) he was on the right side, in the end.

On reflection, utilitarian justifications are always a difficult situation... you see it in how the fandom's torn on Dumbledore (even though Dumbledore is very, very clearly a paternalist not a utilitarian, the fandom treats him as a utilitarian). As a consequentialist, I guess I generally accept the premise of that basis for a redemption arc but, honestly, I prefer it if they end up dead like canon Snape since it requires less soul searching as a reader (I mean, I finished Manacled because I was reading it, what does that say about me?).
