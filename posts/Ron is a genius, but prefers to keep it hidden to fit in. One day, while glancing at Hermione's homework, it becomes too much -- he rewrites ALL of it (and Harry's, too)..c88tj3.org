Perhaps he spots way too many errors in Hermione's work -- and don't get him started on Harry! As the frustration mounts inside of him, Ron tries his utter best to ignore it.


** How dare you suggest Ron is anything more than a character to bash? Unbelievable!

I love this prompt though lol.

** Another interesting detail could be that all those times when Ron accidentally predicts the future or says something true while joking are just him trying to plant ideas into his friend's minds about stuff that he has already figured out.

I love this prompt a lot but I'd like a variation to this prompt even more where rather than hiding his genius, he's just too lazy to explain it. For instance, he figures out that Tom Riddle probably killed Myrtle and tells his friends so but they just take it as a joke and he's too lazy to correct them.

*** A great jumping off point for this that I've never seen anyone use is Ron being attacked by the brains in the Department of Mysteries.

**** I know I've read a fic where one of the brains that attacked Ron was a renowned Potions Master and he gets all the knowledge and such. It was definitely a subplot. I think the fic was linkffn (Harry Potter, Heir of Gryffindor by Brent Braten). IIRC this fic had a lot of philosophy. I remember liking it when I read it, but on a recent reread liked it less. It was originally published in 2004, so it is likely that some of the OCCness and maybe abundance of tropes is due to that. Some fics were great for their time but didn't age well.
