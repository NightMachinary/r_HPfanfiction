It starts with a teacher saying his aunt was right, and that he is nothing but a problematic hooligan. This was after he couldn't turn in homework, again, thanks to Dudly ripping it up. So, he snaps.

Of course, he's not really insane, but acts it up. What are they going to do to him? Beat him, starve him, throw him in the cupboard? No wait, they already do that!

I can imagine Harry, instead of vacuuming, opens the vacuum and dumps the dust everywhere. When serving dinner, he drops fancy China full of food right on the floor. And being tossed in his cupboard starts screaming marathons, which, thanks to magic, is amplified and Harry never seems to need water or gets a sore throat.


** Business by esama. Harry decides that, since everybody thinks he's a delinquent---a criminal---he might as well be one. He's astounded to find out there's no underworld in the Wizarding World. Yet. linkao3(1113588)

**** Harry works /extremely/ hard at being lazy and is also absolutely loyal to his cause. He invents devices and always has a scheme running on how to avoid work. He has an iron-clad schedule of naps that he keeps religiously. He has a sharp eye for talent, since he has to know who has the best skills to help him do nothing. He is a smooth talker since he has make up so many excuses for missed homework and other missed obligations.

I would argue that Harry the Hufflepuff actually works way harder than a regular hufflepuff and especially cannon Harry.

The second is that Harry thinks lupin might be a Transvestite or cross dresser, because he mistakes lycanthropy for pms symptoms. Not transphobic, Harry doesn't give a crap that he might be, just feels embarrassed that he got it so wrong.

********** I knew a guy named Mark who stopped being my friend because of my viewpoint, though. When I first met him, he was a she named Mars (I never actually asked what it was short for, looking back). Then one day he brought up the fact that he wanted to be called Mark from then on, interrupting me in that hesitant, but rushed way of someone ripping off the bandaid, and my response was "oh." /shrug/ "so anyways, Mark, then. /same exact question/?"

He stopped sitting next to me in class, wouldn't talk to me in the halls, avoided me at lunch, and I think he tried to start a rumor that I was fetishizing him or something? I did realize that I was a bit overly blunt in my disregarding of it being a rather big step for him, which is why I still feel guilty over it a decade later (geez, high school was THAT long ago???), but I kinda blame that on how I was raised (I tend to disregard lost limbs just as easily, but I've usually been thanked for not staring or asking questions). I wish I could go back and instead say something that would let Mark know that I was happy that he was doing what he felt needed to be done, and that no one's opinion on his body was worth regard other than his own.

Another (online) friend started calling me a transphobic a-hole because I didn't want to get into a conversation about the "politics" of the "label" trap. That's a landmine I don't want to deal with, because that's just nothing I can say that would ever satisfy anyone about it, because it isn't something I've ever had to deal with, so I can't give a good opinion on it. It's like asking me to describe my experiences as a gangster when the worst trouble I've ever gotten into at school was that I "read too much." I'm a fantasy and scifi nut, not the type to go traipsing about in political minefields.

*********** If it helps, coming out, and even just being out, is a huge minefield. Sometimes we get a little too trigger-happy, because we're so accustomed to people being two-faced. And most people who say they don't want to talk about labels, or don't believe in them, etc, turn out to be the type who think non-binary people are men or women. And it's so common to stumble across such negativity.

Just today I stumbled across a post on a subreddit I frequent that was all cis people patting themselves of the back for having an “intellectual civil discussion” about how non-binary people, and many binary trans people, are just confused and need to stop bothering them. It's everywhere, even in liberal places, and it's....disheartening. You learn to stop trusting people. You learn to start snapping at the first sign of betrayal. I certainly make that mistake sometimes.

That's not true for every abused child. True, there are those who get quiet and try to avoid getting hurt. Those are the children who are often overlooked in the system, because as a teacher you can never be sure: is that just a shy kid or is there more behind it?

But there is also the other category who start to act out outside of the place where they are abused. They start to hurt others like they are hurt at home. It's not a conscious decision like you have written. It is more like pent up aggression which they can't let lose at home so they act out at other places. They are much easier to spot as a teacher (if you care to look) because behind every child who is hurting other children there is usually a story why they do that: abuse, negligence or the total lack of boundaries at home. In my experience most children are just a mirror of their environment.

****** Thanks for pointing that out. As an adult who was an abused child that he up with other abused children I can vouch that meekly complying with the abuse is only one of many responses kids have.

Not the same people who clearly hold the abusive power over them and can easily hurt them tenfold back whenever they act slightly out of line.

edit: I mean, sure you can write it like they try to rebel against the people who abuse them, but then the next logical step would be to change scene and have Harry be in his cupboard, with serious whipping marks down his back from a belt, bleeding badly and sobbing in pain, starvation and agony.

******* From my understanding in the books, the Dursleys didn't beat him as we believe physical abusers do. Yes, he was denied food, but not actually starved. Yes, they were rough with him but not to the point of full on beatings. The worst was the verbal abuse.

So not actually experiencing the worst, he still might see destruction as a way to get attention, especially if it is a much younger Harry.

******** the concept of this prompt was that the abuse also included physical abuse, as mentioned in the post in the sentence

#+begin_quote
  'Of course, he's not really insane, but acts it up. What are they going to do to him? Beat him, starve him, throw him in the cupboard? No wait, they already do that! '
#+end_quote

So we are going by the assumption they are willing to physically abuse him and thus it can get worse.

********* Yeah, but I was more trying to phrase that as something from a child's view. He's taking things to an extreme because that's how he sees it. I'm sorry. I did see this more on the crack side for stories.

********* Remember, he does specifically mention that Petunia has tried to hit with the skillet, and he avoided it. It's said in a very matter-of-fact manner, as if she had done so many times before. If true, then she had to have landed at least one blow to his head for him to learn that she REALLY WOULD hit him and wasn't clowning around. So, yes, they did physically abuse him. That they condoned Harry Hunting, where Dudley and co hunt him down, is also physical abuse, second hand, because I don't think Dudley and company wanted to kiss Harry when they caught him.
