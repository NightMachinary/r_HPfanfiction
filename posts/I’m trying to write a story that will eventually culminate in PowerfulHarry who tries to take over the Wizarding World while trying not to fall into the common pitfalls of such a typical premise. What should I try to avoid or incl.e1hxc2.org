So a couple months ago I decided to write my first HP fanfic based off of one of DZ2's challenges. Now it's been taken down since then, but the basic premise was that Harry would receive a different wand, that was actually the real Deathstick while Dumbledore's wasn't. I know that he doesn't have the strongest writing, but I thought it was interesting so I wanted to try my hand at it.

Without going into to many details, I want to try and expand on some of the lore in HP, while also creating new feats in magic, similar to the Mind Arts or The Mystery of Magic. The main thing I'm worried about is falling into common tropes, many of which I hate. For example, I want to write Ron as a good friend, and keep the level of complexity that Snape and Dumbledore's have to their characters without bashing anyone. I also don't want to have Harry be some kind of instant Uber-powerful wizard who's a jackass, but lead into his development as a character. I haven't started writing yet, because I want to finish my plans for the story first. The two main ideas I've had so far to avoid the common tropes are “remember I'm writing about 11 year olds”(the plan is to have Harry grow into his role, sort of like the fic is his origin story) and “Keep people in-character”(So I'm not immediately bashing anyone). I feel like that's a good start, but I wanted to hear other opinions, so if you guys could give some advice that would be great.


** One basic advice I can give is to make Harry have to work really hard for things. Don't have him start off as super-rich, or politically/magically powerful, force him to start from a very precarious position within wizarding society (i.e. one wrong move could destroy his ability to get what he wants done within certain groups for a long time) and let us see him struggle and fail sometimes, so that big accomplishments actually have weight.

*** I agree with this.

In one fic, I made him politically incompetent and every time he spoke, he set himself back like three steps. He literally tried to unite a group and ended up turning them against him and he was never able to sway them back and they ended causing him a massive headache later on.

Flaws are excellent. Every 'bad' guy has flaws.

*** Or choose a more covert way where Harry vanishes (eg after the war) and trains/plots in seclusion or carries out stuff under a fake identity. It does not have to be the regular "slowly work your way to the top" path, be it for skill, power or influence.

Let's say that the Order is to depleted to force changes after the war. So Harry disappears from the general public. One or two years later, Ministry collaborators start to disappear. At first, it seems random, an accident here, a pub brawl gone wrong there, but slowly a pattern becomes apparent. And Harry moves from the simple enforcers and easy plans to more elaborate plots and more difficult targets. And then he returns to the public, promising to bring that killer to justice while using his powers for more and more elaborate actions until Umbridge (or whoever else you choose to turn into the leader) and everyone serving her is defeated. Or even just use the general feeling of dread to get popular support and then begin the "work to the top" arc.

The rise to power does not have to be linear. It can stagnate followed by a rapid rise or a good start followed by stagnation afterwards. That even translates to the training montage, as Harry seems rather adept at defensive magic compared to his contemporaries.

** Be careful about your protagonist being too clever in finding previously unexploited loopholes and power-ups. A good rule of thumb when using magic or some magical law to obtain a power-up, solve a problem without difficulty, or in general when introducing new magic, one should ask several questions:

1. Keeping in mind that canon characters know more about magic than you do (even if you might know some factoids that they don't), why didn't the characters do that thing under similar circumstances in canon? (Remember, 1 in 4 wizards is very interested in obtaining power with low effort. They are called "Slytherins".)
2. How would society be different if others could do what the protagonists are about to do? Is it (whether in canon or in your fic)? If not, why not?
3. Would the antagonists be in the position to anticipate it, and what countermeasures would they take?
4. If others can't do it and/or can't anticipate it, why not?

One should not proceed one has found satisfactory answers to all of these questions.

For example, much of conflict and adversity in canon is concerned with whom to trust and to believe, both for the protagonists and for the general public. If it could be solved with a "Wizarding Oath", why didn't everyone use it?

*** While this is generally a great writing advice, I think at least #2 needs some modifications or leniency when applied to potterverse. If you tried, for instance, to apply it to the canon itself, the entire setting would fall apart. Almost all magical spells and abilities carry plot-hole inducing implications if you dig too dip.

**** That's where #1 comes in: canon characters know more about magic than you do. In particular, they know more about its limitations and/or costs---and their own limitations in applying it---than you do.

So, if it looks to you that some magical spell or ability carries a plot-hole inducing implication, that's not because it actually does. If it did, some canon characters would have exploited it, and then the world would be different. Therefore, the spell or ability in question must have limitations and/or costs of which you, a Muggle, are not aware.

*** This might not be a good suggestion, but what about if sirius died in year 3 instead of living and that puts Harry on track to take over the wizarding wrold.

It will probably start like this - Harry is very VERY angry, but he is still quite optimistic and childlike compared to his future self, and he is working to revolutionise the wizarding law.

His revolution (he's only doing things like protests and gaining awareness at this point) seems to be gaining traction. He starts working towards his goal.

But several tragedies/ big eevents happen along the way which changes his view a bit like this

1st tragedy / big event . Not only the wizard justice system is flawed, the entire ministry of magic is

2nd tragedy / big event - The society and pretty much everything in the wizarding world is quite flawed

3rd T/BE - Probably after he starts expanding into a different country, and visiting them, probably after a while he realizes that this is in other countries, and slowly he will begin to think this of the whole world

4rd T/BE - He can't trust anyone anymore. He realizes he'll have to be careful with his secrets. Of course, he'll have very close freinds like Hermione and Ron who he has already, but he will be wary of making more

5T/BE - Something enormously big happens, which makes him feel incredibly alone in the world for a while. It seems like the whole world's against him

6T/BE - Even more things happen, Harry starts to slowly lose his grip on reality, but he is still clever and won't lose his sanity. He might seem a bit cracky but can get serious when he wants to be. He starts to take on even more extreme views

7T/BE - He goes full on 'The Nightmare Man' mode.

This story probably might be filled with absolute pain and suffering. Be careful - be sue to balance it out with happy normal days as well. Maybe something like a spectacular school festival that the golden trio sets up with the help of their freinds brightens up the story. The story might slowly get darker and less happy, or it could go abruptly dark with a huge turn of events, or anygthing in between. There are so many different choices!

These tragedies could be anything - Someone close dying, a plague, finding a muggle and muggleborn children rapecamp for purebloods, anything. They just need to be well thought out on how they will impact the story, Harry, his thinking, and several other factors. Note these are just guidelines, not rules. They can be bended and molded and modified to fit what you make and can be made better. I may be even wrong.

You can also shuffle these events around, but in an order that make sense. Also, a character's death in two different circumstances will be very different, e.g a close character who dies at the hand of a traitor will make him realize he can't trust many more people, and if that close character died in different circumstances, e.g lucius malfoy, he will realize something different.

** To write Ron as a good freind, you might want to list bad and good traits of his.

I'kll try, but I'm quite bad at this:

Strengths

Freindly

Funny

Doesn't jump to conclusions (Which seems to be a huge trait in HP as pretty much all the characters do that)

Willing to stand up to ANYONE who is against Harry

He makes Harry very happy, and without him Harry may have remained quite timid, like neville used to be.

Weaknesses

Poor manners

Inability to think of others emotions

Kind of mean at times

Lazy

Reminder - I don't remember a time Ron was really arrogant. Why try to put the traits of MALFOY on an opposite, a WEASLEY?

** - no hypocrisy --- the MC shouldn't judge different groups of people by different standards, especially when one of these groups includes himself or he's the only member in that second group.

  - the MC can be incorrect and develop incorrect notions and opinions, but he should be confronted with criticism from other characters and / or be facing setbacks because of them until he's forced to readjust his views
  - however, also strive to avoid making the story into a political soapbox for your own opinions (no matter which way they're leaning). One good (if difficult) way of doing this is by making all characters grey instead of black and white. If the reader has to pause and think why what a particular character in your story is doing is wrong or counterproductive, then you're doing a good job of not depicting cartoon villains and heroes. It's difficult because stories like this will also tend to be less enjoyable / more difficult to read, so it's a tight balance to juggle.

- no intuitively accessible answers to hard problems. E.g. if the MC is trying to solve some mystery or develop some scientific theory, he has to actually work through the steps of logical reasoning and trial and error to arrive at the right answer instead of somehow getting it "because his intuition was telling him so"
- no sadism --- the MC can blackmail, torture, kill, etc, --- but only if there really is a valid reason for him to be doing so. One thing that's definitely not a valid reason is for their own gratification. See also: no false justification and no hypocrisy.

  - no torture falsely justified as punishment (e.g. when instead of just killing a DE the MC decides to first torture them as some kind of supposed punishment for DE's past crimes)
  - generally no justification of MC's actions by acting like the crimes of the victim somehow serve as a valid excuse and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence][indulgence.]] E.g. if the MC has to sacrifice someone for a ritual, he has to be cognizant and aware of what they are doing, instead of, for instance, finding a muggle serial killer and then acting like their moral high ground is somehow making their own committed murder better. Many fanfiction stories that fail this point also tend to make the MC "play with their victim" (taunting, informing them that this is happening because of the victim's past crimes, etc) before torturing / killing them.

- no canon stations repetition --- Quirrel siccing a troll, the MC ending in the mirror room despite their intentions, people learning about MC's snek-speak during Lockhart's duel, the basilisk petrifying a bunch of people without killing anyone, Lupin being an idiot with his potions, and so on. If no /actual/ changes are happening throughout your MC's school years when you compare them to canon, then you need to revamp your entire plot design.

  - also please try to avoid prophecies determining conflict outcomes and character actions
  - this one can be a demotivating advice, so maybe just ignore it. Try to design your entire plot from beginning to the end before commencing with chapter 1. Otherwise you'll be more likely to write the relatively easy part and then get a writer's block when you reach sections that are difficult to write or continue the global plotline from.

#+begin_quote
  keep the level of complexity that Snape and Dumbledore's have to their characters without bashing anyone
#+end_quote

You'll probably have to give the MC some unique and powerful ability or artefact to make it possible for him to become a Wizarding emperor in a setting that has a competent set of characters (including VD and Dumbledore).

** Don‘t go the Indy!Harry path, if you start chapter1 with Harry entering gringotts and finding out he is actually Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell-Griffindor-Slytherin-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Lestrange, rightful heir to the magical british throne, with a billion galleons and majority shares in the prophet, hogwarts and the ministry, there isnt really anything left to be done in chapter2 (except assembling the harem, because obviously he has dozens of marriage/consort/concubine contracts waiting for him in his vault, too.. ugh).

He should start with very little, so that there is room for conflict as he conquers britain, not just him walking over everyone.

He also needs a realistic motivation as to why he his driven to do this, the general incompetence of everyone in the books lends plenty material there.

Now the next part is maybe just me, but I really dislike it when:

The goblins have magic that takes care of all the horcruxes and heal Harry from malnutrition and magical blocks, and kill all death eaters without any problem.

The houseelves can be invisible spies that rampage across britain unhindered because noone except Harry knows they can do that.

The RoR gives Harry access to books written by Grindelwald or Ravenclaw and he is suddenly completely overpowered.

He finds portaits of his parents/other relatives, I just don‘t like that. Either limit them to some kind of echo or just don‘t include them, I can‘t put it to word right now, but its creepy and weird.

He has magic blocks on him that he gets removed and kazaam he is Merlins.

He is a parselmouth, so a pet snake or a variety of snakes for venom or stuff are perfectly reasonable. Please don‘t give him a magic viper that for some reason can fly, turn invisible, speak telepathically, teleport and sing opera. No way that god of a snake is just chilling in privet drive/diagon alley.

Magical trunks with 7 compartments, with enough room inside for a small country. Magical trunks are cool, but if you put everything that anyone could ever want inside, why bother leaving? Big nono for me if overdone. Library is ok. A big ass mansion with fields to grow wheat and cattle, and a quidditch pitch is not.

What else.. Ahh yes.

I absolutely hate the trope that magical britain is this backwater place in the magical world that noone actually cares about or takes seriously, and any other country is just so much better.

I hate even more so the idea that muggles are superior to magicals, the atom bomb is a thing yes, but wizards can apparate into any and all government buildings, read all the important info from your head before turning you into a traitor/mole/sleeper agent with a spell or potion. I also don‘t believe for a second that a capable wizard wouldnt be able to shield against bullets.

I think I went slightly off topic in my little rant here, sorry. (._.)

** Here's the big secret to writing. As long as your prose is good and your characters are compelling, you can get away with literally whatever bullshit you want in the plot and worldbuilding departments and people will still read it. Someone once challenged Jim Butcher to write a story about the most ridiculous concept they could think of, a crossover between a lost Roman legion and Pokemon, which resulted in the bestselling [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Alera][Codex Alera]] series. See also Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, or Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, which are two of the most commonly recommended fics on this sub while still absolutely indulging in all the tropes that people claim to hate.

*** *Codex Alera*

Codex Alera is a fantasy book series by Jim Butcher. The series chronicles the coming-of-age of a young man named Tavi in the realm of Alera, an empire similar to Rome, on the world of Carna. Every Aleran has some degree of command over elemental forces or spirits called furies, save for Tavi, who is considered unusual for his lack of any. As the aging First Lord struggles to maintain his hold on a realm on the brink of civil war, Tavi must use all of his intelligence to save his family from diverse enemies.

Avoid Pureblood lords trope.

Most important thing in any take over fic is you should have loyal people in every department. Harry using his fame to install his upper class students in good jobs was a great way to infiltrate government.

Harry must have one friend with morals, who can keep him from going extreme to acquire his goals. Hermione/Luna fits in to this perfectly.

Money was important for any campaign to be successful. Create a legal/semi legal way business to earn money.

Powerful reason/beliefs/ideals/cause that can rally people with little effort. Voldemort promised great power to dark pureblood families who then rallied for his cause. Fear of Voldemort drove many people towards Dumbledore.
