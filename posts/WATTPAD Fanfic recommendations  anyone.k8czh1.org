** As I have learned over the past 14 years, "good fanfic" and "on wattpad" are mostly mutually exclusive. But maybe thats just me.

**** This one is wolfstar and the writting is genuinely good. Like really good. I was surprised to find such quality on Wattpad tbh. [[https://my.w.tt/KatcjsUc1bb]]

Ginny time travels to Marauders Era. Not sure how good the quality is but the chapters seem to be fairly short. [[https://my.w.tt/VJKhMJyd1bb]]

Teddy Lupin writes letters to his parents. [[https://my.w.tt/SqFhInUd1bb]]

First book of the Marauders Series. I think their good. [[https://my.w.tt/WF9WnF7d1bb]]

Sirius x OC:

Don't remember much about this one except that I thought it is cute. [[https://my.w.tt/eUx10upe1bb]]

I binge read this one. So I enjoyed it but I can't vouch for the quality. [[https://my.w.tt/Hf2kp3ue1bb]]

I don't remember reading this. [[https://my.w.tt/mWQpwAze1bb]]

I have more but those came to mind first

**** Oh and I just saw your requested little to no romance . I'm sorry but at least the Marauders series is more adventure I think? And in the Teddy Lupin fic has just the letters. Nox is focused on pre-Wolfstar relationship and getting together. Tho it's heavily focused on introspection.
