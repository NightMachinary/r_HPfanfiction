Read plenty Hermione time travel to the marauder era, and a few Harry one but I want more. Fun stories where he tries to change the future. Over 60k wording please. Don't mind slash as long as it's not too graphic

Thanks!


** The only one I can think of that I liked was [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8315797/1/Gray-Skye-Mourning][Grey Skye Mourning]] a Snarry fic where Harry timetravels to the past. It's actually really good, although the end is a bit sappy. linkffn(8315797)

Is love strong enough to overcome the pain from the past and ensure Severus' survival? Time-Travel fic. SSHP - COMPLETE.
