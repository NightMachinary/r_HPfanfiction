:END:
hi everybody! I'm searching for a fanfic from, I would guess, the early aughts. Its AU (I think Voldemort never fell, Harry may be dead), Harry's generation should be young adults.

One crucial thing that I believe may help identify this story is the fact that the death eaters had different ranks, one of which was riders, and their mounts were called ‚night mares'. Draco Malfoy may have been one of them.

Although that doesn't really jive with her name, Cho was of Japanese heritage (...yeah) and I remember a scene - I think it was a flashback - of her performing a tea ceremony for Cedric (?). Someone calls her butterfly a lot, which is sort of her motif; it is revealed at some point that she turned into a succubus (?), a scene in which she is again likened to a butterfly, but here because of the insect's true ugly face. She is also some sort of spy.

POV switches between characters, if I remember correctly. Generally pretty dark story. May be unfinished.

Sorry if this is convoluted. Hope someone knows what I'm talking about.

Stay safe, stay sane
