There are countless fics where Harry goes back in time, relives his Hogwarts years and does it “better” but most of the time it's pretty crazy and ooc filled with annoying cliches and tropes in HP fanfic. So what do you think canon Harry would really do if given the chance to go back, how do you think he would act, what he would try to change etc? Let's discuss!


** Tell Dumbledore everything and have him take care of all the problems.

*** Yup. The only /real/ problem is the "horcrux" in Harry's scar. Harry might be fucked on that front, especially if he returns to a time before Voldemort's resurrection (where he took Harry's blood into himself and thereby provided Harry with a /potential/ anchor to life).

Even if the blood anchor is still in place, and even if they could arrange for Voldemort to use a wand which Harry was the master of to cast the spell, it's not clear that Harry could replicate the ability to survive the Killing Curse. The very fact that he was cynically attempting to engineer his own survival changes the moral context of the act.

I personally doubt that magic will grant plot armour to someone who is attempting to trick it or otherwise game the system. If you want magic to treat you as the hero of the story, you need to be making a genuine sacrifice out of moral principle. Which is why it was so important for Dumbledore to trick Snape into tricking Harry into thinking that the plan was for Harry to die rather than survive. Knowledge of Dumbledore's true plan would have foiled that plan.

I don't know about that part. Didn't Dumbledore say that he didn't know if Harry would actually survive when they met in Kings Cross? He said he guessed.

I think Dumbledore thought there was at least a possibility of Harry's death.

***** He wasn't certain, but it had better odds of turning out well than any other plan (at least as far as he was aware).

** Canon Harry would probably make getting Pettigrew his first priority or, if he isn't able to do that, tell Dumbledore about Sirius being innocent. Whether that would be good or bad is up for debate.

** Hard to say. The most logical thing would be to go to Dumbledore and tell him everything about Horcruxes and co so that they can take care of that right away. Catching Pettigrew early on and freeing Sirius should also be easy. He'd probably try to get Snape to like him and get him to tell him more about his mother.

But if everything went smoothly and was just a sped up perfect version of canon, it would be rather boring. There are a few problems, though.

The biggest problem would probably be getting rid of the piece of Voldemort‘s soul inside of him. Easy if Harry being from another time means it's already destroyed, difficult if it's not.

Harry would also have to defeat Voldemort early on (probably first year). The longer he waits and the more he changes, the more he changes the timeline and his future knowledge might no longer be of any use. In year one he has Voldemort in the castle. If he manages to destroy all Horcruxes, he can end it right then. If he doesn't, he won't know where Voldemort is and with Pettigrew out of the picture he has no idea what will happen from then on. The longer he waits the more likely it also becomes that Voldemort finds out about the destroyed Horcruxes and makes new ones that Harry doesn't know about. (If he can make them in the state that he's in)

Spending time with his loved ones would probably also be a priority, but might also be difficult. If Harry doesn't go through all of the dangerous adventures he might not have quite the same relationship he used to have with those guys. They only became the Golden Trio after Hermione almost died in a troll attack. It might also be difficult to relate to them of your mind is 20+ but your friends are 11.

** It depends.

When does Harry go back - in both senses (IE, what time pre-jump, and what time in his life does he return to). Is there any limits to what he can act on? Etc.

I can see a lot of ways it could go, without even going into an AU nature. I could see him going to Dumbledore immediately - but that's not a given. One thing, however, would be that I see him as /definitely/ going to do whatever he can to save the people he cares about.

For instance, returning while Sirius is in Azkaban, I don't see him standing by and letting it go without trying /something/ to stop it.

But there are so many variables that it's /very/, /very/ hard to say anything specific. I think it's a lot more interesting to brainstorm with the specifics in mind!

** Depends on when he was sent back. If it's after the Battle of Hogwarts, then he might actually do everything faster and better --- cultivate a better relationship with the Dursleys, befriend Neville and Luna, free Sirius, etc. --- or he might be scared to change anything because he thinks it'll disrupt the timeline.

If he was sent back after, say, his fourth year, though, he'd probably be freaked out and not really actively do much, but still permanently change everything. He might even forget about some things, like saving Hermione from the troll --- or the troll wouldn't exist at all.

There's also the question of how he is sent back. If he's reincarnated in his younger body, then he'd do things more openly, while if he is sent back to live alongside his younger self, he'd be more subtle. He'd probably change his name and appearance and help his younger self from the sidelines. For example, he could make younger!Harry find out about the dragons in the First Task and how to defeat them way earlier, or that Sirius is innocent and it's actually Scabbers/Pettigrew.

Or Harry could even be reborn in someone else's body. Then he'd have to be even more subtle. He'd also have to learn to act like that person would act, so that no one becomes suspicious. He could even be reborn as a Muggle, and then he'd have to find a wizard/witch to help him out.

There are a lot of ways this could go. I attempted to write a fic like that a while ago, but it was rubbish and full of useless tropes, so I deleted it pretty early on.

** Definitely tell Dumbledore. And also I don't understand why there's so much delay in intercepting the hocruxes. That would definitely be a priority of Harry's; having to destroy the hocruxes after living such a fruitful life without Voldemort.

Either way, I don't see him trying to "preserve" the tineline. He would try to, maybe, but you know he'll probably end up AKing Quirellmort the moment he sees him, and definitely do something rash with Scabbers/Peter.
