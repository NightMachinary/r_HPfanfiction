So basically either Hogwarts hiring Gordon Ramsay to help/replace Snape or Snape acting a bit more like Gordon Ramsay in his classes, all the while both making a legend of his temper and attention to quality standards amongst the older years as well as being rather tolerant and nicer around younger years.

Anything would be fine as long as this isn't something in the background.

** I ran across a one-off someone had written in the Writing Prompts subreddit ages ago. It was just posted in the comments and it was hilarious. It was Gordon Ramsay himself doing the teaching and the writer had his mannerisms down pat. I think it was in Writing Prompts, but it was a while ago. If I find it, I'll link it.

** This situation does not actually happen until the sequel of this series which is mentioned that Snape was “a magical Gordon Ramsay” (A actual quote). The funny thing was the fact that this version of Ron appreciates Snape's teaching style.

I'm not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for since it is not specifically focused on Snape, however, he is an important character for Ron when he gets to Hogwarts.

Basically, this series is a HP and MCU crossover. The story starts by focusing on Ron growing up in America with Clint. So Ron would understand plenty of pop culture references by the time he goes to Hogwarts in the sequel. It's a fun read overall. I was surprisingly invested in the story enough to reread the series a couple of times.

  Third installment of the Son of the Archer series. Ron has survived his first year at Hogwarts. But it's never that simple is it? After all, he still has his family he was raised with, and the family he was born to in his life. Add in one of the most egotistical muggle men to grace technology and famous magical author and watch things get out of hand.

***** You don't have to be a jerk, you know. Sometimes people are just looking for a fic and don't know where to look or how to look (and they actually want to make sure they're getting actual /good/ quality stuff by checking things with a group of people instead of having to wade through all the stuff that pops up at the front of the search results), just like all the countless different Request threads all over this reddit.

If you take offense to me and my way of requesting fics, then why don't you bother all of /those/ other threads as well?

Sheesh.

***** 1st one is most realistic and has the best writing from a technical standpoint.

2nd one is kind of realistic but also funny and has sort of amateurish writing.

3rd one has the crudest humour and is the funniest.
