  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** 1)Harry Potter: Master of Malicious Compliance Watermelonsmellinfellon

Summary: Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.

2) Allure Immune Harry Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8848598/1/Allure-Immune-Harry]]

3) Escapologist Harry Harry runs away at age four. After bringing him back, Dumbledore's attempts to keep him at Privet Drive gets progressively more ridiculously extreme with each of his escapes. Animagus!Harry, Crack [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469775/1/Escapologist-Harry]]

4) Harry the Hufflepuff » Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story Harry refuses to lift his finger to do shit.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff]]

5) Script? Bleep the Script! Angering Death is generally a bad idea. Which led to his current predicament. He had gone to sleep as Harry Potter, and woken up as Bella Swan. On an airplane. On the way to Forks. Rated M for Harry/Bella's mouth: Harry the mod becomes Bella and then starts beating the everloving shit out of edward anytime he sees him refusing to go with the “script”

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10207646/1/Script-Bleep-the-Script]]

6) Triwizard Tales » - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best. In which Harry basically pulls the middle fingers and does fuck all to for the tournament
