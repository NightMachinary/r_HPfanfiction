Where to begin on this fic, it's honestly the best fanfiction I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The author is extremely talented and writes the characters perfectly, it's paced so well and flows seamlessly.

In summary, this is about Harry being resorted into Slytherin in his 5th year so is an AU of the 5th book, it deals with his relationship with his old Gryffindor friends really well, and develops new ones even better that makes this so much better. Seeing Harry have to adapt to his new life is Slytherin while Umbridge is taking over the school, while his connection to Voldemort gets stronger and while he's taking his owls is truly entertaining and engaging. The author deals with the Dark Arts amazingly. This is a dark!harry but not evil!harry, and it's perfect.

He discovers more about himself and his family than ever before and as the sorting hat said the first time 'you'll make real friends in Slytherin'. There is limited bashing in this fic, it gives a 3D version of every character so no one person is really hated on.

There is endgame Drarry, but even if that's not your thing still give this a chance, their relationship is very subtle and blossoms naturally and there is nothing explicit, it is very much an understory rather than the main plot.

The author is currently writing a sequel and I think there will be three books in total, and believe me, you'll be pining for them by the end.

I would love to hear what other people think of this fic and if you've not yet read it, going and read it, you won't regret it.

** I just read this fic recently and loved it. I'm usually wary of fics like this because, more often than not, Harry turns into an edgelord, all the Gryffindors are bashed and Slytherins deified, and there's an undertone of condescension towards canon that really irritates me.

This fic manages to avoid all of those pitfalls. Harry's character is more or less retained while still allowing for growth and change, all characters are written with nuance, no one is all good or all bad, and, thankfully, no one is bashed. I love the concepts that are explored in this fic, and I'm really looking forward to the sequel.

** The plot interests me(even if I think re-sortings are a bit too much), but Drarry is a major turn off, I mean, Canon Draco by that time is basically Hitler Youth. I will give it a try, even if slash is not my thing at all.

** Yes, I read and loved it. What I appreciated a lot is that the re-sorting is done in 5th year and people act more adult and Harry self-reflects more. It's a wonderful story of self-discovery. People are not cardboard cutouts there.

** I just read this story recently. Are there any other stories where "the dark" and/or "having an affinity for 'the dark'" is treated similarly to this story? I've tried looking at many dark!Harry fics over the years, but just couldn't get into most of them because of the writing, and the ones with readable writing "dark" was mostly synonymous with "evil," or Harry was "grey" or "edgy" or "indie." Maybe I haven't delved deep enough or looked at enough stories, but I've never seen a story where "the dark" was handled the way it is in this story.

*** I've not found any, maybe ask the author on her tumblr page (linked at the end of the fic) if she knows of any, I really don't know any at all similar.

** Yes! Fantastic fic, I also recommend it. I hadn't realised it had finished, though - explains the lack of updates.

I'm terrible for continuing to read chapters when they update, but I stuck with Evitative for longer than most. Shame I hadn't discovered it finished, really.

** It might be worth mentioning that the resorting thing is because of his brief expulsion after the Dementor attack.

** Are there any other fics you would recommend that are similar or just as good?

I read through this one in about 12 hours and am dying for more good to read!

** My one major problem with this fic is how the author has whitewashed Slytherin.

Almost all the slytherin characters have done a 180 in personality because Harry is in Slytherin.

There is so much wasted potential conflict. It would have been a far better story if half of the 5th year slytherin class actually believed in Voldemort and were still somewhat shitty people.

Its the same with Sirius. Having him be a dark wizard makes no freaking sense to his personality in Canon. He shouldnt have been Harry's mentor but trying to stop him. Eventually they would rekindle, Sirius would be more supportive and provide Andromeda as his mentor.

This fic is one of those good ideas that could have been implemented about 5x better if they hadn't made it so easy for Harry. So much wasted potential.

*** I disagree regarding Sirius, I think that him being a dark wizard but striving not to be like his parents in this gives his personality depth and mixes nicely with what we know about him from canon.

And also Harry needed someone (whom he trusted before) to be dark otherwise he might not become one himself thinking everything dark=bad. The conflict you describe could be anyone else

*** I partially agree, that the Slytherin characters behave quite differently from canon.

On the other hand, perhaps the canon depiction of Slytherin was a bit two-dimensional. Perhaps their behaviour here is actually more realistic.
