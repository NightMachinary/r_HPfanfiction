Basically I had this idea that everyone interested could be entered into a bracket and paired up against each other. Then a thread would be opened with a topic to debate, say for 24 hours. The two people paired off who's turn it is are each assigned a side to fight for (lets say for arguments sake that HPMOR is the greatest fic ever written). I figure that we can either have people randomly assigned or just the first person to comment gets to choose the side.

So the idea would be after someone starts the debate and argues that no it isn't the get to make their comment explaining their opening argument. Then the person arguing that it is makes theirs in a separate comment. They each then get a rebuttal comment back and forth for lets say 5 replies in each thread.

Up until now no one else comments then we can have judges/mods come in and vote for a winner and explain their reasoning.

Alternatively just have a strawpoll vote of the community (figured upvotes would end up with vote manipulation).

Or combine the two and have a vote after the 'judges' have given an opinion.

Then the winner moves on until we have a champion.

Anyway what are your thoughts, good? bad? fuck off?


** Sound cool, someone like a real debate. One concern I have is that one or both of the participants won't know the topic.

*** Well I was thinking it'd all be HP fanfiction related so whether it's a fic or piece of fanon there's a decent chance they could be able to talk about it.

A good way to combat that might be to inform them of it a day or two in advance and allow them prep time.

I was thinking [[/u/timeloopedpowergamer]] actually but yeah that's definitely going to need to be a thing. A pretty generous one I think but i'll leave that open to everyone else.

** While I think the judges would have to be very carefully chosen to avoid turning this into a popularity contest, I also think it would be very amusing to see some of the more vocal posters having to defend positions or fics they fanatically hate. It might even help reduce the stupid "all fics who use that word/couple/idea are bad, no matter their actual content because I know a single term or idea used means the whole story is bad" threads.

** I had a similar idea I expressed on [[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23%23hpfanfiction][IRC]] two days ago and it was added to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3i83ki/state_of_the_subreddit_survey/][State of the Subreddit Survey]] but you vote for fics instead of people.

Originally the idea was to do a bracket tournament with 8/16 fics (more would be too much, the tournament would take too long) taking place like this:

1. A thread is made where people suggest /one/ fic. The 8/16 most upvoted fics are picked for the bracket tournament.

2. Threads are made for each duel where people debate on why the fic they support in the duel is great. On each comment, they show which side they're in and at the end of the given time for each duel (let's say 24h) we add up all the comments points and see the winner. Example:

   #+begin_example
      [HPMOR] What is great is (...)

               -> [Homecoming] Yeah but in Homecoming, you can see (...)
   #+end_example

3. New duels until there's a winner.

*** Not the same thing, this isn't a popularity contest to see which fic people like the most. It feels more like debating the issues in the fics rather than trying to find the best one.

**** Yeah I know it isn't the same thing but since it's similar I wanted to see what people think about this as well.

We can totally do both types of tournament, they serve different purposes. Users debate tournament is interesting for users that like to debate and make a point while a fic tournament is interesting to see who likes the same fics than you and for what reasons. The latter can also interest people that do not want to debate but just read what others think in the fic duels and vote to make a difference.
