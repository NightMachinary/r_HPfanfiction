I prefer fics that have 70k+ words. I'm looking for one character ending up with multiple others. It can be a player, marriage contracts or whatever. That's my only criteria. All else goes.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8837257/1/Wizards-Fall][Wizards Fall by Bobmin356]] is 143k words so can be quite the time commitment but I loved the story. HP/HG/LL if I remember right. Potter hides out from the world post-war on an island that turns into a sanctuary for the persecuted.

** The Firebird Trilogy is the obvious answer. Gets super dark later though.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** Even though it's pretty short, I really enjoyed the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/37166][Raging Sensation series]] (HP/DM/HG)

For something longer, I have really been enjoying linkffn(The Soul of the Wolves by LR Earl). It's also a HP/DM/HG story that is a WIP but is slowly updating.

** I can't remember the name, I'm so sorry. It's Lucius, Severus, and Hermione. Hermione gets abducted as a sacrifice to Voldemort, as far as I recall, and is given to Severus as a gift.

Any help here from someone who might know what fic this was?
