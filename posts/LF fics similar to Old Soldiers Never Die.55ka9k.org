I want something similar in the sense that he does army crap, but not as complicated as Emperor is.

Over 70k+ words please!

**** In my story "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution", Ron discovers that he's really good at muggle weapons and tactics when he gets training by the British Military. The story focuses (after around chapter 10) on a war across magical Europe with Britain's combined magical and muggle special forces battling pureblood Regimes and inciting further revolutions. Ron's pretty much the "frontline hero" there, with Harry and Hermione taking more (but not exclusively) political roles.

In "Divided and Entwined", Hermione and other muggleborns get muggle military training and gear to better fight Death Eaters, Guerilla style, again combining magical and muggle weapons and tactics. It's not quite as military focused, though.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
