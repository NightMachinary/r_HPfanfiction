** Tomarry is basically all time travel. I enjoyed linkao3(love is touching souls surely you touched mine; Don't Fuck with Florists They'll Fuck You Up)

Snarry: linkao3(The Boy Who Died A Lot)

Drarry: linkao3(Tea and No Sympathy)

Cedric/Harry: linkao3(honey there is no right way)

Ron/Harry: linkao3(Prelude and Fugue)

The last three are time loops btw.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  ‘Have you tried everything?' Hermione asked insistently.‘Yes! Every time I get to the cup and Cedric doesn't take it with me I go immediately back to my bed in the morning. But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?'
