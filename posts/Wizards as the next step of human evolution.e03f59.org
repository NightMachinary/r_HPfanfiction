I'd like to read a fanfic story where wizards are portrayed as the next step of human evolution and are well on their way to replace baseline humans.


** The Mischief's Heir series more or less fits that. Marvel crossover that can be read with little knowledge of the fandoms (MCU/X-men). Not exactly a replacement for humanity but... well you'd have to read it.

Warning: there's a fair bit of crack in here, and it won't be to everyone's taste. The trio bashing mostly goes away as characters grow up but stereotypes absolutely get turned up to eleven early on (Ron's gluttany, Hermione's "I'm always right!" etc). The series /really/ improves as it goes along, and the slash is non-explicit and refers to supporting characters.

*** You can have evolution within a species. For example, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence][lactase persistence]] evolved in some human populations but not in others, depending on whether their environment had the sorts of animals that could be domesticated and that could produce milk economically. They are all equally human, but some have milk-digesting superpowers. :D
