Are there any good fics out there about Ginny dealing with the psychological trauma she must have had after the CoS events? I read a fanfic that mentioned that in their AU Lupin helped her deal with it, something like that would be nice to read!


** Here's the fanfic you requested:

**** You're welcome - the rest of keeptheotherone's work (and MandyinKC as well) are very worth a read.

ManyinKC's Percy and Oliver are fantastic (Order of Mercy)

Can't recommend them enough.

** I wrote a fic which deals with the summer and following year from her perspective. A large portion of it is her dealing with her trauma. It's lightly AU.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

** It's not the focal point of the fic but Ginny sees a Mind Healer in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]]. In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12999698/4/][The Brothers Gaunt]] she and Harry exchange letters where they discuss their respective fears and worries, which in Ginny's case includes her post-CoS trauma.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
