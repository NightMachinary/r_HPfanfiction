I'm writing a Quidditch scene for my fic and I'd like some tips on how to make it interesting, does anyone know how to not make them repetitive?


** Have something important to the overarching plot within. If it's a scene that could be summarized with "a quidditch game happened. People went and then they left" without leaving out any important details for the story, then it's certainly too long and will feel repetitive.

** No idea. I honestly do not like the long, drawn out quidditch scenes from the book. Definitely don't take that approach and use the description of the commentator to explain what is happening. That is my only dislike from the books.

** I find Lee Jordan's biased commentary from the books really entertaining if you're going for a comedic effect. Other than that, I've seen a few fics where someone in the stands is having a conversation, while occasionally noticing a good move or cheering which I've enjoyed.

If the scene just feels like a description of the sport or canon rehash, I tend to skim though it.
