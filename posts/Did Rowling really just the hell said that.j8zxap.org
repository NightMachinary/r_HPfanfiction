I mean, OK it's fine that Rowling goes talking around how characters like Hermione and Hagrid are black. She probably thought about it when she started but didn't elaborate or she is simply targeting discrimination on skin colour or something.

But then comes this news and it like really confounded me-

"Hogwarts didn't always have bathrooms, Before adopting Muggle plumbing methods in the eighteenth century. witches and wizards simply relieved themselves wherever they stood, and vanished the evidence."


** I dunno. Maybe for Americans it makes sense for hermione and hagrid to have always been black, but as someone who lives in Scotland I've only known 2 black people in my entire life, it's a much smaller minority than in America.

*** Particularly in the 90s - Scotland has really low diversity.

"The percentage of people in Scotland from minority ethnic groups had doubled to 4%, up from 2% in 2001.

The Asian population is the largest minority ethnic group (3% of the population or 141,000 people), representing an increase of** one percentage point (69,000) since 2001*. Within this, Pakistani is the largest individual category, accounting for 1% of the total population. **The African, Caribbean or Black groups made up 1% of the population of Scotland in 2011, an increase of 28,000 people since 2001.* Mixed or multiple ethnic groups represented 0.4% (20,000) and other ethnic groups 0.3% (14,000) of the total population."

*** No no, you got me wrong. I have no objective with Hermione or Hagrid being black. Or rather, I would not have had any objective. Now I do. It has been more than 20 years since the release of 1st book and she suddenly says that these characters are black!! The books have described Hermione getting tanned or flushing due to embarrassment and other things and the movies have confirmed these beliefs so that now that we think of Hermione and Hagrid the images from movies pop up in our mind and make it hard to believe that these characters had been black. I didn't mind any other character having a coloured or black skin tone like the Patil twins and Seamus Finnigan.

BTW I am an Indian so I see all types of Skin colours everyday.

This is how I feel too. It's pretty obvious that when Rowling wrote Hermione, she was picturing someone white.

I have no problem with a black Hermione. Adaptations change races all the time. Grover (from Percy Jackson) is white in the books and black in the movies. And I love how he's depicted in the movies (probably more than the books).

But Rowling pretending her books were retroactively more diverse than they really are just seems disingenuous at best and ignorant at worst.

Discussion wise - Dumbledore stated he was quite happy to have found a room full of chamber pots. I find it hard to believe wizards went from vanishing their ass to chambers pots to plumbing.

****** It would be hilarious indeed. I'm sure there's a oneshot like that. Back then, the Malfoys were quite pally with the muggle royalty so it's possible that wizards adjusted to changing standards just before the statue of secrecy kicked in.

I guess 900 years is a lot of time for traditions to be altered.

*** I think it makes sense when you consider that medieval people didn't really value/have privacy unless they were the lord/lady of the castle. People back then toileted communally.

In the middle ages and the victorians were very concerned with it, so chamber pots make more sense. What seems bizarre to me is that the toilets used pipes and rather than being self-vanishing. Perhaps magic wasn't there yet, or the waste transports to a central tank/pit where vanishing or cleaning takes place.

I mean, they had "bathrooms" over 4,000 years ago. It's not exactly a modern invention, and certainly predates hogwarts. So, no, simply shitting yourself was /probably not/ the most likely possibility.

**** Why shitting yourself? The quote doesn't say so. They probably pulled their pants down and crouched.

Cleanliness, which was the main reason for the early "bathrooms" you mentioned, would not be a problem for wizards. In the middle ages, when nudity taboos and privacy became a factor, wizards probably simply ignored such things at first. When they eventually adopted them, they just used a privacy charm in addition to a cleaning one.

****** Back then toilets were often communal - large Roman toilets were two benches with holes several in and the soliders would sit facing the opposite person and chat. Even castle garderobes sometimes had two seats in the room. The king/lord would have his own, but a servant would wipe his bum for him.

I suppose, what value does a bucket have if you can vanish the contents away. There's no real need for containment.

Except for the gentry, almost no-one had any privacy at all back then. Potentially, going wherever you were would have provided greater privacy than the muggle alternative.

It seems likely to me that chamber pots probably came into play in wizard's lives when privacy started to matter.

My personal view is that the younger students probably did have to use garderobes, but the mark of a skilled wizard/student was one who could toilet where they pleased. Potentially, a transferring spell could have been used by those who couldn't vanish yet.

  Besides, what about first years in September? Were they just taught the vanishing spell in their common rooms after the welcoming feast? Were people dodging poo piles while running to lunch?

/Evanesco/ is actually not a trivial spell. It's taught during the fourth year, and is a part of the OWL practical exam.

So, half of the school wouldn't be able to clean up after themselves.

** Yes she did. Everyone around here brings that disaster up when they talk about JK's off-pages canonical ramblings. However, even though she probably shouldn't have mentioned it, at least at Versailles that was quite common practice in earlier days (without the vanishing part). Every tour guide will make sure to mention that little fact.

I think somewhere during the development of Pottermore JKR stopped writing for it, and it was taken over by WB and their writers. I just cannot believe JKR would ever write such nonsense, it had to be some intern at WB who didn't know any better.

Fuddy-duddy wizards often lament that "nobody reads Rowling any more", but they are works of a bygone era when the most important problem facing a Hogwarts student was which magical corporation made his or her Quiddich broom.
