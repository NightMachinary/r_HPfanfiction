I want to write a fic about Draco bleeding to death after sectumsempra and coming back as a ghost, but the fic will be about him and Myrtle ganging up to rinse the shit out of people together.

Thing is, if Draco died, that would really affect the plot of the war, and that's not what I want to write about but it's something I need to have prepared for background if say I set a chapter in the future with Draco interrupting Professor Potter's class and ruining his job satisfaction.

So what do you guys think would happen war wise with Draco dead? How/when would Dumbledore die is the main question, how would the Malfoys react, how would the psychological impact of murder affect Harry's actions?


** Wouldn't Snape automatically die as well? Because of the vow?

Dumbledore sees Harry being taken away, a student death and his plan of Snape killing him coming down in crumbles... "Well, fuck" he says.

*** I just looked up the wording of the vow and Narcissa says "and will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?" So I don't think him dying by Harry's wand would kill Snape because Snape couldn't have known to protect him since he wasn't present at the bathroom fight until after; and assuming they didn't get there in time for him to heal Draco, so long as he tried his best to heal him, he's still technically honoured his vow.

I don't know if this interpretation is right though, it could be that you're right too, I think there are arguments for both. But Snape is useful to keep alive if I want to go the path of having him kill Dumbledore at the end of the year as in the books. But killing him might be more creative if I also make a cohesive alternative plot....

Thanks for pointing this out!

**** Would be fascinating if the spell perceived Snape failed, because he invented the Sectumsempra spell and didn't properly secure the book. The Vow spell realistically can't be that strict, though, because it would end up being useless. It would be so lethal that hardly anyone would use it.

*** Snape only has to protect him to the best of his ability, so he'd be just fine, nothing he could do to stop it after all.\\
It's a pretty easy to get around vow, which is probably why he agreed to it, he knew that if push came to shove then all it would take is him being temporarily out of the way for others to act freely.

*** I think the "unbreakable" part, in this instance, doesn't mean "not allowed to break," but, rather, literally unbreakable: Snape had no choice but to save Draco, whether he wanted to or not, because he wouldn't have been the one in control anymore, when it came to this matter.

And, maybe due to the magic, Snape wouldn't have gotten punished by the vow, because it wasn't up to him to fail. Like, you know how when we really don't want to go somewhere, we'd stall? The vow wouldn't have allowed you to stall, even if you wanted to.

Don't get me wrong, the Malfoys still would have killed (or attempted to kill) Snape if he had failed, because I wouldn't put it pass them, but his death would have been at the hands of Draco's parents, rather than the consequence from the vow magic.

** Dumbledore dies about the same time, but instead of coming through the vanishing cabinet, Snape let's them in through the front door. The Malfoy reaction is unimportant until Narcissa bends over Harry in the forest, but they blame Harry and probably Snape. Harry freaks out at first and the rest depends on where you want to take the story, but I think he becomes further desensitized to it all and it probably affects his usage of the Killing Curse

*** Ah yes, the forest scene is going to be either terrible for harry, or I figure out how to avoid it. I was thinking the murder might break Harry's spirit and make him less willing to kill because it felt awful (and a ghost kept making him feel worse about it). But I don't know how much I could even get into Harry's choices in the seventh book if I'm writing Draco's POV- he would be stuck in the bathroom while Hogwarts got taken over. I guess unless Harry's choices affect the plot, I don't have to go into them so much. Thanks for answering!

This works, too, but you can't get less willing to kill than canon Harry lmfao. My own thinking is by the end of the series, Harry's devolved in the sense that he's filled with so much hate he's able to cast the Cruciatus Curse successfully. If he's already "murderered" someone, he might be less hesitant to do it again.

***** Yes, I think if he does end up killing someone he might become slightly more desensitized to murder of death eaters etc. It would be interesting and would lead to a darker Harry

***** He's not stuck in the bathroom for long, but I head canon that young ghosts are stuck where they died for a while until they calm down a bit and figure out how to roam- basically as a plot device for Myrtle and Draco to become friends who are mean to people together

**** Ghost Draco wouldn't be stuck in the bathroom. Only reason why Mrtyle was, was because she had been haunting a girl who had bullied her. Ghost Draco could move around just like Saint Nick, Peeves, etc.

That'd make it more interesting, if you do end up deciding to have Ghost Draco, be a thing.

Obviously, he'd be angry he had been kill (untentionally but still), but since he did, he wouldn't have any stakes in the war outside his parents, would he be willing to help Harry and co or ignore them? Would he go straight to Malfoy Manor, stay at Hogwarts? etc. That's something to think about.

** Draco's task to kill Dumbledore was never meant to befulfillable at all. Voldie gave that task to Draco because he knew Draco had no hope of completing it. It was done to punish Lucius for failing to secure the prophecy in the DoM. Draco was /supposed/ to die so that his father would feel bad and have something precious taken from him.

Draco's actual death would affect nothing. Harry has already killed, and would not be overly affected by another.

It would affect something. Quirrell was different. It wouldn't affect how the story plays out, but it would affect Harry.

The real problems start after Malfoys death:

The minister wanted Harry on his side for a whole year. Even if we know it was selfdefense - the ministry of magic doesn't have a good track record of being fair. I can imagine that Scrimgeour is ruthless enough to bargain for Harrys cooperation.

Then there is also the point, that with Malfoys death Harry never becomes Master of the Elderwand.

** Just read this one-shot, and while it doesn't have too much plot advancement help it does get into how devastated Harry was. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24751672]].

This may be obvious but I feel regardless of Harry's lack of intent to kill or that he was acting in self-defense I feel like the Malfoys would be beside themselves.
