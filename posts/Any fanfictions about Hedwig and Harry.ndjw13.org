I really like how close Hedwig and Harry were as pet and owner, how they genuinely cares about each other like Hedwig going every Christmas to the Dursleys to get him presents, I doubt that Harry was sending her there because he knew he wont get any decent gift from there.

And Harry also caring about her, like visiting her regularly in the owlery, and being happy when she started talking to him again after the incident at the train station in COS, and he was worried about her in OOTP when she came back injured.


** Don't think this is /quite/ what you're asking for, but it's the best fic I know has Hedwig as a main character.

  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

*** This one is one of my favs, along with Unhinged for its more cracky nature.

I really wish the author'd write an expanded version of all six years.

** I know that there are several Harry/Hedwig pairings on FF, usually hedwig is either a person trapped as an owl, or is a “reverse animagus” they're usually a mix between sweet, weird, and sometimes uncanny valley.

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)
