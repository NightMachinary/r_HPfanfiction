***** Basically, the author's Harry from Lack of a Bezoar and canon Harry get transported to the Spiral Saga universe where Voldemort has won. He actually happens to be off colonizing outer space leaving SS Harry in charge, when the two new Harry's show up. SS Harry now has to suppress a rebellion reanimated by hope thanks to the two new Harry's.

****** Thanks for the summary! Am I right in remembering that the Harry from the spiral saga is a psychopath who tortures people once second ane cuddles with his girlfriend the next? Can't understand how people would want to read 6 stories about that. I mean who would enjoy it?

******* Pretty much. There's some Pansy abuse before he settles for Daphne if that rings any bells.

And I dunno, fascination with the gortesque? It was pretty dark - enough that it stands out in my mind despite all the fanfiction I read haha.
