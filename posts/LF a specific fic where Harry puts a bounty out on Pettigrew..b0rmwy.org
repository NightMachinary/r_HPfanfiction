Out of sheer frustration because of his isolation during the summer between GOF and OotP, Harry puts out a bounty of 100,000 for Pettigrew's arrest. Naturally everyone goes mental looking for him and the entire ministry freaks out due to the frenzy, as they're positive he's dead but everyone else banks on him being alive. That's all I can remember.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is fed up with the lies of the ministry, the slander of the prophet and the inaction of everyone around him in the face of Voldemort's return. After careful thinking he has come to a conclusion: find Peter Pettigrew and you find the truth. Hence Harry puts a 100,000 Galleon reward on Peter's head and watches as the entire magical community goes mad in the race to find him.

  To be honest, I like James, and his attractively messy hair and hazel eyes with that Quidditch toned body... Hey, I'm a girl, I have hormones, I notice things. I have no problem admitting that James is attractive. I don't own anything you recognise. Beta'd by the wonderful Stacy!
