Here's the scenario: Harry's sixth year, Voldemort has captured, in turn, Hermione first and Ginny second. They are tortured with lasting effects and returned to Hogwarts. I'm looking for horrible ideas about torture that are A) not easily cured by Madam Pomfrey and B) have lingering effects for Ginny and Hermione. Sexual abuse is off the table as are existing spells.

If you were a Death Eater with orders to torture, but not maim or kill these two students, what would you do?


** Imperious one of them, then make them torture the other. Then switch it up. Eventually, the two will begin to want to hurt the other who has been causing them so much pain, strengthening the curses and driving them both into insanity.

** Polyjuice as Harry to torture them, their families, innocent people... "Just give in and I'll stop". Keep twisting reality. Like force Hermione to watch Ginny being tortured, but once its done, it turns out to be someone else (polyjuiced to look like Ginny). Then later "Ginny" is tortured again, only it turns out to really be Ginny. Fake an escape where "Harry" comes to rescue them but really its a DE and its all just to bring up their hopes and crash them down. Do a purposefully botched partial human transfiguration to give them hooves rather than feet, or some other humiliating disfigurement. You could spend a lot of time on their minds & memories being twisted / shredded. Brainwash Hermione into believing in blood purity. ... and with that... I think I need a nice happy story to cleanse my soul...

  Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the Boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.

  ‘Hermione!' said Lupin, startled. ‘What's the matter?'

** A lot of good examples here already, but here's my crack at it.

Psychological torture is great! Murder people spelled to look like loved ones. Start with the other prisoner, and keep them separated for a few days. Make them doubt their own senses--gaslight them. You never killed Ginny--Purebloods are above murdering one another, silly mudblood.

Let them listen, but not see, the torture. Let them imagine what's causing the screams.

Scars are always a fun lasting thing. Disfigure them horribly, then heal them. Then do it again. Leave them scarred for days on end.

A very specific one: break/cut all of Hermiones fingers, leaving her hands useless. Maybe fuck up some other joints, and tell her all she has to do is read a few pages of a book on the floor--try turning pages without fingers--within, say, ten minutes, and she'll be healed/fed/whatever. Ginny is there with her. Ginny has been told that if she helps Hermione, or tells Hermione why she can't help, Hermione will be killed.

Leave them like that until the timer runs out, or Hermione manages to actually do it.

Food/water are big things. Make them eat off the floor or out of bowls. Make them feel less than human. Feed them scraps, offal, dishwater, anything foul. Single one out for special treatment--never explain why. Foster resentment. Maybe toss this in with forcing them to curse one another, as suggested by others, but no imperio--no, just inform them, quite plainly, that if you don't find their curses satisfactory, then you'll be dolling out punishments as well.

Force Ginny to spout blood purity nonsense during "punishment" sessions. You can get a lot of psychological mileage out of betrayal, even if they know it's forced.

Another specific one: Remove Hermione's ability to read. Curse her eyesight so words blur or simply aren't there. Cure it, do it again, over and over. Vary the time frame.

At times, let them wake up in opulent conditions, being waited on. Perfect health, dressed differently, even different appearances. etc. Gaslighting. Make them afraid to sleep, never knowing if they'll wake up in hell or the weird pureblood racist heaven.

Speaking of sleep, deprive them of it. Constant noise spells, chained near animals, or just a spell to never let them sleep. Let them go insane from that. or just one. Make the other way as one falls further into mental instability from lack of sleep.

Torture one in front of another. Promise the one being tortured that if they manage not to scream, the other isn't hurt.

Creative use of minor spells. A weak cutting spell, for instance. One does nothing. But ten? Fifty? A hundred? Especially when combined with not knowing if they'll get healed, or have to wear scars for a few days.

Freezing spells=frostbite. Fire spells to burn. Hover one over a dozen candles below bare feet, or any other skin.

Good old blunt force trauma--targets for banishing spells. Death eater darts, played with rocks. or actual darts.

Nerve damage. Shaking hands. stuttering. Make it harder for them to wave wands and speak spells, cursed, or simply from accumulated trauma.

Conditioning can be interesting, and combined with any of the above. Curse Ginny to feel intense pain, or bite her tongue, if she tries to call Hermione anything but "Mudblood" or something similar. Curse Hermione with the same if she refers to Ginny as anything but "Traitor".

Condition one or both to be actively afraid of wands. Pain if they pick one up. Excruciating pain if they move it in any spell-like way.

Strip their names from them. More dehuminization, more conditioning. No "I" just "This one" or "This Mudblood" or whatever derogatory term you prefer. Maybe spell them to actually forget their name after a while of this, and "graciously" remind them of it.

...Man, I need to go read something happier.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** Hear me out: the bronze bull, wizard style. Big enough to fit a human lying down or on all fours, it utilises a combination of spells that prevent the heat from going any deeper than the skin and to keep the heart rate below a deadly level, preventing it from affecting any internal organs or blood vessels. It would cause lasting, deep burns in parts of their bodies, psychological damage from being unable to escape the pain by just dying, and their screams would be rather entertaining for people like deatheaters as they'd make the bull roar. It would probably also mess with their core temperature or their perception of temperature and pain.

** I'm going to add in some specific comments as well.

If the goal is to break their spirits, rather than mutilate, then I think a good idea might be to make them afraid of what they love.

**Ginny**

She loves flying on a broom. It's not impossible that the Death Eaters would be aware of this. If nothing else, Voldemort could peer into her mind.

So how do you make Ginny afraid of flying? That's tough.

But you can make her afraid of falling.

Remember the mist that Harry passed through in the Maze, when he realized it was too difficult to get across? It threw him upside down and reversed his polarity,

Something similar could be done to Ginny. Tie her hands and feet together, and toss her into to the mist. Her gravity is reversed, and she's helpless to get out of it. The risk of personal injury is minute, but she can't get loose and it just feels wrong.

Or, create a pool or a circle or a something-or-other that gives the sensation of falling, falling but never landing. Tie a blindfold around her eyes, and Ginny could fall and fall and never know how close the bottom of the pit is. Broom flyers dive down and go up all the time, but remove her ability to choose how far or how fast she falls, and that could create fear. And possibly give her vertigo.

Or if you want to avoid magic entirely, just tie her ankles together and hang her upside down from something on the ceiling. Let her dangle upside down from a chandelier.

*****

What else does Ginny like? She likes animals. Ron mentions she likes cats, and she doted on Arnold the Pygmy Puff.

Something small and furry that she could pet could bring her comfort, and if you then take away that comfort, or twist it into something worse.

Ginny wakes up, and she sees Arnold lying on her. But instead of nuzzling her like he usually does, he bites down hard on her nose. The injury is superficial (how hard can a fuzzy ball barely bigger than a hamster bite?), but it hurts her heart as well as her nose.

Or, when Ginny is given a tiny bit of meat to eat, she finds purple Pygmy Puff fur in it. She just ate her pet.

****

Or maybe something a bit simpler. You mentioned that most of the known curses are something you want to avoid. Why not go for more Muggle tactics?

Take Ginny's most defining Weasley characteristic. Her long, red hair.

If Ginny is pinned to the wall or otherwise tied up in a way that she can't move away, a Death Eater with a knife could seize fistfuls of her hair and cut it off. A fistful at a time, Ginny's hair is cut off, until there's almost none left. If she's barefoot and tries to move around, and she walks on her hair, it would be deeply unsettling. And now she doesn't even look like a Weasley anymore.\\
****

Something that could work for either of the girls is food. Not depriving it, but making it hard to eat.

If Ginny is dehydrated, and her lips are cut and bleeding, let the Death Eaters give her something to drink. Some nice, refreshing lemonade. Which would burn the cuts on her lips and sting terribly.

****

**Hermione**

So what's Hermione love? Books. She loves reading and learning.

Put her in a room with bad books. Books that don't just scream, but scream horrible, crass insults. Books that can bite--not just like the Monster Book of Monsters, but books that actively try to hunt. Books that chase her in the style of animals, books that bite her fingers and toes and don't let go.

Books that plunge her into nightmares. Hermione finds herself in the world of the book, and it's not a good world at all.

A book about witch burnings attacks her, and Hermione finds herself bound to a stake, as the flames close in.

A book about Acromantula, and Hermione finds herself in Borneo, as a giant spider pierces her with its pinchers.

****

What else does Hermione love? Well, she loves her cat Crookshanks.

If we further the education angle, Hermione loves the scent of fresh parchment.

Let her witness how parchment is made.

Parchment is made of sheepskin, or goatskin, or calfskin, usually. It's not just fancy paper.

So what if there was something Hermione loves, and it's turned into parchment?

Let her see Crookshanks get made into parchment.

****\\
If Ginny's most defining physical feature is her Weasley hair (and in fairness, the same Haircut from Hell could work on Hermione), I'd argue that Hermione's feature is her teeth.

Give Hermione a piece of bread to eat. Only when she takes a bite, it turns out it's a stone. She breaks her teeth on the stone. It hurts terribly and it's humiliating and every time she closes her mouth she winds up tearing her lips.

****

That's all I can think of right now...

I think I'm going to go hug my kitty.
