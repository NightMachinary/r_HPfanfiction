:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry swore on his magic to never return to the Dursley's and he found out he had a place in the country or something and he cleaned it up and stayed there for a year whilst everyone was looking for him. He did his own private studies. When the year was up, he decided to make the place into a school.

​

That's what I remember from it, there are a ton of other details I can't fully remember... I believe it was a Harry/Hermione fic also. Maybe part of a series. I just want to find it again.

​

Edit: It's The Cupboard Series (link is in the comments) I'm so happy I can read it again! Thanks ya'll!


** Could it be part three of the linkffn(The cupboard under the stairs by stargon1) series?

  A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic.

** I think it's one of Robst's earlier fics, or at least the premise is similar enough. Check out linkffn(4612714)

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.
