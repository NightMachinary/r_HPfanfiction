All I remember is that the story begins with Harry aboard the train (somewhere around 4th-5th year) in a compartment with Hermione. They are not friends and bicker back and forth. Harry notices a light rain and tells Hermione that he thinks it is a creature similar to dementors. Harry saves some people, but his twin brother takes credit for it. I

have searched all over the place and have had no luck finding it.

Thank you in advance!

**** It was popular because it had a lot of interesting ideas and great fight scenes like the fight against his brother and then his father on the battlements after Harry outed his brother as a fake... but it was held back by terrible writing and execution, sadly. It's no masterpiece, but it was quite entertaining.
