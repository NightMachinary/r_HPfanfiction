Basically magic Ultron vs Voldemort.


** "You built an unyielding shell of magic around the world, and told yourself you were free because the inside of the prison no longer allowed Unforgivables. Sounds like an awful world to me, Mr. Croaker," McGonagall hissed.

"I've seen worse," came the mild reply.

"Yes but let's focus on how we /beat/ the bloody thing," Harry interjected, his eyes constantly darting from Voldemort to Bellatrix to Dolohov and back again.

"I understand your urgency," nodded Croaker, "but we must not rush in to anything. The Adaptive Negation spell matrix means that if we just heedlesssly throw things at it, we will only make it stronger."

Here most of the two dozen people in the room shot ugly looks at Bellatrix. Harry shivered as he wondered what tortures Voldemort must have carried out to turn the cackling insanity he'd seen during the Department of Mysteries fight into the silent, broken figure of a woman standing at his side.

"And you're /absolutely/ /certain/ it hasn't adapted a way to pierce the Fidelius around the house?" Hermione asked, gesturing a hand to encompass the magically-expanded sitting room of 12 Grimmauld Place.

"Yes. Absolutely," came Croaker's firm response.

He was still mid-nod when the front wall of the townhouse burst open in a deafening blast of sickly yellow light. Some dove for cover, others froze in fear. Harry, Voldemort, and others with honed battle-instincts snapped out shields in an array of different colors and shapes.

Dozens of glowing blue figures slowly came into view as the dust cleared. They were humanoid, but looked more like sci-fi androids made of glowing blue light than actual living things. The foremost figure, larger than the others and lined in coruscating green static discharges, floated forward.

A beat of silence followed.

Into the empty space where a wall had just been, an apparition-crack delivered the stooped, gnarled form of Kreacher.

His shot his arms up in a pleading gesture, his high scratchy voice calling out, "heres they bes, Master Ultimage! Yous can kill them and clean the world of filthy Muggles and elves will all serve pure magic!!" His voice cracked on the edge of ecstasy and madness.

With a casual wave of its hand, the larger Ultimage construct vaporized the elf.

Harry managed a single thought: 'oh hell.'

*** Tom's mind took in the situation and considered several possible courses of action. A flash of his genius intellect weighed and evaluated, assessed and then decided.

Of the twenty-six people in the room, there were only two he /needed/ to save - himself and his irritating little bespectacled soul-jar over there.

He very strongly wanted to save four others - Rookwood, Croaker, Bones, and McGonagall. The first two, as Unspeakables, would be most likely to have access to knowledge or artifacts that would help in the fight. Bones, as acting Minister, would be able to command the respect needed to gather the necessary forces. And McGonagall, as acting Headmistress of Hogwarts, would be the key to letting them retreat to the only meaningful bastion left.

His eyes and mind danced across the other people present. A seemingly endless flood of redheads. The werewolf and his shapeshifting partner. Department heads from the Ministry. Malfoys and Lestranges and a half-dozen other august names from Wizard Britain's long history.

Tom dismissed them all. He raised his wand to make the only move available to him when his eye was caught by a glint of light coming off of Harry's glasses. Had a second to spare, Tom would have rolled his eyes at the thought of how difficult and potentially disastrous Harry could be were he not placated.

A moment's thought and Tom decided the ritual could extend to one more. The added difficulty due to the extra energy needed to bring a seventh may actually be offset by the arithmantic balance of seven travelers, he mused.

This was, of course, hogwash. The ritual already had seven - the sacrifice and six travelers. But Tom was gifted at nothing so much as lying to himself, and magic was driven powerfully by belief, intent, and expectation. And so Tom's mind and soul fully expected the ritual to work.

With a powerful slash of the Elder Wand and a single word incanted in Low Babylonian, Tom activated the prepared spell. Bellatrix gave out an inhuman shriek, her voice spiraling into an overlapping wailing of human, animal, and even demonic voices. The magic was a ritual considered an ancient, lost secret even in the days of the Old Kingdom in ancient Egypt. The magic was so unknown, so arcane, that the "Ultimage" constructs immediately halted all behavior and focused their considerable power on observing the effects.

--------------

This was, so far as they had been able to determine - the only real way to slow down Ultimage for even a few moments of time. Present it with previously unknown magic. It's drive towards self-improvement would demand that it give up almost any advantage if it could learn some new magic and adapt to a way to nullify that magic.

Its core drive wasn't even the elimination of witches and wizards. It wasn't even self-improvement.

No, the damn thing had been made with the same flawed premise as all great human follies: good intentions.

The Unspeakables had thought to craft a planet-wide unbreakable ritual that would permanently stop the Unforgivable Curses. They built the accursed thing in secret over the span of nearly two decades. It needed a mind to sense and respond to the magical energies that built up in the moment before an Unforgiveable was cast. It needed access to magic to be able to dissipate those energies. And it needed to be able to iteratively self-improve and Negate any attack against itself, so as to allow it to continue functioning even if its creators were long gone.

The public face of the project (and here "public" meant "those with code-word-top-secret clearance to know about the project but not actually involved in making it") was that it was a tool to stop Tom. The fondness he and his followers had for the Unforgivables was well known. The idea was that lack of access to their most heinous tools would cripple them.

Of course, the foul thing leapt out of their control mere minutes after it was activated. The command "stop all Unforgivable" was soon re-interpreted to mean "kill any witch or wizard as they are casting an Unforgivable, as they are likely to attempt to do so again." Then, the things magic-sense evolved until it could sense not just an incipient Unforgivable being cast, but any Dark Magic with a similar signature.

It started murdering Aurors minutes later. It showed up at Saint Mungo's and murdered people in their hospital beds, simply because they were victims of Dark curses and their bodies gave off residual Dark energy.

Now, the entire Magical population of the planet had been nearly halved and things were beyond desperate.

--------------

This was the backdrop against which Tom activated the teleport ritual. It could move people from any spot on the planet to any other spot on the planet. It could bypass any wards or protective enchantments of any kind.

It was also the darkest ritual Tom had ever seen. It required the unwilling human sacrifice of a person who truly, completely loved the ritual's caster. It could not be faked with Amortentia or the Imperius or any of a dozen other means. The love had to be pure, soul-deep, and long lasting. It had to be the kind of love that would willingly sacrifice itself for the caster.

And so Tom could only cast this spell once.

None would ever love him as his Bella did.

Thank god it didn't require the love to be requited, Tom thought, as his body and six others disappeared in motes of golden light.

With a flash, they reappeared in Hogwart's Great Hall. Rookwood stumbled into McGonagall, knocking her into Croaker. Tom kept his feet easily, of course, his natural grace handling the teleportation with ease. Madame Bones was similarly unaffected, her stolid form quickly dropping into a practiced battle-stance.

And tumbling to the floor, his obnoxious soul jar ended up tangled up with the girl that Tom could only assume was his girlfriend.

She snapped her head up in an instant, her searching eyes taking in their new location. She didn't even attempt to untangle herself from her boyfriend before snapping out a series of questions: "how did you bypass Hogwart's enchantments? Was that language proto-Indo-European or proto-Uralic? Did you only bring seven of us because the arithmantic workup of co-location spatial folding can be..."

Dear Merlin. The boy had a girlfriend even more annoying than he was.

*** Voldemort threw a dark spell instantly after the elf had died.

A black hole started to appear but the construct vanished it and threw it back at him, vanishing the Dark Kord for good.

For a moment no one said or did anything. Mcgonagall went hard at work to trans figure Uranium 23t and a Nuclear Reactor using items in the room, others protected her as IT walked slowly towards her

Bellatrix threw 7 crucio's in the span of fifteen seconds, the construct deflected all of them using only its hand.

As Lestrabge was on the floor screaming her soul out Hermione charged at IT.

She tried to punch him but he caught it and tore her arm of before decapitation her by transfiguring her arm into a sword with ease.

Harry watched as madness was going in around him but his eyes couldnt leave his good friends body.

Dolohov turned towards Remus and killed him in the confusion and before he could react his chest and a hole in it, the constructs arm was sticking out of it. Only Harry, Tonks and Mcgonagall were alive.

Tonks tried her hardest but she was strangled by her intestines by a summoning spell and a strangling spell. Harry cast difindo to spear her the pain.

Mcgonagall finished before turning to him saying "Goodbye Harry!" And he was wosked away by her Order Portkey back to Hogwarts.

IT lifted Mcgonagall by yer neck and snapped it using magic. And suddenly a magical Nuclear bomb wiped out all magical life in England killing the construct of magic for good.

Crocker had left when IT arrived and was shortly tried for his crimes by the international Wizegamot.

Harry Potter married Ginny and named his three children James Siruis, Albus REMUS and Lily HERMIONE Potter.

One day someone knocked on the door, as Ginny opened she was instantly vaporized.

Harry thought to himself 'Am I on coke again?'
