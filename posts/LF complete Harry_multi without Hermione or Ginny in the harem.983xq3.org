Pretty much anytime Harry has multiple girlfriends Hermione and/or Ginny are in the thick of things. What about stories without them in Harry's love life. They can be in the story as long as they're not in his harem.

Completed stories only please.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
