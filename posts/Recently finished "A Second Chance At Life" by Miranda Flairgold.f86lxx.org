As the title says I recently finished Miranda's serries starting with "A Second Chance At Life" and I'm super sad that it is unfinished. I was wondering if anyone knew of similar fics. I'm also always looking for new romance fics (all ships supported ðŸ˜‚)


** linkffnet(bloody-skies) Bloody Skies byToki Mirage is similar story that I really enjoyed reading, plus it is completed.
