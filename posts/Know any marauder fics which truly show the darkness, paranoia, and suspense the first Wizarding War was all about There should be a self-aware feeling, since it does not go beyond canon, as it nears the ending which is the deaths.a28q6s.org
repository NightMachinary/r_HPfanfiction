#+TITLE: Know any marauder fics which truly show the darkness, paranoia, and suspense the first Wizarding War was all about? There should be a self-aware feeling, since it does not go beyond canon, as it nears the ending which is the deaths of the potters, the SB and PP craziness, and one survivor.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801][The Age of Lies]] linkao3(13281801) - canon divergence, set post-Hogwarts

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9106972][Glass of Water]] linkao3(9106972) - set 6th year and is from Lily's POV, but really focuses on the "war is coming" feeling

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus...Regulus is alive.No-one is more surprised than him.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

** I would recommend the Promises saga, by Robin4. It starts with Promises Unbroken, follows with Promises Remembered, and finishes with Promises Defended. It also has a prequel to everything called Promises Honored, but you can read that after the original trilogy. It starts with the premise of Sirius being the secret keeper, instead of Peter, and how the four of them fight in the war against Voldemort while also maintainimg their friendship and dealing with their own problems. It turns kind of dark, ince all of them deal with some pretty grim stuff, but as the saying goes, it all has to get worse before it gets better. It deals with the issue of distrust and betrayal, but this is more a redemption fic, it's not an every man for himself situation. I can't say more without spoiling. It's very extensive and very well narrated. I definitely recommend. Might not be exactly whst you're looking for, but I would definitely give it a try.

  They laid James Potter in state without his glasses, and the autumnal color scheme of the flowers clashed horrendously with Lily's hair. And there is nothing Remus Lupin can do, about even the little things. Early November, 1981. (a short oneshot).
