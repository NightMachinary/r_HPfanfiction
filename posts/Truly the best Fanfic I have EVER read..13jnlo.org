I assume many people have read this but if not, check out the Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave. (First book is called Saving Connor) It's about 6 times as long as the actual Harry Potter series, but definitely worth reading. It's crazily well-written and the characterization is fantastic. (It's HarryxDraco btw)

Just spent the last month reading nothing else, so I figured I'd go ahead and promote it.


** What's the concept?

Also, I will reserve judgment, but anything that's slash makes me/extremely/ skeptical about good characterization (or at least, characterization consistent with the source)

*** I feel the same way, at least when the slash is about Harry.

I'm also rather iffy on stories where Harry has a twin who is supposedly the Boy-Who-Lived.

**** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] is fantastic. Though the author stopped updating on FFN a while ago for some reason; a lot of it is on the WbA section of DLP. Though worth noting if your concern is about consistent characterization with canon, Harry is totally different in this one, while the twin is effectively canon Harry.

*** Harry is in Slytherin while his twin (the real boy who lived) is in Gryffindor and Harry has been trained from a young age to essentially live completely for his brother and be his protector at all times. He then attracts the notice of Snape and Draco and it spirals into chaos from there but that's the basic premise. And I had the same feeling when someone told me to start this but it was so worth it. :)

*** It's... /interesting/. In many ways I loved it, it had some brilliant ideas, excellent writing, some of the most interesting and thorough presentations of magical theory that I've encountered, and lots very good characters (particularly Evan Rosier, a creepy cannibal who quotes a lot of Swinburne, and was one of my favorite death eaters from any fanfic ever), and Harry's characterization was pretty good at times, but there were some serious issues.

The slash was very very annoying, and I'm not usually a slash hater. Draco was unbearably whiny and annoying, but the author loves him and gave him a LOT of screen time. All of Harry's issues were dealt with in a kinda realistic way, meaning that he agonizes and agonizes and maybe makes a bit of progress and then backslides and agonizes some more and then backslides again, over the equivalent of several hundred pages of text. It was just way too long and way too repetitive.

That said, large parts of it were fantastic, and I thought it was worth the ridiculous time sink and the boring 40 page sex scenes/angst scenes/stupid fluffy romantic scenes that I pretty much invariably skimmed over/skipped.

** I read the first two, but it got a bit long for me. I don't know why but I could never remember what had happened when, and I found Draco to be a bit clingy (not sure if that changed later). But I agree with you in that it's very well written :)

*** Draco got very slightly better, but not much. He nearly ruined it for me, but it was worth it in the end.

This fic would have been 1000 times better if Rosier just ate the whiny little ferret.

** I'm a bit late to this, but yes, the Sacrifices Arc is probably the only complete fanfic septology.

Its main strength is definitely its background and universe; I still have not found any fanfiction that is able to match its sheer depth and intricacy (especially the purebred culture, the rituals, and the concept of a vates)!

However, I feel the fic doesn't really take off until all that is set up by the third book or so. For me, everything before the third book are cheesy and repetitive plot lines and some not so subtle set-up for slash.

As for everything past the third book, the only major problem I had were with Harry's [spoiler]constant mental breakdowns[/spoiler], which become quite repetitive after a while.

I admire the dedication and work that Lightning must have put into this; she has incredible talent. If anyone wants more of her stuff, she has some original work at [[http://www.fictionpress.com/%7Elimyaael][FictionPress]].

** I read the whole damn thing. I'm a fan of Harry/Draco in general, but tended to skip their parts until Draco stopped being whiny. But man, was I a fan of the pureblood dances. I ate those parts up.

Yeah, I can already tell this will be amazingly well written with a believable plot and characters with personalities that are faithful to the original series.

** Saving Connor was my first fanfic that I read and I really enjoyed it, but for some reason I didn't realize what Draco/Harry meant. Around the second book, I clued in and stopped reading, it started feeling awkward and a little forced, and Draco was always so clingy and manipulative. What I did like about this series, was that he tried explaining different parts of magical theory which was nice. However, the whole pureblood deal just bothered me, it practically idealized pureblood ignorance and power, when they were really no different than half-bloods or muggleborns. Overall, if you're into slash fiction and care about magical theory, this will be a fantastic read that will absorb your life. I learned, however, Drarry, and most other slash involving harry, isn't really my thing.
