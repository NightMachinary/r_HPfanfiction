** An oldie but a goodie, Prelude to Destiny is one of my favorite fics period. Lily should be annoyingly perfect but isn't. There are great OCs, great interactions between Lily/James but also the best Sirius/Lily friendship characterization I've seen. Canon through OOTP. [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/anotherdreamer/PTD.html]]

Prelude to Destiny by AnotherDreamer Rating: PG-13 /They lived to defy Voldemort. They lived to enact vengeance. They lived in the shadow of better people. They lived to earn the respect of better people. Their story is more than the tragic beginning of the great victory over the Dark Lord. It weaves its way through heartbreaking love, games of magical tag, hours of learning animagi transformations, dates with the wrong sort of boy, and the bonds that death cannot break. This is the story of the people who will star in the footnotes of the great battles of Harry Potter- they who History deems unworthy of great attention and who worked diligently with Destiny to pave the path of the Boy Who Lived./

#+begin_quote
  The year is 1983, and Lily Evans is protected from a world controlled by Death Eaters by her best friend.--Lily feels like a half-finished puzzle.Some days she tries to put the parts she's got together. Some days, she almost feels like she's got it, she's found all the missing pieces, and she's ready to find the places they go in, but they never quite fit. It's never long before she loses them again, before something breaks her concentration and it's all lost, all so many little meaningless words that don't fit or connect anywhere.She clings to what she has anyway. The last time she thought she remembered something important, it was just a name, but it seemed the most important name she had ever heard, it seemed so important, like someone had screamed it three streets away and the wind had carried it here. She stole a scrap of parchment and a quill and wrote it down. She hadn't held a quill in so long that it shook, and her handwriting was large and messy, like a child's. It was just five letters:Harry.And then, later, when she remembered something else, another five letters, strung together, it seems, almost by chance:James.
