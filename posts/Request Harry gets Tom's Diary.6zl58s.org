I'm looking for a specific fic I read ages ago. It's a slash fic I want to say was called Poison Pen, and was HP/TR. In fourth year Harry ends up with Tom Riddle's diary, and the fall in love. I think the author deleted their profile... If anyone has this fic saved somwhere, please... It's my white whale...
