:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
now, i read this fic about 2 years ago. it's a Harry Potter/Star Wars crossover.

the basics, Harry/Hermione pairing

harry trains a group of jedi including ron, luna, and others.

ron and Luna are together, but ron dies at the end.

harry is worried that the abuse he took at the dursleys shortened his life.

harry and Dobby are near equals with a Lightsaber

fred and george get in trouble when making their saber crystals, as they nearly kill themselves in the process, they also create a lightsaber with a shifting rainbow blade.

harry and the others defeat voldemort, and dumbledore flips his shit, he tries to kill Harry in plain view of the Aurors and Madam bones, ranting how harry must die or voldemort will return.

if i remember correctly, this all starts when harry has a conversation with Yoda through the Force. this in turn starts him on the path of building his own small jedi order.

hermione's parents are also involved in the training.

â€‹

these are just the details i can remember off the top of my head. i have looked but cannot seem to find the fic. it might be on fanfiction, ao3, or hpfanfictionarchive. i am unsure which.

if anyone knows the fic? please let me know where i can find it, so that i may read it again.

thank you for your time.


** one final thing, it may have wound up a multi pairing for harry at the end. i just remember it starts out as a Harmony pairing.

*** it was. hence why i want to find the fic. it was also one of the first HP fics i ever read. so needless to say the nostalgia value is high on this one.

** I think i found the fic. JEDI POTTER on Ficwad. so far everything seems to match up...

YES!!!! SUCCESS! I HAVE FOUND IT!

JEDI POTTER by Alorkin on Ficwad. 37 chapters in length, including a couple notes, it is exactly as i remember it.

it is also one of the single best harry centric Star Wars crossovers to take place solely in the Potterverse. it NEVER leaves Earth. there are hints at the star wars canon, but the fic never falls into the cliche of harry going out into the greater galaxy and acting as the janitor to Anakin's messes.

so many HP/SW fics have harry as a jedi fixing all the major turning points, thus preventing Palpatine from becoming emperor. it is over done honestly.

this fic avoids that by staying squarely inside the Potterverse.

i strongly recommend this fic to anyone. it is a good one.
