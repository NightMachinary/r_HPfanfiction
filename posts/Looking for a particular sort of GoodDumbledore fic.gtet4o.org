** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), both are from the same author and feature scarily manipulative Dumbledores. But instead of the usual "how to manipulate a teenager to sacrifice himself" BS, these Dumbledores display their skills on the political and operational level. Of course, Harry stays totally loyal to him.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] plays out in a non magical sci-fi universe in which Hogwarts is a spy school. Needless to say, this Dumbledore is manipulative and ruthless as hell. Being trained from very early on, these kids are also on a totally different level and eventually figure out what Dumbledore was up to. But since they are already master spies, no hard feelings here:

  Harry softly said, “Dumbledore was already resigned about dying. He didn't even care about getting hurt or poisoned when we went in the cave. He would've asked for help on something else. Like turning Draco. Or protecting the school.”

  Ron fumed, “You're trying to tell me Dumbles was asking Snape to kill him?”

  Hermione asked him, “Would you have wanted to go out the way the headmaster was facing? Either being tortured to death by Death Eaters or slowly dying in agony from his illness?”

  Neville said through his packed nose, “Old SS and KGB trick. You shoot your spy so everyone thinks you're on their side.”

*** Cheers, gonna bookmark those to read next! I've read way too many of the inept Dumbledore fics lately, it's nice to read something better for a change.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** Did you edit this segment from HGatBWLso the names are right? Or is their a version with the HP names. It's the only thing that really bothers me about this fic.
