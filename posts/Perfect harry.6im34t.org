Something like time to put your galleons where your mouth is. I mean some one so perfect(in the way he act) to seem a mask. It's not about power.

More-or-less Harry as somewhat a better version. of teenager Tom Riddle, only he is good/light.


** Anything by Jeconais. In all of his stories Harry is amazing and everyone is constantly in awe of him. He gets all the women and does all the magic and everybody has a splendid time. In some of his stories he actually manages to make be believe it too.

Many of them are good, and it's really nice to read something where the world isn't burning down around our cast on occasion. I particularly liked [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] which I think most people see is his best work, and it is definitely something to read.

***** Gary Stu is more about clich√© and wish fulfilment, good at everything no bad sides.

Different from a Gary Stu with only good sides, What I search is a MC with perfect scores in social interaction. Things like be trusted, having more than a way with words, knowing how to get on the good side of people, maybe caring with juniors. I don't care if he is magically talented, no good in sport, or other things.

Was it clear?

****** Oh so like super socially competent/skilled Harry. That seems interesting.

Idk if I'd call it "perfect Harry" but I get what you mean.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) and linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) might be up your alley

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
