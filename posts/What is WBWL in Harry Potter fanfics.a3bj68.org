** Wrong Boy Who Lived. The usual setup is this; you have twins instead of a single child. Instead of James and Lily dying, they survive and Voldemort is vanquished by some sort of weird twin magic (basically no fic explains how this actually happens). However, Voldemort still only marks one of them as his equal (Harry), being the Boy who Lived and the other isn't marked (let's call him James). James is heralded as Boy Who Lived, despite Harry being the actual one. James remains with his parents, growing up a spoiled brat and bully, sorted in Gryffindor, and Harry is raised with the Dursleys or some other bad environment, sorted into Slytherin, is regarded as "dark" but in the end is the true hero of the story. Sometimes Harry gets his own mentor figure in life (usually Sirius/Remus as his godfather, and/or Severus as his Head of House) to give some sort of counterbalance to James Jr.'s support group (parents, Dumbledore, the other one of Sirius/Remus). Usually contains bashing of most "Light-aligned" people, especially James Sr.

There is another trope where Neville becomes the BWL, but those stories aren't labeled WBWL... unsure if they have their own term.

*** That's a nicely accurate rundown of the usual ways this trope is done.

*** Well that sounds fucking stupid. Like those fanfics where Naruto has a big sister who does all the protagonist stuff for him.

** A shitty trope where an otherwise normal family ignores one son in favour of his twin brother/sister.

The only good WBWL stories I've read are Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, and Just Another Orphan, where HP is legitimately not the one marked by Voldemort.

*** WBWL can also mean that Neville is seen as the Boy-who-lived. Not necessarily shitty Potters, it can be also just a manipulative Dumbledore (be it favouring Neville or Harry's brother).

*** I don't think it's usually Neville. More often Harry's twin, who somehow has an extremely out of place name like Todd or something, is extremely doted upon by Lily and James, and is Dumbledore's favourite. Of course, Harry is now neglected and abused, and half the time is still living with the Dursleys.

**** There is an aweful lot of 'Harry has a twin, who gets the fame while Harry gets a secret destiny. I have no clue why, it makes no sense with the existing character setup.

I think it was originally Neville though along the lines of 'the prophecy was targeting Neville all along'. Bwhich at least fits better

***** I actually literally saw a fic today that had the WBWL named Josh. Think about that. I believe it's in the first community I linked in another comment.

****** What a lot of people don't understand is that you should put as much thought into naming your characters as you would your own child. Does it flow well? Does it match the rest of the names in the family? Etc., etc.

... But then, some people don't think about that stuff for their actual children, so I suppose I shouldn't be so harsh.

******* At least Josh(ua) continues the whole semi-messianic theme of the story, since it comes from the same Hebrew root name as Jesus - Yeshua.

**** It's more often Neville, a canonical Boy-Who-Almost-Was, than an OC twin...
