So I recently caught up on Blindness, linkffn(10937871). Are there any similar stories where Harry focuses on healing? Not just from injuries, but cures as well would be a plus. I have read "To Shape and Change", linkffn(6413108). Also, preferably no slash stories.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** There is one that I am reading called 'Whispers of the Night', but it pseudo-harem (it is actually polygamous relationship), but there is little focus on the healing, even like 40+ chapters in.

It ls mentioned all the time, and you see him making awesome strides in it, but he really has had more then like 2 chapters where it is super useful.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

*** Also note that later on has some of the most impressively descriptive combat scenes in fanfiction, like on the level of 'the lie i've lived'
