**   Smoky balls flew out of the cauldron, changing color every other ball of smoke. Very shortly. they were surrounded by them. One of the balls floated into George's face, and exploded into pink slime. Another floated into Fred's shoulder, dousing him in yellow slime. The twins stared at eachother. "I don't think that's supposed to happen. Did you add the porcupine quills?" Fred asked.\\
  "Porcupine quills? I don't have any porcupine quills! I have echidna spines!"\\
  The potion they were brewing chose that moment to start expelling copious amounts of slimy sinew. "BRACE!" shouted both the twins in unison as they dived to the floor, followed by the remaining potion exploding and rendering the room something that would not look out of place in a Jackson Pollock gallery.\\
  The twins slowly pushed themselves off the floor. Fred stared at his- well, himself. Sort of. He could tell it was his body he was staring at because it was still doused in yellow slime. He stared down at the hand attached to the body he resided in. Different freckles too. "Huh. Well. Now we really are Gred and Forge," he quipped.\\
  George glared back out of Fred's face, "I'm not really-"\\
  "-finding this funny. I know," Fred said, interrupted George, who huffed at the interruption.\\
  "Now really isn't-\\
  "-the time to twinspeak," said Fred\\
  "Will you /stop/, you absolute bellend?!" George shouted at his twin. "We've switched bodies and this is hardly the time to joke."\\
  Fred was a bit taken aback by this. "Whao! What's gotten into you?"\\
  "You! You got into me!" George growled out.\\
  Both twins grimaced at that. "That did not sound right," they said.\\
  "Still, I'm not sure what the issue is, we're twins," Fred said, stepping forward, then stumbling. "What in the blazes is wrong with your feet, George?"\\
  "They're /my/ feet, Fred. We may be twins, but despite our best efforts, we aren't actually identical," George retorted. He very gingerly took a step forward. "You have fat ankles, Fred."\\
  Fred looked quite affronted at this, "Do not!"\\
  "Not the time, Georg- FRED."\\
  Both brothers stared at eachother for a good long moment, before collapsing into eachother's arms in helpless laughter. The laughter continued until they were both on the floor gasping for breath.\\
  "So... Now what do we do?" Asked George.\\
  "Talk to Dumbledore?" Suggested Fred.\\
  "Oh, that is a fantastic idea. Confess to Dumbledore that we were brewing experimental potions unsupervised in an abandoned classroom, and had an /accident/? Do you /want/ a howler from Mum?" George groused.\\
  "Better him than the slimy git!"\\
  Both twins shuddered. For all that they learned a lot from Potions, the only person Snape hated more than them was Harry Potter.\\
  "That wouldn't end well," George observed.\\
  Fred snorted. "Too right, George."

** Or they don't care and still go but I'm Fred I'm George even when they're actually not.

Could definitely see them looking at each other, and going eh who will ever know?

** What if they notice but no one else does because their so identical! So they just keep on living life as each other and tbh they do everything together so no one actually can notice and when " Fred " dies it's actually George and then Fred tells everyone that he's in Georges body and George is in his body so they can save him if they turn back to normal because he's already survived as Fred and George so yeah!

** But they are identical twins. They should have little to no differences in their body. They are the same age and go to the same classes and shit. Hell there's no reason to even hide it.

It's not even "Fred going to have pretend to be George on the Quidditch, because Wood is so observant he will somehow notice the difference if George shows up in Fred's body", because Fred is actually on the quidditch team. They have the same life pretty much.
