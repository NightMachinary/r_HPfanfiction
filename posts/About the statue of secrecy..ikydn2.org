How much harder would it be to mantain secrecy if the numbers population were much more even?. Let's say that instead or being only 500 millon wizards across the world in the 90's ( according to the wiki), there were 2.5 billon. What would be the consequences?.


** If there were literally 2.5 billion witches and wizards a statute of secrecy would be irrelevant.

*** Hell if there were 500 million wizards, the statute of secrecy would be totally irrelevant.

*** Yep. 2.5 billion people with roughly double the life expectancy of mundanes and each of them able to laugh at the laws of physics? They'd easily control all the resources and mundane people would be an underclass.

** The wiki is almost certainly not accurate in this respect. I'd put the highest estimates far lower than 500 million. That would place the population at over 1:20.

I'd say that at 2.5 billion wizards, wizards would rule in the open. Muggles would be lower-class citizens after wizards. Magical products would be employed daily. Technological development would likely never have really occurred (high quality of life means that the Wizarding population will have been high for a long time).

** Well, the real question is where all those wizards would come from.

If they just appeared one day, then it would be impossible for the statute of secrecy to be upheld. Having an extra 2 billion humans on Earth would also not be sustainable and it would lead to resource wars, no doubt about that. (I am of the belief that the number of 500 million wizards is VERY VERY wrong though, but that wasn't your question).

Not that there would need to be a reason for hiding anymore. Of course there were the witch burnings and the superstitious hostility of the population in general that led wizards to start hiding. But the real reason they /stayed hidden/ probably lies in the advent of the industrial revolution that happened soon after - in the Harry Potter universe possibly even as a direct and unintended result of them going into hiding.

During this time the economic power of the non-magicals rose to a degree that wizards were never able to match. There's almost no large scale magic in canon and the wizarding world never attempted to replace its craftsmen with much more efficient automation and factory workers. All of that becomes irrelevant once you reach a near population parity, since even mediocre wizards can replace a large amount of non-magical technology with a handful of spells.

If the number of wizards is a natural effect on the other hand, then one has to trace their numbers back to when that happened. Did they have parity in numbers forever or did that happen at a specific point in time?

I'm going with the second option for this one: wizards have had a much higher standard of living for the past millennium at least. In the UK the largest change can be directly traced back to the opening of Hogwarts as the first school that was open to anyone. Given the society at the time, one can assume that education had been based on the apprentice system previously with plenty of self-educated hedge wizards and witches around. Even their meager knowledge would have let them live a better life than the average peasant of the time.

What happens when you have a better quality of life and can achieve a higher education too? That's easy: you gain in influence and wealth. Over time this would lead to a very different social dynamic. Wizards would sooner or later ask themselves why they should have to put up with following non-magical rulers in the first place and take ownership of the land and rulership over the entire population for themselves.

With the stranglehold wizards would have gained over both the politics and economics of the entire world, the possibility for scientific education and research would be markedly reduced. This would in itself stop the industrial revolution cold, but even if some enterprising non-magical geniuses were to work on alternatives to magic in a specific area, they wouldn't be successful. One only has to look for how long the oil industry successfully suppressed research and development in areas that would threaten them. That's without wizards simply choosing to obliviate those pesky muggles of their annoying ideas.

The social changes during and after the industrial revolution were massive, none of which would ever happen here.

How would the world under wizarding rule look like today with this sort of backstory? I don't dare speculate, but keep in mind that servant (if not outright slave) species have survived in the hidden wizarding society until at least the late 20th century. The lack of equality for other sapient magical species is notable too. Without an industrial revolution and all the social changes that came from it, the society probably consists of a small amount of rich landowners, a narrow middle class and a large number of poor serfs. Poor they may be, but with so much magic rolling around this doesn't have to mean bad living conditions.
