  'Here,' he said. 'We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.'

  Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching, but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.

** I have a theory that Harry's room had a portrait which connected to another portrait in Dumbledore's office - or, alternatively, St. Mungo's (since Harry's ancestors invented some important healing potions). So, the portrait may have spread the story quickly. We see this usage of portraits at least twice in OotP.

** The only way that Dumbledore could know to send Hagrid to pick up Harry after the attack is if he already knew the outcome of the attack. How could he know? Probably because he's actually Ron. Ronbledore confirmed.

*** That whole time line is messed up. My headcanon is that Dumbledore went first and checked things out, then called Hagrid in to attend to Harry. For this to be logical I assume that you don't use magical transport with babies, which I don't think is much of a stretch, seeing as how unpleasant it is for grownups. So Hagrid comes in to take him a more mundane way, til Sirius gives him his motorbike.

Also in a more logical world, Harry wasn't taken directly to the Dursleys, he was taken somewhere else for a day, which would account for the story spreading and everyone celebrating while McG is just chilling on a fence as a cat.

This is canon. Godric's Hollow isn't west of Bristol (which Hagrid passed on his way to Surrey), so I'd say Hagrid took Harry to a safehouse somewhere in Wales or West England - probably the Forest of Dean, where Hagrid (and Rowling) was raised. Yes, the same forest they returned to in DH - a book which had a recurring motif of returning to places previously visited in the series.

***** Also, we know from Chapter 1 that news of the attack was spreading across the country all day; Vernon sees owls flying about and wizards out in plain daylight celebrating. So either they took Harry away for the whole day or they left an orphaned baby alone in a destroyed house with his dead parents for a whole day. I lean towards the former.

** Prophecy, mainly. Possibly Snape, if his mark reacted to Voldemort's death. If you're asking how Dumbledore knew it was the Killing Curse specifically, well, there's a couple logical reasons. Spell residue, priori incantatem if the wand was left behind, just plain assumption because that was Voldemort's trademark spell.

Of course none of these are actually canon, because we don't GET an answer in canon, aside from Harry's dreams. We as readers know it was the killing curse from Harry's dreams, with the flash of green.

Aside from that, anyone looking for certainty is SOOL.

EDIT: there's also the idea that it was contextual. Lily and James were killed by the Killing Curse, Voldemort wasn't likely to change spells on a whim when one was working so well for him.

  In the woods at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup in Dartmoor, England, this effect was invoked by Amos Diggory by incantation on Harry Potter's wand, which had been wielded by Winky the house-elf, in order to determine who had conjured the Dark Mark over the campsite. - Harry Potter Wiki
#+end_quote

It's an actual spell, it's just that brother cores amplify the effect tenfold, for whatever reason.

As for Voldemort's wand, well I have no idea. Another thing not mentioned in canon at all. If they had any sense they would have snapped the damn thing. Honestly never seen an object get plot armor before.

***** Peter was missing when Sirius went to check on him and the only person who knew where Voldemort was. Since Peter returned Voldemort's wand to him after resurrecting him, he might have been nearby to see the house explode and ran with the wand after finding his master dead.

*** Snape is the most likely explanation of how Dumbledore knew something happened, but not why he sent Hagrid to check on things rather than go himself. Though he could have gone later and seen how Harry's parents were killed to somehow guess that Lilly sacrificed herself trying to save Harry and caused Voldemort's spell to backfire creating the explosion.

Nothing really explains the missing day, why Dumbledore only left a letter for the Dursleys, and knew that blood magic would mysteriously protect Harry as long as he called their place home.

We simply have to face the fact that Rowling sacrificed explanations for symbolism.

**** I think that Dumbledore, being nearly 100 years old at the time, had seen a great deal of inexplicable magic and given that he knew the prophecy, he might not have assumed that Harry was a corpse.

Not that he could have foreseen an infant surviving the killing curse, but that he'd been around and knew better than to assume anything.

ETA: That device in his office that was the subject of "in essence divided" in book 5. Was that something he put in place when Harry was an infant because of the prophecy?

ETA2: The trace was on baby Harry - did the Ministry know the magic was happening in the house?

** I'd imagine its just inferring. Voldemort primarily uses the Killing Curse to kill (that's pretty much all he uses in the books). Because of the prophecy, Dumbledore knew that LV was after Harry to kill him. After the whole debacle, he entered the Potter house to see James dead on the floor due to the killing curse. Up the stairs, Lily's dead from it too. But Harry isn't, and he's got a bleeding scar on his forehead. Also, magic leaves traces. I don't know exactly what that means, but perhaps Dumbledore could tell that the killing curse was used on Harry, or that Voldemort cast three killing curses in that home (and he's too good to miss). Maybe Dumbledore even got the memory of the attack from Harry and viewed in in a pensieve -- or viewed it straight via legilimency.

***** What would be a better example in your mind?

I just mentioned him because [[/r/asoiaf][r/asoiaf]] discover tiny details hinting at future events all the time. Sometimes it is full on tinfoil but other times they have some logical base.

I thought it would be a good comparison to show, forgetting to plan something and planning something books in advance.

And why I chose GRRM and not another author, is probably because I haven't read a popular book series except these two.

P.S. I may have leaked off some fanboy earlier and I must apologize for that.

****** Well, first of all, GRRM's writing has some... questionable qualities. ("Sunset found her squatting in the grass, groaning..." "fat pink mast" and so on)

Second, GRRM's books are rich in detail, but half of it is red herrings or simply irrelevant detail, while almost all small detail in Harry Potter foreshadowed an unfolding plot. I simply can't believe that GRRM is going to wrap up all the subplots he introduced in the series, many of which indeed led nowhere. He admitted that he wasted a lot of time trying to solve the "Meereenese Knot". And then you have subplots springing out of nowhere, like Aegon in ADWD.

To be honest, I seriously doubt GRRM is going to finish ASOIAF at all. Rowling, at the very least, knew how to meet deadlines. GRRM prefers writing about Handegg than writing ASOIAF - the last I heard he barely completed 200 pages of TWOW, and it has been four years since ADWD was released. He might be good at world-building, but he is not a good writer.

I agree wholeheartedly, but atleast he doesn't have illogical institutions, ie Snape being a dick and still getting away with it. This could still be attributed to a racist and barbaric world of her creation, so I can't say much about this.

You know that's not an argument, man. The same could be said of Justin Bieber. And many don't see ASOIAF as a great book series. I enjoyed reading it, but overall it ranks far below many other fantasy books I've read.
