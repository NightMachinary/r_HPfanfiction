It has to have Hermione in Slytherin. It can have one of the following plot lines:

- Hermione is sorted into Slytherin, but the story follows Ron and Harry as main characters.

- Hermione is the main character.

- Bellatrix travels back in time and takes over Hermione's body in order to save Voldemort.

I doesn't matter if Hermione x Draco is involved. But if it's Hermione (Slytherin) x Ron (Gryffindor) the better.


** I'm a little confused, so its Bellatrix taking over Hermione's body, but what happens to Bella in that time? I.E, does Bella from the future affect present Bella?

I read this one a while ago, and I found it quite good. It's the only Slytherin Hermione I've read though, so it may not be as good as others.

It seemed to follow a fairly unique path in my opinion with some really interesting plot elements.

Hermione x Draco
