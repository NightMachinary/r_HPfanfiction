I look at this reddit and don't understand why people are so obsessed with Harry that noone else is being asked for in threads asking for indie or dark. I've always found him to be a really bland character to fulfill the trope of the Chosen, nearly a blank slate. Sure, some fanfiction starring him changes his character and he becomes interesting to read about, but still reading about him gets old. So please tell me how to find indie\dark\grey fanfiction about anyone else but him?

I'll appreciate links to specific well-written fanfiction, naturally, but I also want to know how to find it myself, so I'll appreciate if you give me hints about that, too. It's relatively easy to find recommendations for indie!dark!grey!Harry, after all, because everyone is obsessed with him, but when it comes to fanfiction starring anyone else, I'm not even sure which words to use in the search engine.

P.S. It can literally be anyone else. The possibility of a protagonist being Hermione\Ron\ Draco\OC comes to mind first, but I really don't care, it can even be a side-character in canon.


** This is (somehow) an indy!Grey!Dumbledore. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/Phoenix-Insurgent]]) It's still in progress but it is a fun read and regularly updated!

There is nothing (to fear) is a series of shorts/one-shots about about a Tom Riddle sorted into Gryffindor. Somehow it makes him even creepier than in canon.

  Better to be the right hand of the devil than in his path. Better still to be the consort of Hades than a part of his collection of souls. Ten years after Voldemort has won the war, Hermione reaches a breaking point and shreds the flow of time to change her future. If she can't change the world, she will change her place in it. - Extremely dark Tomione/Volmione. Warnings inside.

** Well... the novels were titled "Harry Potter and the ..." for a reason.

Not saying fanfiction shouldn't subvert that, but most people prefer Harry as the protagonist. That's probably the reason why you think people are obsessed with Harry Potter as a character. It's not that they are obsessed, it's just that without him, it could just as well be a generic fantasy world. That's how I see it and why I don't like HP fics that don't involve him.

*** Imho, Harry is what makes the novels so generic. The Chosen One? Check. Mistreated but secretly amazing and famous (and even rich)? Check. Has no knowledge\power but is always lucky to defeat the villain because he should? Check. Not terribly good and compassionate, but is said to be exceptionally morally good? Check. Etc, etc.

I don't think it's just me who dislikes these tropes, most people in this fandom aren't teenagers anymore and want to read something different. But imho some of these tropes are easier to get rid of when Harry is not in the picture. I've seen fanfiction that subverts them, but the worst offender, the Chosen One trope, is usually still in, because that's Harry. He's still a Mary Sue. Writing from someone else's POV would eliminate lingering tropes automatically and if there's still a fight with Voldie, the new character has to use intelligence and\or earn some actual power to defeat him.

Sure I understand that it's just me who dislikes him for these reasons, so I'm not exactly arguing. Just discussing. And it helps. Now I think that maybe I should've created a topic that asks for non-MarySue protagonist who works for everything the hard way, rather than ask for fanfiction about alternative characters. The former seems to be what I'm looking for, after all, the latter being just potential means towards that end. ;)

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
