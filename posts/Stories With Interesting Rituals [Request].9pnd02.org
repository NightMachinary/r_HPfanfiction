In canon, we see or learn about maybe two or three things that could be considered a ritual: Animagus process, Horcrux creation and the potion Riddle used to restore his body. In fanfic, I don't often see any examples of magical rituals and when I do it's usually pretty boring stuff. I recall a crossover where Harry gets generic physical enhancements "because ritual". Any stories with interesting ones? Perhaps the effects of the ritual aren't fully understood by those doing it so the end result is less predictable.


** There's a very unique ritual near the end of the second in this series, though it's more into explaining magic and inventing spells.

One: linkffn(10070079)

Two: linkffn(11463030)

Three: linkffn(13001252)

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/1/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] contains a Death Eater marking ritual (ch 21).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2905557/1/Heir-of-Slytherin][Heir of Slytherin]] - Harry performs a rather psychedelic ritual to find a familiar (ch 17-18).

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

*** Arguably, not just potions, but all wizardry and witchcraft. After all, what is a ritual other than a set of procedural steps with magical significance which produces a magical effect?

*** Eh, you're not really wrong but I think if you call those rituals you end up broadening the concept too much. All of a sudden any common social interaction that follows the same steps every time (hand shakes and greetings) become rituals too. I'm tightening the definition so it makes it easier to identify what I'm looking for.

***** Exactly! The theory need not be explicitly detailed, but how the ritual is performed would be nice.

** I'm a little confused why would anyone do a ritual that will permanently alter their body if they don't know exactly what it would do?

*** Because what is known about it may be enough to sway them. It's not like wizards always know what they're own magic will do, so they may not even know there are other side effects. As an example, take the Elixir of Life. Yay, we've got immortality. But what if it didn't de-age you but simply keep you alive as your body gets worse and worse. You wouldn't know that beforehand, as no one else is known to have had a Stone besides the Flamels.
