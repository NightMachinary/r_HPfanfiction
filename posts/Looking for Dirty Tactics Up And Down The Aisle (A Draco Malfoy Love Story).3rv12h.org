I'm on a crazy quest for Dirty Tactics Up And Down The Aisle by SinAndSmile, the 2nd story in her Dirty Tactics (A Draco Malfoy Love Story) series. She originally wrote them both on Quizilla but when they closed down the site (without warning I might add), she lost everything. She (Sarah) and I have been searching all our resources without much luck, so now I've come to you reddit community. If any one of you kind souls still has a copy of that story for what ever reason, we would be most thrilled to have it posted/sent to us. If she gets it back, she may finally be able to finish the story. :) A moment all her fans have been waiting 7 years for. Thank you!

Unfortunately, not all of the chapters were archived. Most of the ones I tried seem to work, though. Hope it helps!

*** Oh my gosh! You are the most amazing person ever! We are soooo grateful to you for this! :) You've made my day and will have made Sarah's as well! Thank you felicitations! If you or anyone else knows of a way we might find those missing chapters that would be fantastic but in all sincerity, this link is most helpful. :)

**** Hey SterlingOtter, have you or Sarah posted the story on another site? I used to read this story about 8-9 years ago and something made think of it the other day and I found this reddit thread! I would love to read it again, major nostalgia!
