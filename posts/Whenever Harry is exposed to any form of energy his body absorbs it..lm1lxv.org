- If he spends to much time out in the sun he's like a toddler on a sugar high.
- Magic is a form of Energy.
- He absorbs magic instinctually but needs conscious thought to absorb any other form of energy.*

Thank you [[/u/tribblite][u/tribblite]] for pointing out some major flaws.

I've been on the subreddit for two days and some comments impressed me more than most of the fanfics that I've read, Just wanted to see if someone can come up with anything good.

*Edit


** So you'd probably want to add some restrictions, since if you take it to it's logical conclusion:

- Harry will be a pitch black hole of nothingness silhouette as he wouldn't reflect any light.
- Harry will be icy cold to the touch as he absorbs heat.
- I'm not sure how kinetic energy will mess up (granted heat is just diffuse kinetic energy), but one way might be some weird reaction to air.
- Chemical energy would be intersting. Does he absorb a whole object or just the surface layer? This could make touching Harry deadly.

Of course, Harry does need some way to vent energy or he will overheat.

Hawking radiation. This means that (assuming a perfectly spherical non-rotating 1 year old Harry with a mass of 9kg) he has a lifetime of 6.1x10^{-14} seconds. Also, Voldemort dies from burns^{\}) before he gets to cast the AK.

* and when I say "burns" I mean "he and everything within several km can kiss its arse goodbye". Lily screwed up that protection magic pretty badly.

*** Lily mathematically proves that 1) There cannot be a charm to protect Harry from Voldemort and 2) There IS some transfiguration that would protect Harry from literally anything.

It's James who casts the spell that turns Harry into a black hole.

*** I've made one edit which should solve this issue, Thanks for pointing this out, this was a shower thought so I didn't think a lot about it before posting.

**** Heh, pointing out problems is much easier than coming up with solutions.

So having an absorbsion cap means that unless he has an interesting way to vent he would probably always be at his cap.

But either way we want an interesting story. Which is tricky as I think the way to achieve this is by following Sanderson's second law of magic. Which essentially says limitations are more interesting than extra powers.

For a lack of control what is absorbed and how it's vented will make things interesting. You could have a scientific study type fic where you explore the consequences, which would make an interesting short story for more unrestricted manifestations.

In general though, I think I would want to have some modicum of control, but the most interesting would be as your prompt suggested where it gives him some negative side effects.

That said the most important aspect of his power should be that it blocked the killing curse.

With that you could play around with the idea that the killing potentially knocked out his power for a while due to the powerful nature of the curse, which made him seem normal for a decade.

But as for the nature of the restrictions, the easiest thing is to restrict his abilities to what kind of energy they absorb (only magic would be the easiest to extrapolate), limit what percentage of power he absorbs (which could account for why he was scarred instead of killed) or limit how much he could absorb at a time.

EDIT: I think the way to swing this is to consider what kind of story you want. Make a bunch of restrictions that would cause that and then expand your story with some of the other consequences of your restrictions.

Having his power limited to only absorbing magic, be knocked out while he is discharging, might be interesting since there're periods where he seems normal and then periods where magic can't touch him. However, this would be tricky to swing into a fanfic story.

***** If there is a cap on the amount of absorption, some sort of explosive output on overcharge could be used to explain his survival and Voldemort's "death", like since he was just 15 month old he couldn't absorb a whole AK and emmited the excess back to Voldy.

Every discharge would stop the ability for a set amount of time.

One restriction that I was thinking was something along the lines of not being able to be healed by magic or at least spells.

** You're going to need to come up with limitations to this because otherwise Harry is just straight up invulnerable to pretty much everything. The world is made of matter and energy, and e=mc^{2} means that, in a very real sense, there's not /that/ much difference between the two. Even if you limit yourself to the e side of the equation, you still have to consider the ramifications of Harry being able to ignore fire (thermal energy), lightning (electromagnetic energy), physical force of any kind (kinetic energy), and likely more that I'm just not thinking of.

** Frozen Elysium

When Hagrid reported back that the portkey he made to take him to Potter cottage dropped him about a kilometer out and that the whole town was frozen, Dumbledore was worried. He tried it think about that last time he had made a mistake making a portkey and nothing recent came to his mind. With a sigh he decide to make another one and head over himself to check what happened.

Entire 1 km radius around the Potter cottage was frozen. Frozen not just in the sense of ice but also magic. Nothing in his long life had prepared him for the devastation that lay in front of him. Any magic cast or forced into the ice immediately dissipated, no more correct would be absorbed. It was a disaster, "Frozen Elysium" as it was dubbed by those in the know. But no one knew what happened inside. Theories were there but there was no way of confirming it. One group decided to put the blame on Voldemort while another believed that it was some kind of sacrificial magic by the Potter.

It would be a long wait before they can find out what really happened.
