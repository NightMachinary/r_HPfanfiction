Its been A long time since I read a WBWL fic and I just can not find any more. Can you recommend me some fics. Would appreciate if they are complete or ongoing but not on Hiatus.

The pairing I am looking for are Harmony or Haphne. I don't like the cannon pairings or older pairings like H/Fleur or Tonks. No Slash too.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's life had been hell. He'd spent ten agonizing years slaving away for his only living relatives, only managing to escape through the surprising hospitality of a strange book store owner. On his eleventh birthday, he discovers things about himself he'd thought were only fantasies, but the greatest revelation was that he had a younger sister who'd somehow saved the world.Inspired by Sarcasm and Slytherin.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13706449/1/A-school-for-outsiders-Miratim]]

Description:  A nontypical wbwl story where harry goes to this school for mostly muggle-borns, werewolves and squibs. With some half-bloods. There is a bit of Dumbledore, James and Lily bashing. And Harry has a twin brother. Hermione will probably eventually go to this school as well. There is going to be a bit of a revolution and muggle technology and magic mix.

It's a recent fic, and has not finished yet. But good to look in to.

** There was a fic like this I remember reading. James cheated on Lily with a pureblood woman and Harry's half-blood brother was a few weeks older than him. There was a Lily/Sirius shiptease since Sirius was like a father figure to Harry. Hermione was friends with Harry's half-brother and Ron in Gryffindor and Harry was in Ravenclaw, but she pulls away from them and she and Harry eventually start dating.

Can't remember the title, sorry.

*** I remember this one. It was pretty cool, but doesn't Harry get potioned into being with Ginny and cheating on Hermione? Think the fic was abandoned.
