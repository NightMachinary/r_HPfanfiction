  Tired of human stupidity, Death decides to teach those who sought to be Masters of Death a lesson. Thinly veiled as a favor, Death offers Tom Riddle a second chance, the opportunity to be born again and live a new life. Some things are just too good to be true, and Tom soon learns there's a catch. There always is. Rated T for swearing.
