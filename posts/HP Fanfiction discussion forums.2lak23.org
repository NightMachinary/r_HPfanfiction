** DarkLordPotter.Net is without a doubt by far the most active HP forum on the net these days, not just for fanfic but for HP discussion in general.

Spacebattles has a moderately active HP thread.

As far as I know, those are the only remaining active HP fanfic forums, apart from this subreddit. By active I mean multiple posts a day.

Beyond the Veil is mostly dead but has a single active fic recommendation thread. No discussion, just fic links.

I haven't been to The Fanfiction Forum recently, but I imagine it still has some measure of activity. It was never HP-only though.

There may be other non-forum communities like livejournal and tumblr which probably still have HP fanfic activity, though nowhere near the level of the past.

They have two active threads, as far as I can tell: one for HP (and HP/X crossovers) updates and a slightly less active thread covering all non-HP fandoms. (Pretty much just Perspicacity posts Naruto and Star Wars updates in the latter.)

I think that site started when the old fanfiction.net forum closed up shop and the site went to shit. (Jeconais took a back seat to running it and handed over recruitment of new writers to Kinsfire, meaning only average-quality H/Hr shippers and sub-par smut peddlers would be eligible to apply.)

** harrypotterfanfiction.com has a very active forums community. Beware, however, that it's heavily, heavily moderated. Swearing is forbidden, and you're also not allowed to discuss stories from other archive sites.

*** That's moronic. What's the point of censorship like that?

**** The site has a fairly large number of younger members. (At least it did at one point. Sometimes I feel like the demographics have shifted quite a bit in recent years.) The idea of keeping the forums to a 12+ rating is to keep them friendly to all ages. As far as not being able to post about stories from other archive sites, that's mostly just a personal choice on the part of the site owner. His sandbox, his rules. I figure he's the one who gets dragged out of bed when the server pukes at 3:00 AM, so it's only fair.

** [[http://fictionkingdom.com]] has some nice articles although some are related to the author's work. However it tries to put out articles to start conversations and recommend other fanfiction.

** Hogwarts Extreme (hexrpg.com). There's one regular FanFiction forum, and one listed under clubs. They're both pretty slow, though, but occasionally a good discussion pops up. I don't really go on Fanfiction forums anymore =p
