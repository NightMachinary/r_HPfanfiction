** Like she doesn't like Ron and thinks Lavender is good enough for her friend? Or she does like him but accepts defeat? Or doesn't accept defeat but gives that impression publicly? Or none of the above and wants to do a threesome?

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

**** It looks like you responded to me and then deleted it I guess? Not sure why you are riled up but I was just answering the question that you asked. Hermione gets over her resentment of Lavender long before she and Harry get together.
