*** I've had a plot bunny like this for a while and wrote some snippets. I have no plans to continue, in particular because I feel that a redemption would be a cop-out, and the there most certainly shouldn't be a happy ending any more than there was one in /The Godfather III/.

--------------

--------------

Under normal circumstances, Hermione would have been in awe of where she was. She had known that Mum's big brother was very rich and important, but even what little she had seen of the mansion in the past few days had made her think of a king's court, complete with walls and gates and servants and armed guards. And the library---where she was presently sitting---could well have been an actual library.

But that didn't matter, because Mum and Dad were gone. Every time she closed her eyes, she could see the man shoot Dad, then Mum, then try to shoot her, and then /something/ happened, and then there were more people with guns and a long car ride, and then Uncle and Aunt's mansion.

She could see coming now, having a muted conversation, that she tuned out.

"Adriana wanted out. She wouldn't want her daughter in the business."

"I respected her wishes, and it got her killed."

"That doesn't mean Hermione has to be any more involved."

"She can decide on her role in the Family when she's older. For now, she's got to know we have her back."

"This'll traumatise her. She's only five, for crying out loud!"

"She's already traumatised. This'll bring closure. Look, I'll take care of this."

Aunt and Uncle sat down in the chairs opposite of her, getting her attention.

"Hermione... Aunt and Uncle have a question for you... We found the bad people who hurt you and killed Adri-Mum and Dad. What should we do with them?"

"Tell the police?" She saw her aunt smile. But her uncle continued.

"And what will happen then?"

"The police will take them to jail, of course. You know that, Uncle!"

"But that's not very fair, is it, Hermione? They tortured and killed your parents, not put them in jail."

"But if we torture them back, won't we be just as bad as them?"

"I don't think so. They hurt your Mum and Dad first, so they deserve it."

"But then they'll want to hurt us back..."

"They'll want to hurt us back even if we give them to the police. But if we hurt them enough, they'll be too afraid to hurt you, or Uncle, or Aunt ever again."

"That makes sense."

"Now, Aunt and Uncle have one more question: do you want to watch the bad people being punished?"

"Sure!"

--------------

"House of Minions, here I come," Hermione thought to herself as she sat down on the small chair. All that was left was to think the right thoughts at the right time.

/Think: herbology, make friends, community, acceptance, love people just the way they are. Visualise: sunny meadows, smiling faces, friends, birthday party, doing homework together, helping junior students. Think: herbology, make friends, community, acceptance, love people just the way they.../

The hat came down on her bushy-haired head.

"Nice try, young lady, but you are a thousand years too young to deceive me. You may want to look up 'Occlumency', by the way. It'll help you where you're going..."

"Wait!"

"Oh? You know where you fit as well as I do."

"You want to send me to Slytherin, don't you?"

"You don't agree?"

Hermione thought quickly. "Look, both you and I know where I come from. You also know I'm a Muggleborn. For me to go to Slytherin is the bravest thing I could possibly do!"

There was a long silence. Hermione wondered if the Sorting Hat couldn't handle contradictions, like a robot from an old sci-fi movie.

"Just put me in Ravenclaw and be done with it. You know I'm smart and studious enough," she offered.

"Very well. I don't only sort you based on what you want, however. I also sort you based on what you need. Maybe you'll pick up some courage and decency after seven years in GRYFFINDOR!"

--------------

"Honestly, Harry, if you want to rise through the ranks, you've got to understand that rules are there for a reason. People who violate rules and procedures end up in jail or killed---or, worse, tortured to death."

--------------

"Draco, Draco, haven't you ever heard that snitches get stitches?" She nodded to Ron, who delivered another kick to the tied-up Slytherin's stomach. "Was it worth the hundred and fifty House Points, Draco?"

Draco somehow found the strength to look up at her. "Granger, when my father... Ah!" He reeled as Hermione shot a carefully measured stinging hex at his eye.

"Still planning to tattle, Draco? Sounds like someone didn't learn his lesson." She crouched next to him to grasp his chin with her free hand. "Did you know that with the dose of the Forgetfulness Potion that you have in you right now, you won't remember our faces or this conversation, but you'll remember the pain and the fear? Oh yes, you will... Magic really is amazing, isn't it, Draco? Sometimes, I wonder if it's wasted on Purebloods."

Draco whimpered.

--------------

"Um... Hermione..." Ron was visibly nervous, shuffling. Asking to speak with her alone suddenly felt like a very bad idea.

"Yes?" Hermione raised an eyebrow.

"I don't want to... But... I mean..."

Hermione nodded and gestured for him to keep going, looking increasingly impatient.

"Dracowouldntknowwhatastitchis."

"Ronald, please enunciate. And don't slouch."

Ron composed himself.

"Draco wouldn't know what a 'stitch' is. The kind for wounds. His parents would just use Episkey." He paused.

"Is that all?"

"Um... Also, wizards say 'sneak', not 'snitch'. 'Snitch' is for Quiddich."

Hermione looked him up and down, then surprised him by drawing him into a hug.

"Ron, did you think that I would hurt you for correcting me?"

"Um..."

"You did, didn't you? Do you really think me a monster?"

Ron shook his head quickly.

"You do..." Hermione let him go. "Look, Ron, I only hurt people who deserve it, when they deserve it. Malfoy deserved it, right?"

Ron nodded.

"Now, Ronald, you brought me useful information that will prevent me from making a mistake in the future. Better yet, you waited until we were alone, so you didn't correct or contradict me in front of others. You did precisely the right thing.

"In any case, I think Malfoy got the message. Under the circumstances, the best we could hope for is for Malfoy to develop a subconscious association between me, crossing me, and pain and terror. The specific wording was therefore not very important."
