Which name do you guys like better? She's going to be a muggle born I know that for sure.

Julie Albright (this character fits in any era, since Julie is such a common name)

Abigail Albright (I love the alliteration of the name, though her name fits the best in maybe Charlie's era or Harry's era)

I haven't decided what era she'll be in. Any suggestions?


** I like Abigail, personally.

** Abigail Albright. The Wizarding World has a thing for alliteration. Minerva McGonagall, Severus Snape, Peter Pettigrew, Daedalus Diggle, William Weasley, Colin Creevey (Muggle-borns are not excluded from this), etc.

** I went with Abigail for her first name. I think Helen will be her middle name.
