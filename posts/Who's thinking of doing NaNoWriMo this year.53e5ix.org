And are you writing a HP fic or a story about something else?

I'm ~thinking~ about doing it since I'm not in school this semester but I have no ideas so far.


** I always want to, hope to, /yearn/ to, but regular NaNoWriMo falls during peak period at work and I have zero chance of being able to write the requisite number of words. I did Camp NaNo both times this year though, which was overwhelmingly positive.

** I was actually just thinking about this! I have a cool idea for an HP fic, and also an original work which is only half finished that I could do, but I've got a pretty heavy course load this semester. I actually did NaNoWriMo last year, which was a pretty heavy semester, and got really close to finish, so I might. But also the HP fic I've been thinking of I might want to start sooner rather than later.
