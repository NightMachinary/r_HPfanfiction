Okay so after like lots of months of everyone here saying how great it is in lots of threads I did try to read it after seeing it in another recommendation thread today! I mean the story idea that I know about it sounds interesting! About Voldemort winning and Harry rising up as like a true rebel leader in the middle of his reign! Like classic fantasy stories! :)

Except I couldn't finish the first chapter! :( It is like written in english but then not english, there are lots of words in another language! :( Stuff like danke and saurkraut and stuff! Also lots of people's names are different and from the other language I think, like Harry is Henreich now or something. :( Also I did not really understand WHY this was, but do they totally explain all the AU history stuff later? Also when does Harry start doing rebel stuff? And also does the other language stuff go away later or is it always in the story? :( Because I can't read it, I don't understand it. :( It is all very confusing and strange. :(


** Its meant to be a hook. Spoiler, but Harry was raised in Germany because his parents fled from Britain as Voldemort was taking power. The point is to draw you in and say "you haven't read this story yet."

** Takes awhile for the story to do anything interesting at all. I've been rereading it and there's just something offputting about the whole thing. Just really hard to get over the fact that the author calls an 11 year old a blond bombshell.

*** This fic may be the most slash heterosexual!Harry story I've ever read. Hell, maybe out of anything I've read written in the last sixty years.

** It's supposed to be confusing to the reader and slowly over the next few chapters you get a better idea of what is going on.

** it takes a long time for the rebelling to start, if I remember correctly. it is more of a Voldemort mentors Harry story that doesn't make Harry go dark.

****** Its not spread through the whole story, just the beginning (i think). You could type it into google translate.

** I understand where you're coming from. I found the writing in this fic rather offputting: there was no art to it. It was entertaining for awhile but I felt it turned into a kinda-oppressed-Pagan-teen angst-fest with gods and monsters after awhile. I guess it's worth a read if you are patient with it, but if you can't get past the first chapter and it's really frustrating you just stop. It doesn't become any more familiar as you go on.

The author translates all the foreign-bits at the end of the later chapters though, so no worries there. (Fairly certain the author even admits they don't speak German and used Google translate as they wrote.)
