Specifically im looking for fics where harry either trains and learns a lot of interresting magic, and uses it (superpowered harry is ok) or he just realises hes being an idiot by only coasting by, and takes his studying serious. Focus on learning the spells is preferred. (Show not tell, as in not "Harry read a lot of books in the library, and used an abandoned classromm to train in, several weeks later he finally felt powerful enough" i want to know what he learns! I dont want to be just told he's powerful, i want to experience him becoming powerful)


** The only fic i can think that has all that done in a way that seems plausible is linkffn(A Cadmean Victory).

Harry in canon wasn't that big of a slacker you know. He didn't really bother too much with theory and essays but he had practical combat magic down pretty well. Better than anyone else his age and he could go against most adults.

*** Right, he was two years behind . Look at the difference in the magic of GoF and the last book. Two crucial years behind and he did pretty well.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** How do you feel about fem!Harry? My story has Iris Potter take it seriously. It's only 40k words in though... and the first task hasn't even happened yet, but it will go the route you described in case you're fine with following incomplete stories. I've got over 45k+ words done and the story hasn't even been out for a month so I update fairly quickly.

She's pretty on edge about the tournament too, and things like the Dark Mark showing, the disappearance of Bertha Jorkins, etc. In response to this, she ignores her Divinations class and starts using that time to study Ancient Runes (a subject I'm completely changing from canon, so that could be the interesting magic you're looking for) and Arithmancy. But yeah, she's done fucking around when it comes to actually learning. Ancient Runes, defensive and offensive magic, animagus stuff.

  Iris Potter, the Girl-Who-Lived, gets thrown into the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Seeing the signs of a storm on the horizon, she sets herself on a new path. Featuring the beginning to a morally grey and powerful fem!Harry, a new take on Ancient Runes, animagus transformations, five mostly unique tasks, and a good amount of humor. No bashing. First of a multi-part series.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt][House of Potter Rebuilt]] he heads it off at the pass and prevents himself from being entered. Similarly in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133028/1/The-Birth-of-Evil][Birth of Evil]] he prevents himself from being picked. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11642540/1/The-Lawyers-Against-the-Cup][The Lawyers against the Cup]] Harry flees Hogwarts and hires a lawyer. Easily my favorite of any fic featuring wizarding law. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power][Knowledge is Useful but Power is Power]] has a really nice expansion on the whole magical contract stuff. Not the biggest fan of where it went but it was still a fun read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10707993/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unforgivable-Tournament][Unforgivable Tournament]] is my favorite Triwizard fic because it has a Harry who takes the whole thing /very/ seriously and people react rather poorly to it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11118965/1/Always-Read-the-Fine-Print][Always Read the Fine Print]] has Harry deciding to get */way/* more powerful.

*** Weres Harry also has him prevent himself from being entered, but Dumbledore makes him get involved as a host. (And you don't really need to work on self-improvement when you can wrestle a basilisk and have her venom in your claws as a potent neuro-toxin. Not to mention a very potent glare that promises death for whoever provoked it.)

*** You do have a fair point; to quote Goblet of Fire:

#+begin_quote
  Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school. Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione's that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx.
#+end_quote

And a paragraph before that:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment.
#+end_quote

The only time Harry really dilly-dallies around is when trying (or rather, not-trying) to solve the clue for the second task that's in his egg. After he's done that (and learns it has something to do with water), he dives straight back into the library again.

*** Not really. Quite a few fics just have a few 'establishing' scenes that showcase Harry and potentially others struggling with learning something. And cue a chapter or ten later he has it down pat. There's not much to do with the act of learning the spell. Especially because we as readers are rarely told what that spell even is.

Now this makes me wonder. Didn't Harry and his classmates start to learn the Accio charm two weeks or so before the first test. And he and Hermione started practicing it a lot in that time. Seems kind of odd to me. Would suggest a 3-5 week cycle of studying a spell before moving onto the next one. Though I suppose if we are to compare it to real life middle and high school it's not that incomparable to the time spent with each chapter before moving onto the next one.
