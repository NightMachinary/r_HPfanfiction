It's been awhile so I wanted to see if there were any new or unheard of ficus with Harry going to another school or being homeschooled or tutored but preferably another school?


** Linkffn(An Aunt's Love) has Petunia pulling Harry out of Hogwarts (and her head out of her arse). He ends up at a Muggle school, but keeps up with magic studies plus tutoring in combat and mental strength. Hermione, Draco, Snape and Lupin are still major players in this one but we also see Harry interacting with new teachers and Muggle students. Oh and Voldemort is weird AF and has a fondness for fireplaces.

  Harry comes home from school and Petunia is upset at the change in her nephew. Petunia decides to do what she should have been doing all along. Dumbledore had better stay away. Petunia Dursley is upset. Warnings on profile.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF
