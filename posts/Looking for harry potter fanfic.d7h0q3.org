The only things that I remember about this fanfiction are that there were power levels, his parents are alive he has a brother and that harry potter can absorb powers, ability, skill, and memories and harry goal was to become a literal god. Harry went to magical Greece where he found out that the magical community in Greece are strict about dark wizard because most wizard from Greece can trace their lineage to the greek/roman gods and there even is a wizarding school that only allows those who are related to the gods like Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Harry absorb the powers of these demigods children and then later at the end of the story Harry defeat the gods and become one himself so if anyone can give me the link to this fanfiction that I love so much that will mean a lot to me thank you I had tread finding it myself but I can not find it anywhere.
