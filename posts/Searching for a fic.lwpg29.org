:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read the summary of a fic but didn't actually read it as I was already in middle of another one, but now I've finished that fic but I can't find it...

The summary went something like - /Harry had found a way(/a spell?) /to defeat Voldemort for good. Unfortunately, there are side affects./

Ya, I think Harry goes to the past to the marauders era. If someone can recall that fic, please tell me


** Ffnet id; 1097925 AU During his fourth year, Harry begins to feel that something is Not Right. He studies incessantly and when Voldemort is resurrected, he knows of a spell that can get rid of the monster forever . . . unfortunately, there are side-effects . . .

** Wow, that was an incredible story. I'm so glad you lost it, because it gave me the opportunity to follow the link as well.
