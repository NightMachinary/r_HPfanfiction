I've been looking everywhere for a fic I read a few years ago. I remember it was harry and draco, it starts off as a friendship where they sneak off to drink cognac? In hogsmeade, Ron and hermione are concerned they think he has a drinking problem. There isn't much sex until the very end, and if that I remember the writer censored it and posted the uncensored on her site.

There's a sequel that was in progress last I checked. Harry made a group where all students from different houses get together and there were beads from answering questions. Ron doesn't support it. Ron and hermione are in a relationship but it's not happy.

Edit: It's Snakes and Lions by Gatewaygirl!

Hermione managed to see from the eyes of a ferret and lupin was upset?

If any of this rings any bells please comment!
