** linkffn(Beyond the Curtain; Harry Potter and the Homecoming; Echoes in the Fog; Hogwarts Battle School; Worthy of Magic; Stages of Hope; Gryffindor Girl; Realignment)

HP and the Homecoming is a REALLY dark and evil Harry, though it takes a while into this slippery evil slope, but its so well done that I had to recomend, its part of a 6-part series plus a side-story. It's also the setting for Echoes in the Fog, so you have to read it and read the other fic called For Lack of a Bezoar to get it, but trust me, its worth it.

Worthy of Magic is also a quite quite dark fic, with a psychopath Harry in love with the Void (what he calls his magic) and there is THE single biggest twist halfway through the fic that I found mesmerizing and so so uniquely done. Dark and Evil Harry though, so be warned.

Beyond the Curtain is simply fantastic, with tones from Walking Dead (no zombies, but the dystopian scenario is really really similar) and a completely different outcome of the war. Neville is the narrator, but Harry is the protagonist, with several layers of depth to their characters. Its fantastical in the sense that it feels like you're reading Harry Potter for the first time again, or at least that's what I felt while reading it.

Hogwarts BS is pretty much self-explanatory, if you've seen/read Ender's Game, but without any aliens. A great Harry, a really unique Hermione and the most lovable Tracey in the fanon. You just can't not love her.

Though I suggested Stages of Hope, its such a recommended and well known fic that you've probably read it already, but if not, its a wonderful dimenstion travel, where Snape wears Burgundy, James is a douche, Lily is married to Lupin and Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna are completely insane (Nev not so much, but the other 3 are quite a bit) war-weary teens from a dimension that everything went to shit, but they kept fighinting.

Realignment was recommended a lot last year, but since it got completed, I haven't seen that happen much. There's an explanation somewhere in this reddit, where it involves Terminator lingo and knowledge that I just don't know what it was, but it made sense when I read. Its basically a pissed of, OP Harry from the Future "sent" to kill young Tom Riddle, with Dumbledore Protecting him during Grindewald's rise to power. Its fantastical in the same way as Beyond the Curtain, where it feels like a new thing, at least it was for me.

Lastly, but not least, is one of the best femHarry fic I've read, simply because I love Mary's personality. I don't know exactly what to say, except that it doesn't follow canon to the letter, as you can clearly see during the first few chapters, so there's a lot of change in it, but it still somewhat similar.

** linkffn(9517967) is a good one. Also from the same author are linkffn(12149140) and linkffn(11689576). All three are rather lighthearted and funny.

  A baby is left on a doorstep, only this time Petunia Dursley isn't the one who takes it in. Charles 'Hawk-Eye' Potter, retired Sniper of her Majesty's Army is surprised when his adopted grandson turns out to be his own flesh and blood. Now Jamie has to deal with learning magic on top of his regular studies. It's going to be a bumpy ride if he wants to be a pilot in the RAF!

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!

  Hagrid wins a dragon egg...only what is inside is no dragon. Harry is the first to make eye contact with the creature inside...and ends up with a most unusual familiar. Watch out Hogwarts...things are about to get prehistoric!
