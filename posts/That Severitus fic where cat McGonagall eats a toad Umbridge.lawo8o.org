:END:
Read it a while back and thought it was hilarious, would love to read it again. Basically shit hits the fan regarding Umbridge's blood quill and Snape trirs to kill her but McGonagall "escorts" Umbridge to Dumbledore instead, some transfigurations and animagus ensue and a certain cat barfs up some toad.

One of my favorites!

  ... Snape leaned over to McGonagall. “How did that idiot get away? I thought you had her under control?”

  McGonagall shrugged. “She was a slippery little thing.”

  Snape gave her a sharp look. The deputy headmistress was alarmingly blasé about having let Umbridge slip through her fingers. He would have expected her to be livid at the Pink Toad's escape from justice.

  Abruptly Minerva let out a loud belch. “Oh my, excuse me!” she exclaimed, patting her chest. Then she locked eyes with Severus who was just lifting his teacup to his lips. “It must have been something I ate,” she said, very deliberately.

  Snape promptly spit his mouthful of tea all over Fawkes, who screeched in protest and huffily vanished in a burst of flame.

  Snape stared at Minerva, who gazed placidly back. Surely she hadn't meant...!

  His mind worked busily, considering Minerva's absolute devotion to her students, her well-hidden Slytherin tendencies, and her uncharacteristic lack of concern over Umbridge's potential for future harm.

  Snape gulped as he realized that one seriously enraged Transfiguration expert who is also a cat animagus plus one minimally powerful toadlike witch who has done the enraging equaled... one partially digested threat to Hogwarts's children.

  “I---er---have a potion for indigestion,” he offered, trying not to sound as terrified as he felt. Suddenly Albus was no longer the scariest person in the room.

  “That would be very kind,” she said, giving him an approving smile.

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!
