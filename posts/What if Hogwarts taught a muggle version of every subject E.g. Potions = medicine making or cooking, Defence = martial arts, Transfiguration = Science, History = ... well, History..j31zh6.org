The new curriculum can help with them during life, like how Wizards don't get taught spelling, reading or mathematics after they turn 11.


** Um... magic can make food for you and potion-making /is/ medicine making, martial arts are completely useless, and the students already learn the basics of science they need to be able to understand Transfiguration. This would simply make the timetables uselessly overfilled and would only slow the classes' progress. Also, as someone already said, they don't have any Muggle students, so it's doubly useless.
