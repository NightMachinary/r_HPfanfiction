How much do you think it would have cost to repair the damage done by the trio to Gringotts? Taking into consideration that they can't use the repero charm to fix most of it and do not have to pay labour cost. Like what would it cost assuming the goblins did the work themselves.

Let's say

-Fire damage and claw marks where the dragon was kept

-repair of the broken tracks and a new cart

-ventilation in the lobby

-expensive crystal chandelier

-7 expensive wood desk

-fire damage to the lobby

-repairing the glass dome roof

-general roof repairs where the dragon took off anything else make it up


** Dear Mr Potter,

remember when you and your shitty friends rode a blind dragon through our only source of income? Now that you've got that fancy uber-wand, mind helping us out with a super-powered reparo? Or should we just pull your intestines out your anus?

Lots of love,

The goblins you didn't kill

** Well, there are wizards who work for Gringotts. Maybe they have a maintenance wizard with a really good /Reparo/ plus a litany of other solutions for curse damage?

*** Well, I figured they would have enchantments on their stuff so it doesn't break so easily and last longer. Thus probably also harder to fix, and if it was easy to fix why would they pass a perfectly good chance to extort some money. Also there the damage Voldemort did on his rampage soon after, a little detail like who was actually responsible is insignificant :P.

** Reparo with elder wand probably can fix most damage caused by war... but it would attract unwanted attention..
