So, I've read a few stories where the Muggles, usually those aware of magic, fight against the Magical World. Most of the time, its after or during the war with the Dork Lord and its muggles fed up with the magic-on-muggle violence and/or sexual assault.

I have never though, read a story where Magic is just... discovered at random. Just some random guy or girl stumbling upon the magical world and spreading the word somehow without sounding crazy, a random ward failure that causes a magical site/enclave to be discovered, or an instance where a Wizard had to defend muggles from something magical and there was no way to hide it after. Nothing like that at all!

I've seen magical integration on magical terms, usually instigated by Hermione or Harry depending on the story. But I've never come across a story about just randomly being discovered and dealing with that. I mean, sure, the magical world or at least the British magical world is stuck in the times but you would think there would be some kind of protocol instated by the ICW just in case there was a massive uncoverable breach after what happened in New York for reintegrating into the world at large.


** I've tried to come up with a story with this premise but so far haven't had any luck. I agree though, it's an awesome angle and I'm shocked I haven't seen it in my travels so far

*** I think it's the scope of things, its a world encompassing event and unless you're really good at world building (And I mean REALLY good, doing research and everything), you can only do so much with what you actually know and it kinda just falls flat.

**** yes, exactly. And I feel weird enough trying to get the British stuff right with the characters we know and the stuff Rowling gave us, but trying to write a British muggle finding out about a secret British magical society is really difficult

Possible, but I haven't hit the right notes yet

** There's one where magic is caught in the background of a commercial aired during the superbowl, I'm trying to find it now. It was on ao3, I think
