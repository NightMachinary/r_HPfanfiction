I want to start a debate why so many fanfictions with Harry aware of his inheritence (Lordships), he is almost always paired with Daphne Greengrass ? Why the Greengrass family would be so lucky ? Why he isn't paired wiith somoene else like Blaise Zabini (Neutral) or Susan Bones (Neutral) ? Why not even with children of death eathers like Nott or Malfoy ?


** I did it because I felt I could do a lot with her. She really is this Slytherin blank slate you can do a lot with. I always thought that was interesting.

It's not really much different from Fleur, Veela aside. Or Susan or some other character/non-character.

Though I've never touched the politics really. I can see why people use her for that.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** A lot of stories feature kids in politics, and basically all of those are silly (or worse) because it is done poorly. Old Pure-blood families end up being politically savvy (often with Occlumency because that's /totally/ a skill kids can pick up), so Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor has to get with one to learn to politic. Greengrass is just a blank canon character from a pure-blood family so it's an easy choice if you want to write this kind of story.

**** First of all Blaze is a boy's name. Second, we have no knowledge about the Greengrass family, so people can make them how they want them to be. Personally I agree about Susan should at the very least be as popular as Daphne, but for whatever reason she isn't.

****** While true, there's also the fact that Susan's parents are canonically alive until the sixth book. While the fanon view her as being a ward of Amelia. My headcanon workaround though is that the Mr. and Mrs. Bones mentioned in the sixth book was her uncle and his wife.

Also, we only fucking know that A) Amelia was a good duelist, enough so that Voldemort deemed it important enough that he himself should fight her(Or is that fanon, I forget sometimes), and B) That she's head of the DMLE. Nothing else is known about the Bones or Susan.

Lets be honest, most fanfiction authors can screw up characters that we have available to us with a full personality and development path. Which is why quite often the OC-yet canon named characters end up rather flat and stale.

******** We know absolutely nothing about Lily's character, and how much Ginny looks like her. Rowling stated that one of the reasons Ginny and Harry got closer was their shared experience of having Voldemort in their heads. Also, as referenced in HBP, he's rather attracted to her personality, liking that she's bold, and fiery. He also feels comfortable enough to confide in her, especially regarding things that he doesn't confide in Ron and Hermione. In OotP, it's Ginny that Harry talks to about his desire to speak with serious.

Now, regarding this nonsense about Harry and Malfoy, that's a shallow and biased interpretation of the text. Not for one second in the books has Harry done anything other than despise Malfoy. His first impression of Malfoy compared him to Dudley. Not to mention, in HBP, Malfoy had been directly responsible for hurting 2 friends(Ron and Katie Bell).

So why was Harry still "obsessed" over Malfoy? Here's why. During both OotP and HBP, a common theme is Harry's frustration at his inability to join the order, and actively work against Voldemort. Malfoy, however, is a target in his reach, and someone he suspects is working for Voldemort, and focuses his efforts on stopping Malfoy, mostly because that's all he can do now.

********* - Contrary we have a very large description of her physical appearance and personality : Lily was a beautiful woman. She had thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders and bright green almond-shaped eyes. (HPDH) Lily was known for being a vivacious, talented, and popular student. (HPHBP) Lily was also a woman of sound moral principles, and would stand by them no matter what it cost her: though her actions were ineffective. On at least one occasion she called out James Potter and Sirius Black for their bullying of her friend, Severus Snape. When she realised --- through an insult that Snape gave her in a moment of angry humiliation --- Snape's devotion to Voldemort's genocidal cause (of which she was a target of at the time) as well as his increasingly deep fascination with the Dark Arts, caused her to refuse his apology for the insult, and ended her friendship with him permanently. Lily and her daughter-in-law Ginny also are very very similar to each other. They both have red hair, they both married a Potter: Lily married James; Ginny married Harry, they both were popular in school, both weren't afraid to stand up for their friends: Lily when the Marauders harassed Severus Snape, and Ginny when people ridiculed Luna Lovegood by calling her Loony Lovegood.

****** Now it's been a while since I've read the book or watched the movie. But I'm rather sure that was the result of a really awkward first kiss than anything else.

As for obsessing over Draco, the dude was trying to kill Dumbledore, and damn the innocents that died in the attempt. With nobody caring or even believing him he did what he thought was necessary to protect Hogwarts.

And then to the love-hate thing. Well I've got good news for you, all Extremists are just secretly lovers of what they actually fight against. The Environmentalists are secretly the biggest industrialist supporters. And the Islamist's are secretly the biggest democracy and equality supporters. You see how faulty that logic is?

- Takes every opportunity to antagonize Harry
- His dad tried to kill Harry, and every other muggleborn in Hogwarts
- Treated their slave, Dobby, like shit

Not because he wants to suck his thick, pureblooded cock.

***** Yes It remind me a little of Harry/ Ginevra alias James/Lily . Harry with Giny it just a case of oedipus complex that I think Dumbledore wanted It Just sad that Harry is stuck in the past, he should have had to choose a side not because Voldemort killed his parents because it was war (and really they should have fled Britain or to Potter Manor with the ancient wards) but he should have done a informed choosing of beliefs.

** If nothing else, it's a really pretty name.

But other than that:

- Unless it was written before book 6, Zabini, Nott, and Malfoy are all guys, and slash pairings (particularly Malfoy) are not all that appealing to everyone.
- Susan Bones fics deal more naturally with Ministry work (since, after all, Amelia Bones) rather than Wizengamot work, I feel. Though as I recall there's a few that do the whole Lord thing as well.
- Susan Bones is also canonically a redhead (though I can't remember if that was from the books or just because of the actress who played her in the movies), and not everyone's into that. I know some people get really weirded out about Ginny being a redhead.
- Personality-wise, the name Susan Bones as a redhead evokes a very different feeling to Daphne Greengrass. It's stereotypical, obviously, but you think of redheads as having "fiery tempers" and things like that, regardless of whether or not they do. A lot of HP/DG fics have things like backhanded compliments, maintaining poise in the face of political adversity, etc., etc. It feels out of place for a redhead named Susan Bones to do that.
- If you do Harry/Daphne, you can keep canon characters at least somewhat close to normal. Harry with Malfoy would require him to act /very/ different from in the books, for example. Daphne is a blank slate.
- Susan is a Hufflepuff, and Daphne is a Slytherin.

But really, those pairings you mention do sometimes have the whole Lordship/inheritance thing. Not always, though, because they have other parts to them they can rely on instead.

Zabini is a guy, And the "Lord" fics don't include slash that often. There are plenty of fics with Susan Bones/Harry as the ship, which often ends to her being a ginny clone since she's a redhead.
