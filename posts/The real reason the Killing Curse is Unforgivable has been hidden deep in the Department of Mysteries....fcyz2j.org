In a room with no windows or doors, no light and no sound, a creature has lain dormant for centuries, immortal and terrible. But every life taken with the Killing Curse crack the chains just a little bit more...

And it's about to wake.


** There is a fanfic that works like this , but it's with all dark magic. I think its Harry Potter and the Elemental Power or something along those lines. It has an au Slytherin elemental Harry with an OC gryffindor girl who is also elemental. Voldemort is a lot more powerful and all dark magic used supposedly wakes up a dark deity or something like that

**** Harry was Slytherin, there was even a point where they jumped realities into Canon-verse and Mary (the OC) got along with everyone and no one except canon!Harry even tried to get along with the other (younger) Harry cuz he was a Slytherin. Oh yeah, they also steal the Mona Lisa to open up Potter Manor

** Reminds me of The Nightmare Lord series. I think he's supposedly in the room that Dumbledore claims the Unspeakables are studying love inside.
