I've always been curious about how would the school change during that year, and how the characters there would react. I'm finding it imposible to find a fic who focuses more on the Hogwarts students lives during the year Snape was headmaster and there were DE wandering through the hallways.

** linkffn(a call to arms by mydearprofessormcgonagall) is really really good. It follows many students' viewpoints during 7th year, most notably Ginny and McGonagall.
