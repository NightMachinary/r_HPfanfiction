I've read so much fanfiction that I'm starting to forget what Hermione is truly like.

I know that authors use her as a self insert, so hey, her personality can range. However majority of fics make it seem like all she cares about are reading books, never being wrong and being a know-it-all with bushy hair.

I'm curious what your take on Hermione from Canon is? I've given some prompts:

What are Hermione Granger's...

- likes/dislikes
- insecurities
- strengths and weaknesses
- things she values
- fears: I know about failing classes but surely there is more.

Other questions...

- do other people like Hermione? Why or why not?
- why does she like Ron?
- is she vain?

Anything else you can offer up would be readily read and appreciated.


** In my opinion, the whole character of Hermione is based of her desire of acceptance, and the difficulties she had to get it.

From the start, I think Hermione is an intelligent/ talented girl, who probably had excellent grade in class. But in canon, her character has a lot of difficulties to socialize with other people (I always found it funny how she would give relationship advice to people while probably being the worst at it).

Her best strenght is probably her intelligence, but you could probably ass an excellent work ethic (she is hard working), and some other qualities such as her courage (she proved several times that she belonged in Gryffindor).\\
As for her weakness, I would put her lack of social skill. She seem to have a lot of difficulties to interract with people, and to be just incapable to do some small talks (most of the time she end up talking about class or some obscure knowledge). Her interraction with Lavender in PoA (when her rabbit died) is the clearest proof of this weakness in my opinion.

I believe both her fears and insecurities are linked to her desire of acceptance. Once she found acceptance, she is afraid to loose it. For example, I do not think her worst fear is really to fail class as having a 0, but rather that in her mind, she is afraid to not be good enough to be a witch, to not be accepted as such, and failling her class would be the proof of it.\\
In fact, I think that a good part of her work ethic is due to her linking academic success with social acceptance (probably because of the reaction of her parents and/ or teachers), and she probably thought that if she was good enough in class, other kids would accept her too, even if because of it, she was seen as an overachiever and a teacher pet by the children who didn't like her.

And finally for the things she values, it would be her social acceptance (her friendship with Harry and Ron), plus knowledge in general (with a preference for /Magic/), and some human qualities like courage of friendship (what she say to Harry in PS).

​

To answer your other questions :

#+begin_quote
  /do other people like Hermione? Why or why not?/
#+end_quote

At first, no. Considering how she acted on the train, I doubt she ever had any friends before Hogwarts, and even there, she didn't have any before Halloween (Ron remark about how she didn't have any friends hurt her because it was true).\\
But she does grow up during the story, and at the end, she seems to have made some other friendships outside the Trio (like Ginny), and was at least friendly with other students like the ones in the DA.

​

#+begin_quote
  why does she like Ron?
#+end_quote

Does she need a reason to like him? If you really need some, as I said I think Hermione valued humans quality like courage before things like academic success. Ron may not be the most hard working student, but I'm pretty sure he perfectly fit her category of "Great Wizards".

​

#+begin_quote
  is she vain?
#+end_quote

Absolutely not. In fact, with the exception of Lockart (where I really think she built a mental image of the man based on his books, and could not admit he was not like it afterward, as well as his status of respected professor), I do not think she ever showed any sign to be like it. Unlike a lot of girls, she didn't care about Viktor Krum at first, and even later she was more with Viktor Krum, the quiet and polite guy, that Viktor Krum International Quidditch Player.\\
She also never seemed materialistic, with the exception of books (where I think she cares more about the knowledge they contain that the books themselves), I don't remember her showing true interest in any item.

** - Hermione likes reading and research. She likes freshly mown grass and fresh parchment and spearmint toothpaste. And Ron.

But with the freshly mown grass, we can infer she likes order. She likes a job being done and being able to appreciate what comes with the job being done.

Spearmint? Presumably, it's the kind her mother and father, the dentists, use. Make of that what you will.

- Insecurities

She's not very pretty. She has big teeth. She has trouble making friends.

- Hermione does not like...well, anything that goes against what she thinks, if we must be honest.

Although she enjoys watching games, she looks down on Quidditch culture. She dislikes the competition that sprouts up between the Houses (though given her bazillion House points, she can't exactly call herself sinless in that regard).

Of course, given that Hermione sucks at flying and never tries to get better, there may be an element of being just being bitter about her dislike of Quidditch.

- Hermione's strength is, to paraphrase my father, having a mind like a steel trap. She reads and reads and reads and more importantly she /remembers./ Though her memorization is far from perfect--she couldn't remember what the Legend of the Chamber of Secrets was, despite it being in /Hogwarts, A History./

She's also quick-witted. Despite a tendency to miss the obvious /magical/ solution, Hermione can also figure out how to solve problems quickly. She immediately realizes Snape is doing /something/ to Harry and sets out to stop him--notably without hurting Snape.

Hermione has a strong sense of right and wrong. She is /outraged/ over the way wizards treat other sapient beings and despite her tendency to be a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie][Soapbox Sadie]], the fact of the matter is, she's /right./

She's also a fast learner--she is able to do many spells in class and the DA lessons that others struggle with, the Patronus Charm being an exception.

- Her weaknesses?

She's as stubborn as a mule, and often very self-righteous. Even her good intentions can fall flat, due to her zeal. She can be prone to panicking. And while being a Muggleborn means zilch in terms of impeding her skill, it does make her culturally unaware of things Ron takes for granted: She didn't know what the word "mudblood" meant, just that it was clearly very rude.

Hermione also doesn't particularly like aggressive confrontation--she trembles whenever Harry snaps at her. She likes to /argue/ but she doesn't like to /fight./

Hermione has a temper, with an occasional violent streak. She sent her conjured birds on Ron with a look of vindictive fury. When studying for O.W.L.s with Harry, she lost her temper and hit him in the nose with her textbook, hard enough to make his eyes water (though given the size of the books, this may not have been terribly hard).

For all her complaints of the Ministry interfering at Hogwarts, Hermione doesn't tolerate /any/ dissent from what she thinks is right, until proven otherwise. She dismisses the abilities of Fred and George as flashy tricks, not proper magic--until she sees the Day-dreaming Charms at their joke shop, which are apparently quite impressive.

See also, the way Hermione treats Luna. Whatever you feel about Luna, Hermione starts every single argument they have by rudely shooting Luna down--and that was after giving a half-arsed apology the first time Luna stood up for /The Quibbler./

It takes Luna participating in the Battle of Department of Mysteries before Hermione comes to a point that would be /agree to disagree./

It takes until Hermione learns Luna was with Ginny and Neville trying to steal the Sword of Gryffindor before she actually /defends/ her from Phineas Nigellus's insults.

- What does Hermione value?

She values friendship and bravery--citing them as virtues far above books and cleverness. Effectively, she calls herself "good" but she calls Harry "great" (Interestingly, it's an inverse of Ollivander, who was quick to condemn Voldemort's actions as "terrible" but still "great"). Make of that what you will.

Hermione values the pursuit of knowledge--she reads far ahead in the textbook. /Goblet of Fire/ has her study the Summoning Charm on the ride to Hogwarts, something Harry struggles with when they study it in class */In November./*

- What does Hermione fear?

Failure is one thing, but consider what that means--Hermione prides herself on being the best.

She fears Voldemort and what hatred and bigotry mean.

On a more mundane level, Hermione's probably afraid of heights, given that she "lacks confidence on a broomstick" right before the Battle of the Seven Potters.

*** This is the best answer. I would only add because it is something I notice in fanon-that Hermione is kind, selfless and emotional, whilst I think fanon tends to potray her as overly cold and clinical and frankly that's why I hate fanon Hermione.

Because canon Hermione is if anything overly emotional she cries a lot (and that's really a major reason why Harry prefers Ginny), she tries to comfort others and she is always willing to lend her assistance (see her constantly helping Neville or still making time for Hagrid even on top of her homework).

Hermione is ultimately a Gryffindor, and it frustrates me that fanfiction likes to potray her as this cold, calculating and cunning person when really she's anything but. She's strongly empathetic and is so black and white in morality that she objects to Harry fighting a man with the face of a baby.

#+end_quote

It's especially noteworthy in that Hermione is willing to help others who /cannot/ fix it themselves.

If someone is dealing with an emotional problem that is distant--Lavendar's despair over her rabbit--Hermione is rather dreadful at making people feel better.

And if someone's problem is brought on by their own hand--read, Ron's poor study habits or more seriously Harry's situation after nearly killing Malfoy, she's far less sympathetic.

I had forgotten that bit about the baby-faced Death Eater though--that's a nice touch to her character. At times, Hermione shows too much mercy.

There's nothing finer for making a complex character than contradictions, and Hermione is great for that.

***** Just a question :

#+begin_quote
  Ron's poor study habits
#+end_quote

I know some fanon loves it, but where the hell did that come from? Hermione may consider that Ron (and Harry) have poor study habits, but she is a girl that start freaking out about exams something more than 3 months prior, EVERYONE has poor studiy habits in her opinion.

From what I remember from Canon, Ron's got the same OWL grade than Harry with the exception of Defense where Harry got a O (at least partly due to his corporal Patronus), meaning Ron's grade where something along the line of :

- Defense = E
- Transfiguration = E
- Charms = E
- Potions = E
- Herbology = E
- Care of Magical Creatures = E
- Astronomy = A
- Divination = P
- History of Magic = D

That make 7 OWL, with 6 E. These are not the grades of a bad students, or one that only barely passed classes by copying Hermione's. These grades also means that Ron's goal to join the Aurors was something achievable, and not a stupid whim that has been granted thanks to his status of War Hero.

****** Actually, we don't know that. In chapter 5 of HBP (“An Excess of Phlegm”) it says about Ron's results only:

#+begin_quote
  “Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who cares about them?” he said happily to Harry. “Here --- swap ---”

  Harry glanced down Ron's grades: There were no “Outstandings” there. ...

  [...]

  “Well done!” said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ron's hair. “Seven O.W.L.s, that's more than Fred and George got together!”
#+end_quote

So, we don't know he got same results as Harry, we know only that he got seven OWLs and no Oustandings. Still, these are rather good results and nothing to be ashamed of, and all bashing-Ron stories are made stupid by this, but not what you described. Is it from the film?

******* I just looked "Ron OWL's results" on google.

But we can deduce at least some of his grades if we really have to. We know that that the teacher choose to accept, or not a student into his NEWT level class, and that most of them ask at least a E during the OWL to do so (except Snape who is worse and ask a O for potion).\\
With this rule, we see McGonnagal refusing Neville because he only got an A in Transfiguration, and advicing him to go into Charms because he got an E. We also see that, even if he is not as strict as Snape, Slughorn ask for an E to continue Potion.

With this informations, we know that Ron, like Harry, got at least an E in 3 subjects : Transfiguration, Potions, and Charms. We can also suppose that this rule apply to at least the 2 other subjects necessary into the Auror program, Defense and Herbology (especially Defense considering Snape standards).

So Ron got at least at least 3 confirmed E during his OWL, and probably at least 5.

Finally, for his 6th supposed E, Hagrid though that the whole Trio was going to take Care of Magical Creature (and was heartbroken when they didn't). It means that the 3 of them got a passing grade, and while I could see Hagrid accepting student with just an A (or just anyone, just to show some "interesting creatures"), I would think that the school (and Dumbledore) would force him to put some standards, if only to ensure no students die during his class.

​

This is for this reason that I consider that Ron got 6 "E" during his OWL, with a mystery 7th one with just a passing grade (though I would say Astronomy because, as most students, Ron could not listen to Binn's class, and his power of bullshiting only worked with Trewalney for Divination, not the Ministry sent examiners).

Of course, as Hermione points out to him he wasn't expected to do it the night before. In fact, there's many moments of Harry and Ron procrastinating and only just managing to finish their work.

Having poor study habits doesn't mean you have bad results, as many a student will tell you.

** I think that Hermione is an intelligent, caring and loyal girl but who is either antisocial or has difficulties relating to others due to her intelligence, which lead to a love for books, an almost absolute trust and hero worship for authority figures and a bunch of insecurities.

She is also someone who is not afraid to do what is necessary, not matter how distasteful, when fighting for what she believe in or protecting the innocents and her loved ones.

I also think that she is someone who would rather judge someone on their accomplishments rather than what they appear to be, and she also tend to see the best in people until proved otherwise (innocent until proven guilty kind of deal), though IMO she has a rather naïve view of the world (still, not that weird considering she is a teenager...)

She is rather open-minded (except when it comes to Trelawney and House-elves ) and an over-achiever.

Anyway, that's my take on Hermione.

Is it true, though? Fanon seems to think that it is, but we're talking about a girl who set a teacher on fire two months in her school carreer.

I've seen people justify this opinion by bringing up Lohhart (who she simply had a crush on), her not writing anything of importance to Harry in the summer before the 5th year (nobody else did either), and the broom incident (she was wrong to do that behind Harry's back, but she did it because she was worried for his life, not because of her particular trust in the Hogwarts staff).

I think she has a normal level of trust in authority figures for a girl who had a healthy childhood, it just seems much higher compared to Harry who doesn't trust adults (and has good reasons not too).

Some people see that as hypocrisy -- I see that as a child still developing their worldview and trying their best in extremely difficult situations.

** Fanfiction Hermione is often such an underwhelming shadow of canon!Hermione, you're so right. I always found her one of the most fascinating characters in the series,

Despite the sheer amount of Ron the Death Eater and dark!Harry fics, I always thought if any of the Trio had the potential to go dark, it would be Hermione--- she has a streak of genuine ruthlessness to her, and more worryingly, enough self-righteousness to be confident that her actions are just and necessary, no matter who gets hurt. She can also be incredibly close-minded, bossy, and inflexible. That being said, she has a strong sense of justice, she's very intelligent, and she'll follow her friends to the end of the earth, which tempers these worse traits.

I think Hermione values intelligence, loyalty, and strength--- kind of like Ginny, she prefers when people are no-nonsense and sensible, and the end of SS shows that she admires bravery above all else. What she's afraid of... from PoA, I'd intuit that it's failing, and more than that, being incompetent and disappointing, unworthy of belonging in the Wizarding World.

Do other people like Hermione? I wouldn't call her especially popular--- she's the pariah of her year in SS, due to her smug attitude and lack of social skills--- but Ron and Harry seem to like her well enough and she's good friends with Ginny.

Why does she like Ron? Because he's one of her best friends, he challenges her, he's loyal and intelligent in his own way and brave. I'm not sure if they could make it to the epilogue without marriage counseling, but I can see where the attraction came from.

Is she vain? To a certain extent, yes--- she has Madam Pomfrey shrink her teeth in the fourth book, and dresses up very nicely for the Yule Ball, but she can't be bothered to keep up with the hair-straightening potion and I think that says a lot.

** Hermione is loyal and booksmart and she tries to be caring to her friends. Sometimes she even succeeds. And, for the most part, she knows right from wrong.

Now, to her flaws.

She's a hypocrite. Rules? They're for other people. It's okay for her to confund McLaggen. It's not okay for Harry to pour Felix Felicis in Ron's cup or to use non standard potions recipes.

She's as mean to Ron as he is to her. Emotional range of a teaspoon? Uncalled for. Nevermind that people often do crack under the strain of heavy emotions and feelings. She herself almost did so in her 3rd year. Speaking of which, it was pretty messed up for her to buy Crookshanks after it had almost eaten Scabbers. Yes, it was Pettigrew, but she didn't know that. The fandom often brings up Ron's reaction to Hermione/Krum. Hermione attacking him with birds? Not so much. And she was absolutely not trying to be helpful with the Levitation Charm.

Also shows how jealous she is. See her treatment of Fleur in HBP as well.

Closeminded? Yup, that too. See her interactions with Luna and her reactions to Divination and the Deathly Hallows.

SPEW? House elves needed to be treated better. Not asking what the wanted and thinking she knew best? High-handed. Not speaking to Harry about that firebolt? High-handed. And I don't think her parents would agree to having their memories modified and their practice sold.

She's afraid of being lonely. She's insecure about her looks, but not vain. The books are from Harry's POV, but it doesn't appear that she was well liked until HBP/DH. She made her 1st friends bc of a troll and, seeing as she was always alone in POA, she very well likely didn't make her 3rd until Krum.

  a) She buys a cat, knowing Ron has a pet rat. Then makes no effort to control said cat, even when it's attacking her friends rat. But conveniently, that rat is the guy who betrayed the Potters. Yay crookshanks

  b) She tattles to McGonagall about the Firebolt, without telling Harry her suspicions first. The brooms not cursed, but hey guess what? She was right all along and it was sent by Sirius Black.

  c) She faces no action for permanently disfiguring another student, who was just following the rules (remember Umbridge was Headmistress. She wasn't Voldemort)

  d) She pesters Harry continuously about the HBP potions book, refusing to actually sit and analyse the textbook with him. But as it turns out, she was right and the book belonged to the murderous traitor Snape.

  e) She is jealous of Ron, and attacks him with conjured birds when he's with another girl, even though they have no prior commitment or relationship. She faces no consequences for this, because oh Lav-Lav is someone Ron gets tired of and breaks up with. Ironically when Ron does this at the Yule Ball, the plot punishes him for being insensitive.

  f) She questions Harry's methods and insights in DH, and is talking with Ron behind Harrys back. But it is Ron who abandons Harry (even when it makes a ton more sense if she abandons Harry) and she sticks around

  g) This is all added with the fact that she conveniently has answers that the plot needs Harry to get.

Does he ever actually ask her to do so/share the book with them? I recall Harry being pretty possessive over the book. In any case, they're doing pretty intense potions work by 6th year and it seems like even Hermione wouldn't be qualified to tell if the instructions are valid. I can't imagine anyone thinking Harry was in the right if we were talking about higher level chemistry in real life -- that's how people get hurt.

** Hermione seems like the person to support the underdog. She was a bit naive in school, but lost that after the war.

I could see her championing other oppressed species, but with more skill than SPEW.

She likes reading, hanging out with friends, and other various things. I see her disliking sports and other similar activities.

Her strengths are her knowledge base and her single-mindedness when it comes to an issue.

Her weaknesses are the inability to acknowledge mistakes and overthinking problems. She also is a bit heavy-handed in her approaches.

She's insecure about her intelligence I think and pretty much the same things a teen girl are.

She values knowledge, equality, and her friends.

I think it depends on how they interact with Hermione on whether they like her. She wasn't Miss Popularity, but she had a few admirers. I personally think she's a bit abrasive.

Ron in the books, when he isn't a jerk in the 4th and 7th book is actually a fairly decent guy.

Hermione is a bit vain. She did get a bit jealous of Harry in the sixth book when it came to potions. She could accept DADA, but with an annotated book, Harry started surpassing her.

​

In canon she is an intelligent, hard worker, but she isn't extraordinary. Dumbledore, Voldemort, and even Snape were more talented, as evidenced by teen Snape's annotated potions book enabling Harry to surpass Harry. She's like a kid acting like an adult.

** First of all: there is a huge difference between the book Hermione and the film Hermione. I don't know if it is just fault of Steve Kloves or whether it was pressure of Warner Brothers, but the film Hermione is very much pushing all movies towards the Hollywood boring stereotypical model, that there is one best male character and one best female character and they end up together. Movie Hermione (stealing most of the good lines from everybody else, especially Ron) is than foundation of Harmony fanfiction stories, which are mostly pushing this Hollywood stereotype even further (the only scene from movies I am sorry is not in the books is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucS3xMZcrHQ][The scene with birds from HPHBP]], I think they really should tell each other what they feel, I like that brother-sister relationship). In my further musings I am talking only about the book Hermione.

One idea which haunts me last couple of days (or weeks already?) is idea of dysfunctional Grangers' family. Not Dursley-style violence/explicit-abuse style of dysfunctional, more like neglect of highly-functional two employed professionals parents-are-not-at-home perfectionists. Children are under high stress to perform, there is performance-based acceptance, and in the situation of general neglect, kids are more or less left to care for themselves as soon as they are able. It explains so much about super-nervous overachieving workaholic Hermione, which is never certain she did enough for her studies and exams. It also explains a lot of ruthlessness with which Hermione goes after her goals (disfiguring a sneak for the rest of her life, really? OK, teenagers are supposed to be stupid and reckless, but this doesn't show much empathy; ehm, emotional range of teaspoon, anybody? It takes one to recognize one).

It also explains a lot of secrecy between Hermione and her parents. I mean, yes, my kids are just getting to teenage years so I don't know what I am talking about, but the fact that she managed to almost die couple of times and still she never told anything to her parents for six years means nothing good about their relationship. Also, the ease with which she is able to stand them up for the Christmas break trip to Switzerland is horrifying. And yes, in the end, she still doesn't tell them anything, charms their memories and sends them to Australia. There is something seriously rotten in the Grangers family.

** She doesn't have good social skills.

Her moral compass is very much based on rules instead of values.

She prefers to follow rules and authority and dislikes breaking rules for silly reasons like sneaking into hogsmeade.

But if there's a serious enough reason to break the rules, she goes all out and even does quite questionable stuff, like brewing illegal polyjuice, creating cursed contracts or memory charming her parents. I think this is because when she's already breaking rules, she's also losing touch with her moral sense since it's so closely linked with rules.

She could seriously go full evil if she saw the rules of society as fundamentally flawed.

Edit:

Because of her low social skills she probably didn't have many friends before Hogwarts, she's different not only as a witch but also because she's a genius and on a completely different level than other kids her age.

When she found out that she was a witch, she probably hoped that she would find more like her, so Hogwarts is her only hope for fitting in somewhere. This is the reason for the "or worse, expelled" quote.

Since she expected the other students to be at her level, the reality of being with a bunch of idiots (from her perspective) causes her to become more and more insufferable than she already is, especially during the Wingardium Leviosa class. When she realizes that her dream of finding equals at Hogwarts isn't happening and, as Ron mentioned, she's not making any friends again, her reality comes crashing down and she spends hours crying.

Then, after accepting that she's just too good, she's completely helpless against a troll until Harry and Ron save her. Worldview shattered again. Followed by her lying to teachers.

After the troll incident, she's accepted that while she's not found academic equals, she's not perfect and others are good at things too, she's found friends (although she doesn't have much better social skills since she doesn't make any close friends beyond Ron and Harry) and she's somewhat accepted.

** This [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Characters/Hermione_Granger][webpage]] has a pretty good summary on canon Hermione, for the most part.

** Hermione is very intelligent and logical. However she's not the best at creativity not in the same way the weasely twins, the marauders or even Voldemort himself is. She applies magic intelligently but despite her smarts does not innovate anything new.

She isn't purposely unkind or anything but shes not the best with empathy. Like for example when Lavender is upset about her rabbit being dead and points out that Trawleny predicted it and she should have seen it coming, Hermione is more interested in pointing out that her logic is flawed than comforting her or pointing out that feeling responsible is unfair even if she feels guilty. Or like how she attacks Ron when she is jealous cuz she doesn't know how to process her own emotions. Or how she tries to free the house elvee perhaps they can be freed but the way she went about it was doomed to not work if you take into account how House elves felt about her approach. Which she did not care about and/or did not notice.

Shes not incapable or understanding or empathizing with people. Shes immediate sympathetic to winky and Lupin and Hagrid. And takes offense to people treating them poorly so much so that she even hides Lupins secret once she realizes he's a werewolf. However when she has a particular view of how the world works in terms of relationships between people...or people's emotional state she gets blinders. But she is very righteous and is willing to do so even if no one is on her side like in the case of her trying to free the house elves and trying to free Buckbeak from getting executed.

She is also very prone to stress and is not quick thinking or acting in high stress situations especially ones that are life threatening. She freezes up for example in the devil's snare incident. And very preoccupied with getting good grades even as their surroundings become hostile enough that most would care less about the grades though they are less of a priority as the story goes on.

She also has a jealous and vindictive streak. Like how she kept Rita Skeeter hostage in a jar. And how annoyed she got when Harry did better than her in potions using the book of the half blood prince. Yes shes right about it being shady, but the initial reason she disliked it was it understood potions better than her.

Something like a researcher might be more appropriate from her than Minister like in cursed child which requires more social skills. But an advisor position I can see. At least based on the books.

Why people like her? Well shes still strong driven well intentioned a good person hard working smart and you want to see her succeed.

But alot of people like her based on the movies where she lacks pretty much all her flaws and has alot of Ron's good qualities and some of his better moments. She's more empathetic charming easy to get along with etc. In the movies it makes no sense for her to like Ron.

But in the books they have several bonding moments and he despite having alot bigger fights with her than anyone else is more patient with her than most people including Harry. In most cases when Harry and Hermione are hanging out without Ron they both miss his presence and things feel heavier and more awkward. Ron balances out Hermione out more has the qualities she lacks and can help relax and ground her.

** The best take i have seen on Hermione was from Red Hen who perfectly portrays her character i say. Give that a read if you like but my take is:

- She likes getting things her way and hates it when it goes another persons way.

​

- Not being good enough

​

- Good memory and work ethic. Out of the box thinking

​

- Her values are as she sees fit: Mostly about getting it her way

​

- Fear is not getting it her way

​

- The anwser is that most people do not like her.

​

- She got a crush on him from the start and never let go.

​

- Well not vain on looks but vain on being the best.
