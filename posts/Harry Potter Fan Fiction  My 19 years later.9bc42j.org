DISCLAIMER : This is just a concept

My story would revolve around James Sirius Potter and his time at school. It would deal with him trying to live up to the legend that is his father and learning to be a good older brother to his horrifically anti social brother Albus Severus Potter who does not get along with his brother at all.

It would also deal with a muggle trying to expose the wizarding world for the death of a loved one. At first James would help this person to try and find the killer as he wants to try to be like his father (an auror). However, once the muggles true intentions are revealed must turn his back on his muggle “friend”.

James would be accompanied by his two friends. A black British wizard who aspires to be one of the greatest wizards of all time. So he spends most of his days practicing all the spells that he could in case he was stuck in a situation. Unlike James, this wizard does not like Quidditch in fact he finds it boring. Unlike James' other friend, a middle eastern Scottish girl who lives with her father. She is one of the greatest quidditch players of her generation and has promises to join major quidditch teams when she finishes hogwarts. Which is why she is not overly enthusiastic about joining James' crusade to help find this muggle find the wizard who murdered there family. However, she will always help her friends when they call.

Another player in this story would be an American transfer student from Illvermorny who has recently transferred to Hogwarts due to an incident that has the ministry on its heals.

Albus Severus would also be a consistent part of this story due to James trying to connect with his brother but also because of Albus' strange abilities that he has garnered once attending Hogwarts.

** My main question is how James is managing to interact with a Muggle while attending Hogwarts. Where did they meet? Why does he care about this particular person? Why would he try and solve a mystery rather than going to McGonagall and alerting her that there's a Muggle bent on exposing the Magical world and let the proper authorities (AKA his dad) take care of the situation?

*** James and his father are not very close. The only thing they have in common is that they both love to play quidditch, however James isn't even a seeker nor as good as his father. Harry also is barley home mostly because his out all day solving cases. In an effort to get closer and impress his father James thought that he could solve this case and him and his father would become closer.

James found the muggle through Harry Potters untouched case files. This muggle has been long trying to find the wizards whom had killed his family. James, knowing about his fathers parents also being killed by a wizard felt pity for the muggle and tried to help him.

James would pressure his friends to help him go to his fathers working place to help him find clues to the murderers of the muggles family. However, James would come to know that justice is not enough for the muggle and he would like to expose the whole Wizarding World as he believes that they are way to dangerous to be kept in the shadows because of how the wizarding world tried to sweep his families murder under the rug.

**** Okay, so I can understand James and Harry not being close and James wanting to impress his father. But, I don't understand quite how you are going to work this into the context of a school year. Students don't just randomly leave Hogwarts to take trips down to London to visit Dad's office. They did it in OOTP, but that was after everything at the school had gone to hell and no one was in control. Hogwarts has Muggle-repelling charms on it and Muggles can't even properly see it. How does he come to know that this particular Muggle has it in for the wizarding world? How old is this case? Why is it untouched? You'd think that if Harry came across a case where a wizard killed a Muggle family he wouldn't rest until it were solved.

It's fine if this is the story you want to tell, but make sure that you have concrete reasons for why things occur the way they do and you're not trying to shoehorn in things arbitrarily.

***** James knows about the case because of the office Harry has at home. James used on of the spells he got from his friend to infiltrate Harrys office (not alohamora). Once in James rummages through some files and finds one that interests him which is the muggles family being killed by wizards. He choses this one as is resembles what happens to his fathers parents and if he solves the case than his father would become closer with him.\\
Once visiting the muggle James begins to feel immense pity for him. James sees loads of pictures on the wall of “proof” that wizards exist. However, most of the picture are arguably fake. Once the muggle tells James what had happened James agrees to help him as he believes James is also a muggle and a believer in the wizarding world. So than James would try to collect all the evidence that he could (not enough to expose the wizarding community) to help the muggle find the perpetrator. However, once the sufficient amount of evidence is found the muggle is now bent on exposing the whole wizarding community as he believes wizards are too dangerous to be kept in the shadows.

******* Sorry. James finds the files during the summer holiday. When he returns to school he shows it to his friends and so that they could help him solve it. James in an effort to get more time to solve the case gets suspended. His mother, Ginny than in an effort to get both her husband and son to bound suggest that Harry take James to his work place. Camouflaging it as a way in which James could be productive during his suspension whilst truly getting them to bound. Whilst at the work place Harry does not spend much time with his son and is instead working cases or talking to his friends. During this time James manages to slip away from his father to help find evidence. So once he returns to school he has much more to go off of.

The muggle families murder happens during the early 2000s once Harry has joined the aurors. This case is a case Harry himself wanted to take however he refrained from doing it due to the ministries warnings about taking up cases that would prove to hazardous for the wizarding world. However, James only finds this out later once he has already helped the muggle. Once James finds this out both him and his father finds out both of them are not too different.

  Albus' strange abilities
#+end_quote

Oh please, why do people always make ASP the chosen child?

Anyway, here's the information on the next-gen characters that we know from the Epilogue (disregard CC and JKR's post-information) that you should keep in mind:

- Albus resembles Harry with a thin face and green eyes, but /he is not a clone/ (resemble does not mean identical but only similar). More than likely, he has auburn hair because of his name. He's good friends with Rose, maybe not extremely close but a sorting wouldn't break them up. He's the least likely to end up in Slytherin.

- James is like Ron. This means that he's highly ambitious, highly insecure because he's often neglected in favor of his siblings, but also extremely protective of his siblings (and probably distrusts anyone who dates them). He's the most likely to be in Slytherin. More than likely, he has black hair because of his name, and since Harry and Albus resemble each other so much, James probably does, too. He's also only a year older than Albus. None of the cousins are the same age as him.

- Lily has red hair because of her name. She's two years younger than Albus and is extremely close to her brothers, including Teddy. There's not much else to her character. Hugo is the same or close in age to her.

*** Aside from Albus and Rose being friends and Lily's hair color and age, none of those things are said or even implied in the epilogue.

And why would James tease Albus about being in Slytherin if he was a Slytherin?

*** You're kind of taking their names too seriously. Just being named Albus or Lily really doesn't mean much in terms of hair colour. Each of their names follows the same pattern, so there's no reason for it to have relation to hair colour. Lily's the only girl, and their had to be a Lily. James was taken-so let's name him Albus after someone else we want to honour.

James is said to be like Ron after loudly exclaiming Teddy's relationship with Victorie. This is meant to indicate that like Ron, James could be insensitive to other's privacy/relationships. Not that he was like Ron in his insecurities-which would be weird to bring up. We see him joking around, he's clearly meant to be like Fred and George, and Ron in his humour. There's nothing to indicate he has any place in Slytherin.

Also this is fairly indicative about Albus' (and Rose's) personality-broody and solemn like Harry. While Lily is more lighthearted.

#+begin_quote
  “If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you,” said Ron, “but no pressure.”

  “Ron!”

  Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.
#+end_quote

But I agree making Albus the chosen child/special one is the wrong thing to do. I like stories that have Albus being shy and awkward and trying hard to live up to his father's name but not necessarily making it.

**** In my story that is not the case. Albus does not care about living up to his fathers name, in-fact he would rather be for distant than close. Thats why in my story Albus finds a father figure in Neville Long bottom, a professor at the school. Also, Albus in my story is also not “the chosen one” I hate that gimmick to. Yes he has strange abilities but that does not make him the chosen one in my story.

***** Oh I think you're story sounds fine to me. But I am hesistant about "special abilites" just depends on what they are. I have seen people go way over the top with that sort of thing.

Albus not wanting to live up to his father's name is a good idea. People taking different angles with characters is a good idea. Most of next-gen characterises them the same way: James is like the James , Lily is like Ginny and Albus is Harry . We see this in the epilogue in essence but taking different approaches is a good idea.

  More than likely
#+end_quote

I'm aware that it's only a possibility. Seeing as it was emphasized that Lily had red hair, I think there's a high chance that I'm right.

#+begin_quote
  Ron in his humour
#+end_quote

Ron used humor to cover up his insecurities. James is ignored when he tries to get his parents' attention. If the shoe fits...

And like Ron, James becomes thoughtless when it concerns his siblings' relationships. It was implied but thank you for emphasizing it.

***** Assuming their name correlates to their hair colour is strange. That wasn't the implied intention with the naming convention. Lily was always going to be Lily, James was always going to be James and Albus was always going to be Albus (and if we're talking about author's intention then surely it must be acknowledged that Albus canonically has black hair). In essence if Albus had been born with black hair, Harry's not going to suddenly name him Severus Albus-Albus Severus would always be his name.

James isn't ignored-he just didn't get the reaction he expected which is very different. He's taking most of the intention despite it being Albus' first time at Hogwarts. That's pretty indicative of him being a bit of Fred/George character.

This is nowhere in canon. His hair color isn't mentioned at all, we only know he has a thin face and green eyes. People assume he has black hair because of the "resembles" line, but as I already said, /resembles is to be like or similar, not identical/.

******* Yes. But I'm saying if we talk about author's intention as in-naming him Albus was JK Rowling clueing us in to his hair colour, than it must be acknowledged that author's intention is that he has black hair like Harry. Basically, in one interpretation it has to be argued that Harry named his children after their hair colour-there is little to indicate this is the case considering their names. However, if we think of author's intention then you may have a point-but author's intention is that Albus has black hair.
