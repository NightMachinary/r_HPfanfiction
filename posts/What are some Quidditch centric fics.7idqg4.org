#+begin_quote
  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

** linkffn(6864381) - It has its flaws (OP Harry, wbwl, other cliches), and the focus shifts between the pairing and the quidditch quite a bit. I still loved the interactions between Harry and his team. Not for everybody, but I'd say its worth a read.

I'll also endorse Vitam Paramus and A Game of Style and Brutality. The former has a great focus on the life of being a pro quidditch player, but it ended much too quickly. I would've enjoyed more.

  AU, Harry Potter was four years old when The Dark Lord attacked, Harry vanquished the Dark Lord but his baby brother takes all the credit. Dark but not evil Harry! Super Powerful&Smart Ravenclaw Harry. Starts with Harry's fourth year. HP/FD
