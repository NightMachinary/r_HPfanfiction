** I'm not big on smut, so these may not quite suit you, but these are what I have with polyjuice that at least come close.

  The battle was fought, the war is won. All is well. Why, then, does Harry Potter have the eerie feeling it's not truly over? Hogwarts stands half-broken, its ghosts missing. The Auror program is not what Harry expected. Dementors are fighting for their territory, and Harry thinks someone might be trying to kill him. Is it all in his head, or does the Boy Who Lived have more to do?

  One would think that after second year, Hermione and her friends would stay away from Polyjuice Potion. Hermione and her Boyfriend don't, and end up with a problem. Established Harry/Hermione. One-Shot. Complete. See Challenge at end of story.

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.

  Hermione knew Harry better than maybe anyone else, which was what made finding a birthday present for him so hard. She wanted to find something that reflected the depth of their friendship, that showed him how much she cared for him, loved him.The only thing she could think to give him, though, was her self.
