I'm not sure on which site I read this, but here's what I do remember: I think Sirius comes back from the veil, and he's upset that Remus moved on by marrying Tonks. The one scene I remember takes place at the Burrow(I think), Remus is there already and Sirius shows up, I think he's drunk, with some man and he's flaunting this man and being a general ass. Any ideas? It's rather angsty, IIRC. Thanks
