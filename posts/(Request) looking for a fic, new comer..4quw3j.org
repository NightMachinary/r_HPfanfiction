Hi, I'm looking for something post DH and something really good, I haven't dived into fan fiction...so anything is up for grabs. Thanks!!


** If you are new to fan fictions, I recommend canon compliant ones first before diving into AUs (Alternate Universe).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]'s 83 story series is mostly focused on the years after war. *Grave Days*, linkffn(5486257), happened immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts. *Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is a wonderful fic about Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2010.

This author is serious on canon-compliance, as he has started replacing the names of Ron and Hermione's children with 'Granger-Weasley' in all his stories.

** A few basic things might help people suggest more fics, and ones you'd be more likely to enjoy!

The main ones: do you want fics that feature or heavily include romance plots? Are you opposed to having slash (male/male typically, though there is female/female out there) or would you prefer it, or does it not matter? Are there any characters you can't stand? Any who you really want to see more of? Any romantic pairings (eg Harry/Ginny, etc) that you want? Any you absolutely could not read (remember, if there are two characters that could be shipped together they have been - and time travel is canon so pretty much anyone can be shipped with anyone to varying degrees of popularity)? What are your thoughts on original characters? Are you looking for something relatively compliant, as in, feels like JK wrote it, sticks close to epilogue ending, or would you be okay with moving further from that?

You don't have to answer all the questions or even some of them. And if you have questions about my questions feel free to ask (I tried to answer from a basic totally new to fanfic perspective so apologies if my examples were redundant!) But Harry Potter arguably has one of the largest bodies of fanfiction (currently with about 744,000 fics on fanfiction.net [not including crossovers] and nearly 100,000 on AO3 [some may be posted on both sites] and that's not even counting all the smaller sites that are typically pairing specific!) that I know of, and you'll probably enjoy reading it more if we know which direction to point you in.

Also, I believe there's a link in the sidebar for getting started that has the most recommended fics from this sub so that may be a good place to start too!

Happy fic hunting!!

*** I think that I would want something as canon as I could get, with JKR writings and something that starts right after Deathly Hallows, pre epilogue. I don't mind romantic but maybe not the focus of it and slash doesn't matter to me, I just want it to feel real.
