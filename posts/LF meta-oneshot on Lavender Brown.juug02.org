It was basically a oneshot to give an in-universe explanation for Lavender Brown's actress changing, and there were references to the disappearance of Sally-Anne and Dumbledore's actor replacement. I think Lavender noticed something, so she went to talk to Dumbledore, and he folded her into the conspiracy theory so she couldn't tell anyone the truth? It might have been only in reply to a prompt here, which is why I can't find it on ffn/ao3.
