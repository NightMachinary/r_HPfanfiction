What are some good methods for doing time travel shenanigans in a story? I have a story idea I want to do, where Harry travels back in time before he goes to Hogwarts, like when he's 6 or 7, and I'm trying to think of a better way to make it happen. I'd like him to be in London when it happens on a trip with the Dursleys. I'm trying to avoid some rando wizard throwing a time-turner on him and sending him back, aka Time Paradox Ex Machina. So any ideas? Maybe I should invent a magical creature or something else to do it.


** There's a ton of stuff possible:

- veil of death
- some DoM contraption
- potion
- creature
- specific curse
- runic spell
- sacrificial magic
- it just happens at his death
- he is the chosen one
- unfulfilled prophecy
- second chance given by some god
- sold his soul to some demon
- united the three hallows
- corrupted magic
- backlash from two powerful spells
- destruction of time turners
- some mishap with the sands of time (in time turners)

These are just some that I've seen before or just thought up. If you give us some more details about the constraints and settings, we might be able to help you more.

/Edit: formatting and some more possibilities./

*** I really like the DOM contraption, and I think it fits really well!! The scenario I want to set up is that through time travel Harry is sent back to Tom's time and eventually ends up in Wool's Orphanage with an older Tom who is already a couple of years in Hogwarts. I want him to still be the Horcrux, but to have no knowledge of the magical world. So ideally he gets sent back as a child a year or two before his letter through some freak accident or something. I think it can be really doable with the DOM Contraption. Yes! I can imagine it coming together quite nicely, and it's somewhat logical and not too handwavy.

**** If I were to try to go down this route I would consider using the prophesy orb as a catalyst in a reaction caused by some accident in the DOM...

this way you can avoid having the newTimeline-DOM be aware of Harry to whatever degree you want. You also avoid having to finagle the /DOM-contraption/ to Harry or vice versa... (especially if you want Harry to be ignorant of the whole thing)

--------------

This still ends up in you having to contrive a reason for the Orb to be affected, you could go with diving meddling or whatever if it's too hard figuring out a reasonably acceptable reason

***** That's an interesting idea, this is what I had planned for it: It's September 7th 1988 or 89(not important), The Dursleys are taking Dudley to a friend's birthday party in London. Figg was unavailable to babysit so they had to take Harry with them. They leave him on a bench or something and tell him he's to not move a muscle. Harry sees something odd moving down the street. He sees two people and a giant machine floating in between them. They're Unspeakables, Harry doesn't know it but he overhears them, He starts to follow them down an alley. He hears the first one complain about not being able to shrink the device or apparate with it, and the other responds this was the only safe method of transportation to the DOM. They talk about how they found it in a Dark Wizard's home and have no idea what it does. Harry is trying to be quiet as he follows them, but they overhear him and are startled. The two Unspeakables are arguing how the other should have put up the Muggle repelling charm when the device falls and begins to react strangely. The first Unspeakable leaves presumably to get help when the second talks to himself about getting fired and leaves as well. Harry entranced by the device gets closer when it explodes. Then as his consciousness is fading he hears an air siren, screams, and explosions. (Just a short summary first chapter would definitely be more fleshed out and longer but it's a good start I think. In the next chapter we find out he was sent 48/9 years into the past and arrives in London during an air raid. People find him and bring him to a hospital and the last thing he remembers is an explosion.)

****** sure could work... to me the Unspeakables are the elite/crazy ones; so i would suggest the device reacts to Harry's scar/horcrux... and this is what startles the Unspeakables; this also allows you to not have Harry follow strange strangers but just sit there and simply notice this happening too late to react (Notice-Me-Not charm or whatever)

**** No need to come up with an original DOM contraption. Theres already a perfect place to start it. End of 5th year at the DOM. The time Turner case gets hit by a stray spell and destroys them all.

I know you said you don't want a rando wizard to hit him with a time Turner. But that's cannon and pretty well set up to justify any amount of timey wimey sandy madness.

I once considered trying to write one where Neville gets hit by it. He gets thrown into the 4th dimension as an incorporeal consciousness that can glide through space and time effortlessly. But is only able to interact with the world by briefly taking over random people and making them talk.

Not really sure about the central conflict. If there is one. Mostly just like the idea of Neville becoming the source of prophesies.

** Xenophilius Lovegood gets collected into the Unspeakables instead of going to Azkaban.

Now, this is where you go ape-shit with the lore. Crumple-Horned Snorkacks don't exist. Cyclical-Horned Sorkacks do. Once the horn grows enough for the tip to reach the base (circle), the cycle is formed and they get control over their time powers. That's why nobody finds them, they jump to another moment in time to escape danger. Well, except for a young Xeno. He found one. And was stabbed by an adolescent Snorkack. This made him experience every point of *his* time of *every* timeline if he wasn't focusing enough. This can explain why he was such a.... unique individual.

​

Anywho, because of all of this, he was immune to time magic. The Unspeakables used him to clean up the time room since he wouldn't be stuck in a time loop, get thrown back/forward in time, or go even more insane.

​

In steps Harry, head Auror. He has some weird thought from back in the war and decides to go down to ask "Hey, how easy would it have been to locate and/or remove Horcruxes? Can you even get the Dark Mark under the Imperius? Did the blood wards over Privet Drive really work?" This is where he gets his world crushed.

Xeno saw this coming, and showed himself to Harry and dragged him into the time room. Xeno tells him an address to go to send him a letter when he wakes up, throws sands of time in his face and then launched him into the Death Eater baby in the time loop.

​

Harry wakes up at age 6, and freaks out. Have him be babysit at Mrs. Figg's place the following weekend and he escapes her by using her Floo to Xeno/Luna's place.

​

Queue explanations.

​

This way you get:

- A weird Yoda mentor who doesn't make sense half the time, but drops truth bombs whenever needed.
- Magical creature that does time.
- Access to the Weasleys if you want that.
- Access to Luna if it's going to be a Harry/Luna pairing.
- A way to save Pandora Lovegood. (This could be his real Mentor) Make her an Unspeakable. And BOOM! You have and in with the DoM.

** What kind of world is your Harry coming from? What is his background?

Good end, auror Harry can break up a criminal magic act and have side effects, depressed, bad end Harry usually tries to cause the dues ex machina. Or bad end voldemort decides 'neither can die while the other lives' means banishing Harry to another dimension (even if that causes the good guys to win there) gets him his immortality.

Both from and to are needed to say what would work.

*** I like those types of stories and for my setup to work I wanted it to be even more different and unique. Harry is very young, hasn't even received his letter yet, so he has no knowledge of the wizarding world, and Voldemort isn't really back yet. So I was trying to figure out a somewhat believable way of sending him back through an accident, without having a 3rd party aka rando light/dark wizard sending him back for some purpose, that way I can avoid the paradox.

***** I'm thinking about making him slightly older maybe 8 or 9, but I want him to go even further back to London in 1940 during the first London air blitz which is also during Tom Riddle's 3rd year at Hogwarts. I just wanted the time travel to be a mechanism to get Harry into this scenario, of him being put into Wool's Orphanage during the time Tom was also there. I think I got a pretty good mechanism for the time travel without being too handwavy, I want it to be more AU than Crack Fic I think but I'll see how it comes out.

** I recommend making it an external force of some variety that is either A. Indifferent to the plot, B. Has its own motivations beyond that of any other characters (possibly to be used in a subplot), C. Is entirely accidental and viewed by harry as something of a miracle granting second chances (best used with post war time travel), or D. One use Time travel ala ritual, best used in an apocalyptic post war senario where sacrificing the current timeline and everything in it to go back and stop it from ever happening is preferable. With this version the time travel would have to follow what amounts to dimension travel rules, where it is possible to erase timelines and remake them without consequences or paradoxes.

** There's a TV Show called Goodnight Sweetheart in which the main character just walks down a certain street to time travel back to the 1940s. In the show, he can go back and forth as he wishes, but you could have it be a temporary or fluctuating phenomenon or even moving. Have it occur when the phylogiston rotates widdershins around the macguffin of inconvenience or whatever - just enough justification to make it not an easy thing, but that it can occur if or when you need him to return to his original time.

** Well there were a few stories where Harry Hermione and Luna were hiding from Voldie's regime that controlled Britain when Santa contacts them in the name of Lilith the Faerie Queen who is loosing power as all of her Faerie children die since Voldie hunts them down for experimentation. She channeled all her power through Santa's Time Magic which he usually uses to reach all the children in the world in one night and instead sends all three back in time. It was a challenge from Paladeus - Champions of Lilith.

Then there is the ever common Don't Fear The Reaper challenge where Harry has died several times and is on his last chance thus getting sent back with his full memories to an earlier point in his life by his Reaper. There are two versions of this. The difference between them is he has one of two soul mates "some Granger girl" or Daphne Greengrass.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
