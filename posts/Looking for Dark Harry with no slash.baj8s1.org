Are there any good Dark Harry fics that don't involve HP/LV/SS/DM/LM/TMR/etc.? Het or no pairing is fine. Thanks!


** I also Lineofeld19's recommendation and would like to congratulate him on a job well done for that series. It won't be for everyone, and I think it does overuse the whole (addicted to dark arts) trope, but it is still very enjoyable.

** linkfffn(13239742) it's a WIP but being updated every Wednesday (unless something drastic in my life prevents it. I have seen nothing but positive feedback thus far and I think it is one of the best things I've written (though admittedly still in the world building phase as far as what has been posted.

  The world is a complex place, one of many subtle things that separate us Wizards though, many of them view the world as black and white, light and dark, good and evil. Albus Dumbledore is one of those people. So when Lord Voldemort fell the world rejoiced, and Dumbledore thought Harry Potter, the Saviors of the light to be just that his saviour. He is in for one hell of a surprise.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
