There the books multiple Weasleys make accurate predictions of the future the most impressive of which being when Fred and George predicted how the World Cup was going to end, they were so certain of the result that they bet there life's savings.

So did the Weasleys have a talent for divination?

And if they did how did they use it?

I think that Ron used his when playing chess so he was literally playing multiple Moves ahead.

The twins probably used it to help with there business ,being able to predict if a product would sell well before they even started to make it would have been very useful and being able to predict if they were on the right track when makeing a product would have cut down with a lot of trial and error.

Also,does anyone else think that divination is a branch of magic that is not compatible with the wands,and learning it being more along the lines of controlling accidental magic) leading to it not being trusted by people who excel in wand based magic like Dumbeldore,Mcgonnagall and Hermione,ect.

*** "We'll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts,' said Fred, as he and George quickly pooled all their money, ‘that Ireland win -- but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch"

‘Boys,' said Mr Weasley under his breath, ‘I don't want you betting... that's all your savings... your mother --'

"Don't be a spoilsport, Arthur!' boomed Ludo Bagman, rattling his pockets excitedly. ‘They're old enough to know what they want! You reckon Ireland will win but Krum'll get the Snitch? Not a chance, boys, not a chance... I'll give you excellent odds on that one... we'll add five Galleons for the funny wand, then, shall we"

Do you really think that they would bet there all of there funds for there future dream on an educated Guess . sure they could use the information to narrow down the possible out comes(which i would still count as being part of divination) but they were pretty dam sure on what was considered a very risky bet.

not to mention Ludo bagman who threw his Job and his Gambling habit probably has better information than the twins.

**** Why do you think Bagman (who is shown to be greedy) tries to discourage them from the bet?

Because he loses if they win.

And about gambling it all away on a guess: Sometimes in life you have to take a risk to get ahead /and/ they are teenagers.

then gain if i were the Weasly twins I have sold Bagmans Debt to the Goblins after all they would probably be willing to buy it if the twins were will to accept Half what they should have gotten(which is better than what they got, because didn't Bagman take there money they used to make the bet so they never got back there original money)

** It's interesting that you ask that because back in the day, like between OOTP and HBP, "Seer Ron" was a very popular fan theory. There were also those that were convinced that DD was a time-traveling Ron, especially when it came out that in his youth, DD had red hair. There was one super great story--I can't remember the title, but it was by LavenderBrown--that had Ron come out of the Department of Mysteries fight with Seer abilities.

** I think in a story like Harry Potter, there's a fine line between foreshadowing and divination.

There's no reason why you /couldn't/ make the have latent (or not so latent) divination talents, but I don't think there's anything that you can point to and say "Yes, they have this talent."

Especially considering how ill-defined divination is in the books. The only thing we know is real, actual divination magic is the crazy prophesy stuff. But at the same time, there's a lot of the trappings of historical and cultural divination lore, like tea leaves and crystal balls.

You could argue that those things obviously must work in the HP Universe otherwise they wouldn't be taught in school. But you could also argue that nobody took Trelawney seriously as a diviner, so obviously those things /don't/ work.

*** I like the idea that there is a Conspiracy to discredit Divination by either the ministry or the People who are actually good at divination.

The reason i say that the people who can actually do divination might be in on it is that if people actually thought it worked they would put restrictions on it but if divination is thought of as a joke. No one is going to look twice at the Wizard that goes into the muggle world ever weekend to watch the races or other muggle sports.(although the wizard doing that would probably have to be good at disguise magic so the muggle don't get suspicions over the person that winning all the time)

** Literally the only example you have - and it's kind of a bad one, at that; people make long-shot bets all the time - is one where, had the Twins really had any foresight, they wouldn't have taken, anyways.

****** /wat/

How is foreshadowing the same thing as divination?

Divination is about reading tea leaves, looking into crystal balls and making prophecies (which you /don't remember, afterwards/).

Why would vaguely saying something that you could maybe kind of attribute to some future event but only after the event has occurred, anyway be even remotely similar to divination?

******** Okay... such as? Those are the major methods shown in the books, except for dream interpretation.

But no matter, really, because no one could call "a vague conversation which happens to be relevant at some point in the future" as divination. You could loosely relate that to prophecy, but people don't remember their prophecies, after. It's called coincidence. Or, because it's a book, foreshadowing.

I don't mind that you think differently than me. We all have different headcanons and the books can be quite open to interpretation. I wouldn't mind reading a story where the Weasley Family have a high ratio of divination-inclined members.

... but you posted a yes-or-no thread specifically to ask the question that I answered...

And that answer is "No". The Weasley family did NOT have any extraordinary talents for divination. Not canonically, at least.

I also asked how they would use it if they had. How would divination manifest itself in there lives. Like when Ron plays chess would The saying "planing three moves ahead" be literal for him?

how would the other weasley siblings talent in divination manifest itself in there lives if it was there?

************ Sorry, I guess I didn't see the bottom where you asked for additional thoughts. :)

I'm not sure that divination could really help Ron with chess. There's a nearly infinite number of possible states in a Chess game. "Playing x moves ahead" just means anticipating your and your enemies reactions on shifting variables. Divination would provide those routes, perhaps, but that's functionally identical to just imagining them yourself, anyways.

************* I see Divination in two parts when if comes to predicting the future first is the amount of Possible outcomes and how far into the future you are trying to look.

so predicting a coin toss which only has three possible outcomes and is seconds into the future is probably one of the most simple divination exercises. bit its also about getting its right 100% of the time.

for predicting the chess game sure Ron would start out predicting 3 moves a head but as he gets better he would eventual be able to Predict every move his opponent would make between the start and end of the game with 100% accuracy

always in motion is the future.

which is why i say that Distance into the future is one of the two main parts that measure difficulty.

the other is possible Possible outcomes so at the start of a chess game the person playing White has 20 possible first moves 16 pawn moves and 4 knight moves which is a lot more than the 3 possible outcomes from a coin toss.

meaning the difficulty of predicting what moves your opponent in chess is going to make is a hell of a lot harder. and with the further you do into the future the more possible out comes there are with each harder than the last to predict with 100% accuracy than the last.

then say if the person is using divination for gambling on a football game and they only want know which team will win for there bet then there is only 2 possible answers less than 2 hours into the future.

or gambling in a game of blackjack trying to predict which card is going to come next with 100% accuracy gets easier the longer the game goes on because that amount of possible cards it could be only goes down.

************* /Shrug words still have definitions in fiction too. I'm not trying to be argumentative, I just like the OP's original thought and it seemed to fit well in the framework of the story. So I pointed to an example of in-story confirmed (via Dumbledore) prophecy occurring in ways that were similar to what the OP suggested. There is obviously a difference (Trewlney never remember either) but I assume the fact that prophecy was never covered in any of the in-story divination classes, and there are multiple years of class-room content that there are multiple ways to divine the future all of them falling under the banner of Divination.
