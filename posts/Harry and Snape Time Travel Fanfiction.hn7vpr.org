Hello

I've been looking for some good fics in which Harry travels back in time (remains an adult) and befriends Snape. I can take a good fic where they become friends if Harry merges with his child body too. Snarry is OK if there is some good friendship buildup first but ONLY if Harry comes back as an adult.

Bonus points if they both travel back in time/have the memories from before.

The longer the better!

Thanks for the help~!

Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived to Defeat Voldemort, Head Auror of the MLE, finds himself stuck in his 11-year-old body after a potions accident. How does 28-year-old Harry deal with being a First Year, with Voldemort rising back to power, and himself a Horcrux again? How does being sorted into Slytherin affect his relationship this time around with Snape? EWE. Slash.

''A post war and guilt ridden Harry is having dreams of a younger Snape. He realizes he can actually communicate with him, first as a disembodied voice, then as something more tangible. A sweet story about love across time.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624][*/Perfect Shapes/*]]

When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

These two fics are Snarry if you don't mind.
