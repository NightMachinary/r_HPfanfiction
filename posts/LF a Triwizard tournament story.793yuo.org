I remembered reading a story where Fudge's and Umbridge's name (in addition to the usual players) came out of the goblet of fire. I passed on the story as I was distracted then, but now I want to give it another shot. Google has not been helpful. Does anyone know the story?


** Ooooh, this sounds interesting.

** Did they compete? Would love to see Fudge trying to take on a dragon. (Umbridge is surprisingly adept at transfiguration so maybe she'd do ok against the dragon, and in the second task. (Employing Krum's idea))

*** Yes, they were forced to compete. I think both were injured and Harry might have been dark, he might have been the one that placed their names in the goblet.

** I think I've read this one, Dumbledore was in it too and at the ball was found out to be having sex with a goat/Voldemort (harry was kidnaped before the final task and willingly gave them some goat blood, and moldywart came out as a half goat man)
