Whether they both are working on something they both want or Narcissa is hiring Harry because she needs his talents (or vice-versa) doesnt matter. On the way to their Goal, Narcissa migh have a (temporary) Crush on Harry. He, however, doesnt have any such emotional connection to her. But he wont stop or interupt her in any attempts of getting closer to him or seduce him.

​

At some point they could sleep with each other (or rather, she sleeps with him, but he doesnt reject her).

​

It doesnt have to be Narcissa, but in fact any other "Older" Woman

** Is it essential that Harry be younger?! Because um, I have a fic that chronicles the adventures of an old Harry and Hermione and yes, there is sex in it!

*** hmm, not necessary. I actually had only the image of Narcissa (or an other woman) coming to Harry for help. Is Hermione a young one or as old as Harry?

**** They're both old...I take it you want to read smut, right? I'm actually writing both a main fic and a companion piece and I'm gonna send you a link for the companion piece because its very first chapter has what you're looking for.

You can check this out and see if you like how I write lemons.

As for your request about an older woman, I'm gonna soon be writing a chapter with Ginny as an older woman, what do you think?!

** Damn, I was /just/ reading a fic that had exactly this a couple of months ago! It was, at first, a plot orchestrated by a totally-into-men!Lucius to either tie his wife up in a scandal, turn Harry to the dark side (Heyo! or otherwise), or just get his own rocks off in peace, idfk. Harry and Narcissa meet at the QWC, and sexy times/magical training happen well into the school year.

Harry juggles two illicit affairs at once, but I won't spoil the other pairing. Shame I can't remember the name; It was actually a decent plot in amongst the smut.

***** That's the one exactly! I feel bad for forgetting the name now. Kinda wish it was still being updated (yes I know it's not the original author), and that's saying something for me, what with the pairings.
