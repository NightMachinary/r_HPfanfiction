However, Tom is still intelligent and so in order to have magic, he makes a deal with his dying grandfather that makes the old man turn Tom into his Horcrux. Tom finally has magic and goes to Hogwarts.

*** Thank you!

"The moment the incantation was spoken, Tom could feel the splinter of his grandfather's soul stirring within him, and he sensed his grandfather's magic coursing through his veins. He closed his eyes for a moment as the magic tingled through his body. Magic. I have magic now...

He took his grandfather's wand out of the old man's hands and pointed it at a "What a clever boy you are, Tom! My grandson, my soul! I will live on in you, my beautiful child..." He closed his eyes and drew his last breath, a smile upon his lips."

And now I have to ask, do Horcruxes work this way?

**** We would not know. The one human horcrux we know of in canon already had magic before he was made into one. So, perhaps it does. Harry did gain his Parselmouth abilities from the Horcrux though, so who knows.
