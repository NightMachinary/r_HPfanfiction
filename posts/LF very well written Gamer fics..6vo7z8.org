What it says on the title. I just got up to date with the Root of darkness by Amorphis760 so I'm in a bit of well written gamer mood. I have finished most of the good ones at the video game plot community at ffn.net so I'm looking for rare gems with more than at least fifteen chapters. crossovers are welcome. And finally, please, get past the first year at hogwarts.


** Gamer fic is a codeword for "will be abandoned within 6 months" since authors lose interest in the munchkinry. You aren't finding many because there aren't many, tbh. Since they spend hours and chapters on building Harry's skills up before Hogwarts, 99% never get beyond yr 1, and most don't even get that far.

If you want a HP/gaming crossover, try linkffn(8096183) but that one is also abandoned/on longterm hiatus (fundamentally identical to abandoned).

  I was nothing special before I died the first time but when something offers me the chance to live again I take it. Reborn into a world of death I will survive. There will be no mercy and no pity. For there are monsters that roam this world and to survive I might have to become one myself. Elements of the Gamer and X-overs in later chapters.

**** This probably one of the best ones I've read personally, there's a few scattered around on Archive of our Own but some of them are, lets just say, acquired taste.
