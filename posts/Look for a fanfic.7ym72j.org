Ok so there's this HP fanfic that I love, but I can't find it anywhere. It's basically Harry gets wrongly convicted and sent to Azkaban with only the Weasley twins believing in him the entire time. Barry's innocence is proven and when he gets out of azkaban he's not in his right mind and the Weasley twins are the ones that are there to help him. Eventually Harry gets his sanity back and Dumbledore now begins to press Harry to fight Voldemort because he's the boy who lives but Harry doesn't want to seeing as the Wizarding world was against him for years.

That's the basic plot with a lot of the Twins caring about Harry. PLEASE if someone can find this fanfic and send me the link I'd be enternally grateful!


** Is it one where he moves into the shop with them and there's an attack on Diagon Alley? I think I have it bookmarked at home, will look if no one has posted when I finish work
