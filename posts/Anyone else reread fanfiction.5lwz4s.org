I've got a couple favorites that I reread.

Currently I'm on my guilty pleasure lightning on a wave saga.

What's yalls?


** All the damn time!!!!

Especially one shots I really liked. Most of the time I don't even remember their names, I just see them and I know I've read them because the hyperlink has shown that I have clicked on the link and I'm like "oh well, it wouldn't hurt to read it again".

Off the top of my head, I have read *DisobedienceWriter* and *questionable quotation's* numerous works a tonne of times.

** Constantly. I read fast and don't actually retain well, so re-reading is always fun - I forget entire scenes and subplots. I've got 80+ HP fics saved, and even more in a few other fandoms.

** I was rather late to this fandom, so Princess of the Blacks and its sequels were the first ones that I read which had the cliches of manipulative Dumbledore(unless HPMOR counts), overly abusive Dursleys etc. I reread it around 3 times, though I probably won't do it again, but I will finish the series.

I like to reread comfy fics like Harry the Hufflepuff, Remus Lupin PI on occasion. Other rereads include Murder Most Horrid and the Arithmancer.

I don't think I could ever reread the lightning on a wave saga, it is far too devoid of humour for me. Finishing it was depressing enough.

** HP and the Nightmares of Futures Past, and also Backwards with Purpose. Some of the best time travel 'fic, IMO, they're popular for a reason.

HPMOR (only certain chapters). Harry Potter and the Natural 20. Great examples of competence porn and more, when they're not being pretentious.

To Reach Without (on ff.net). Being Liquid, and Of Historical Figures and Now (both on Ao3). All about gender issues in the Wizarding World.

** I usually reread things after enough time goes by that I can't remember a lot of the specifics of a story even if I remember the overall plot still, so that it feels like a somewhat fresh experience.

So usually every 2-3 years or so I'll reread fics when I'm browsing my favorite pairings.

*** This. I've reread A Black Comedy (nonjon) at least 4 times over the last 5 years. I've read the Denarian saga a few times. The wizard of the Kaleidoscope (gets stranger every reread lol) and countless others.

There is a lack of good humour fics which have plots and that's probably why I keep rereading them

** All the time.

- After a long pause in updates
- During a lull in my update notifications
- When a new story in a series starts
- Or simply when I'm in the mood for a specific story.

** I've read Pureblood Pretense about 4 times since I first read it in August 2016. It's a problem. I think I've read Draco and Harry's first meeting in HPMOR at least 7 times. This is the opposite of a problem. Others like The Arithmancer, The Merging, and Blurring Reality I've read a couple of times each.

I keep trying to finish Lightning on a Wave, but I can't seem to manage to get past book 4 or so each time I try. It's driving me a bit mad, actually.

** Every year around April I reread the Life Cycles trilogy linkffn(Life Agendas) by windseeker2305. The first one is not that great and the whole thing is kinda weird and it's overly slashy and a lot of characters are ooc and overpowered but it's my guilty pleasure and i love it lol. Just wish it would get updated more than once every year or so heh.

On another note, I stopped reading lightning on the wave around halfway through the fourth one because harry is still a whiny little bitch and it annoyed me sooo much. Does it get better? Should I try to push through?

** I realized that I could reread stuff 6 years into reading fanfic. It was very nostalgic and now I reread in between updates for WIPs.

My typical reread includes Problem with Purity (once a year) and A Black Comedy.

** I love rereading great fanfiction. If something slowly updates, I might feel obliged to re read the whole thing just so I remember what was happening.

There is like a limit to how frequently I allow myself to re read something but that's why I'm always on the hunt for more undiscovered gems.

** Yeap, all the time. I read fanfics since I was 11 ( so around 13 years) and even if I've alread switched shippers a lot I kind of stuck in some shippers and some determined type of fics that I prefer, and is difficult to find new good fics all the time, so I usually end up reading my favs again.

** I typically don't reread stories very often unless I'm feeling particularly nostalgic or am looking up details for something. Mostly because pretty much all I read are long fanfics, 50+ chapters, hundreds of thousands of words etc.

That and if I read something too many times the story becomes stale to me and I don't really enjoy it any more because I've read it so much.

** I have reread Objects of Desire by azrael (sp?) so many times... it borders on obsessive. My brother and I both love it, since it ends up with both of our favorite pairings, but it is pretty dark and sucks you in. You think you're getting a light hearted ridiculous virginity loss pledge story, instead it gets really dark very fast.

I also reread Mundungus42's stuff (on ff.net) all the time. Really like her writing style and am always psyched to get an email that she posted a new story!
