Do you know of a story that drastically alters the curriculum of Hogwarts for the better? To its detriment?

My submission is [[/u/KwanLi]] 's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]].

Please leave a link and thanks in advance for contributing.


** Here is an AU one shot that fits your description.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6326956/1/The-Board][The Board]] by Clell65619: "Following the fall of Voldemort, the Hogwarts Board of Governors meet."

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7619993/1]] is a 'Harry is sorted into the headmaster role' fic, and fixes things. A fun read.

** Taure's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic]] did this, but it's abandoned.

Pretty sure that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird's Son]] does this too. Not a fan of harems in the slightest, but...

EDIT: Late edit, I know, but thought it was best to clarify as I misread (yeah, stupid lol). These two fics just have AU curriculum - they weren't improvements on the canon schedules, as such. Sorry :P

** I really liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven][Wit of the Raven]], alas its long since abandoned.
