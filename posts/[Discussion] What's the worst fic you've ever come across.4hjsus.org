** I have no idea. You can usually tell that a fic is extremely bad within the first paragraph. As such I don't spend much time on very bad fics and so they tend to mix together in my memory and get forgotten.

****** Urgz, don't remind me... it features fellatio with 11 year olds. And the teachers and parents are all cool with that (really though, isn't this a huge red-flag for possible child abuse if an 11 year old girl thinks this is something she should do?).

If "The Real Us" were a book, I'd have thrown it into the corner in disgust at that point.

It's all poorly written harem fantasies, where apparently all the women think it's reasonable for him to have sex with multiple women because he "needs" more sex and that a single woman just doesn't have the stamina to keep up with him- ahem, I mean, Harry.

** I have read some really awful ones on purpose. Sometimes I see what doesn't work and think about if I see shadows of it in my own writing. Actually, my first story was a Dramione, and not because I ship them---or anyone, but I read one and thought, "That isn't how I would go about scaffolding that ship," and so I challenged myself to take a crack at it.

** Not the worst I've seen, but the worst novel-length one I've read:

Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is by no means the worst fic out there. The author actually has a pretty good grasp of the English language by fanfiction standards. But the story is just super awkward at many points and in the end I just wondered why the fuck I wasted more than an entire afternoon on it. It's not even one of those cases where it is so bad it's funny.

**** Many characters just felt massively OOC for a fic that claims to be canon-compliant.

Neville often felt out of character. He shifts in and out of his canon personality, but the more he becomes a military leader, the more his canon personality vanishes. The author takes the "Army" far too literally. These are teenagers, not battle-hardened soldiers! Most of them have faced nothing worse than Umbridge in their lives. And yet, they're thinking and talking like walking clich√© soldiers.

Snape was absolutely ridiculously brutal. In that story, Snape sent Luna, Ginny and Neville to be eaten by werewolves in the Forbidden Forest. Also, he has Ernie and Neville beaten almost to their death and then hangs them from the ceiling bleeding for several days.

There's also an awkward scene in which Neville, Ernie and Terry torture Goyle as a revenge for raping Lavender. Seriously? Neville taking part in torturing anyone?

And then of course, there's the infamous execution scene. Basically, Neville and Hannah are sentenced to death by beheading, but Percy Weasley turns out to be a polyjuiced Viktor Krum who saves them.

And then, they don't leave the country. Nope, they go back to Hogwarts after somehow the ministry decides to accept the Imperius curse as an excuse.

Another thing was that the relations between the boys and the girls were quite awkward. In the Harry Potter novels, witches and wizards are equals. In The Year Of Darkness, it's mostly the guys doing the heroics, and the girls are usually either victims, healers or admirers. Mostly the latter.

I think trainwreck is the best description for that fic.

** C'mon guys, nothing can beat My Immortal in terms of worst fanfic ever. To do this day I'm still unsure whether she was trying to make it bad. Naturally, all the characters are goth (or goff, as she spells it), and of course Dumbledore walks in on her (the author writes herself as the main character) shagging. Not to mention that they're all obsessed with punk-pop music and her spelling is painfully horrendous. I'm not even going to being on the plot, or lack thereof. This fic is absolutely atrocious.
