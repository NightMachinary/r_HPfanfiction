** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4084005/1/Fate-s-Mistake][Fate's Mistake]] by kb0 fits... for the most part. There's child abuse in the first chapter, but he "gets better" and the rest of the story is about Harry being a normal kid with a happy childhood.

  There was no way Lily Potter would let her son anywhere near her sister, so she told Dumbledore about her cousin in America. After Halloween 1981, the Fentons gain another son. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Danny Phantom and related media.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** The author is kind of a pompous twit that experimented with a few things that fell flat, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12706296/1/The-Resident-Spy][*The Resident Spy*]] linkffn(12706296) features a Harry raised by Natasha Romanoff (The Black Widow from the MCU). She pointedly made sure he had the most normal childhood he could have in said situation.

  It is our choices that show who we are, much more than our abilities. Of course, your abilities are what prevent you from being killed. The choices you make with those abilities are what Dumbledore was probably going for when he left Harry with the Black Widow. Hopefully no one was paying attention.

** linkffn(remus lupin, pi) has Harry removed from the Dursleys in early childhood and sent to a foster home where he's happy. The fic overall is kinda decent too, pretty good first half progressively weakening towards the end.

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.
