I am looking for any/all fan fics where the Hogwarts students protest the teachers and get rid of some of them. I remember one where Harry started a school wide protest against umbridge and snape to have them fired. And the students didn't leave the towers really, oh and I think Hermione had a large issue with it all and was kinda kicked out of Gryffindor because she wouldn't go along with it all. *Sorry for spelling mistakes!


** This might be the kind of fic you're looking for (I'm talking about chapter 2 but all the other chapters are really good too) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11271241/2/What-If][Chapter 2 of what if by Fyreheart]]

  Harry starts up a Rebellion after Dumbledore is forced to flee Hogwarts and his two targets are Dolores Umbridge and Severus Snape. He has a foolproof plan: to drive them insane by acting insane himself. Complete and sequel, Rising, is up!
