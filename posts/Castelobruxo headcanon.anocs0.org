"“The Brazilian school for magic, which takes students from all over South America, may be found hidden deep within the rainforest.“ - Okay, first thing wrong with this sentence: how was this school built in the middle of the rainforest since efforts to colonize the Amazon were still being made in the 20th century???? Okay, so, maybe, like the Harry Potter wikia says, the school precedes the Portuguese colonization and only has a Portuguese name due to the Marquês de Pombal ban on indigenous languages on the 18th century. But if that is the case (completely ignoring the huge number of indigenous languages that were spoken in South America before colonization and the problem of which would be the school's official language), why the fuck is this school located in the Brazilian Amazon, where most of the communities were of the smaller sort even before the Portuguese/the Brazilian government arrived, instead of Peru, where they had THE FUCKING INCA EMPIRE!"

I've decided for my story that Castelobruxo was built in Peru, but it was moved into the amazon following the statute of secrecy. To that end, it has the capacity to turn into a stone giant that is capable of casting magic, truly making it a" wizard castle".


** I think many north americans have problems with how Rowling envisioned their magical society, so why would she do any better in south america? She lived in Portugal and knows enough, I feel, but in the end, it is just a couple of sentences of back story. I mean, perhaps the school had another name as you suggested and anyway Castelobruxo is such a stupid name- first, we did not have castles, second, we rarely use amalgamation to create words, third it should have been something like Fortaleza da Magia ou Castelo Mágico...something that gramatically made sense.

*** I think the thing that most annoys me about the NA worldbuilding is that there is only one school in the entire fuckin' /continent/.

Where the fuck do the Canadians go? Mexicans? We're honestly being told that parents ship their kids into the US for school? And Hawaii's a state, yeah, but it's also in the middle of the fucking ocean.

I mean, my god, California consistently ranks in the top ten of /world/ economies, and if you drop someone off in the middle of Texas it would take them several days to get out of state by car.

Even if we say there's only one wizard for every thousand muggles, sorry, "no-majs" and that only a third of the magical population is school age at any given time that's still...too fucking many students for one school to handle.

** So much on Pottermore feels like worldbuilding that was done without checking out anything deeper than the first couple of links after hitting "Enter" in Google Search.

Well, now there just needs to be an AU filled with magical schools that transform to battle kaijū.
