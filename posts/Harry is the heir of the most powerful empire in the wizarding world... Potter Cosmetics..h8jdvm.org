Voldemort chose the Potters when he heard the prophecy because they'd thrice refused to develop a hair recovery potion for him. Snape hated James for always trying to sell him Potter brand shampoo. Gilderoy Lockhart is constantly trying to off Harry "accidentally" to improve sales of his own cosmetics line. Bonus points for Lavender and Parvati stalking Harry to try and get jobs once he is old enough to take control.
