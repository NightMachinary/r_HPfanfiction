In HP FanFiction we often see the term holster used for the object in which a wand is held for convenience and concealment. Given that holsters are typically used to hold pistols, which are more of an L shape, while scabbards are meant to hold blades, which are typically straight or slightly curved, why is it that we use the term holster for these devices when wands are more similar in build to a blade rather than a pistol? Is it due to the fact that wands are more of a ranged instrument, or more to do with ease of wording rather than accuracy in description, or perhaps some other factor I am unaware of? What do you think the reason is?


** I'd like to see more people making like Lucius Malfoy and store their wand inside a pimp cane.

*** Just wondering how tf it didn't snap in there, because from what I remember the metal bit was all outside the cane part

** I can't lie, I'm just partial on the wizard using an undetectable extension charm on their sleeve and storing it there.

** I think it's just something people used for it's simplicity and then others copied it. Don't fix what isn't broken and all that.

** Because 'scabbard' means 'sheath to hold a blade' while 'holster' means 'a case for carrying a small item' as well as the more widely used 'holder for a firearm'. Linguistically, sheath would actually be most appropriate as a more generic term for 'thing to hold another thing' because there's no firearm or blade links in its definition.

I imagine the ranged instrument thing also plays a part (most fanfiction seeming to be written by Americans these days and they being more familiar with guns will be more likely to use that association), along with fanon not fixing what isn't broken. We all know what someone means by 'Wand Holster' and 'Wand Sheath' or even 'Wand Scabbard' would evoke a different image that we'd have to think about rather than just noting that the character has a place to put their wand (aside from where the sun don't shine :D).

I've definitely seen a few fics use 'sheath', though that most often referred to a dagger-like hip-sheath specifically rather than the wrist-mounted things fanon seems to love so.
