I'm looking for a fic where Harry is somehow aged down to his toddler self and, since he is a child again, has to be taken care of by someone (preferably Ron and Hermione.). Harry would still be himself and have his memories but would be a child again so unable to care for himself.

The only fic I can think of that play with this idea is These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo ( linkffn(11317075) ) and I was wondering if there were others around, especially if it's the main plot of the story.

  The war has been won, yet the aftershocks continue. The scattered survivors are left to pick up the pieces and find ways to move on. Join the various members of the extended Weasley family as they struggle to rebuild and cope with the consequences. And of course there are still Death Eaters left to find.
