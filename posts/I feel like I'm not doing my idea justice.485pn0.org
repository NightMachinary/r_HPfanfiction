For a long time, I've been wanting to write this very specific fic. It's not something that's been done a million times (actually I can't find anything like it), but I actually think it would have pretty broad appeal /if/ it was well-written.

Honestly I've outlined it and reworked it, and I even have a spreadsheet with all of the subplots and how the plots/subplots would be ordered chronologically.

But the actual writing is just so daunting. There's so many things to consider and when I actually put words to page it just doesn't feel like what I'm writing is good. I feel like I have this grand idea of a really fantastic fic but I'm not doing it justice.

But I have such a firmly established idea of how the characters would act that I could never just hand the idea off to someone else. It's forever my head canon, but I wish I was a skilled enough writer to put it into words.

The other thing is that I'm so busy with my family and work that I really don't have time to do it justice. It makes me sad that this epic will probably always live in my head.

Does anyone else know what I mean?

Only too well.

I'm writing an outrageously long story. On the plus side, the novel format allows the author to take their time in creating interesting characterizations and laying intricate hooks for future plot developments. On the other hand, one minor change means having to go through the /entire/ story to look for any possible conflicts.

Sometimes the level of detail is what makes a story interesting to write. Other times it's the reason to walk away.

** This kept me from writing the story I'm working on now for three years.

What finally got me moving was the realization that, because I had so much of the thing outlined and plotted out, there was nothing wrong with me just starting to write any scene I wanted to at any moment. No order, no compulsion to finish what I write, just writing---with the files organized in roughly outline order. I got 20,000 words into the story that way, just writing scenes and bits of scenes and snatches of conversation with no guide except what I was excited to write that day.

As it turned out, a lot of my plot points didn't quite work once I finally wrote them---among other things, I had a character vanishing twice in a half an hour to facilitate two similar but not identical scenes, and a lot of scenes didn't quite make sense in the order I had them. A lot of the scenes I'd kept myself putting off for later, because I wasn't excited about them, turned out to just be bad ideas; once I had written the "exciting" scenes around them, it was easy to see how to replace them.

But because I'd tricked myself into writing so much of it already, it was easy to a) see those problems and b) reorganize and revise what I'd written to fit. You'll leave the outline more than you expect, but once you're actually writing that doesn't feel so bad. (And the changes rarely affect the germ of the idea that made you want to write it so badly.)

** Practice makes perfect. It's also ill advised to start with your dream story. The amount of rewriting you will have to do because your skill is rapidly increasing from total noob to sub par will be enormous and suck all the motivation out of you. I recently wrote the first chapter of my "epic" (and my first chapter ever) and posted it on the dlp forum. Man was I proud of that chapter and oh man was that chapter objectively garbage. If you want to write your epic like I do, I suggest you join the dlp forum and post scene by scene in your own WBA thread and have people help you out by pointing out why you suck dick at it :). That way you will steadily churn out your story scene by scene until one day you are done.

You have it all planned and worked out. You're concerned about the quality of your writing. That puts you ahead of like 99% of fanfiction writers. No one is expecting fanfiction to be perfect and it sounds like the only thing holding you back is your lack of confidence. I'd say go for it! It's not like you have to finish.

You haven't mentioned anything about your actual story, but I already know I wouldn't mind reading it. If you find the act of writing it a fun thing to do with your spare time, what's the harm trying?

** Yup. Definitely get that feeling when writing long fics. One thing that's worked for me is being willing to detour from the spreadsheet a bit. More organic interactions arise when I do that. So do the little details that really flesh out a story. If I'm just writing to get from plot to plot, the story lacks life. Of course, when I do that, I end up having to record the new details just in case they're throwing something else off. It is time-consuming and can seem hopeless. I have to take breaks now and then, which is why I like working on two stories at the same time (more if I'm throwing short stories in too.) I can switch back and forth and avoid burning myself out on one idea.

** outlines?? what is this thing you speak of?

I have the opposite trouble, brilliant sparkly bits of scenes and plots that I can't organize into anything.

Then you'll just have to write it well, won't you? It will be bad at first, of course. All writers are when they begin. But the more you write, and the more you study /how/ you write and /why/ that writing is good or bad, the better you'll get.

Not to be callous, but with that attitude, it /will/ always live in your head. There are a great many quotes about finding time to write, and they all boil down to this: You don't find time to write, you /make/ time to write. If there is a single hour in your day that you spend luxuriously on yourself, /that is time to write/.

** Yep, I know exactly what you mean. it's one reason why I will never be a fanfiction writer.

I'd suggest grabbing the bull by the horns and writing anyways or giving up. Being in limbo is pretty sucky.

** I dedicated all my writing time to an epic once, unfortunately i didn't like the way i was taking it and gave up.

The premise and certain scenes held promise but i just couldn't portray it as my mind's eye held it and i think that's the hardest thing i've faced as a budding writer. I think people who can articulate plot elements with the true force of feeling behind them are the ones who are always the best writers , if you can't manage that then your writing seems dry and without life and that might be the most horrible thing i've had to deal with ; not being satisfied with how you're showing your own fantastical and vibrant idea to others.

It's like having a movie be in Oculus Rift-esque reality and turning out as a plain 2-D movie when you're finally done filming it.

Writing is a very time consuming and somewhat wholly encompassing hobby. When you have an idea like that hours , days and weeks pass just perfecting it in your head. Then planning it all out and finally getting around to writing it ; it takes a lot of effort and not everyone is willing to dedicate all of that time , i certainly wasn't.

But it's not all doom and gloom , one of the best feelings in the world is when you write down a story you've had in your mind and have people understand and go through the same feelings you did while you experienced it for the first time ; that's why i write.

** When you start writing it and posting it can you message me a link to it?

I would say just start writing it and see how it goes though
