*** A ton of comedy potential with Lavender, she gets my vote. Plus you can have Harry tease her constantly with Won Won.

** Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson were both really willing to banter while they were at school, and I feel like Fleur could be an interesting addition to such a misfit team.

Then... Well, there's no actual LIMIT to how far Myrtle can go from her bathroom, right? She'd definitely be a ragtag addition.

** Katie Bell - dark haired witch from a year ahead of Harry, Quidditch player, joined the DA, poisoned by the necklace Draco tried to have smuggled into Hogwarts to kill Dumbledore. She returned for the Battle of Hogwarts and survived. While she's not particularly well-defined in personality, there's enough background there to build a believable character.

** Wait, Sirius is 22? And Teddy is 24? That's either a typo or this fic is /really/ interesting.

** Pansy Parkinson? She could have a redemption arc. I like the other suggestions of Lavender or Fleur.

** Assuming time travel is involved, I would suggest Amelia Bones. She's got to be competent to be head of the DMLE, and is pretty fleshed out for a periphery character.
