*** If only that one would update as well!

Hey, OTWTG is by far the best Slytherin!Harry story and we have ACA for Slytherin!Hermione... Too bad there's no crazy awesome fic (or any at all) for Slytherin!Ron.

**** Kevin Vacit's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/red-hair-green-tie-hp.334067/][Red Hair, Green Tie]] is pretty good. It could have been become crazy awesome had it not been abandoned after year 1. I also like [[http://slashfest.livejournal.com/84742.html#cutid1][Better when we're Together]], but it is Ron/Draco, so YMMV. But yeah... no crazy awesome story about canon Ron in Slytherin.

On the bright side, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] is crazy awesome Slytherin!Ginny. Hoping it would update soon. Nothing for Neville, Luna or any of the Marauders, as far as I know.

**** Oh but there is Slytherin Ron -[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/red-hair-green-tie-hp.334067/][Red Hair, Green Tie]]. Personally however I don't find setting Ron in the Slytherin as that much of an interesting thing, he was always a background character for me.

**** Ron's a Slytherin in Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). He comes across as a bit unsympathetic in the beginning but does end up becoming much more so later on.
