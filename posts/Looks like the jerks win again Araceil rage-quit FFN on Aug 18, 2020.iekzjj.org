  Fed up of FFnet and the pricks on here. So everything is getting deleted. Thanks for the 20 years of memories and abuse and mental disorders. Thanks for the death threats, the stalkers, the suicide threats, and snidey entitled demands. ;)

  You won't be missed.
#+end_quote

In good news, the [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Araceil/pseuds/Araceil][AO3 account]] is still there, but does not include all of the stories. Two I know of that are missing:

/Niflheim Academy/ is not there, but there are two chapters of a rewrite, renamed /Niflheim Academy of Magical Practices/. Really wish I'd downloaded this because most rewrites I see never make it past a few chapters, and very rarely get to the same plot position of the original, no matter how flawed that was. The premise of this is one that, in retrospect, I'm completely surprised isn't a trope: during Chamber of Secrets, when Fudge decides "the Ministry must be seen to be doing something," he not only arrests Hagrid but also /expels the known parselmouth/.

/Fairy Tale/ is not there at all. This is particularly depressing to me because I loved the concept of it: Harry realizes that he's creating the incidents he gets punished for, and goes searching for ways to control it. He comes across the Fairy Tale manga series, and starts teaching himself based on the magic system in the manga. It's one of those "Harry can do amazing things because he doesn't know they're supposed to be impossible" stories. He teaches himself to "eat" electricity! At least I had this one downloaded.


** I didn't rage quit or delete anything but this is why I no longer bother with ff.net. the readership of ao3 just seems more mature and less randomly abusive.

I don't know this author or their works but at least they don't seem gone for good!

*** I don't know any of his work but the readership seems more 'mature' on ao3? Authors just remove any negative comment and even have the option of reviewing comments before allowing them to be posted.

And I guess you could call ao3 a more mature website, since 50% of their readers are probably only there for the smut.

P.S. why would you care about people's comments at all? And why would people send death threats? Unless he was writing some really fucked up shit?

**** I'm not sure why you're taking it so personally, I'm only speaking from my own experience and clearly this authors too. I found I would often get people reviewing my stories on ff.net to rage that I hadn't written their chosen ship, even though I had made it clear it was canon compliant. Or sending me death and rape threats because they didn't agree with the direction the story was taking - and no, for the record, I wasn't writing fucked up shit at all.

It's very easy to say "just ignore them, why would you care" and I guess some people can do that but for some of us it will affect us more, and that's why we might make the decision to look for smaller audiences on sites like ao3.

***** Fair. But I wasn't referring to you with that but to the OP who obviously knows the guy's works.

I wouldn't worry though, from what I could see of the author's profile, most of his work is slash and there's a bigger slash community on ao3 than straight. There's a lot of people on ffn.net that don't like slash so maybe he'll be happier there.

Ao3:

Harry/Draco: 44 000 stories Harry/Ginny: 9 000 stories Harry/Snape: 12 000 stories Harry/Hermione: 4 000 stories

As for negative comments because of not writing someone's chosen ship: there's this story called 'The life he leads' that was amazing but the author decided to end it when people were flaming him/her for veering off the ship he was saying his story was.

P.S. there are more stories on ffn.net with Draco/Harry than Ginny/Harry as well. Is fanfiction more popular with the LGBT community or are there that many teenage girls reading fanfics and are obsessed about Harry/Draco?

****** As someone who only reads and writes canon compliant stuff I'm not really in a position to speculate. I would guess the transformative nature of fanfic allows people to explore different dynamics and representation than is possible in mainstream literature, and, yes, there will probably be an element of young people exploring their sexuality too. But despite the higher allowance for smut on ao3, as I said, I generally found the reviews there more respectful and mature. Possibly the culture of tagging and warnings is more established than on ff.net, so you're more able to find what you want and ignore the rest.

******* Sure but if you want to go through ao3 without being bombarded with stuff you don't like you have to use 30 tags to exclude and even then authors often don't even use tags.

No matter how many tags I use I keep stumbling across fics depicting rape and pedophilia. Something always seems to slither through. I don't have this with ffn.net. I'll take some immature teenagers over the alternative. Then again, I'm not a writer.

******** I've genuinely never had that problem, I just glance over the summaries and scroll past the ones I don't like the look of, I've never accidentally come across paedophilia. Mind you, I don't actually read that much fanfic and my tastes are so basic/vanilla that I expect I'm not getting the full experience. Either way I've been happier since I've carved out my niche there.

The site itself is also just so much easier to deal with when it comes to publishing than ff.net - I hate the doc manager on ff.net so, so much, and ao3 let's me categorise works more easily arrange series and so on. So I've ended up with less than a dozen fics on ff.net but over 100 on ao3, and everything about it has just been better. I definitely see other authors abusing tags and stuff for ao3 so can imagine it being frustrating from a readers pov, but as a writer it's a far easier experience.

#+end_quote

Both. It's also popular with women generally, including some who I'm sure were teen girls obsessed with Harry/Draco 15 years ago. But you'll notice there's also a lot of Hermione/Draco on both sites - it's not just about slash, it's also about people finding more to say about non-canon ships in general. Even if you like Harry/Ginny, you don't need to write the story of them getting together, because that's already in the books.

****** Actually, a lot of it (Araciel's work) is fem!harry rather than slash.

PS: That's because Ginny is a creepy fangirl whose only shared experiences with Harry are Quiddich and being possessed. Harry likes Quiddich, but he kind of hates all the "boy who lived" stuff, and that's what Ginny sees and likes. She (Ginny) even tells him that she knows he won't be happy unless he's doing the thing he basically spent 6 books trying to avoid. He's pissed off, backed into a corner, and stubborn as hell, not "happy".

In general, Ginny need a lot of work to be an interesting partner, and it was already poorly done by the author. Why do it again?

I have been reading and writing fabrics for a long time and even if I have never received death threats or insults I know too well that some people can't have nice things. That's why I support the control an author has on Ao3 on the comments section. Yes, some people is going to abuse it to erase any kind of criticism, even the helpful one. But most people will use it and need it, to deal with hateful people that thinks is funny/right to personally attack an author that didn't owned you sh*t on the first place.

** I don't know this author so cannot speak about them, however from experience, I have found some authors can be a little too touchy about any little criticism. I used to read this one author's work and really enjoyed them, and left the author reviews saying so. One day, I was reading a work by another author, who unknown to me, was the same author using a different pen name. In this story, about half way through, she started doing a McGonnagal/Snape romance out of left field. I left her a review saying why that pairing didn't feel right as there was nothing leading up to it. She responded that it was her story to do as she wish and I could just bugger off. She then proceeded to permanently block me from ever reviewing any of her stories again, under either pen name.

*** Please just remember that authors write fanfictions in their own time for free with no profit made from it. Their main reasons for writing these stories are to provide enjoyment for others and in return receive enjoyment for those that review back.

I understand where you are coming from with the constructive criticism you tried to give to the author, but at the same time, please remember that people may interpret the wording of your review differently and every author will have a different reaction to it. Also fanfiction is global, the language you might use for your region may be deemed as acceptable but may be considered rude or offensive to others.

Happy to debate this with over you :)

**** I guess I have been lucky with my own couple of one shots. While admittedly poor, I never received any harsh or rude criticism. The criticism I did receive, was constructive to help me in future stories, which I took for what it was.

Usually when I send constructive criticism, I try to keep it mostly positive, such as I did in this story, I will start out with things I like about the story, then the constructive criticism portion, and end with more positive feedback. Unfortunately, in this case, the author ignored the positive portions, and only seemed to see the critical parts.

I disagree with authors that will not accept criticism, though will not get into an argument over it. If they are going to post on a site like FFN or A03, then they should be prepared to accept some positive criticism. If the reviewer is being rude, then by all means, block them. If they do not want to accept criticism, create a private Facebook group to post your stories to, so the author gets to vet who reads their stories and and review them.

As for the language thing, I do agree with you. I have read a number of stories by authors who's first language is not English, so do make allowances for that, such as authors that keep saying, yesterday night, rather than last night.

Nevertheless, if you do not enjoy where the fic is going, it is your right to tell the author so. Without resorting to insults or the like, with constructive arguments, with patience. If the fic is undergoing a severe case of "it's becoming worse chapters after chapters", then the readers need to tell the author, wether or not he's doing it for fun. That's why criticism exists. To help an artist become greater.

As far as I know, the author never said whether they care if people share downloaded files. I guess you could try to check with them using their AO3 account. It's only the FFN one that was deleted. It's possible they plan to post all of their fics on AO3 eventually.
