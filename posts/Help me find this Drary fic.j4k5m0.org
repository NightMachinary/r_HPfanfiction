:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Draco invents a potion that shows the taker who their soul mate is. I know he grows a lot of his ingredients himself, but the main one is a diamond from a wedding ring of a successful marriage.

Harry is an auror who is investigating Draco to make sure the potion is legit. There's also some kind of child care happening in the sanctuary where the ingredients are grown. Teddy is there, but Harry apparently doesn't see him often.

Help me find it!
