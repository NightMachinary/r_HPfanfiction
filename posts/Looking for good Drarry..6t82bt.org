I usually don't read slash but am requesting good written Drarry stories. Believable an non graphic sex scenes. Preferably keeping with some of the original plot, at least with Voldemort being the villain.


** For a light and humorous intro to Drarry, try "Draco the Cowardly Lion" by Lomonaaeren, a oneshot where Draco's sorted into Gryffindor. No sex scenes in this fic. The author does a ton of Drarry, most of which is top Draco. So if you like how this fic was written, it'll be easy to find a bunch more with this pairing, from light to dark, humorous to angsty.

The story that convinced me that this pairing could work is "Temptation on the Warfront" by alizarincrimson. It's also one of my fav fanfics. Draco joins the horcrux hunt. Follows canon fairly closely with some good and very touching divergences. One sex scene, but I don't remember it as being too graphic. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594/chapters/9926705]]

And, like the other poster said, check out the [[/r/HPslashfic]] subreddit. You'll find a number of Drarry threads on there already.
