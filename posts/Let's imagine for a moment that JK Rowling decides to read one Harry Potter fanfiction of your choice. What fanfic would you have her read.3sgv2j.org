Oh boy, so many possibilities. My first thought is to show her one of the most messed up smut fics I can find and watch her eyes widen in horror. Or maybe find a fic that contains as many bad tropes as possible. Or maybe a BellatrixXHermione fic, because most people would not take you seriously if you said that could happen and be believable.

***** This is interesting, but I have mixed feelings about a few sections. Your conclusions RE: the Nature of Magic seem like an attempt to place mundane physical laws, magical effects, and magical laws into some sort of hierarchy. I think you're giving JKR too much credit here. She operates throughout the series without even the most basic understanding of maths. So far as I can tell, there's no reason to assume she has an understanding of physics. (And thank God. HPMoR is a mess.)

I see the magic in the series purely in terms of its literary functions. Need a way for physically diminutive wizard children to knock out an enormous club-wielding troll? Introduce a levitation charm earlier in the day. Time to have a flashback showcasing how the father of your Dark Lord baby was ensnared? Better have a present day side-plot involving Amortentia so the reader is better able to understand its effects. Despite the Chest Monsters, JKR is a very capable writer and I think that almost every spell was drafted in such a way that it would be the right spell to use at the right time to further her plot. I don't see any evidence that she codified the precepts of magic in the same way that you have here.

I understand that this is merely a headcanon document and you aren't attempting to subvert canon in any way. It still feels a bit like trying to use numerology to understand an ancient religious text. Regardless, I can tell that you put an enormous amount of thought into this and it was an absolutely fascinating read. Thanks very much for sharing it.

****** I largely agree with you about the way JKR things about things (indeed, that's largely why I'd like her to read this doc!). However, I take something of an "author is dead" approach when it comes to headcanon. I imagine myself in-universe and try to see regularities. The facts of that universe are determined by JKR, but the intent behind those facts becomes secondary.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

You know, that might actually work :-) /Time Heals All Wounds/ is one hell of a fic.

** The sacrificial arc, Methods of Rationality and Nightmares of Future past would be my pick ...

This makes me think of copyrights... I would love that she started a collection of JK Rowling presents "parallel Potters series" where she would allow the best fan fictions out there to be released for profit and let the creators that worked hard on writing good quality books based on her work make money out their work base on her franchise.

After all what makes a story original? Not just the characters surely sure she created a rich universe that these other writers used to create their revisited stories but they are vastly different stories.

If they changed names and other details you would still be able to recognise the inspiration material so there is no point dancing around the legal terms...
