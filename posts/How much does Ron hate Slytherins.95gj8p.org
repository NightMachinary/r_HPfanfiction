** Ron and his family don't hate the Slytherins at all. In the books it was Hagrid who said all dark wizards are Slytherins not Ron.

Ron does dislike Malfoy for obvious reasons and he would probably not trust a random Slytherin immediately, but Ron hating Slytherin is pure fanon. In the books Harry is shown more biased against them than Ron.

Edit: There is one line i recall where Ron speaks of being sorted into Slytherin the same way Draco spoke of being sorted into Huffelpuff at the clothing store. Another line in the second book, after he finds out that Salazar Slytherin started the pureblood supremacy thing. Thats mostly it i think.

  "What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry. "Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin." "That's the house Vol---, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?" "Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.

  “I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn't be in his House if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back home. . . .”

edit2: There is not a single mention of "Slimy Slytherin" in canon.

There is one mention of Stinking Slytherin and thats something Harry says.

  “You're worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.”
#+end_quote

The stinking part is about Slytherin. Having gone thru all mentions of Slytherin, i must say that Slytherins are totally arseholes to him tho, so Harry kind of has a point.

Funnily enough Harry doesen't think Slytherins are out to get him because they are evil. In GoF he mentions that Slytherins are arseholes to him because he keeps beating them in quidditch :P. Still he still disses Slyths more than Ron does, but that just shows that Ron hating Slytherins is pure fanon.

** In the books, Ron isn't exactly prejudice against Slytherins so much as his hatred for Malfoy is probably the greatest out of all of the three. This kind of makes people think he hates Slytherin in general. The movies also *butcher his character.

** Not much. Its important to point out that when this trope comes up, its usually when the author has an axe to grind so they make Ron look horrible/bash him. Same thing with Hermione being a stuck-up know-it-all.

The thing is, these plot devices are usually written from what I've seen as a way of occupying space in an otherwise vacuous plot till X point where the main conflict occurs. Again, same for manipulative!Dumbledore. None of these things are accurate, but they can be turned to suit an author's particular biases or story idea quite easily

To paraphrase someone else, our contempt for others only demonstrates how narrow our own views are.

** Ron's pretty much indifferent to all of them besides Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who he goes out of his way to avoid. There was a part in the Half Blood Prince when they're walking by the room of requirements and the little Slytherin girl (either Crabbe or Goyle under the influence of polyjuice potion) drops and breaks her scales, which Hermione fixes and Ron makes no comment about besides, "I swear they're getting smaller."

I think a big reason for the fanon belief of Ron hating Slytherins is because he hates all of the Slytherins he has to interact with. Aside from the aforementioned, there's Pansy and Millicent, who bully Hermione; Snape, who bullies non-Slytherin children; Voldemort, who is Voldemort; Bellatrix; and so on. Has Ron ever met Andromeda? If not, I don't think he's ever had a positive interaction with a Slytherin.

** No more than the Slytherins / Malfoys hate him (and Harry, for that matter). I find it a bit weird when a fic decides to overcome one established rivalry, but not the other.

** In general, Ron has no belief in Slytherin - he does not believe cooperation is possible in Order of the Phoenix. This is, of course, after four years of Slytherins constantly picking on him and his friends while spouting racist remarks.

I don't think Ron would have said one word to a Slytherin if Malfoy would have left them the hell alone (except for the Chamber Polyjuice thing).
