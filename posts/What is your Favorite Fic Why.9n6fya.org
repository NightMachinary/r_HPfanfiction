I suppose I'll start it off with mine. "A Black Comedy" linkffn(3401052) by nonjon is probably my favourite fic of all time mostly because it was one of the first fics I read through and finished. The story was lighthearted and fun, but it also had likable characters and all around the fic is funny. *Please don't bash each other's choices. You wouldn't like it if others did it to you. Please link to the stories as well!*


** Since “Seventh Horcrux” has been picked, I'm going with my second top favorite [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). I love it because:

- A Dark Trio who kept their canon characterizations
- Trio relationship and interaction
- Revolutionary theme, and overthrow of that incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot
- The melancholic tone
- Great characterizations of George, Neville, Susan, and Flitwick
- Compelling plot

** The One He Feared by taure linkffn(9778984) and the Lesser Sadness by Newcomb linkffn(10959046), they are unfortunately both incomplete but they are great at describing magic and its use particularly in battle. I also really like The Sum of their Parts by holdmybeer linkffn(11858167), because I always thought that it gives us a better post war than canon does.

** Well, as is traditional, it's linkffn(Seventh Horcrux). Even after multiple rereads, it still holds up as hilarious, brilliantly written and very clever.

A close second is the most interesting fic I've ever read, linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus). It's unique in so many ways, I love the descriptions and characters, and it's just very entertaining, as are all the various side fics and spin offs.

Also, I think this community is one of the more chilled out ones. I don't think you'll see much bashing of others choices. Well, maybe if HPMOR or robst comes up somewhere here, but oh well.

**** It's a comedy with crack. It does rely on a specific type of humour though so it may just not work for you specifically.

I like it because I find the writing style completely hilarious. Everything is filtered through an unreliable insane narrator who constantly comes to the wrong conclusions while making fun of various Harry Potter tropes and cliches. It is also extremely quotable and feel good type of story.

  Ah, Severus, my most loyal servant. It was good to see that, even a decade after my disappearance, he continued to attack my enemies. I suspected this would negatively impact my Potions grade, since I currently was one of my enemies. Nevertheless, his devotion was admirable.

  Dumbledore was a far greater dark lord than I could ever hope to be. He was fifty steps ahead of everyone else, so far ahead that -- by the time his plans came to fruition -- everyone involved had already died. My only hope was to throw him off balance by planning no steps ahead.

** Definitely Basilisk-born by Ebenbild

It's always my favourite. Different take on Time Travel, Travels around the World, Cohesive World Building. If youre unfamiliar with it, It's takes place right at Dementor attack before Fifth year. Harry is thrown back in time ( not his first year or back when his parents went to school) Centuries ago I think around 700-900BC. He learns from Merlin, and meets other well known wizarding family's during his life (Ollivandars, Flamel, McGonagall, Gaunt, Malfoire/Malfoy, Black), he meets the Founders, King Arthur, Morgana, Lots of Goblin. It switches between past and present every so often to see how this changed Harry is fitting into to Hogwarts and how his whole plan is finally coming into place. How his friends And teachers react to this new Harry.

I really enjoy this fanfic because it's different from all the others. There isn't a worry to change the timeline, Names and Languages are changed as times move forward to reflect that. There is a lot of Magical Creature-lore. Goblins are written great, not the usual greedy-dont care about wizards-or bend over backwards to help type we see. Every piece of information written has a place in the plot that may not even be revealed till chapters later.

The writing is good, the premise is clever (Hermione gets ahold of Riddle's diary in Y2), and the characterization in particular is intriguing - Hermione gets a lot of depth and Riddle manages to be both fascinating and still murderously unhinged.
