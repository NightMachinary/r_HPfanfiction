*** Clarkson: This... is a Firebolt. THE fastest racing broom in the world and the most stunning piece of wizarding engineering ever created. James - what on earth is that?!

May: This... Is a 1987 Ford Anglia. Now I know what you are thinking, Captain Slow is here with a relic from a bygone era, it's top speed is a magnificent 63MPH in a southerly direction. But this car is special! It learnt to drive itself long before the rest of the Muggle cars. And it can FLY.

Clarkson: ....are those pincer marks on the hood? And what are those 8 legs in the back seat?

May: nevermind that! Wait what was that sound?? Oh he hasn't... Tell me he hasn't..

Some say, that his nipples are in fact explosive.
