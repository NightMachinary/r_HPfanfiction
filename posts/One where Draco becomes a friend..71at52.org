Can anyone please direct me to a fic where Harry becomes friend with Draco in secret, others not knowing and they become angry with him when they find out. And, please it should be a HHr one. Is there any fic like this? Well, if not, then any fic where Draco becomes a good friend to Harry. Also HHr.

Thank you, guys.


** Maybe someone else can find it, but Harry goes back down to the chamber and finds some really cool secrets, but everyone else is all "oh no, Slytherin is bad, you should never go down there" so Harry tells the only person he knows that will appreciate it and not tell anyone (cause why would Draco admit to hanging with Harry) they both end up becoming animagi.

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.

** linkffn(Snakes-and-Lions by gatewaygirl)

Only good one that comes to mind. It's a 6th year AU with a few OttP facts altered (Arthur died instead of Sirius).

It's H/D friendship with (very) light slash towards the end. Hermione plays a heavy-ish role, despite not being part of the pairing.

There's also a sequel in the author's insanejournal page called [[http://gatewaygirl.insanejournal.com/?skip=20&tag=teamwork][Teamwork]] <- Scroll to the bottom of the page for the first chapter. Features slash a lot more heavily.

I admittedly hate Draco as a character, but GatewayGirl has taken the pieces and assembled them in what can only be described as a fun character. He's still an arrogant, cowardly little pissant (at least at start), but he's also witty, fun-loving, and brimming with an undercurrent of teenage rebellion.

Harry is also a lot more nuanced than usual. A little more rebelious, a little slower to trust, a little less forgiving. Small touches that turn wizard!Jesus into an actually interesting protagonist.

And after writing the above, I have to conclude that characterization is the shinging beacon of both stories, even though the plot and pacing are also quite good. Every character, no matter if they have 100 or 20 lines feel distinctive. If you've ever got the feeling that you're reading a list of things the characters do while reading a story, well, this is the pollar opposite. I actually got the sense that I was a fly on the wall watching these people have conversations and do things. It's a damn rare thing.

*** I read this based on your recommendation, and I really enjoyed it - in fact, I'd have to say that my only frustration was that the story ended when it did.

I agree though that the characterization was AMAZING Seamus alone might have been the best Seamus I've ever read.

**** Glad you enjoyed it! Check out that sequel too, it's equally well written - even if more slashy (I just skimmed through those parts).

I especially enjoyed how Harry and company's social circle expands in the sequel. You've never seen Patil twins, Millicent Bulstrode or other named OCs like these before.

It's almost like the author is a witch herself with the way she breathes life into these characters...

EDIT: I also forgot, Snakes and Lions has [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/gatewaygirl/SALEE.html][a few more chapters]] that are missing from the fanfiction version (the author calls it an extended ending). Read that before Teamwork.
