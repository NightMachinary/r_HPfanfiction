In /Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets/, Ron attempts to curse Malfoy with his then-broken ward, resulting in it backfiring. Ron begins vomiting slugs. It's implied that the spell was intended to make the victim vomit, Hermione even mentions it being a difficult spell.

So, the spell is /intended/ to cause slugs to come out of someone's mouth. Except... wouldn't that then be a Conjuring spell? Those are /definitely/ not second-year material. And it would be Conjuring slugs /inside someone/! What the hell even is this, I don't....

Either Ron is a genius and hides it well, or the magic in this series is just completely bonkers.

** I would rather think that it works in two parts. It forces the target to vomit, and turns said bile and vomit into slugs upon entry to the mouth. Thus "eat slugs". I would label it a hex as it mixes Transfiguration, and Charms.

**** eh, Its just the thought that popped into my mind. The same would apply for the Bat-Bogey Hex. It forces the target to get "bogeys" or a runny nose, then transfigures those boogers into semi-capable bats. I say semi-capable because the "Bats" are still bogeys, and still attached to the nose.

A more interesting conversation in my opinion would be how finite incantanum, stops most hexes/jinxes. Does it "cease the magic of the spell?" if that is true then wouldnt such spells as the Bat-Bogey hex still be uneffected since it isnt just a spell but a physical transfiguration of the targets bodily fluids? Via that line of logic, could you over power the Bat-Bogey Hex or modify it in someway that you turn the victims saliva or worse, their blood into Bats thus killing them?

***** I do like how your explanation worked. Mine was just me being a bit of an ass.

I figure that there are multiple interpretations on how finite incantatem could work. For one interpretation, it would stop active magic. So it depends on whether or not transfiguration requires magic to constantly be keeping a thing transformed, or whether it's a one shot effort thing. In another, it could just undo a spell-based magical effect (ignoring cursed wounds, fatalities and so on), so a transfiguration would/could be reversed.

*** Malfoy used serpensortia intending for it to win him the duel. It was probably the best spell he had at the time. He probably spent extra time learning it (12 year old Slytherin Draco probably thought a spell that conjures a snake was absolutely wicked) and he's not exactly unskilled either.

Likewise, Ginny is also a talented witch and the Bat Bogey hex was considered her specialty, meaning she likely put extra effort into perfecting it.

No /conjuration/ needed. Only transfiguration.

** I have this idea: maybe Vanishing stuff just puts it away somewhere 'Else', and the 'Else'-space has a lot more unwanted slugs and snakes and messes of vomit and excess phlegm, so summoning those sorts of things doesn't require a wizard to create them wholesale; they just pull someone else's unwanted slugs from outside space-time. It's very difficult to conjure a gold coin- because really, who would throw that away? But conjuring up spoiled vegetables- any second year could do that!

Once you understand that, jinxes and hexes make a lot more sense.

Eh. Rowling's consistency isn't perfect. It's a nice attempt to return to the first book's level of 'this is how magic works' which most of the books gloss over.

** I imagine conjuring is mostly considered an upper year spell because takes more magic to create something from nothing as opposed to turning something into something else. So perhaps in this case the caster is not the source of the majority of the power used to conjure the slugs. Perhaps the spell draws on the victim's magic to do the conjuring bit whether or not it might be too demanding since it is a curse after all. It also probably makes it easier by only conjuring one or two slugs at a time over an extended period rather than a whole bucket load at once.
