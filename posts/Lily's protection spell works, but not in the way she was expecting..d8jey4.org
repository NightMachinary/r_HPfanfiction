All harm done unto Harry rebounds back onto the one harming him - both magical and physical. Voldie accidentally imbues his own physical body with the horcrux meant for Harry and stunts his own continued mental development. AK cast at Harry kills the caster. Harry vs. Dementor equals a stand-off. Dudley beats on Harry but Dudley is the one with bruises. (Makes people better believe that Harry is an unstable juvenile delinquent.) Petunia skips feeding her nephew but Petunia is the one who goes hungry, despite eating until she makes herself sick. Vernon locks Harry in an uncomfortable cupboard overnight and, eventually, Vernon and Petunia have to sleep in separate beds because Vernon keeps buying softer, high-end mattresses for himself in the hope of getting a good, ache-free night's sleep. It never works. Cue the lawsuits. Aunt Marge sics her dog on poor Harry? Poor Ripper runs back to her with a bleeding bite on his hind leg. (What a brutish, heartless, inhumane child!) The Dursleys are eager to send Harry away - no matter where - and their longstanding bitterness toward his freakishness is justified when their lives 'magically' get better as soon as he is gone.

Or: any and every magic cast at Harry with intent to harm results in Harry experiencing something pleasant instead. Instead of a dark, evil soul fragment, Harry is imbued with only the most helpful, intelligent, and encouraging traits from the person who cast a horcrux on him. Mr. Riddle is an excelent study guide, tutor, and a great reference for obscure information. Better than Quirrel! Boggarts are a literal joke. AK kills all of Harry's current stress and anxiety and pesimism. (No, Luna - Do Not cast AK to rid normal people of their nargles!) Crucio-- well. Pubescent Potter. 'nuff said. (((Bonus points if dementor exposure or excessive Death Eater AK attacks basically turn Harry into a Panglossian.)))

Or: whatever weird or quirky idea you can think of which fits the title's criteria. =]


** This is in the same sort of vein. The horcrux gives Harry a dark aura that, rather than actually making him dark, makes him a loveable attraction for various dark creatures who just all want to get close to him. Linkffn(No Competition)

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

*** If I'm reading it correctly, it wasn't really the horcrux that made him dark; rather, the blood wards were starving in the absence of a loving magical family, so they drew on wild magic, but for it to be usable, the magic had to come from a magical member of Harry's family - so the wards funnelled all the wild magic through Harry. Which would ordinarily just make a child unusually powerful with a talent for ritual magic, but his existing association with death meant that the result was not neutral but dark.

It's not meant to be taken particularly seriously. Whatever justification works to allow the premise basically

** Every time I see a prompt with "Lily's protection spell works, but..." all I can think of is just giving Harry [[https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Curse][Baldur's Curse]] (from God of War 2018) and seeing what shenanigans would eventually happen because of it.

(For those curious about the curse [taken from the above Wikipedia page]: It is designed to make the victim/recipient invulnerable to any and all injuries no matter how minor or serious, but at the cost of being unable to physically feel anything.)

"Harry Potter is blessed with invulnerability to all threats, physical or magical."

** I think I can make a story on this while also using some other prompt ideas for this story. I read another interesting prompt that Lilly Potter had a darker side to her not talked about by which she dabbled with blood magic and that was what made the curse rebound. There was another more funny prompt that made Harry more oblivious and less heroic by which he ignored all the mysteries that happened every school year, but somehow each of the situations worked themselves out without him and his friend's help. Although this annoyed Dumbledore who orchestrated much of said mysteries to test Harry.

So:

- A version of Lilly Potter that dabbled with blood magic which is a form of ancient magic that was considered dark and fazed out.

- An oblivious Harry that for the most part stayed out of trouble and didn't go snooping around to solve all the mysteries happening every year.

- A manipulative (It was All For the Greater Good) Dumbledore whose plans surrounding Harry failed nearly all the time.
