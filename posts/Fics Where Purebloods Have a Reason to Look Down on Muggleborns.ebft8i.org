I've seen it a few times and it is inherently interesting when Purebloods (particularly older families) have some tangible reasoning as to why they think they are above muggleborns.

E.g: extra magical abilities, knowledge etc.

Please and thanks x

[EDIT] Thanks guys!


** Fics that come to mind are:

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived): as espoused by Calypso, muggleborns seemingly rarely if ever develop extra-ordinary magical talents (it happens, but they are an exception and not the rule).
- linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): because of the noticeable imbalance of wizards to witches, purebloods (particularly witches as its a distinctly matriarchal society) have every desire to make sure muggleborn witches are less able to take away the few magical males from them. I'm not advocating it, but I do at least understand the logic from their point-of-view.

There are also plenty of fics that depict things like family magic, natural talents being related to specific lineage, and of course the real-world parallel of the idea that an invasive outside culture seeks to alter the wizarding world as it sees fit (this is something that appears to occur basically in every human society, just with a different target and degree). All of which are offered up as reasons for why muggleborns are discriminated against.

** Oh crap. I know of one but forgot the name of it.

Harry lives past the war, then gets assassinated. He meets Dobby at the all white 9 3/4s, and gets sent to a world where Harry Potter died, but he ends up in the past and is 10 again. Ends up freeing Sirius by impersonating his son (who doesn't exist), and getting him a trial. Gets blood adopted by Sirius and a bit of DNA from his now dead fiancee.

After all that, he's told that Muggleborns Magic is considered "Wild" and won't have talents. Harry ends up having a talent as an Assessor, also ends up in Slytherin.

Strange fic that's still getting sporadic updates. Annnd I still can't remember the name of it. Hoping this will get recognized by someone.

Yes! That was it!

*A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story*

By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1121841/cosette-aimee][cosette-aimee]]

The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] Pureblood families have hereditary magical traits and family rituals related to comuning with their magical ancestors on certain days. The latter books in the series (four and five) go deeper into that aspect of worldbuilding. The first book is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12608820/chapters/28722276][Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes]]. linkao3(12608820)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] has some of the most unique (and strange) worldbuilding I've seen in this fandom. In that fic Purebloods have a method of directly absorbing knowledge from old tomes without having to actually read them. 'Dark Magic' is powerful instinctual magic that can only be done by thinking in a sort-of pre-enlightenment unscientific way. Such methods are still preserved by some Pureblood families but are derided by modern-minded wizards. linkffn(10629488)

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** I can't think of the fic's name, but it's mainly about how muggleborn charge into the world, don't learn anything about the culture and start tearing things apart. It goes on to show that the purebloods weren't that mad about James/Lily because she actually went and learned the history/traditions.

â€‹

Then, there's stories like Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!, linkffn(3695087) where it's all about family magic and muggleborns almost never bring anything magic related (spells/books/etc) into the marriage. At one point Hermione did her jinxed contract bit and impressed the hell out of Narcissa Malfoy and congratulated him for getting himself a "proper pureblood marriage". Sure, it's a parody/crack fic, but the family magics part is a pretty neat story mechanic and I'd like to see more fics with stuff like this involved.

** I'm just reading one where Salazar slytherin defends his views at one point on why pure bloods should stay separate from muggle borns.

Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament. It's excellent for many other reasons as well.
