#+begin_quote
  I don't know what's worse, fanfic that is well written, free of grammatical issues, but utterly lacking in imagination and solutions to canon events, or fics with interesting ideas that are strangled by crappy grammar and poor structure and expression of ideas.
#+end_quote

Well said.

The whole point of a time-travel fic (for me) is to derail canon in dramatic or comical ways. But there was a phase when people wrote "Characters read the HP books" fanfics, so there must be some appeal to having characters react to canon events.

*** Hadrian is just a shitty name in general, especially where it concerns the Potters. To me, if you really want a “Harry is short for...” thing, do Hardwin. Why? Well, 1) It is a nice name imho, and 2) It is the name of an actual ancestor of Harry. So it makes more sense.

Also, Hadrian comes from Adrian, which means “dark”, and I doubt Harry's parents would want that kind of connotation to their son in wizarding society.

  Additionally it reads very awkward when you have to switch to past tense to explain story elements that actually happened in the past.
#+end_quote

That sounds a bit arbitrary. In past tense you have to switch to past perfect for things that happened in the past.

To me a well written present tense story has the advantage of being very immersive. It feels more like watching a movie when the author is good at showing instead of telling. Just very visceral and immediate.

***** The problem I tend to see with present tense is tense confusion. It'll randomly go to past tense for a sentence or 2 and then it's present tense the rest of the time. Story readability tends to be inversely proportional to tense confusion, especially since tense confusion is usually accompanied by other grammar issues.

** When people start jerking off the main character every other sentence.

Every time there is even the slightest obstacle he rolls right over it without actually doing anything and then everyone stares at him with stars in their eyes gasping and gossiping about how amazing and strong and sexy and powerful this fucking 11 year old is. I don't mind Harry winning, but it should be /some/ sort of challenge or else the story becomes incredibly tedious.

The only time anyone should ever remark on how cool and powerful the main character is is at the end of a long arc of clear struggle wherein they actually accomplish something that is /genuinely difficult/ to do. Becoming Hogwarts Champion (seriously wtf) /just because/ screams lazy writing; if one person can do it and no one else /ever/ has, what makes them so special?

** Canon rehashes are fine, but I don't see the point in writing those if you're gonna keep everything the same. I recently read a story where Snape gets deaged when Harry joins school and he's supposed to befriend and protect him. I gave up after a few chapters because literally everything is the same. Harry is in Slytherin but it makes no material difference to the story. Harry, Snape and Hermione become best friends, Ron and Draco get bashed, but the story otherwise proceeds as canon. I really liked the premise but what's the point. Might as well read the books.

** If the characters get too OOC I jump ship. THat's the first thing I do, then of course poorly written with grammar, spelling and formatting mistakes, my god it's bad.

I have a weird tendency to jump ship plot wise if a characters relationship makes no sense. Mainly if you take two characters that abhor each other, with the ENTIRE GOAL OF YOUR FIC to be to make them into friends/lovers/mentors/familial after a while, it REALLY annoys me so much so that I leave and will never read a fic of that authors again if they undo everything. For example if you build up a positive relationship between draco and harry or Pansy and hermione, etc you get the point, and I've seen authors over-time do that and do it well. They finally get it to the point of them being in whatever sort of relationship the story was ACTUALLY MEANT TO BE, then the author suddenly without reason reverses the entire thing and makes them bitter enemies again. Sometimes without a single reason, sometimes with a stupid reason that makes no sense. Bonus points if they end up killing each other or some stupid shit. Like why bother writing this fucking shit besides to waste everyones time. my god this enrages me. I can understand if it's a LEGIT argument, as every couple/friend/etc has them, but when you're making it like 'i could no longer take pansy stealing the green beans off my dinner plate, so I reached over and punched her in the face and avada kedavra'd her in the middle of the hall and everyone froze for a second before applauding and i was given an order of merlin first class for being a little cunt' I am like why

They are trying to write a tragedy but they don't understand how tragedies work. Instead of a fatal character flaw that leads to their doom the two characters are awesome together and perfect in every way, but then get ripped apart by author fiat. Then you exclaim "Oh that's so tragic", therefore tragedy!

Now that I think about it, it's kinda ironic: There's lots of fanfics with indie!grey!Harry characters with fatal character flaws (like Anakin Skywalker who end ups dooming himself and everyone he cares for), but they almost never end in a proper tragedy. So kinda the opposite problem there.

** •Stupid manipulative Dumbledore. I think it's important to talk about the weird and morally uncomfortable decisions that Dumbledore made. Unfortunately, the way that most fics approach this conversation is so off-putting that I generally avoid it all together.

Dumbledore is a complex character who makes a lot of mistakes, but he's also smart (or at least tries to be) and if you're going to write manipulative Dumbledore then have his manipulations be more clever and interesting than Dumbledore doing something shitty out of the blue and then muttering about the greater good while sucking sullenly on a lemon drop.

• Slytherins being depicted as profoundly different than anybody else because their cunning grants them unique abilities of forethought even as teenagers. Like, when Snape was a teenager he was rash enough to confront a suspected werewolf on the full moon, in the forest filled with dangerous creatures, next to a demon tree, based on information he got from a known antagonist.

• Snape suddenly becoming the champion of abused students. Snape is an unrepentant asshole who bullies and belittles children based off of whimsy and personal grudge. Snape literally verbally abuses students on a daily basis, he's not going to be first choice for talking about a difficult home life.

•Redemption fics where the given character (usually Draco or Snape) either suddenly becomes a good person spontaneously or the past is altered so they were a good person all along (so all of their actions are justified).

Nobody drastically alters their actions or belief system without a catalyst. If you have a story centred around redemption you have to at least attempt to address the questions involved in that discussion. (Is redemption possible? What does it mean to be forgiven? How much does it really matter whether it's your fault or not?)

** I just typed this out in another thread and found it surprisingly relevent here too:

There was one I got most of the way through when I first discovered the realm of fanfiction (and BDSM) that was SS/HG, with Snape being a seasoned dominant who'd trained many submissives, and Hermione wanted to become a/his sub. It was good at the beginning, she was a bit of a brat and there was some hot-and-cold style angst as there tends to be in smut, but the further I got into it, the more times he would do something impulsive or stupid and apologize and plead "I've made so many mistakes with you," all while practicing horrible BDSM etiquette that took me right out of the story. Eventually though, the turning away point for me was when they decided to take it from in the bedroom to adopting it as their lifestyle, which led to him telling her what she could and couldn't do to help Harry and Ron find horcruxes, dictating whether or not she could even talk to them... By the time I gave up, she'd entirely lost any semblance of being Hermione because she wasn't allowed to be. I'm sure it was supposed to ultimately become a "Hermione rises up: We can be equals even if we're dom/sub, so let me do what I want sometimes" sort of exchange but I was tired of waiting for that part of the story.

An additional 'get out of here' is granted for the realisation to occur within the first few paragraphs, because we urgently need to establish that this story defines itself through the oversimplification of complex characters and the warping of their motives.

Two additional 'get out of here' are granted for: having manipulated him into bumping into the Weasley's at Kings Cross so that they may ensure his continued influence.

Sometimes if I like the idea and it's unique, but the writing isn't great, I will scroll through as well, just to see what happens or if the authors writing improves over time.

Quitting moments happen irregularly and depends on mood or context- most (of which I can remember) are really about pushing the limits so far of what is in the realm of Canon so far that it becomes illogical. i.e. strange focus on werewolf culture with Fenrir as like this weird protective alpha. Strange focus on sex as a deux ex machina (not tongue in cheek). Unexpected cross-overs that take a pivitol point in the story. Poorly executed concepts, characters, descriptions situations... It's all about the suspension of D'Belief.
