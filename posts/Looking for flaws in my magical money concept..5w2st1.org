** I think it looks alright, but you have to specify that the gold they use was the basis and that there was real gold involved. because otherwise it violates the rule that only the philosophers stone can create gold. I think you should tweak it so that the money doesn't turn into other money but rather switches places with it. just say that there is a switching spell on the money and people wont be annoyed. maybe you could also add a one way version for muggle money because if you can do this to your own money i see no reason not to expand this if it stops people from bothering goblins for exchanging money

**** yes, but does it start out as one coin or three that are somehow merged, and enchanted so only one can take up space at a time?. because if it starts out as one coin it would conflict with canon that gold and probably other noble metals cant simple be created. ( with the exception for gold with the philosophers stone) If you say all coins were forged your fine

**** Ok, but then, what happens when some of the sickles or knuts get mixed up? I mean, if you break up a galleon and spend a few of those sickles, then those sickles aren't actually part of that galleon anymore.

I suppose you could say that a sickle is 1/17 a galleon, but can become any part of a galleon. I don't see why you couldn't transfigure the /shape/ of gold, so long as it retains the same amount of gold. Alchemists did work with gold, and the inability to create gold is something which comes from alchemy, so it makes sense in that way.

I also feel the need to point out that Rowling once said on Pottermore that these sorts of calculations can be done magically. She doesn't say how, of course. It could be anywhere from some kind of innate magical ability to charmed wax tablets. Though, like 50% of Rowling's post-series additions, you can probably safely ignore it.

They don't remember what galleon they're part of. A knut's existence is 1/493rd of a potential galleon, but it could join with any galleon. Just like an oxygen atom could join with any two hydrogen atoms to form a water molecule, and it could split and reform with other hydrogen atoms.

** I like the idea. Frankly, having gold, silver and bronze coins was already pretty dope in the HP universe. But adding a bit of magic like this gives it another level of it "being magical".

As someone already pointed out, the problem would be that a determined wizard could drown Diagon Alley in Knuts by converting a year salary worth of galleons. Which would be pretty funny.

Not that hard to do (Crabbe / Goyle could do it) and the a huge room collapsed horribly. A first year can levitate a huge club. We know from the Fantastic Beasts movie that adult wizards have no problem moving tons of bricks and steel beams around.

Look at the Gemio-Protection in DH in the Lestrange vault. Throw one of the enchanted cups in the crowd during a Lockhard-booksigning.

Wizards could do dangerous shit if they wanted to.

** Perhaps have so there is a limit that can be turned into other types at once. For example you can turn your galleon into 29x17=493, but there is a max where it would be too much, then you would perhaps have a bag that would change it to other (have it linked to the goblins? or just magic)

You could also make your own money and perhaps make it very low weight. You could have so the coins are a simple 10 to 10. So 1 Galleon = 10 Sickles, 1 Sickle = 10 knuts (and so 1 galleon = 10x10 = 100 knuts).\\
Then maybe they form a square (or have it a square, but rounded). like\\
@ @ @\\
@ @ @\\
@ @ @\\
Then in the center have one on top, so it's like pushing outwards, or you could have so the extra one is the edges.\\
Then the wizard (or other magical creature, because house elves would probably have to use it too) and they will it turn into x.\\
Wizard has 2 Galleons\\
Wizard wills it to Knuts, it breaks apart and then breaks apart again, and becomes 200 knuts.\\
Wizard wills it to Sickles, it breaks apart and becomes 20 sickles.\\
Wizard has 190 Knuts\\
Wizard wills it to Galleons, it combines, and combines again, and becomes 1 Galleon and 90 Knuts, or 1 Galleon and 9 Sickles. (Or any other combination, based on will.)\\
Wizard wills it to Sickles, it combines, and there is now 19 sickles.

** Eh, I would suggest something along the lines of symbolic magic. Basically, the goblins own and hold all currency in their bank. This is the master currency. What they give out, are magical constructs linked to the currency to literally reflect it, similar to how the gold standard worked with paper money. The construct looks and feels like a galleon, but is able to divide into smaller constructs as sickles and Knut's, which then reflect the sickles and Knut's in Gringotts. The constructs have loads of anti-theft charms, and cannot be duplicated because you aren't duplicating the real gold as it is in Gringotts. There is a fixed amount of real currency, and this method prevents Muggleborns from melting them down and breaking the economy. You can figure out the fiddly details on your own.
