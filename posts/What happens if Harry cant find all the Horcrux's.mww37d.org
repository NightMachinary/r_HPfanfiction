What happens if the Horcrux's were already destroyed or hidden exceptionally well. How would Harry react, would he still go to fight voldemort. For example Regulus destroys the locket before his death and Kreacher never knew what Regulus had done. Or the cup wasn't hidden in the Lestrange gringots vault, instead was hidden in a secret family tomb. One protected by Fidelus charm.

If anyone has any fics that follow this premise, I'd love to read them.


** He will have to deal with Voldemort in other, harder ways like capturing him ,because simply killing him will just lead to him becoming a spirit and doing the ritual to gain another body, and:

Casting an extremly powerful memory charm that will erase every single moment of his life

Fully binding his magic in the tightest bindings(fanon)

Torturing him into a vegetative state like what happened to the Longbottoms

Cutting of all his arms and legs to prevent himm form using a wand with this body

giving him the Kiss to get rid of the soul fragment in this body

Taking that mutilated, souless body and chucking it in the highest security Azkaban cell for a couple of decades to make sure that he won't regain his mental faculties.

*** There's also the canon solution: expand the scope of your mother's sacrifice so that Voldemort literally cannot hurt anyone anymore thanks to #PowerofLove.

Even if Voldemort eventually learns to understand the #PowerofLove, that's another way of winning I suppose.

  Renamed from 'The Big Box of Silliness', due to complaints that not all the stories were silly. Of course most of them aren't Thrilling either, but you've got to admit, they are Unusual...

*** Wow. That was basically the same premise but with the sides flips as the fic where Voldemort finds out Harry is a horcrux. I enjoyed this too, just noting the similarity.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
