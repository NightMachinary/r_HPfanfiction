Tom Marvolo Riddle had, by now, lost all ability to speak, or even form a coherent thought - such things tend to happen if one goes a full week without being able to sleep.

Had his followers been attentive in reading about the ritual that would resurrect their master, they'd have known that any potions going through the "blood of the enemy" would have their effect amplified and made permanent in the resurrected - and Pettigrew could easily have known that Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, was taking a strict potions regiment to treat his narcolepsy.


** there a are several fics that have a harry having a addiction ( not really, cant remember the word, addiction but not) i remember, reliance on the potion, but that is usually because he is overworked and spends his sleeping time studying or making potions :/

*** Hence why this is a Prompt and not a Request, haha. I'm not expecting a fic to exist that fulfills what I posted, so I'm making it the honor-bound duty of the community to /make/ it exist.

** (/warning: horror and gore/)

The first three days were the worst. He bumped into things. His thoughts were scattered. Dark Lord became progressively more irritated, then frustratted and of course, spell happy. He Crucio'ed his Followers for being too late, being too early, simply being in the same room, breathing too loud, daring to speak... And if he has to suffer then so have they.

The Death Eaters started to keep a schedule to keep him company, otherwise they wouldn't be able to rest at all.

Then came the hallucinations. Their Lord was screaming at wizards long dead. He was cursing, using the foulest dark magic, on enemies that were long gone and turned to dust. In the first few episodes many a servant were hit by malignant spell. Pettigrew turned into grime and soot - at least that what they through at first, until they discovered many very small spiders, scurrying in terror. Mulciber was hit with a curse that left him no more than pitiful mass of organs and limbs, that occasionally whimpered in pain yet refused to die. After few more casualtied, Death Eaters, horrified and almost out of their minds with fear, got better at predicting the moods and tantrums. Many fled. Voldemort raged while his most faithful scurried around invisible, soundless and odorless, trying to shield the place from the Ministry.

After that came the fright. Voldemort kept his eyes closed, his ears fidden under hands that trembled so bad he could barely use wand at all. He was hissing to himself and, sometimes, to the corpse of Nagini, who faithfully remained with her wizard to the bitter end.

Then the being formerly known as Lord Voldemort quieted. Calmed (if that scary void in his bloodshot eyes can be called calm). It started rocking rhythmically, then sat motionless. /Maybe it's for the best/, through remaining Death Eaters. /Maybe we could go about doing this - saving our traditions - the legal way after all./

***** Ah. Yeah, that'll do it - especially if the teacher decides to get graphic about certain experiments that took place at that time.
