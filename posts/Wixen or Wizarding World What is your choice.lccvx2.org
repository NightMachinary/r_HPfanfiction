** Magical World.

It means the same thing, is non-gendered or species specific, and is far less likely to make readers think "ugh, this person is trying too hard."

** Wizarding world. Or magical world of you want to be gender neutral.

Unless it's a next gen setting I'd strongly recommend against using much modern or "woke" language. The canon magical world is not meant to be a very progressive place, and there's little cultural exchange with the muggle world.

** Another reason not to use Wixen: The german slang word "wichsen" is pronounced exactly the same and it means masturbating. The word originally refers to waxy shoe polish and similar substances, but it's turned into an euphemism for semen. As a native German speaker it's a bit weird to read about someone call themselves part of the jacking off world.

** I've never understood wixen. I'm non-binary myself and it feels weird to me. I like wizarding world, but I've been known to use magical world or magicals, instead of wizards or witches, in order to avoid using a gendered term. Depends on my mood and the fic really.

**** That plays a part in it as well. I've actually confused at least one reader by having Harry think of Kreacher as a man rather than an elf at times. He may be an elf but he's also an old man and I think Harry would think of him that way since he didn't grow up in the magical world. But that may just be me.

** It's Wizarding. Like mankind, it's not sexist just a shorter way of saying human or in this case wizard/witch world. And the term was coined by jk Rowling a woman so I dunno why wizarding would be incorrect. Also it's a verb for doing wizarding stuff magic and all that. Wixen also sounds like wanking I'm German, I was another reply saying this but yeah made me laugh.

**** The sentiment behind it is good and respectful. But the term hasn't had much recognition. It's the first time I've come across it. If you're establishing it, well and good, go for it. You'll face resistance but then again, it's your world that you're developing so don't pay too much attention to it. If you want wixen, go for wixen.

Although the comment below is one I agree with as well. Magicals and magical world is equally viable as an option.

And sometimes, being "woke" isn't welcome by many. One instance is when Trudeau corrected someone for saying man-kind and changed it people-kind. It's not always necessary or welcome.

***** This term isn't coined by me. For instance, read "A Place Apart" by metalduck, I think it is. Now I'm reading another fic that uses this term (Phoenix Rising), which can be found on ao3. So thats why I wondered about the term and if we should include it in the fandom or not. Its kinda new, thats true, but it doesn't have to be bad per se.

** I tend to call it the Magical World instead.

Wizarding seems a bit weird when you have Goblins and other sentient creatures running around. Plus, since wizard and witch are used a bit like man and woman, it seems about as silly as calling the Muggle World the Man World instead. Manning World? Whatever, it sounds stupid either way.

I do like Wixen as well. It sounds just magical enough. You can just put a short explanation in the author's notes to prevent confusion. Or better yet manage to include it in the story itself.

*** In my view, it's a bit like calling Earth the human world/cradle of humanity. There are around 8.7 million of species on Earth besides humans, but humans are the dominant one.

Similarly, there are goblins, centaurs, dragons... But the wizards and witches call the shots, so it's called the Wizarding World.

As for Man's World... Well, Amazons in DC call the places outside their island that. Don't see why Wizards couldn't call the lands outside their territory 'muggle world' in respect to the dominant species there - muggles.

**** Oh I didn't mean calling the Muggle World the Muggle World is silly. That makes sense. I only have problems with the Wizarding World, and even then it's not like it irritates me when I read it in a fic. I just use a different term when I write my own.

You do make a good point about the human world. Though in real life humans are the only sentient species, while in the magical world goblins and centaurs are definitely sentient. But I can see where you're coming from.

** *Choice:* Wizarding World

*Reasoning:* It's a native term. The 'wix'/'wixen' is a fanon term from the time when being ultra-super-politically-correct was trending. It feels forced and out of sync with the time, place and culture. Of course, if you were writing about a small coven of muggleborns who decided not to integrate with the wizarding society at large, such a term would be an appopriate way to refer to themselves and other magicals.

** Do you mean "Wixen World" v "Wizarding World" or "Wixen" v "Wizarding World"? The latter is a case of apples to oranges: I've only ever seen "wixen" used as the plural form of "wix," the adjective form of "wix," and/or the the collective term for wixes in general, whereas "Wizarding World" to me not only is comprised of the collective of wixen but also magical beings, magical fauna and flora, magical infrastructure and institutions, &c. On the other hand, the former is a case of apples to apples, and I heavily prefer "Wixen World" to "Wizarding World." I've been an immediate fan of the terms "wix" and "wixen" ever since I found out about them---not only are "wix" and "wixen" far more phonaesthetically pleasing than "wizard" and "wizarding" and "witch" and "witching," but they're also far more inclusive, and on a personal level I really appreciate that. That being said, I generally use and prefer to use "magical world" in favor of both "Wixen World" and "Wizarding World" (and accordingly "magical (being)" in favor of "wix", itself in favor of "wizard or witch", itself in favor of "wizard" or "witch") b/c using both "Wixen" and "Wizarding" to refer to all things magical strikes me as human-centric, as several others have noted.

I do kind of agree w/ [[/u/15_Redstones][u/15_Redstones]] point at least when it comes to the cultural mores of canon---I'd restrict the unironic use of "wix" and "wixen" in pre-Next Gen dialogue to just social justice-minded characters like Hermione, at least if you want a realistic and non-anachronistic treatment of acceptance.

** It also strongly depends on who's talking to who. Wizards talking to other wizards might say "our world", wizards explaining things to muggles might use "the magical world". "Wizarding world" is also canonically common and while some might see it as sexist most probably don't really care, similar to how we might use "manned capsules". It also depends on the characters, women and progressive wizards might be more likely to use "magical world" over "wizarding world". Use the choice of words to reflect the nature of the characters.
