Probably 6 years ago my best friend told me about a fan fiction she read that starts mayber 50 years prior to the series and follows different characters through their years at Hogwarts, like as one is leaving the school it transfers to one that is just starting. Also it may have just been the Weasley family starting with Molly's brothers. My memory of everything she told me about it is kinda fuzzy but it sounded awesome. At the time she couldn't remember the name and I've never been able to find it! I was just thinking about it again and realized I had the power of Reddit to help me now! So if any one has any idea what I'm talking about, help please!


** I hope someone is able to identify this fic, because it sounds awesome.
