I've recently finished reading three stories, all of which I recommend:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9303518/1/Harry-Potter-Whiskey-Accident][Harry Potter: Whiskey Accident]] WIP. Good.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10364683/1/Harry-s-Golden-Nuggets][Harry's Golden Nuggets]] Completed. Very good.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10349675/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lightning-Scar][Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar]] Completed. Good.

I've found the first two to be fairly unique. The last isn't necessarily unique (Super!Harry in one summer), but was still, as I said above, good.

What have you been reading lately?


** Currently working very slowly on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]. I've got a bunch of stuff going on with school and what-not so I haven't been able to read through it all that quickly.

** I've also read all three recently, and I agree on their quality. I generally have lower expectations for challenge responses but Whiskey Accident for exceeded them.\\
the following are all stories that have updated in the past two weeks or so, though I'm sure I missed a few

Also reading:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10108027/1/After-Dark][After Dark]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/397906/Tigerman][Tigerman]]. His Runemaster is one of my favorites and this one lives up to it, with one minor exception: his first language is not English and he didn't have a beta for this one, and it shows. However, the plot is incredibly interesting and unique.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10505765/1/Honestly-Harry-The-Year-of-the-Spare][Honestly Harry and the Year of the Spare]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2818448/Captain-Compass][Captain Compass]]. The Honestly Harry series continues with it's sixth? installment. lots of fluffy goodness and politics. Been reading the series since just before he posted the second book.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10373959/1/Firebird-s-Fury-Book-III-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird's Fury]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]]. The third and final book of the Firebird Trilogy, an extremely dark au with lots of politics. Is tarted reading the first book just after he started the third.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10523682/1/Harry-Potter-and-Grief-s-Wisdom][Griefs Wisdom]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1751050/Poetheather1][Poetheather1]]. Summer after Sirius died independent Harry fic. it's okay.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy][The Legacy]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5180238/storytellerSpW][StorytellerSpW]]. It's over 475k words and has no end in sight. most of the later chapters are extremely long and extremely slow, but it's allowing for the relationships to develop in a mostly natural way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence][Perils of Innocence]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/901792/avidbeader][Avidbeader]]. Another slow updating and slow plot fic, but this one is much shorter in total length and chapter size. Harry and others are raised in an orphanage and several muggle doctors are working closely with them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10381381/1/Compound-Interest][Compound Interest]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5609847/Cillit-Bang-Bang][Cillit Bang Bang]]. Vernon recognizes the value of Harry's magic and uses it for his own nefarious purposes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9937462/1/Black-Princess-Ascendant][Black Princess Ascendent]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4036441/Silently-Watches][Silently Watches]]. Sequel to Princess of the Blacks. Dark au with many squicky scenes and themes. Twin who lived. Jen is abandoned at the dursleys who abandon her on the streets. she's taken in by a very dark witch and works in a child brothel from age 7 to Age 14. well written despite some gross topics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9928419/1/Season-of-Change][Season of Change]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4507917/Branchwraith][Branchwraith]]. Harry Potter is actually Alya Black. It's okay so far.

** Currently reading [[https://fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][Black Comedy]] and it's pretty decent. I know it's a well known one, but I finally buckled and tried it. Can't say I'm disappointed.

Before that, I read [[https://fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Marauder's Plan]]. I personally think this is one of the best fanfics I've read, ever. It's WIP - the most recent chapter came out just as I caught up to all the previous ones - it's incredibly well done. It manipulates the world and a few concepts quite subtly, and although it has a habit of fixing up tertiary characters with OC's, it does make the relationships believable and organic. I really highly recommend it. It's HHr, but you shouldn't let it put you off if you don't like that.

**** It wasn't actually the book club that tipped the scales - I usually have two or three stories backed up to read, so once I've finished one I move on to the next. A Black Comedy has been present in the queue for about a month and a half; it kept getting mentioned so I decided to give it a shot. Then when I checked out the book club and it was on that, I was already 10 chapters in.

*** A Marauder's Plan is amazing and I'm not a fan of H/Hr. The main reason I love it, is that nobody's horrible out of the blue. So Dumbeldore is manipulative but there's a valid reason behind it. He thinks he's doing good. Ron doesn't start trying to rape Hermione or talking about Mudbloods. He has issues but they're dealt with in a really good way.

** These will probably look familiar, since I get most of my reads from this subreddit.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1513042/1/Hold-Me-While-I-m-Here][Hold Me While I'm Here]]. Pretty funny, good read. Looks abandoned.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4302068/1/He-s-Not-Normal][He's Not Normal]]. Really funny, but short. Also looks abandoned.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]. Harry Potter meets absurdism. Nice style, some really funny moments. WIP.

** I've just finished reading what's been posted so far of Playing the Players. AU, Sirius comes back and Voldemort isn't killed. Marriage law HG/SB with a Fair amount of smut, and while Hermione is a fair touch OOC, there's a lot of really interesting, well thought out plot and the author has introduced a lot of cool magical theories and stuff. It's not something I'd usually read but it's quite well written. It's apparently very slowly updated as it's a WIP and was last updated in June this year.
