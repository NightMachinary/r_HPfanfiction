so any suggestions other than the famous ones like tea series or CW verse?


** This is the only Snarry I have ever liked, so take that as you will: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6673719/1/Red-Right-Hand][Red Right Hand]]. /Synopsis:/ After the war, Severus Snape is found guilty and administered a cruel new punishment by Dolores Umbridge and the Wizengamot. The only person who could clear his name is Harry Potter, but there's just one problem.

** What are these tea series and CW verse you mention? If they're really good could you link them, as I don't think I've heard of them?

*** Just did a quick google. I think the CW-verse refers to [[http://www.noiresensus.com/authors/a_sushi.html][Sushi's Civil War Universe series]] and the [[http://telanu.thirteenblackbirds.net/hp.html][Tea Series refers to this series by Telanu]]. My googling also revealed that I actually have fanart for both these series saved in my HP fanarts folder, so I'm definitely going to go read them. At some point. Eventually.

*** so I know this is pretty late and you might've already googled these but here they are:[[http://telanu.thirteenblackbirds.net/hp.html][Tea Series]] and [[http://www.noiresensus.com/authors/a_sushi.html][CW verse]]. I don't think these were all that amazing though. My personal favorites were [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=2205][Aqua Fresca]] and [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=2759&textsize=0&chapter=1][When the rose and fire are one]]. Enjoy :) Edit: ah didn't notice someone already got it
