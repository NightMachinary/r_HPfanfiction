So I have been thinking, how does a boy who is willing to commit dangerous transformation to help his werewolf friend turn into traitor. Albeit there are more sane ways of doing so, here's my weird prompt. I was sleep-deprived when I came up with this so... no judgement.

Peter has an evil twin sister Petra that are minutes younger than him. The thing is unlike Peter, Petra is a looker but unfortunately she is a squib, which she hates ardently. She goes to muggle school, is a leader of a girl gang, and is a bit of a bully. And she hates her brother, because instead of a cool badass like her the magic is wasted on her brother, who she blames for her squid condition.

​

As she likes power, lacking magic does not stop her, she reads her brother's textbooks and learns magical theory etc. And joins an underground squib organization who wants to be a more active part of the wizarding world.

In 1997, a couple of months before her brother's graduation, she purchases a magical locket/charm etc whathever from a shady underground magic store, which works in a peculiar way. Like a portkey, you don't need to have magic to use it, so she can use it as well. What it does is to switch the souls of two people touching the locket at the same and make them unable to talk about it/the switch. Petra uses it on her brother and although she is now trapped in a mouse-male-chubby body of Peter Pettigrew she is happy because she now has magic. The switch also allows the souls to access the previously stored memories and mindscape of the body so she has all her brother's memories. Poor Peter is trapped in his sister's body, unable to talk about it (also the switch is inherently resiliant to certain extentagainst being detected by legitimency etc) and as her mind is a dark dark space he is going a bit barmy. Petra-in-Peter's body convinces the parents Pettigrew that "his sister" is going crazy and gets Peter-in-Petra's body admitted into a mental hospital. Poor Peter is trapped.

​

Meanwhile Petra-in-Peter's-body plays the friend to Marauders (you might make her fall in love with James/Sirius/Remus whatever and make her jealous and spiteful because of that) all the while getting swept up by Voldemort's promises of supremacy and power. S/he becomes the spy that betrays the marauders etc.

The point is all this is found out somewhere around Ootp, or at least after graveyard scene in GoF. In my mind, it is Snape who realizes this with increasing presence of Peter in Voldemort's posse. Maybe Snape's legitemency sees through it I dunno. Once aware of this switch Lupin and Sirius try to find the trapped Peter, albeit better looking than ever, and save him. It seems none of the marauders has spent the last 12 years at ease.

​

That's it pals, how it changes the events is up to you. It is very unnecessarily convulated and unlikely prompt but in my mind it was fun.


** Woah. I actually read a fic a while back that was a time travel Harry who at first treated peter with contempt until he realized that this peter hadn't done anything yet. It's always interesting to see those fics who are like but why? Like it really doesn't make sense and we never get a true backstory for peter, in my opinion. Dude this is interesting. Some people might say your view on magic is skewed but this is fanfiction. You can make your own magic laws.

** Prince of Slytherin has an explanation for this disconnect.

Even though there other motives to them becoming Animagi, young Peter was still good friends with the rest of the Mauraders. It took a Death Eater DADA teacher twisting a slight jealousy, and a twist family history, to turn Peter against his friends.

*** Prince of Slytherin has a lot of good explanations in general tbh. My favourite (though this is more of a story arc than explanation) is Regulus's

** What about, Peter as canon or near-canon, but in the Shrieking Shack in Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry sides with Peter instead of with Sirius and Lupin, believing Peter's claim that he only served Voldemort under duress (and not the guy who's gloating about how much he wants to commit murder).\\
Sirius may not get justice or vengeance, but with Harry willing to support Peter, the latter has less (or no) reason to go back to Voldemort, which means in turn that unless Voldemort can find another minion on short notice, his resurrection (and next attempt to kill Harry) will be greatly delayed.
