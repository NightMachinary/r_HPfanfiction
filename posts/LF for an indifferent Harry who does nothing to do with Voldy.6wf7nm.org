Let me explain. What I'm looking for is a Harry Potter who says screw Volde, screw Dumble, screw the wizarding society and goes and does his own thing. For example, he does not look for the philosopher's stone, leaves Ginny to death, looks at the mechanics of the goblet to get out of the magical contract, after death eaters invade the Hogwarts he simply leaves England for another country, does not let others boss him around.

Maybe going as far as putting a fidelius charm on his own name and going by another name.Does not become the Hero he was forced to become. Ah, and does not let his enemies alive.


** Well, No Thank You ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4670484/1/No-Thank-You]] ) has a Harry who never goes to Hogwarts in the first place. He stays with the Dursleys (who treat him perfectly well in this fic), and all the usual problems of the books sort themselves out by third year by virtue of other characters being a bit more sensible and observant.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.
