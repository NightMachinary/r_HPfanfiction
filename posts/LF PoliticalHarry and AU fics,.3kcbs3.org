  To many, Harry Potter is nothing more than the brother of the famous Boy-Who-Lived, Charles Potter. A childhood incident, his brother's hatred and his sorting into Slytherin, however, shape the man he turns into. His enemies are quite numerous and his ambition entails nothing less than the complete transformation of Wizarding society. Political.

      Hello and welcome to another 'Harry Potter is a Slytherin' story\. This story was once posted a million years ago on fanfiction\.net\. Unfortunately, my account there is mysteriously unusable and so, I'm finally finishing this fanfic on AO3\. I started this fanfic years ago and at first it was a slightly awful drabble but due to mysterious reasons it became something of a phenomenon\. I hope the rewrite will eventually bring this story again to people's memories\. It was a lot of fun and I hope you'll have as much fun reading as I have writing it, especially since I'm finally finishing it\.To anyone just starting this story, the pairings show up around fourth year and will be added to the tags as I write them\. I'm also slowly editing this beast myself so please forgive any minor mess ups but if something particularly bothers you, feel free to comment on it\.For those curious about me or when an update will appear leave a comment on my dreamwidth\. Thank\-you and enjoy\.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

** I guess I'll tentatively recommend linkffn(Again and Again by Athey)

It has a big focus on accomplishing your goals by using politics rather than fighting and traditional action plot points, and some interesting sections about writing magical treatises which I found interesting.

It also has some things that might put off certain readers that I usually skip or skim over while re-reading.

It's basically Harry stuck in a time loop that he can't escape, and eventually he decides instead of trying to fulfill the prophesy in different ways to try and get out of the time loop, he'll see what happens if the prophesy /isn't/ fulfilled and Voldemort wins. So it has political Voldemort in it. It also ends up being harry/voldemort slash, which I've skimmed over in more recent re-readings because the pairing doesn't interest me as much as it used to. You said you're okay with slash, but even /I/ know that pairing is a little out there for some people. I also think there's one scene where they seem to "bamboozle" Dumbledore too easily, but eh, it's only one spot and it's not a big part of it or anything.

But other than that and a few other minor things, pretty much everything in this fic is good to me. I'm trying to be as vague as possible to avoid spoilers in case you do read it, so I guess you'll just have to take my word. But I guess this /is/ a rec thread, so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Also the author hasn't updated it in a while, but they are recently back after a long hiatus and updating one of their other stories. I have hope for this one!

I hope this is the type of story you're looking for. I know I'm going to be checking out the examples in your post!

** Oooh, linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) is probably just what you're looking for. It involves Lily and James setting a trap for Voldemort that kills him, and then flee the country to escape the pressure, causing Harry to grow resentful of the magical world.

This is the story of how he rises to power in the Muggle world, and wields it against his enemie. IT's awesome.

**** Probably somewhere around an eight or so.

I've found it to be quite good, actually. There are no glaring typo or mechanical errors to interrupt the flow of the story. Mild Dumbledore bashing at the start and book one, but he gets better as it progresses. Draco gets a boost to intelligence and cunning to better cope with Harry's more knowledgeable upbringing; he actually comes across as competent.

As for its size, well, that's the best part. I have a hard time investing myself in any work that is less than 100k words and incomplete. I need that substance so I can just read for a weekend without worrying about needing to find a new story.
