I recently read Every Saint Is An Accident and was wondering if there are some more good fics about them.

  Petunia Evans saw her sister as the the symbol of perfection she could never attain. Severus Snape saw her as the ultimate woman he could never win. They saw one another as the ultimate revenge for what they could never have. Written for the LiveJournal's 2015 Severus_fest. I have been privileged to have this fic translated into Russian by Protego_Maxima: http://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks/150039714
