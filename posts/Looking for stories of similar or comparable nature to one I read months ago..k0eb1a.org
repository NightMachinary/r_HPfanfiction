The story was called "His Angel" by Durararaaa. It was a fourth year AU/Divergent of canon where Harry meets fleur at the world cup and they begin a relationship from there.

It doesn't have to be exactly like that, where the plot and beginning of the story is identical, but I really liked the format. It skips the first three years which can get boring in continuous reading of fanfiction. It also starts at an interesting point where Harry can be on his way to becoming powerful without it seeming too ridiculous.

As much as it pains me to admit it, I am a slut for some good angst/fluff/romance. I enjoyed the story a lot but I was curious if there were ones where Harry was more impressive. He doesn't have to be Merlin Incarnate but at least better than the other characters.

If you have any suggestions I would much appreciate ones that are complete or at least regularly updated. Nothing hurts worse than an author writing a really good, genuine fanfiction only to fucking blue ball me.
