:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a fic on AO3 before I made an account there. In it, Harry is living his epilogue life with Ginny and gets temporarily transported into another dimension where he's living with Draco and he is an artist of some kind. I think the title has something to do with the word Glimpse because he's getting a glimpse into a different life. I remember Draco having OCD and needing a certain amount of socks per drawer and a small child (Rosie?) recognizing that Harry is different. Does anyone recognize this fic?

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU. HPDM slash but some canon het along the way. Please trust me - I promise the epilogue will not bite you.
