A brainstorming session of mine came up with some intriguing questions, the last of which motivated me to post this discussion. What follows assumes the new Riddle attempts to leave Hogwarts because, in my opinion, continuing to attack Hogwarts is both less likely and a less interesting discussion.^{^{1}}

First: If Ginny's soul is entirely consumed, does destroying the diary still destroy the new Riddle? If it doesn't destroy him, can the diary then go on to repeat history, consume another soul, and create /another/ sixteen-year-old Riddle? If it does destroy him, then does the new Riddle need to keep consuming souls to keep his body?

And most importantly, we've seen Voldemort's horcrux inside Harry having powerful effects. What effects, if any, does Ginny's soul inside the new Riddle have?

Second: If the new Riddle looks for escape and is caught, how can he explain his own existence? Once Dumbledore is informed, how does he handle the teenager that becomes Voldemort that he can't prove has committed a crime? Or would the pieces fall together for Myrtle's testimony to be enough?

Third, and by far the most interesting question: If the new Riddle isn't imprisoned, regardless of whether the Aurors are hunting him, how do he and older Voldemort get along after Voldemort's resurrection?

Assuming that one cannot control the other through the Horcrux, I can't see either one being satisfied playing lieutenant. Perhaps the new Riddle would see the power of Voldemort and play along for a time, but I think eventually a war between them would be inevitable. And even if they do have an uneasy peace, what's to stop someone like Snape from breaking it?

Imagine a British Isles where Death Eaters are forced to decide which version of Voldemort they were loyal to. One, a disfigured and quite possibly insane demon with fifty years more experience and a nearly successful domination of Britain under his belt. The other, less experienced but more human, more sane, and probably more likely to recognize mistakes and correct them. After Voldemort's resurrection, new Riddle could even convince the wizarding public that he's not the bad guy.

Two Dark Lords, the Imperius Curse, spies on all sides, and the Death Eaters' shadowy terror tactics would all combine to create a vicious game of assassins with escalating body counts and a suffocating level of paranoia for not only the Ministry and Dumbledore's loyal, but for all the Death Eaters and both Dark Lords.

Sounds like a great setting for a war story that requires competent, powerful, yet scarred and haunted heroes to win. Or, at least, not lose.

** 1) I think that the Diary is using Ginny to return the horcrux to a body. Once it's complete, the horcrux is in the new body and the diary is no longer a horcrux, so no replication ad infinitum.

2) If Dumbledore captures him and not the ministry, he'd put the pieces together about horcruxes (I think the diary was his first clue in canon) and destroy Young Riddle, knowing he's not actually a person. If it's the ministry, Fudge still trusts Dumbledore atm and would take his advice as long as it got rid of the problem quietly.

3) (If Dumbledore hasn't killed him) Young Riddle would be disappointed by Old Riddle's failures and would see him as an obstacle to his own goals. At this point however, he's too weak to take him on, so he'd either hide or try to finagle his way into the good books of the good guys and fight Riddle. Old Riddle would seek to kill Young Riddle as soon as he discovered his existence. It would be his priority even over killing HP. Alternatively, Young Riddle might shift his goals on world domination to more 'diplomatic' means, having witnessed that magical might does not guarantee success.

Number 3 would be an interesting story. 17 y.o. Riddle navigating the world and deciding at which point to diverge from Old Riddle's path and by how much, what to do about HP, Dumbledore, horcruxes, etc. I personally find that idea more interesting than the one you proposed, but only because I prefer fics set during the book years.

Objection, Voldemort is a fancy ghost in Albania at this point, probably weak enough to be defeated with a vacuum cleaner.

He's a being with its own thoughts and feelings, and with a piece of human soul at its core --- I'd say he's no less a person than the main Voldemort.

****** I think he would. Tom had already committed multiple murders at that point AND would have just killed Ginny Weasley. I don't think he'd tell anyone (except maybe Snape) or involve the Ministry. Ginny's death would be blamed on the basilisk.

Honestly, though I feel like Tom would have gotten away after draining Ginny and the two Riddles would be fighting each other.

As well as can be parsed from Rowling's interviews, it rather seems like Voldemort would be able to command his Horcruxes like House-Elves, and Diarymort would have no choice but to fight /under/ him.

********* All we know for sure is this:

#+begin_quote
  *Interviewer:* In 'Chamber of Secrets', what would have happened if Ginny had died and Tom Riddle had escaped the diary?

  *Rowling:* I can't answer that fully until all seven books are finished, but it would have strengthened the present-day Voldemort considerably.
#+end_quote

From this we can infer that Diarymort /would/ have joined forces with the present-day Voldemort rather than fought him, because having the distraction of another him trying to kill him would /not/ have "strengthened the present-day Voldemort considerably".

********** Well, this is somewhat disappointing. I mean, I'm at the point with canon where if it's not in the seven books I don't feel bad ignoring it, but still, I hadn't seen this before. I read it the same way you did concerning "main" Voldemort having control over any created versions.

*********** There's a chance she meant it would have strengthened him in that it would have meant another horcrux to destroy (one with considerable capacity to defend itself) rather than having one horcrux down before the good guys even knew what they were.

That's what I'm choosing to believe anyway la lala lala.

********** That can also be read that Diary-tom will think he only has one horcrux and make 5 others. Then voldemort has even more of those vile things than in canon.

*********** Would that work, though? Technically, if Diarymort made Horcruxes, they'd be Horcruxes for /himself/, though --- tethering /him/ to the world if the physical diary came to be destroyed --- they wouldn't technically be Horcruxes for Originalmort. ...Does Diarymort himself still act as an anchor even if he's no longer in the Diary? Something to ponder.

************ I guess it would. A horcrux works by splitting a soul. If a part of your soul still exists, you can't pass on. Given that Originalmort and Diarymort's new horcruxes are part of the same soul I would expect that it would hold the horcruxes keep him safe.

That said, I have no practical experience of making horcruxes.

******** Didn't Diarymort express his disappointment in Originalmort's failings though? That gave me the impression that he was fairly autonomous.

Although perhaps once O.G. Mort returned to his body, he would have been able to exercise complete control over TomTwo.

*** I hadn't considered new Riddle as a point of view character because of my own biases; that could be an equally intriguing perspective on the Harry Potter universe. Especially if, as you suggest, he's more diplomatic the second time around.

In addition to Fudge and Dumbledore not being antagonists yet, Fudge likes problems that go away quietly and Dumbledore would offer that.

** Mizuni-sama's "Prince of the Dark Kingdom" has a great take on how Diary-Riddle would act after being brought back into corporeal form. It's a 7 "book" series that is very heavily AU, where Voldemort won the first war and rules Wizarding Britain in a greatly expanded magical world. While it's one of my favourite fics, it's unfortunately unfinished at 1253k words.
