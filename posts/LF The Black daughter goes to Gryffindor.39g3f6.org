I recently began reading "As Black as night" and was rather disappointed when the fic put the girl into Slytherin. The conflicts there and with the other houses do not interest me at all, since I've read them over and over again.

I don't like Marauder era fics, so I never really read a "Sirius Black in gryffindor" fic. Thats what I'm searching for, just with his daughter as a proxy.

In "As Black as Night" theres Maia Violetta Black. Daughter of Sirius Black and Marlene McKinnon and burdened with the stigma of being a Black right after the first war. A well done OC that I liked reading about.

I wonder if theres something similar and well written. I know and follow "Black Princess Ascendant" to name just one more that hits in a similar vein.

So, yea... Sirius Blacks daughter goes to Hogwarts, gets sorted into Gryffindor. Do you know something like that?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9349216/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Arabella Black]] includes an OC kid of Sirius, but from what I can tell it doesn't change much from canon. (rewrites of all seven books w/ Arabella are on the author's page)

*** rewrites are... alright, i guess. They're at least not necessarily a bad thing.

edit: This one doesn't even change the title of the book. Its actually called "Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone." I'll read this just so I can determine what the hell is going on in this fic.

Anyway, big thanks for the recommendation.

**** Yeah, I know what you mean. They changed the naming scheme for the third book and up.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9322278/1/][Black Bond]] is a good one. By chapter 10 you may feel like turning away and never reading it again BUT keep reading, it becomes really fantastic after that

#+begin_quote
  An eight year-old Harry Potter comes across Acquila Black, a girl at his school, only to realise that he shares a strange connection with her. And when Sirius Blacks escapes Azkaban, how will he help his godson and daughter in defeating the darkest wizard of all times? (Year three in progress) (Chapters 12-20 under revision)
#+end_quote

Despite the fact that yes, there is a soul bond, it's not romantacized like they usually are and Harry and Acquila tend to see it as a problem and want it gone.

*** Stopped reading around chapter 20, the story is kinda... meh. Acquila is basically the epitome of a Mary Sue. Extremely beautiful, powerful and intelligent without any apparent flaws other than having a slight temper. Not to mention that Harry is almost a carbon copy of his canon self, which is just plain lazy in a story that should already make drastic changes to Harry's pre-Hogwarts characterization.
