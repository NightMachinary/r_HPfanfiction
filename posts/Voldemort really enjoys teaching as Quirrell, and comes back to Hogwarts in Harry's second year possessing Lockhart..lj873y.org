** This just made me think of something.

What if Quirrell taught the year before Harry started. And then he left to go looking for Dark Arts things, and came back all jittery. Dumbledore thought 'well there's the curse working again. It's late July, he'll come to me in a few days saying he can't teach and I'll have to find someone new.'

But then September 1st rolls around and Quirrell is still there. Dumbledore thinks the curse is Finally broken, but little does he know: the curse is actually sensing Voldemort as the new DADA professor. He, too, loses the position within the year.

** It would be funny if Voldemort actually taught DADA. I mean imagine him teaching first year and second year hufflepuffs and ravenclaws. Like the amount of sheer frustrations from Gryffindor and Slytherin. I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have a dark lord if they just gave him the job when he was 18. He'd have to deal with Assignments, lesson planning and detentions such that he'd never have time for other Dark Lord ventures.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

** At some point he realizes he--or his hosts--absolutely sucks at it. Of course, it can't be him, he rationalized. Dippett was a fool not to hire him, after all; clear evidence of prejudice against half-bloods, it must be.

The answer is to find a better host, one strong enough to hide the signs of possession but weak enough to be possessed. Curse Dumbledore for hiring that werewolf! Everyone knows werewolves can't be possessed nor Imperius'd.

Alastor Moody! Curse Dumbledore again! Two competent and strong teachers in a row. Good for the students, he guesses, but near fatal for his plans. It's a hard example he'll have to follow. And he has to get back, study Potter (or so he tells himself).

Ah, Delores. This might work. She has a delightful dark streak--and what are these quills? Ooh, so many possibilities!

If that happens we will need a Lockhart/Voldy video to this song: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X53ZSxkQ3Ho&ab_channel=SirMixALotVEVO]]
