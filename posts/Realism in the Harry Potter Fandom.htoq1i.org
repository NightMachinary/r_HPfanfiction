I wanted to address some of the regular problems I have often encountered in some Harry Potter fanfictions.

1. There is some fanfictions that introduce some elements that Harry doesn't know before fifth year like the Order of the Phoenix and its present members without any explanation how Harry have the knowledge. I am speaking of fics that are divergent at a point in the Canon timeline. For ex : there is a fix that introduced that Harry knows he is under guards of the order at privet drive in the summer before fourth year and the Triwizard.

2. There is a plethora of fanfictions that have some pureblood like Neville inform Harry that as an old pureblood family that Neville is trained from early age by his Gran to take on the Family Seats on the Wizengamot when he will come of age and that as old pureblood family the Potter too have a Seat on the Wizengamot and that he will be a formidable political player because of the Boy Who Lived nonsense. But shouldn't the fact that Harry is not being trained from early age to take the Seat make it forbidden for him to take the Seat. Should it not freeze the Seats until an Potter heir properly educated come of age and take it on ? Simple logic.

2bis. In those same fanfictions doesnt the fact that those Seats come from old pureblood family, make Harry unable to use the Seats as he is a halfblood ? Shouldn't the Potter Seats be considered Exctinc as no longer pure.

I personably consider that Harry should lose his birthright the moment his education wasn't done as per the Family Traditions or by allied purebloods of the same rank. It is central in nobility .


** - While Harry wouldn't know what the Order of the Phoenix is, it's not super hard to retcon it so that Harry is aware he's being watched. Simply noticing Diggle, Doge, or maybe Lupin (though that's a stretch) could give him that impression.

- It's far more realistic to have an ignorant polItician making decisions for the masses than what you're suggesting.

- No. There would be no Wizengamot.

*** 2a. It is the central idea of the system of Lordship and all that Aristocracy that it is the regime where the rulers are those that are most adept to rule or educated from birth to rule.

**** We've had a very similar argument before. This is your own headfanon. If this is something you wish to write, have it, but this isn't how it works in someone else's fan fiction and that's fine.

***** Your are saying that fanfictions within the Harry Potter fandom may take liberty with the realism of the universe ? Even Rowling has taken care to create a universe that has those same elements from reality. You are saying that an author of fanfictions would be in his rights to write a Harry Potter fanfiction where the Wizengamot is formed of all Lords of Noble House even those lords that are eight years old if they are orphans ? They should be realism even in fanfictions

****** In theory, all governments require those governing to be intelligent and educated. In the case of aristocracy, those are lords, in the case of democracy, it's the electorate and representatives, and in the case of monarchy it's the royalty.

In all of these cases, it's an ideal and for any given system of government you can find a case where it was not upheld.

All of that said, there are fanfics out there where the magical government is legally incorporated under the crown and they all forgot, fics where matrilineal covens run the government, and even in canon we have absolutely no idea how members take their place in the Wizengamot. It's fanfiction, and people inheriting lordships they are unprepared for doesn't seem any less realistic than the massive levels of incompetence that have /already/ been seen in canon. As [[/u/Ash_lestrange]] said, you can certainly write a version where people are required so that the Wizengamot approaches competence, and if you don't like it the way others write it, you're welcome not to read it.

******* Actually your definition of Aristocracy is incomplete, your definition is corresponding to Oligarchy ( the rulers are those that are the richest => Nobility of money or blood) , Aristocracy is where the rulers are those that are the best. It is the rule of the better => Nobility of Values . The forms of government that are requiring education are the three right forms of government : Monarchy, Aristocracy ( from Greek Aristoi : the better) and the constitutional government. The forms that don't need education are the three corrupted forms of governments : Tyranny, Oligarchy and Democracy.

But accepting that the authors have integral license why the amount of fanfiction with realism is far less that those with unrealistic situation ?

**** That might be what those aristocrats claim, and is even the origin of the term aristocracy, but it's not how they work, plenty of incompetent, malicious or otherwise bad nobles in history, that's the problem with hereditary leadership

***** How do you explain that philosophers like Aristotle support that Aristocracy is one of the best form of constitution ?

Or do you suggest that Aristocracy is to easy to corrupt into Oligarchy ?

** A corrupted aristocracy (sure, oligarchy if you prefer) is not unrealistic, just flawed. We've already seen that the ministry of magic is in fact corrupted, so given that it's logical that authors would continue to write about the Wizengamot as a corrupted form of government rather than an ideal one.

The thing about corrupt governments is that they rarely call out their own corruption. An oligarchy calling itself an aristocracy is still an oligarchy.

EDIT: this should have been in the comment chain, not top-level, but the point stands
