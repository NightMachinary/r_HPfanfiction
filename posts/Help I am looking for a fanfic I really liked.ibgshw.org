:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey I am looking for a fanfic that I forgot to save in which Voldemort won and puts Harry to sleep for like 1000 years-ish and he is woken up by the Weasley's decendants and voldemort has forgotten who he is was and only knows that he is important. I also believe that voldemort smokes or something? And nagini is now named like naniki or something? I really liked it and have been searching for like two hours!!!


** Thanks!

  The liquid flowed thickly down his throat. It tasted of tainted honey and carried the ineffable weight of centuries down with it, until they hung heavy beneath his ribs and drowned his lungs in ice crystals.Harry Potter and Voldemort, and the inevitable baggage of a millenium. (alternatively)The fine art of historical revisionism.
