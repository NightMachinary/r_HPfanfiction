What's your favorite fanfiction that's not popular?

Mine is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6719282/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Guardian-Wand][Harry Potter and the Guardian Wand]]


** '[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3157478/1/Dear-Order][Dear Order]]' (otherwise known as '21 letters to the Order of the giant flaming turkey') is good for a laugh. Involves Harry writing letters to the Order, begging to be collected from Privet Drive. There are goldfish, snarky Harry, Tonks abusing her powers for the greater good and just all round silliness.

** A pair of hidden gems, but seem to be rising in popularity.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]]. Complete.

#+begin_quote
  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8509020/1/The-Handbook-of-Elf-Psychology][The Handbook of Elf Psychology]]. WIP.

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them! Harry is captured by wizards and brought to a castle. The wizards are obnoxious, but there's a lovely wood nearby which is quaintly named the "Forbidden" Forest. Harry thinks that's adorable.

** The most unusual effort would have to be Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4403728/1/Harry-James-Potter-Anagram][Harry James Potter: Anagram]], linked for the sheer insanity of it:

#+begin_quote
  The Harry Potter saga told in a form where every word in the story is composed from the letters “Harry James Potter.” It's slightly harder than it looks .

*** I wonder why do people do this. I saw the reviews and some people are saying how it is absolutely brilliant. It is fucking not fun to read and basically a product of forcing oneself into this stupid condition. Yay I made some shit out of 5 letter , give me a nobel prize. I wish people focused more on their plot lines and stretched the fabric of the universe Rowling created rather than doing this stupidity to win accolades of few weirdos.

**** I suspect for the challenge of it, to see if it could be done.

I thought it was impressive--much more so than that abortion of a story, /Methods of Rationality/, that people seem constitutionally obligated to recommend in every thread. To each his own.

***** Yeah it's impressive but that's the point its like a modern piece of art of red paint that no one really cares about but it costs million dollars. I would rather writers impress me in a different way.

****** And I'd rather the internet tough guy act were toned down in a forum the author's probably not even following, but I suspect neither of us will get our wishes.

Some readers (myself included) liked this story, which is topical with respect to the OP, and regard constrained writing of that sort (which has its own category of prompts over in [[/r/writingprompts]]) to be interesting in small doses. I wouldn't want to read a whole novel of it, but this seems like a whole lot more bitching than a 200 word piece deserves. The author has written several longer and more conventional stories. Or, you know, there's always other authors.

** I once read a romance fic about Percy and his future wife Audrey (who was basically an OC). I just read it on a whim, and it turned out to be amazing. Percy's character was actually really believable. He was bitter and guilty and felt depressed about everything that had happened during the war. Also, he had been demoted down to a low-level office (although he wanted to climb the ranks again). Audrey was just a secretary. I don't remember what it was called, but the author abandoned it...like all good fics.

**** It was something like Senseless or Irrational...maybe irrational. Let me see if I saved it under favorites back on HPFF.

FOUND: Turns out, I did save it. It's probably not as good as I remember it, but I still love the idea. [[http://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=272516][Irrational]].
