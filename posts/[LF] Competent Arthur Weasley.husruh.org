Hit me with any Fic where Mr. Weasley ends up stepping up his game vis+a-vis his job and figures out stuff like Electricity and Firearms and other simple words..


** I mean, he's pretty competent at his job. He knows how to enchant muggle artifacts, he knows how to enforce regulations over enchanting muggle artifacts, and he knows how to get legislation passed through the legislature. He gets a law passed that lets him raid Malfoy's house. Knowing how the muggle things is just his side hobby. You don't have to be an expert in medicine to regulate health insurance.

Now it would definitely be interesting for Mr. Weasley to become more invested in his hobby.

*** But incompetency with things as simply rectified as looking up the spelling (and presumably function) of Electricity doesn't exactly paint a great picture of the man.. He is 41 when Harry and Ron starts Hogwarts, has been interested in muggle technology for over 25 years, has in that time amassed a collection of plugs and batteries, and presumably other bits and pieces, but in that time has done next to no actual, meaningful research.. I get that it was done for laughs.. but I just want someone or something to get him to put in a bit of effort so he doesn't come off as the village idiot or a simpleton..

**** The man got legislation past Lucius Malfoy, confidante of the most powerful man in Britain and the man who bribed most of the ministry. He's great at enforcing the law and at his job. So what if he's not great at his hobby? I enjoy skiing, even if I'm not that great. Does that make me the valley fool?

** I started an AU fic where the war never happened and Hermione was hired to do research for Harry and Sirius who are treasure hunters, and Arthur was the one who started up the Wizarding World wide web, with a little yellow rubber duck as its symbol. Story was Hinny based but never got beyond 6 chaps
