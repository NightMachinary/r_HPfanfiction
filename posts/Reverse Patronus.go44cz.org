The powerful defensive Patronus charm is a "Light" magic spell born out of positive thoughs, and the strong desire to protect those, converted into a light, latter corporeal creature to protect against the dark and even useful as "familiars" being able to "communicate". So, what would a Dark spell or Curse fueled by dark and sad memories would look like?

My Take: If those memories were truly painful and you want them out of you, they could be charged with anger, thus you should cast a Fiendfyre or even a Protego Diabolica, after all, you are "burning" with hatred, and what is more destructive that a cursing chimera fire that quickly spins out of control?. What's your take?


** I always took Fiendfyre and the patron is to be two side of the same coin both taking intense emotion (anger or joy) to form and both taking forms of creatures representing the caster

*** Cruciatus Is about making others suffer, the Reverse Patronus would be like the Patronus to cast out inner feelings, but sadder. I've always felt Imperius Is the opposite of Cruciatus.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

** I saw one recently where Harry was trying to learn the Patronus charm, but tried to use a memory of when he enjoyed seeing someone get what they deserved, and the spell exploded violently in his face.

** In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13220537/1/A-Wand-for-Skitter][A Wand For Skitter]] linkffn(13220537) Taylor has trouble fuelling the charm with a happy memory and ends up producing a cursed patronus.

Putting aside the problems that fic has, I did at least appreciate that. She ends up summoning a barely controllable swarm of cursed maggots, because the memory she used wasn't suitable.

** I know JKR Magical system is not that deep or developed.

But taking the approach of magic as intent, I like to imagined truly Dark spells, like Fiendfyre or the Unforgivables require true hatred or strong emotions associated with it.

Maybe they could do a Patronus Umbra, which is a dark reflection of the user(whereas a Patronus shows something pleasant/good for them) and has the same passive effect of a Dementor to anyone but the caster. A demoralizing spell.

** I liked HPMOR's take on how communicating with patroni relies on wanting to "spread the good word"

What if you're spreading a message of terror... sort of like a more concentrated version of the intent behind *Morsmordre.

Reveling in their malice and cruelty, a wizard can invoke a dark avatar of terror and anguish. Where a dementor excudes a choking, oppressive aura that slows and weakens like a lead blanket of synthetic depression, this invocation is swift and maddening.

Imagine an abuse survivor suddenly feeling the /distinct/ grasp of a familiar hand around their ankle. A weaponized fear spell that makes you feel like your worst nightmare is not only real, but already has you in its' grasp.

I think the counter to the patronus shouldn't emulate a dementors abilities, it should /complement/ them.

  A bittersweet coming-of-age story for fans of good writing. Lily died, and left James to raise a stranger's son alone. In the shadows of Azkaban, Harry learns from Dementors and Death Eaters, while in the caverns of the sea a mysterious power awaits the chance to steal his soul. Warnings inside.
