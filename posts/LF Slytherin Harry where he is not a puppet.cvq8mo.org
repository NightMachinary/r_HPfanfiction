Hi , I am looking for every Independant Harry sorted in slytherin and where Harry is not a puppet so no trials for the stone, I want Harry to do everything to know the world in which he lives and no folow blindly Dumbledore or the Weasleys or worse that mudblood of Hermione. I want him to ask for the end of line clause early because I do not want Harrby to be dependant on adults. To be trully Tom equal he must do everything alone.

I'm not sure what you mean by that.

I know of many fics that would partially fit your request, but none that fit entirely.

For example, "Rise of the Wizards" is an indie!Harry fic that has Harry acting against most of the adult figures who want to control him, and it contains a negative portrayal of Hermione. However, since the fic starts at the end of year five Harry was presumably still a pawn and Griffindor until that point of divergence. Also, I'm not sure it fits your requirement of Harry acting entirely alone, since Harry does have friends and allies.

The "Sarcasm and Slytherin" series is a Slytherin!Harry WBWL series in which Harry mostly avoids being a pawn of Dumbledore and Voldemort from the beginning. But Harry isn't alone because he relies on his friends, including Hermione to a lesser extent.

"Ruthless" by AngelaStarCat is about an unusual Harry sorted into Slytherin who shapes his own fate almost entirely indifferent to the people arround him, but even he isn't alone because Hermione and Theodore Nott are close to him.

*** Lmfao, the idea of indy Harry in and of itself isn't horrible. The execution always is unfortunately. He has to be dependent at the beginning, but a competent someone would have him grow to understand the difference between cooperating and dependency.

***** Tom Riddle threw 60+ years worth of a tantrum because his mummy died and his daddy didn't want him, but he also knew the benefit of using people and the adults around him.

It's also absurd to think a teenage Harry could beat a 70 yr old Voldemort in a fight without a really good 50+ yr old adult. He's also not learning about Horcruxes without the help of someone.

********* I don't believe that Blacks have a library, but even if you give them one he still needs Sirius to get in there.

You seem to want a preteen/teenage Harry who can outmaneuver old politicians and beat 70 year old prodigies in a fight and that's not realistic or the makings of a good story.
