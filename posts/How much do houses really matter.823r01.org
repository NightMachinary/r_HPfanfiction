The houses in Hogwarts are (obviously) used to organize the students. In fanfic however, Sirius is usually disowned for being a Gryffindor and people are mind blown when Harry is friends with people in another house. In Prince of Slytherin when people die and the Daily Prophet reports it, they list the dead people's Hogwarts house. But, in canon, how important is your house?


** In canon, not really important. It's literally just a way to separate kids to make organizing them for classes easier. Canon Sirius wasn't disowned until he was a teenager. You're still more likely to be friends with kids from your own House due to the proximity principle- you live with these people, take classes with them, eat with them, and generally spend the most time with them, so of course you're not as likely to have friends in other Houses.

There are tons of characters whose Houses never come up in canon, especially for adults, including fairly important characters like Scrimgeour

** From my experience with kids, the younger years would take it very seriously, but as students get older the boundaries begin to merge and eventually it is seen as a way to help with timetabling. It would also be used as small talk in later life - "What house were you in? Oh, lovely! Did you know so and so? I always loved the sound of your common room, blah blah blah."

** Mildly important at most, I'd say. Outside of "most of the Death Eaters are drawn from Slytherin" there isn't much, if any, reference to them by any non-parent/Hogwarts staff member.

** It seems that it was more of merely another point of friction between Sirius and his family in canon, since he was only disowned after he ran away when he was sixteen.

** I'd say very important. At 11, a child is proclaimed before their parents, peers, and teachers alike to have certain character traits and values. The child then spends most of their time surrounded by people who have been similarly proclaimed to have these same character traits, and, furthermore, may in fact have them. This goes on for 7 years, with only short 2-month breaks for the summer. I can't see anyone graduating without either adopting these traits and values or being broken by them.

*** I'm not so sure about that. We see Harry's perspective in the stories, so everything is filled with danger and adventure, but for most of the students, Hogwarts isn't nearly the character-defining trial grounds that it is for Harry. The vast majority of them would probably be as affected by their time there as they would at any boarding school.

As for the houses themselves, we don't really see them stressing the "core house values" outside of the sorting ceremony. Aside from maybe Slytherin, where political and social standing seem to be more prevalent issues due to familial pressure, students aren't characterized by those traits very often. We see a lot of house expectations emphasized in fanfiction, but not so much in canon.

**** The effect of other people's expectations on people's behaviour has been studied pretty extensively, and my reading of it is that we are influenced far more easily than we'd like to think. Often the effect is quite strong even when the expectation isn't verbalised explicitly. So, people don't talk about their house values, of course, but that doesn't mean they aren't affected.

Harry's unique adventure is a double-edged sword in this case: sure, he is probably more affected by his Gryffindorness than others; but we also wouldn't know if they were affected.
