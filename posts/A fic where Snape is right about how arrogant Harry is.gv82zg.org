I can just imagine Harry acting like Vegeta here.

"You see Sniveillias, you're not dealing with the average wizard anymore. I, Harry Potter, have ascended to a plane that you can not even grasp. To become a legend with a power you can't not even comprehend. I, Hard Potter, have become the immortal Super Wizard!"

**** I thought I had never seen a fic like that, or maybe the ones I saw were ones where Harry only brought it up when it mattered(like in the Wizengamot where Dumbledore was trying to patronize him or make people overlook his post).

Then I read one where everytime someone said Potter, he returner "Potter-Black" and it really grated me.

Honestly people, if he was adopted, just change it to Black, or let people just call him Potter, not even Royalty demands their full names to be used.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
