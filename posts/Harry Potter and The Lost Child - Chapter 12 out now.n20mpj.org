*Excerpt* 

The bell dinged as the door opened and two tall blond figures walked in. Albus recognised his best mate from school immediately -- the tall, balding man next to him must be his father then, Draco Malfoy. Albus' own father never spoke much about him despite them having gone to Hogwarts together. Regardless, it was quite a well-known fact that the two, though cordial these days, did not get along during their time at Hogwarts. Scorpius' dad was a notorious ex-Death Eater and though he, along with his family, did abandon Voldemort's cause before his downfall the Malfoys were now shunned in almost all wizarding circles. They were still quite wealthy enough to subsist off their fortunes and properties for the rest of their lives of course, but they nevertheless lived a very private and secluded life.

*Check it out:* 

For the past couple of months, I've been working on a fix of the (in my opinion) less than great Cursed Child. I guess I just wanted to give these characters the sequel they deserve. This is a second/next generation canon-compliant (though not with CC obviously) continuation of the series I love so much.

You can find it here:

This story is meant to provide an alternative for people who would like to know â€˜what happened after the story' and would rather not bother with the hot mess that is CC (again my opinion).

General summary: no Delphi, VERY canon-compliant (except for CC of course), the plot draws a little from the Cursed Child but improves upon it (at least in my opinion), and NO BLEEDING TIME TRAVEL.

Reviews/kudos/comments/suggestions/insults are always welcome! 

Doing a new chapter every other week bc I'm SUPER busy but I will probably start writing one per week once I'm done with my studies.
