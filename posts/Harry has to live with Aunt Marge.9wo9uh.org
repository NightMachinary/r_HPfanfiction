** The magic was tied to Petunia and Dudley, Marge is kinda redundant.

*** Well let's say that Dudley lives and has to live with Marge. Harry will have to move in too, right?

**** I can't imagine them living together tbh. Considering what she says when she is drunk, she is a truly horrible person.

**** Well no- the blood magic isn't tied to Dudley either. It is explicitly tied to Petunia and Petunia alone. It is Dumbledore who does some spell we are never privy to - tying Lily's sacrifice to her last remaining blood relative - her sister. Vernon and Dudley could have left and all that would matter is that Harry stayed with Petunia.

Also legally - Marge has no connection to Harry. She's not a blood relative in any way. Our own world would never place Harry in her home.

If the Dursley's died, Dumbledore would've placed Harry in a middling wizarding home. Probably the Longbottoms where Augusta would've been a strict caregiver wont to succumb to the fame of a child.

#+begin_quote
  During the two months she had watched her eight year-old nephews, Marge Dursley discovered that Petunia was a pathological liar, Vernon had somehow been brainwashed by that no good b***h, Dudley was the spawn of Satan, and Harry was actually a good kid.
