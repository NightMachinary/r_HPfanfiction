I wanna reiterate that I have nothing against people who enjoy the Cursed Child.

I was simply disappointed with it and thought I would try writing my own 'fix' for it. I did like some parts of it - like Hermione being minister, Albus being sorted into Slytherin, Albus and Scorpius being best mates, etc. What I didn't like was the time-travel centric plot, the butchering of certain personality traits (Harry telling Albus he wishes he wasn't his son? really?!), and the fact that Voldemort would intentionally have children.

The good aspects were kept and layers were added to them in my own story. The bad ones, well, read for yourselves... ðŸ˜‰

With that in mind, and with some kind advice I got from a random stranger, I would refer to my story as a second/next generation canon-compliant (though not with CC obviously) continuation of the series I love so much.

Reviews/kudos/comments/suggestions/insults are always welcome!

Doing a new chapter every other week bc I SUPER busy but I will probably start writing one per week once I'm done with my uni.
