  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** Wouldn't that basically be Arthur Weasley? Pureblood, fascinated by muggle technology and culture, and has a better understanding than most witches and wizards.

*** Except he never really starts to understand, he doesn't understand something as simple as money or the tube (and wizards are perfectly aware of trains thanks to the express).

**** That's a good point. He also asks what rubber duckies are for. Might not be quite as muggle competent as I said.

***** And I'm pretty sure he calls the telephone a fellytone at some point. You'd think that the head of the ministry department that handles wizard-muggle interactions would be familiar with the most common communication device muggles have.

I love Arthur, but he doesn't /like/ muggles- he fetishizes them. If he actually cared about them as a people instead of an idea he'd be more familiar with their way of life. Arthur is condescending in a friendly sort of way- a "the poor muggles need to be protected because they can't handle themselves, but look at the interesting toys they made," way, kind of how you'd treat a child.
