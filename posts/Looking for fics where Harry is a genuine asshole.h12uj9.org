*** Seconding this. I remember when this used to be recommended ALL the time on DLP

I read this when I first got into fanfic and thought Harry was amazing. A couple years later I reread it and was like wow, Harry you're so unlikeable, cool but unlikeable lol

Also I love how Dumbledore is depicted in that fic

**** Is Dumbledore actually a good guy, or at least somewhat of an ally there, by any chance? I've been looking all over for fics with Good!Dumbledore and it would make me move the series up to being the next thing I read.

***** He's an ally. No bashing or GreaterGood!Manipulation.

It's been a while but I remember him as supporting Harry and working with Harry, but he's also there as the wise mentor trying to curb some of Harry's more assholeish behaviors.

I really love some of the Dumbledore and Harry scene and you can really empathize with Dumbledore quite a bit when he's dealing with Harry.

****** Right! This actually sounds perfect! I haven't read the Dresden Files, but I remember reading a fic where Harry had some sort of fallen angel from the series stuck in his head (Lash?), and it was pretty enjoyable. I think I'll drop the fic I'm currently reading and just move on to this.

***** I've read that one, it's a pretty generic Independant!Harry fic from what I recall? Like he's definitely a massive asshole there, but from the author's point of view Harry is a cool, nice dude that can do nothing wrong.
