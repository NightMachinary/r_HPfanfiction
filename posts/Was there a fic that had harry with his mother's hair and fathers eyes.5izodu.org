Sorry guys I tried to search for the link, but I am old and not technologically savvy.

I hope there's a fic!


** Can't think of any one in particular, but it would probably be a WBWL fic.

The only reason to arbitrarily change Harry's hair/eyes is to his accentuate similarities to Lily over James. Most likely reason an author wants to do that is if there's some kind of Esau/Jacob dynamic with his brother. (Or maybe a creepy Snarry fic? But you probably don't want to read those.)

That said, authors usually change his brother's hair/eyes, cos green eyes are cool. And let's be honest, without the name, hair and eyes, WBWL Harrys would have no resemblence to canon.

*** There was a post a few weeks ago, based on a tumblr picture I believe. I was just curious if anyone had managed to find one or write one!

But I totally agree with your rational that it would be a WBWL fic or something similar.

** Most girl!Harry fanfics have Harry look more like Lily, but I've never read one where he has brown eyes

*** That is very true! I've never really understood the why behind why that is such a popular idea for fem!harry though. (Besides to be a clone of Lily the way Canon!Harry is a clone of James).
