Hellloooo you lovely subreddit people.

I'm looking for fics centered around Remus and Sirius as a couple.

Marauder's Era would be my preference, but I don't mind to check out any suggestions.

Thank you for reading

** Here are two you've probably read but are excellent none the less.

*** In fact my new love of this genre is fresh given that an unexpected slash pairing of the aforementioned couple was a part of a fiction that I had become engrossed in over the past day. It was seeing them in action (figuratively) together that lead me to search out more excellent tails of forbidden passion between our favorite werewolf and Black. ^{_^}

So, thank you very much for your comment, I'm quite excited to continue reading :)

** You definitely need [[http://spacefragments.livejournal.com/58496.html][this list of over 200 fics]] in your life. It's not been updated in more than five years but there's definitely plenty to sink your teeth into there! I've read most of them myself, and they are all good quality, though of course you may like some more than others.

And, of course, you absolutely need to read [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/category/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][the Shoebox Project]] which is one of my most favourite fics ever.

Edit: and here's a bunch of communities of various sorts you can check out!\\
[[http://www.blacklupin.org./smf/index.php?board=1.0][BlackLupin]] - forum based so sometimes tricky to read whole stories\\
[[http://rs-games.livejournal.com/][Remus/Sirius Games]] - and check out other communities linked on their sidebar\\
[[http://accio-rs-fics.livejournal.com/][Accio Remus/Sirius Fics]] - even if you're not searching for anything in particular, there's lots to be found here. [[http://crack-broom.livejournal.com/tag/remus%2Fsirius][Lots of recs at crack_broom]] - and I mean LOTS. Check out other tags for other interesting fics too!\\
I swear I used to check out a million more but I don't think I need to try and track them down, really...

I used to read R/S ALL THE TIME. But it's been a while now so I can't really remember too many specific fics :( Hopefully my (possibly excessive) resources will help you get started!

** The [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/58157][Stealing Harry series]] by copperbadge is my favourite. I'm not normally a fan of the pairing, but I could not put this series down.

Note: the series was not completed, but copperbadge explains why and provides a basic overview of how he was going to end it.

**** I admit, I adore pretty much everything he writes. His original fiction is wonderful, too. I actually own a signed copy of his book of poetry. Fangirl all the way.
