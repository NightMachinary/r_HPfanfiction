Last night I finished a delightful long fic and as it is another planless Friday night during COVID, I thought it would be nice to read some Harry Potter one shots before I start another long one. I could probably read 15 or so tonight, so if you've written one recently, link them below! I'll read and comment my thoughts.

Open to any pairing (though Dramione is my personal fav), and I don't care about the rating. :)


** Not sure if you have a wordcount limit so I'll offer you a shorter one and a longer one, both Regulus & Sirius centric:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24095437][is this hell?]] linkao3(24095437) - 15k, Kreacher rescues Regulus from the cave and takes him to Sirius

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26691385][Brother]] linkao3(26691385) - 5k, Sirius faces Regulus on the battlefield

  Regulus doesn't die in the cave: Kreacher pulls him from the lake and takes him to Sirius.

  Sirius Black has always hated sitting idly by while other people get their hands dirty. But his first Order assignment out in the field leaves him feeling more turbulent than ever after he encounters the very last person he had hoped to see wearing a Death Eater's uniform.

They're all one shots except for one. They're all Marauders-era, mix of fluff and hurt/comfort. I make no claims about how good they are, but maybe you'll like them.

** I know I'm a day late but if you're still looking and you're not opposed to SSHG or Severus/Sirius please visit [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/works][my works page at AO3]], with lots of little fics I've been posting since September. A few highlights:

/So You Think That's An Age Gap?/ POV Hermione 1900 words rated teen; I banged out this bit of AU fluff in one night thinking about double dates between SSHG and RLNT

/Constellations Above the Bonfires/ POV Alternates Hermione/Snape 3300 words rated teen; Post-war EWE fluff with a cute chase scene

/My Whole Existence is Flawed/ POV Severus 7400 words rated explicit; Please heed all content warnings in the tags. This is a canon-compliant SSHG tragedy.

There's also a bunch of collab fics where we write kinky SSHG just for funzies together on Discord

/Mapping the Dungeons/ POV Sirius 3300 words rated explicit; please heed all content warnings -- Severus/Sirius is a generally toxic and this is no exception. Includes NSFW art from a fellow shipper.

I've also posted drabble collections for both ships.
