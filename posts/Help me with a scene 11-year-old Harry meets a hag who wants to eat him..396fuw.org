I'm having a lot of trouble with this scene, and I just wondered if Reddit had any witty one-liners or ideas. Please don't post anything you would mind being used.

The hag's house is spelled to attract "lost" children and Harry is running away from Hogwarts because he has Diary!Tom in his head. It's a lot like the one in "Hansel and Gretel" but because Harry wants to use the floo network rather being hungry, the house isn't made of candy.

Harry doesn't realize she's a hag until it's too late and she and her sister have him in the house. He has to fight to get away.

I was trying to make this a funny scene, but it's just not coming out that way. Is there anything that springs to your mind or that you would like to see in a scenario like this?


** Important questions...

Is Voldebook helpful in either the "no! I refuse to have a /hag/ do what my elder self wasn't able to... that would just be /embarrassing/" or the "No eating my host! mine! not yours!" sort of way?

Is Harry allowed to point out that he's incredibly skinny and that he has a fat muggle cousin who would make a much better meal? Can they be surprised when whatever magic they have shows him being truthful about happily handing over his cousin?

Why is Harry running in the first place? is Tom driving/manipulating him onward? Is Harry trying to get away from a meddlesome old coot that wants to remove Harry's friend from his head? Is Harry trying to protect his friends by putting distance between himself and the Basilisk before the next round of possession? ... Can Voldebook possess Harry at all given the nature of the blood protections in your story and what we know happens when Voldemort tries it in book 5?

You're aiming for funny... but what brand of humor? Harry has a sarcastic streak on occasion in the books if memory serves.

... Is voldebook at the point where he can create the shadowy projection version of teenaged Tom? or maybe a mental projection only Harry can see? there's some potential humor in conversations between Harry and Tom where the Hags can't see/hear Tom, while he and Harry argue about how useless and unhelpful the other is being right now. Or Tom leaning over the pot they plan to boil harry in and wrinkling his nose while tsk tsking the Hags about their poor cauldron cleaning habits.

*** Definitely the "No eating my host, I was using him first!" variety of relationship. Harry can be possessed because the diary is sort of using a mental space that the soul fragment in his scar had hollowed out.

His main reason for running away is that Dumbledore thinks he's like Quirrell- his body too much changed by possession to survive without Voldemort- and consequently doesn't see any choice but to kill Harry to stop Voldemort.

Actually the bit about eating his fat cousin instead is brilliant and very appropriate in a "Billy-Goats-Gruff" type way. Definitely working it in there, thanks!

As for funny, any type of funny I can get, I'm trying to work on my humor (or, you know, /your/ humor ;D) as much as I can. At this point Harry is pretty innocent, though, so if the hag wanted to, for instance, imply something sexual it could be there, but would fly over Harry's head.

But /not/ Tom's... Tom would understand what the Hag was implying. His response comes down to which version of Tom you're running. Has Tom's time as an abused boy in the orphanage, or as the byproduct of a love potion, put him off sex and physical contact etc entirely? Tom making retching noises in Harry's head at the Hag's implications. Or is he a teenage boy with all that usually entails? Was Bella a useful follower... or all that /and/ a good lay? Tom rolling his eyes at the Hag and using Harry's 12 year old voice to reply "I've had/seen/done/etc better" bringing the Hag up short. OR Harry replying to Tom out loud, "What do you mean we've had better? Better what?" or Tom says if he really wants to know what the Hag meant they can hire a hooker after they escape, but all the Hag hears is harry's reply of "What's a hooker?" (or whatever brits called them in the 40's if you want accuracy)

But can Tom take direct control and forcibly move Harry against his will? Or is he limited to making suggestions that all appear oh so very reasonable at the time. ... Does the Hag know about Tom? or is it a shock when Harry/Tom trade off control and his posture shifts before Tom sets everything on fire?

So Harry and Tom are a team in a way? A voice of experience and the Brat-Who-Can't-Seem-to-Just-Die-Already both relying on the other to see their existence make it to tomorrow. Harry trying to sell the Hag his cousin, while Tom's mental projection scoffs and rolls his eyes muttering about the Billy Goats Gruff. Then Tom's eyes widening when he sense's Harry's bafflement at the reference because Harry never heard the story while growing up in a /cupboard/ with /the muggles./ Tom never calls them the Dursleys, insisting names are for people, not insects.

This is fun, I should look into doing this more often.

***** Yes you should, you're very good at it!

Tom would understand... what a teenage boy in the early 1940's would understand. It was a more decorous time, and between his classmates looking to him for leadership and getting glimpses of his dark side that showed them he wasn't someone to be crossed... I don't see him discussing things or joking around with his peers the way a normal teen would. And he's had to be very careful in Hogwarts to appear non-threatening. So if the reference was very modern or very shocking, he might very well not get it, or be shocked or disgusted by it.

Bella's much younger, 16-year-old Tom has never met her. Up 'til now he's directed most of his energy towards hate, revenge, learning dark magic, and learning all he can while keeping up perfect grades and manipulating everyone he can. He had physical urges, but he wasn't interested in any kind of a romantic relationship or entanglement because he wouldn't want to take anyone else's feelings into account. As a sociopath he might be very interested in if any power could be gained through sex, or learning what all the fuss is about, but he's not yet confident enough in his "obliviate" to seduce or rape a classmate and trust they won't remember anything later. Emotionally he's sort of stunted and a prude in the "girls are silly and illogical and have cooties" way that you actually see in many of the novels of the 1940's written by men.

Yeah, Harry and Tom are kind of stuck as a team. Tom is pretty up front that he doesn't care about Harry but will take care of him since he needs a host, and Harry is resigned to the fact that he doesn't really have a choice.

In this particular scene, Tom can't take over Harry. Sometimes he can, but it requires Harry to be either very calm (almost putting himself into a trance) or very weak (starved or hurt in some way). I want Harry to show some fighting/escaping ability of his own to build on later, though as a first year he doesn't know many useful spells, so accidental magic may be what gets him away in the end.

****** I didn't mean that Tom would be familiar with Bella, just that some decisions affect how you play both Voldemort and Voldebook. Bella was the first example of a woman that would interact with Voldemort that came to mind.

16 year old Tom was described as very charismatic... he doesn't really need to force himself on a willing participant. But yes, I imagine casual relations would interest him... and then a girl attempting to make a relationship out of it would just get a confused expression as a response.

If the Hag(s?) never bring it up then I doubt Tom would. Harry certainly wouldn't unless via accidental double-entendre or pun.

also. STRUMPET! always struck me as a funny word. might be how Tom describes them, causing Harry to giggle then ask "whats a strumpet?" inadvertently insulting the Hag.

--------------

If Tom can't control Harry directly, then he'd probably be... verbally displeased with this... in the background.

...speaking of verbal... this IS book 2. aka "the year Harry freaked everyone out with foreign language skills" Maybe the Hag has a snake? Having her pet snake start strangling her while he makes his escape would be within Harry's skill set. It'd be weird if the snake either was, or has met, the snake Harry freed from the zoo, but could lead to a number of various "what the hell are you/he talking about" conversations between Tom and Harry on the way out the door when the snake starts talking about repaying his debt.... in spanglish no less.

--------------

Also, when backed into a corner Harry has already established a knack for casual violence in burning Quirellmort to ash. Add Tom into the mix and set the oven to 'comedy', and his escape may as well involve Harry accidentally murdering the Hags in some spectacularly gruesome fashion that makes Tom uncomfortable, temporarily causing them to trade their traditional conversation roles.

** I'm pretty sure this is unhelpful, but I've had this phrase stuck in my head for weeks now: "I'll Huffle and I'll Puff and I'll (blow/burn) your house down!" Burn just sounds better to me, but blow is more true to the original 3pigs story.
