[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11126195/1/No-Competition]] linkffn(11126195) Very nice. Pros: Very smart, sweet, good natured story. Harry is 'Dark' in the sweetest way possible, and the main 'Dark' characters are a delicious combination of smart, snarky and totally lovable. The uplifting, fun spirit of the story reminds me a lot of the stories of corvusdraconis (my fav author). Cons: Too short. No sequel posted yet.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
