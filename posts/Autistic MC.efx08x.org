Hey, folks! I am thinking about writing a fanfic, where the MC is autistic. I haven't seen many fics in this area, haven't seen any on reddit, at least. As far as I know, not many people know much about autism, unless they themselves have it, or someone they know does. It would be great to inform people about what an autistic person goes through, and what the struggles would be at Hogwarts.

This makes me sound like the angry mother of an autistic child. But really, it would be interesting. As someone with aspergers, it would be good if I myself wrote it. But, I am really bad at creating stories. If anyone wants to take up on this mess, go ahead! And if not, understandable, have a good day.

i'm very nervous about posting this- oH, dEaR mErliN, hErE i gO...

  Dropped alone in a world of magic that seems strangely familiar, I must take up arms to save the day-or I could just tell Dumbledore and let him deal with it? Yeah, I prefer that idea. A Harry Potter Self-Insert fic.

This story isn't a hp fanfic, but it is a really good story with a high-functioning autistic teenage wizard for a main character. I don't think he is ever diagnosed, but the signs are extremely evident if you know what to look for. I don't think I've read a better book with a high functioning autistic character, most works just portray autism as either Sheldon Cooper, or it being such a serious problem that they can't function, rather than what it is, a personality type

*** Autism isn't a personality type, speaking as someone who has been professionally diagnosed. It's a developmental condition that affects many parts of a person's life and has varying levels of severity.

**** I have also been professionally diagnosed, and when I say that Autism is a personality type I mean that it isn't some kind of disease that can be cured (it really annoys me that so many people talk about autism like it's a mental disease) it is just being wired a little differently. I have had a lot of problems because of my autism, but it is also a core part of who I am, and if given the option I would not choose to have been born 'normal'.

Calling it a "personality type" is really condescending though, especially from neurotypical or higher functioning people. It shames people who need additional care or disability accommodations, including myself. I wouldn't choose to be born without autism, but it's not my personality. I think it's better to use the "neurodiversity" terminology than something that divisive.
