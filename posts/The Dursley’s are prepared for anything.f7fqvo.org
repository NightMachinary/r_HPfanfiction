I had a dream.... So Petunia sees her orphaned nephew and decides to take him in...but she's not here for that freaky stuff, the world is already dangerous as it is. So to prepare for wizards coming to her household or the Cold War becoming a physical, she becomes a Prepper. I'm talking full on shit. Vernon and Petunia go hunting with the kids. They all know how to fight. They have pepper spray disguised as hand sanitizer. Petunia has extra bobby pins in her hair, emergency money in her bra, the works. Point is Hagrid meets a very different Harry Potter.

In fact the story could be canon compliant until the Dursley's feel the need to become survivalists after Dudley's pigtail. I don't know. Good night and thank you for attending my ted talk.


** Hunting in the UK and in Europe in general is a very very different business from hunting in US/Canada.

Hunting in the UK and Europe is an elite pasttime for the wealthy (like playing polo), not something low-income people do to bring food on the table. You need vast areas of wooded areas to hunt in, which in on an overcrowded island such as Britain come at a high price.

As a result only the upper classes who hold ancestral lands (nobility, royals, landed gentry, etc) and their associates from second- and third generation "new" money can afford to hunt in the UK.

Prepping in the UK would look a bit different from prepping in the US/Canada. The most likely scenario for a middle-class family like the Dursleys would be that they become tenants on a farmhouse and start to farm to be self-sufficient. I can easily see Petunia spending 18+hours each day preserving food in jars, making jam, drying veggies, etc.

(Think of the Burrow in the movies, just with a significantly larger garden for potatoes and veggies.)

*** I'm Nigerian, so hunting isn't something we actively do. We just mind our business until a holiday comes. Like let's say Christmas is approaching, we need a Christmas Goat. So we go out and buy a goat or just take one off the road, feed it well and then on Christmas Eve we take an axe to its neck. Bam! Christmas Goat!

But I'm also a dual citizen and I lived in the US for a few years so I understand what you're trying to say. I just wanted to talk about hunting in Nigeria. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**** I get it. I too want to talk about my grandparents who inherited a small market garden and house from my 2xgreatgrandfather and essentially had two jobs: running the market garden and orchard while working 9-5 in a department store. Before WWII my 2nd greatgrandfather could live from the income he made from his market garden and orchard, but after WWII the main reason my grandparents kept it was bc WWII had made them food insecure and bc it saved them money on food as well as providing a small additional income.

**** My parents used prepping as an excuse to go absolutely nuts and hoard enough shit to get me and my siblings almost taken by cps.
