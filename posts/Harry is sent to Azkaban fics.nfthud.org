Preferably with no bashing. I don't particularly care if it has any romance or not.

This is one of the better ones I've come across, although (as one would expect from a Harry-goes-to-Azkaban fic) it is incredibly depressing for most of its current length. I believe the author is on hiatus, but it's left off at a decent place for now, so I'll throw it out there.

  Harry never killed or tortured anyone, yet they convicted him for the crimes and sentenced him to life in Azkaban. His friends believe him guilty, the Ministry is more corrupt than anyone realizes and Voldemort is closing in. When the Order comes across info that only Harry can help them with, they need to furlough the prisoner for his help. Can they trust him? Can he trust them?

Can't remember if he's in Azkaban or a different prison; doesn't matter.
