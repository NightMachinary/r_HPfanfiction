*** Is this one being updated at all? I feel like I've seem it started three or four different times (by three or four different authors), but it ended up being abandoned every time. I always liked what there was so far, but then it ended just as it was getting really good.

  Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.

#+begin_quote
  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. New tasks.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.
