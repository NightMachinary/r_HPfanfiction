Does anyone have favorite fanart or fanartists that do art based on fanfictions? Sometimes I love drawing things along those lines because it's relaxing, but then I feel like they must never see the light of day, ha ha.

Along the same lines, does anyone else here like to do fanart of fanfiction? If you do and you have any pieces posted somewhere I'd totally love to see them.


** Recently someone posted /The Awakening/ in here.

The version on AO3 has fanart interspersed in the story.

It's pretty great.

** She doesn't do Harry Potter fan art anymore but I've loved Makani's art for years... It can be hard to track her HP stuff down in one place though since her site (Acciobrain) is no more

**** I love her Narcissa-- especially since the movie casting/costuming was so abysmal. Makani's version is so much more accurate.
