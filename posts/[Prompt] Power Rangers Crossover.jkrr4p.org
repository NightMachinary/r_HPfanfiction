Harry and his friends are sent to an alternate dimension, where there is no magic but where Dumbledore (who is a face trapped on a huge tube) can give people badass dinosaur robots.

Tube-Dumbledore chooses Harry and his friends to oppose Voldemort and Bellatrix (who in this reality live in the moon and can engorgios magical monsters from afar).

Harry is chosen as the Blue Ranger. Ron as the Red Ranger. Luna as the Pink Ranger. Dean as the Black Ranger and Cho as the Yellow Ranger.

Draco is the mysterious Green/White Ranger.

Harry and co need to defeat Voldemort and return to their own reality before it's too late.

Bonus Points if the team realizes the Tubembledore is kind of a racist here in picking their colors.

Doble bonus is he is actually openly racist but Harry and his friends know they have to work with him either way.

**** Well, Power Rangers has quite a bit of magic in it. The amount of magic varies from season to season, but there's almost always some of it around. I think it's mostly just Rita, Zed, and Zordon in MMPR. But Mystic Force, for example, had a ton of magic in it.
