:END:
I recently read that people with BPD have an unclear or “shifting” sense of self and personality. Just thought this might be an actual reason for being a multianimagus rather than “OMG Harry so PowERFuL!!!”

And I guess having Dissociative Identity Disorder would be one too. I actually wrote a fic like that on my Ao3 page if you guys are interested I'll post it as a self-promotion. It isn't finished and might never be due to lack of inspiration and me losing the booklet I wrote my story notes in. Maybe I'll continue when I find the booklet.


** I got a comment alert but now I can't see it. It said something like "I love when troupes commonly...."

*** Sometimes they show up (much) later, but if the person deleted the comment it might not.
