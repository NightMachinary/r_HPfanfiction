Many of you may know Kevin Price, known in the fan fiction community as Paladeus has passed away.

A few moments ago a member posted the following request on a number of Facebook pages regarding fanfiction. (AO3 writers page, Fanfic.net writers unite and one other)

#+begin_quote
  "I can't say much because of it being investigated for possible murder, but I have been asked if any of you knew or talked to Kevin Price or he was otherwise known as Paladeus on fanfiction.

  Now I know that you might not know him, but if you did, his father wants to know if you knew if his son was up to, and what he talked to you about recently, or if he talked to you about what he has planned recently."

If you have any information I urge you to contact the authorities. Or PM me and I will provide you with a link to the post.

I am in NO WAY connected with this. *I do not want you to give ME any information regarding this matter at all.* This is just a PSA.


** Haven't heard of him/didn't know his penname but thank you for passing the info. Goof luck, Mr Price and RIP, Kevin Price. I hope they will find out what happened.
