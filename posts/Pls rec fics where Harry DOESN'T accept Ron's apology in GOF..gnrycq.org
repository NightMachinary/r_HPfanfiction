I do not like Ron Weasley and my reasons why are valid. That said, I can usually set aside my dislike for him so I can enjoy fics where he has a significant presence. At the moment however, I'm feeling a deep need for fics where he gets told off for being a backstabbing twat over the Goblet of Fire bs.

If the fic also has Hermione joining Ron and not becoming Harry's friend again, I'll accept that too. I want drama basically.

Please No: Drarry or Hinny fics.

It's not precisely what you want, but everything you're after is there.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
