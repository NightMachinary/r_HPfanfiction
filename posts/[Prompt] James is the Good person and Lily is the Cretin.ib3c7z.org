I've posted before about hating how Lily is treated like a Demigod of goodness, so I'm now prompting writers to write stories where Lily isn't just a bad mom but she's decided the worst parent and person.

It can be that Lily sent Harry to the Dursley's while James is in a Coma, it can be that Lily steps aside and had no plan which killed Harry and now James has to go Punisher on the DEs, it can be that Lily Cheats on James and James has to raise his son with her to just be a better person (honestly it's annoying to read stories where Lily cheats and then gets mad at James for not wanting to raise her lovers son as James's heir). It can be something like a WCWL where Lily gets caught up in the idea of her child being special while James remains a great father to both his children.

This is the Awesome Dad James Challenge


** I see a version that would work easily.

Lily was the more mature one in canon and felt James needed to grow up. That was because she felt he needed to set his childish pranks aside take things to the next level.

She was a high functioning sociopath who Snape was constantly running interference on.

Think about it, Petunia was obviously crazy as fuck. I mean who locks a child in a cupboard? It ran in the Evans family.

So Snape hated James because he was sure the man wouldn't be able to reign in the insanity that was Lily Evans.

He hates Harry because he sees flashes of Lily hidden under the Potter charm. He is genuinely afraid the boy is another dark lord in the making. Much like Lily would have likely wound up becoming.

His constant attacks on James was him trying to push him away from Lily for the betterment of the world.

*So I present snippets of the true story of Lily Evans in school.*

"I agree they need to be taught a lesson Lily. However gutting the Slytherin quidditch team, no matter how easy it would be to do, is not an appropriate response!"

Severus ran his hand through his hair as he tried to explain once again proportional response to Lily.

He had desperately prayed to the gods that she would have been in the same house as him. If only to keep the body count down.

It was their third year and so far he had managed to keep the body count down to single digits.

Though using Professor McDermott as fertilizer, he had been their herbology professor, had been a battle he had given up the first lesson.

The man was a mysgoinst and Lily was rather insane on women's rights. Their primary school had been nearly seventy percent female by the time she left. The rest had moved or moved on to the next life by then.

Lily just didn't understand why Severus was being so obstinate about this!

"Severus, they called me a stupid woman who was best skipping class and living with the house elves!"

He sighed as he knew they would be needing a new quidditch team soon.

"Goddamnit Lily! I told you to talk to me first before you did anything like this!"

She had snuck into his room tonight and dragged him to see her newest work.

There was a series of books screaming in pain as they were laid out on the table.

She had done some extremely dark transfiguration and turned four Ravenclaws into living books.

They were fully aware from what he could tell and in considerable amounts of pain he guessed.

He had grown numb to this bullshit and opened the book labeled Jerkins.

Line after line in the book were pleas to let her die. He closed the book as he closed his eyes.

"The bookworms are now books! It's perfect Severus! Can't you see the beauty?"

He knew that tone, it was rare that it came out but it was one that he had grown to fear. It meant his life was on the line here as she was deep into the Evans madness.

Steeling himself he opened his eyes and smiled.

"Of course Lily, I just wish you hadn't left me out. Remember that's why you promised? So you could share any beauty you wanted to make."

That was one hell of a lie, but it usually allowed him to drastically reduce the damage done.

She looked abashed and scuffed her shoe on the floor as she realized she had denied her friend the chance to create beauty as well.

She would hate to be left out and it would set a bad precedent. She perked up as an idea came into being.

"Sorry Severus, I promise to make it up to you!"

She turned on her heel and vanished out the door before he could respond.

Severus felt his eyes widen in response to realizing what was going to likely happen.

She was going to sneak into Ravenclaw tower and kidnap someone else tonight.

"Shit."

"You fucking crazy mudblood!"

Severus felt his blood chill as he realized what he had said.

He had called her a mudblood sure. She didn't give a fuck about that and he knew it.

No he had crossed the line, he had called her crazy.

He begged for forgiveness and knew none would be coming.

His only chance of surviving was to throw his hat fully into the ring of this new Dark Lord Voldemort.

Fuck, at least he only cast the torture curse at those how failed him.

Lily had grafted ten students together a few months ago and turned them into a giant squid releasing the unholy abomination into the Black Lake.

He was fucked.

**** I picture Severus going all out to save her as she saved him from his abusive father at a young age.

Here the scene roughly:

Six year old Severus held in his tears as he held his hand to his arm. The bruise that man, not his father, no never that, had given him stung horribly.

He heard a shuffle and looked to to see a thin red haired girl looking at him. She was from that family that had moved in down the street last month.

She saw his hurt arm and moved closer to him. He went to ask her what she wanted when he saw she was holding several large kitchen knives stuffed into her belt.

"Why do you have so many knives?"

The question came out near emotionless as he was in shock somewhat over the pain and the strange sight before him.

She tilted her head and the somewhat gentle look faded like someone pouring water on a painting.

She had a wide grin and a crinkle to her eyes. Like he pictured Santa had, one filled with joy and happiness.

They were bright green eyes that spoke to him of fun to be had.

"Well if one gets stuck you need two. If two get stuck you need three."

He nodded along that made sense. He ignored his hurting arm and walked over to her counting the knives she was carrying.

"Well if eight get stuck then we should use fire I think."

He knew that stabbing a board wasn't a good thing but it sounded nice and violent to him right now. Setting it on fire afterwards would be cool as well.

For some reason that made her smile light up even more. Like she was Santa and was also getting present this year.

"Do you know a place to go? I just moved here."

He was about to suggest a back alley not far away, he liked to hide there sometimes, when that man came out.

"Oh look the little sissy boy has a sissy little girlfriend. Oh, what need a little girl to protect you huh?"

That man was drunk obviously again and was getting awfully close.

"Come here girly and put those knives away."

She smiled even more and skipped forward taking one of his hands with her. She dragged him close to the man and stopped.

Tilting her head she held the knife before speaking.

"My mom says I shouldn't hurt people unless they ask me to go with them. And you just did, so this is going to hurt you."

That man was trying to make sense of what she was talking about when he found his stomach full.

A 10 cm kitchen blade was shoved into his stomach and he was collapsing around the blade on the ground.

She took out another two knives and handed one to her new friend.

"Looks like one got stuck. Good thing I have more! Let's play okay?"

She turned towards him and smiled again.

It was that same smile, the one filled with joy and happiness. They spoke of pure fun to be had.

She stabbed that man in the foot and laughed as he screamed in pain. The blade had wedged in between the bones in his foot and was stuck as well. She laughed as she grabbed another.

"I'm really unlucky this time, stuck two times in a row! So unfair!"

Severus realized she was absolutely deadly, the type of person they told you to run and tell the bobbies about.

The type of person who had handed him a knife and stabbed the person he hated more than anything in the world.

The type of person he realized was the greatest hero in the world.

She was his hero.

Stabbing that man in the arm, where his arm hurt still he turned and pulled it out looking at the girl.

He noticed the blood on the knife matched her hair and blurted out the next part.

"Your hair is pretty like the blood and I love you."

He blushed and turned away stabbing that man again. His hatred of that man, and embarrassment of his words, being cut loose literally as he stabbed the shoulder again.

"I'm Lily, I think you're pretty cool."

"Thanks, you're really cool. I'm Severus."

He stabbed again and could feel himself relax somehow as all his hatred of that man was plunged back into that man with each stab.

His mother arrived home soon and managed to save that man from dying. That man had never been alone in the same room as either of them again.

Severus also always carried an excellent knife from his mothers old potions kit he had found after that as well.

Lily was the c-word, he wasn't allowed to say the c r a z y word outloud. But she was his friend and had saved him from that man. So he kept her from getting into trouble. Mostly by helping her learn to be sneaky.

He had gotten good at that before, always sneaking around so that man hadn't noticed him before.

Now he was teaching it to her so she could kidnap Marcus Kennedy and cut off his thumbs.

She had even found and dyed a wool bag black to put over his head.

Still she was his friend and protector, so he would always be her friend and protector as well. Even if he had to protect her from herself.

A/N: wanted to give a new spin on the whole "you have your mother's eyes" thing. As in you have the eyes of a sociopath who would warmly smile in joy as they gleefully slaughtered me.

About 5-10k words still to go. After that I have a story I promised to work on. This seems like a good take time off and slowly build individual scenes up together thing.

Will do so and send you a link once I got it going. Picturing lots of shortish chapters, each one a different scene of Lily.

** I had an idea back then that Lily and Petunia's mum encouraged both girls to marry "up" in society, to someone who could give them a sense of stability and normalcy. Which is why Lily eventually threw Snape out of her life and married James (a "normal" wizard) while Petunia married Vernon.

I could notch it up and say that had Lily lived, she would eventually became obsessed with keeping up to whatever vague standards of normal there were for wizards.
