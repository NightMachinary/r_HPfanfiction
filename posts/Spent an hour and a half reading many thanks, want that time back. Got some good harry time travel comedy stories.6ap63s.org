That aren't black comedy or whiskey time travel? I want snarky harry sent back in time by accident, no going back to fix shit on purpose.


** Ahh yeah this fic gets linked a lot, but I can't remember if I've read it. No promises on quality.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** linkffn(A Jaunt Through Time) Though it's not your usual "Harry wakes up as his younger self," it still fits and is definitely worth the read if you haven't yet.

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

*** They can fix once they're there but it can't be their goal to go back, it shouldn't be theor goal in the first place. And i tried that one before. It was not something I enjoyed.
