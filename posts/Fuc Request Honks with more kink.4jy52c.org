*** I completely agree, but I'd say the issue is larger as magic in general is rarely used in an 'adventurous' fashion.

*** In one story (I think it was linkffn(A Black Comedy) but I'm not sure), Harry jokes that he prefers Tonks' real form, which is (I can't remember the details, but something like) a four-legged hairless albino midget. It's got a lot of general Honks, iirc, but no explicit content.

**** In the same fic, Harry describes sex with Tonks to Sirius, including having a wardrobe change with a macguffin called "chameleon cloak" that lets her change outfits too. Wonderful mental images without being explicit.

** linkffn(Renegade Cause)

This isn't primarily a romance fic (I generally don't read those), but it has what you request: Harry/Tonks with a twist.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.
