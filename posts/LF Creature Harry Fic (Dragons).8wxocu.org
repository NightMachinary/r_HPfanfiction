I started reading this a few months ago, stopped and then lost the bookmark :(.

Anyway. What I remember is that Harry is a magical creature of some sort. Inheritance I think. Pretty sure he had wings/ was able to transform into a dragon type creature.

Harry also had to build a circle of mates. There were different names for different positions in the circle and I believe he started out with Draco. I think the species he was also had a different world they could travel too.

Also, I remember a character that lived underwater and was rude, and also owned a water snake/dragon thing he had to train. But Harry was attracted to him even though he was a different kind.

Oh and I think Harry was abused too.

Vague enough? Lol I really want to find it again. I think it was on archiveofourown.

EDIT: Harry also got to know other mated circles too. There was some political stuff as well...pretty sure.


** I really hope you mean there be dragons harry, its an amazing and long fic that completely matches your descriptions with a mating circles and different positions within it, a whole seperate world with intricate political relations between the different social groups and species. The only difference is that draco has a mating group of his own with snape, and harry starts off with theo and charlie. In any case if this isn't the one you're looking for it's definitely worth a read!
