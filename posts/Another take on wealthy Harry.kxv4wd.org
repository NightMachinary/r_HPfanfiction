This can be seen as both a request and a prompt.

Are there any fanfics out there where Harry is independently wealthy, not because he's Lord Manynames, but because he was the reason Lord Voldemort was defeated? We know Voldemort and the Death Eaters wiped out many wizarding families. Imagine people who are the last of their families bequeathing their assets to Harry Potter. They may have different motivations - some may be avoiding their assets being seized by the Ministry when they were really the last of their line, some may be giving their assets to the little Potter so they won't be inherited by extended family who fought on the side of the Death Eaters. Some may not leave everything to Harry, but just leave him something to show their appreciation of him ending Lord Voldemort's reign of terror, or because they knew his parents and want to do something for the poor little orphan, etc. Some of the inheritances may be left as trusts, others outright, it doesn't really matter.

And of course, there are people who would celebrate the little savor's birthday by sending him gifts or cards or money. And because no-one knows where the Boy-Who-Lived lives, they have to go through Gringotts where the goblins, not knowing the boy's whereabouts either, just collect everything he's given into his vault. It all starts adding up. So while Harry grows up with the Dursleys, hidden from the Wizarding World, his wealth and assets keep growing and when he finally re-enters the Magical World, he's rich, famous, may own multiple houses, maybe even house-elves, etc and he only just finds out about it all.


** I know I've seen a few fics like this, but I couldn't tell you what any of them are because I've immediately dropped them all for following the same "Welcome to Gringotts, here's a list of all your vaults, lordships, special abilities, magical blocks, and marriage contracts" cliches.

*** Yeah, I was kind of hoping to avoid inherited political clout and special abilities, etc. It's just that the premise, to me, kind of makes sense. People who lost their own heirs in the war leaving everything to the one who ended the war. People wondering how their little hero is doing when he's living away from the magical world and the limelight and sending Harry gifts for birthdays or other notable dates (holidays? maybe the anniversary of Voldemort's defeat / his parents' deaths, etc), leaving him smaller bequeaths in their wills to show their appreciation.

**** It definitely does make sense that that might happen. The problem is that it's hard to build a story off of that idea. Inheriting a bunch of money doesn't exactly kick off a plot when the character in question is already rich. Especially since he didn't do much with his money in canon to begin with. Inheriting more than just money, like artifacts and titles, gives more plot hooks to work with, but then we're right back to where we started with the cliches. I think that at best, it's an idea that can be included as a minor detail in a story, but won't really have any effect.

I know I have also seen a few stories where Harry gets ahold of all the mail he should have received since Voldemort's first death. That does give a bit more to work with, but I think that it tends to be, at best, another way to bash Dumbledore and show that Harry is nice.

Ultimately, the problem is that any story that you could derive from this premise could also work just as easily with Harry inheriting from his parents, the Peverells, or any other ancestors you want to give him, and that's how pretty much everyone chooses to write those stories.

Maybe there could be a story where someone (and it would probably be Dumbledore, because that's how these stories always go) is able to take control of the Potter vault, but not the money that was left specifically to Harry. Or maybe your typical Potter twin WBWL story where James and Lily cut Harry from the family and leave him with nothing, but a bunch of money was left to "the defeater of Voldemort" instead of to the other twin by name, so Harry still gets rich. But in both cases, the fact that inheritance happens pretty automatically makes it a bad solution narratively, so Harry's presumed poverty is immediately invalidated as a problem, and you're basically left with nothing but extra bashing fuel.

** I am unaware of whether there is a specific law in Britain, but as far as I'm aware, in commonwealth countries, if an offence is committed, money taken is imposed as a penalty or fine, and paid to the state not the victim.

Also that in the event an individual who has committed offences against the state is deceased, then his charges and liabilities die with him and cannot be taken up against his heirs, so it isn't allowed by the government to confiscate the property and money.

I'm not too sure about Economic offences but I think it might apply there as well, because I haven't come across an instance where a deceased debtor's estate was auctioned off or confiscated in a commonwealth country, in my limited experience.

So is it actually possible in Britain to confiscate property and wealth like that? I'm just asking for clarification.

** Closest I've got is one where the Potter fortune was spent in the war to support the Order. All that Harry had left was what James hadn't had time to spend. Eventually though the characters find the place where all of Harry's mail has been redirected over the years and go through it, finding a large number of gifts, including money, as well as a few bequeathals.
