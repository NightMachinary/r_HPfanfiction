The family that lived at Bumblebee Cottage was the least ordinary family you'd expect to meet. They were even proud of this fact, being the last people involved in the normal and mundane, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. The neighbors didn't even notice them, not because they were ignoring the family of their own free will, but because of this strange energy that came from the house itself. 

An Indian Harry Potter's Slytherin Sister fic that is currently incomplete and in need of critiquing maybe. The paragraph above is the first paragraph of the story. Contact me if you're interested in being a beta reader for this story?


** If you aren't getting any responses here, you might wanna try the Beta Exchange over at [[/r/Fanfiction][r/Fanfiction]]. It's a weekly thread where you ask for betas.

There's also the beta function on FFNet (in the top bar - browse, community, forums, etc).
