Harry Potter has his obligatory Vault meeting at Gringotts and becomes a very rich young lad.

He immediately decided to purchase a Muggle house and is advised to head to a nearby IKEA in order to pick out some furniture...

Three months later he escapes SCP-3008, the first of the "anomalies" the young trouble magnet (who would later be classified as a Thaumiel) stumbles his way in and out of. Some of them previously discovered by this mysterious Foundation and a lot of them quite new to them...

His employment was considered an absolute necessity, as regardless of the scale of the anomaly (or the intention of Harry or the Foundation) every SCP he encounters is classified as "Neutralised" shortly after Harry encounters them.


** Except 682. Nothing can neutralise 682.

*** He'd been "employed" by the Foundation for nearly two years at this point. A myriad of MTF's either in his command or vicinity whenever he went out of the house, in some shape or form.

To a degree, he was allowed to just live his life. However, as proven a million and one times, his tendency to simply stumble on anomalies whilst minding his own business had lead to operatives (usually Last Hope or members of Red Herrings) following him at all times.

As he'd told his teachers years before, he didn't go looking for trouble, it just seemed to find him. Something he knew to be (in far more "scientific" terms) a quantifiable effect that the Foundation had documented somewhere. Having given HIM a number a long time ago, assigned with his initial object class of Euclid then Thaumiel.

Now, though he didn't go looking for trouble usually, he'd spotted it on the news and confirmed it with his current 'handlers' when he'd made initial contact. An Auror group, lead by a familiar pink haired woman, had caught a very familiar looking creature on the outskirts of Hogsmeade.

The un-killable creature had been Harry's only "failure" as a Thaumiel. Never before or since had he encountered an SCP whose anomaly had not ceased due to his interaction with it.

- 3008 had spat out the remaining humans and become an utterly "normal" furniture store after Harry's frightened squeak of "Fiendfyre".

- 096 burnt to cinders the moment he came into physical contact with him.

- 073 gleefully tended to potter plants in his containment quarters after the two had simply read a Herbology text Neville sent for his birthday. Last he saw of Cain he was spouted a bruised cheek and glittering smile after bumping into a D Class and falling to the floor.

He'd gotten to a point where he expected to Neutralise anomalies, yet... the Killing Curse he'd flung at 682 nine months prior had failed to keep it down.

It had worked on 173, the statue having remained inert for 18 months so far. Even with D-Class personnel made to spend the night in its presence.

Yet 682 had gotten back up after the Killing Curse was flung its way, barely down for five minutes. It had no resistance to the other two however, held in place by Harry's very brief (more curious and experimental) Cruciatus and being lead back to containment by the young wizards Imperio [a horrifying reality Harry lived in, where he so easily and regularly exercised the spells of his enemies]...

Of all the SCP's he'd had the displeasure of coming across, he'd been most intrigued by 682. One of the few he'd actively considered WANTING to Neutralise and */'knowing'/* how to do so...

He knew that was what the Foundation eventually wanted of him, he'd heard whispers that the 05 Council were fielding the idea of making an MTF for him, specifically to put him into active duty (only held back by the fact his very presence went against their mission statement). Thus, he felt no real qualms with what he was about to do.

He coordinated with the rest of the team, the group fanning out to drop the nearby Aurors and administer the memetic agents, choppers already inbound to begin returning 682 to temporary containment. All whilst Harry sidled up to it.

Harry's own idea was simple, the focus of the Foundation (andcother forces) had been on destroying the thing before it devoured anyone else. The containment of such a gigantic, monstrous entity difficult enough, let along when it kept escaping. So Harry would focus on making that containment a little... simpler.

In his hand was a box, a glass box. The item actually too large to fit comfortably in his palm, requiring his right to stabilise it.

He had meant to make it more ceremonial, but it seemed 682 caught a glimpse of the contents before Harry was ready to show it off. The pulling against the conjured ropes and chains ceased as the creature became incredibly stiff.

Petrified. A Basilisk eye viewed through three sheets of glass, petrifying the target rather than killing them. He was punished for his "improvised" methods, but it was a mere slap on the wrist compared to the reward and compensation he recieved.

Securing something that large and dangerous would never be "easy". But if it was entirely unable to move, it took a lot of the danger out of it.

Containing him was far easier, the being not moving meant feeding and experimentation became a lot simpler and easier.

And everyone and everything (including SCP-682) were much better protected as a result of the being being (effectively) Neutralised...

He hoped to use the eye on the Old Man next...
