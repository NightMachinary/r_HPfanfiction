"And next on the docket would be the trial of Lucius Malfoy, on charges of murder, torture, use of blackest arts, sedition and man leser charges." spoke Albus Dumbledore, presiding over the trials in his capacity as Chief Warlock.

"He's pardoned" interrupted Minister Bagnold.

"Pardon me?" asked Dumbledore, surprised.

"I've pardoned him. Nott, Yaxley and Parkinson as well. They've been under Imperius Curse, surely they can't be blamed for the atrocities commited while they were trapped under the yoke of that vile curse!" she continued.

Dumbledore was stunned. It was a disaster. It was true that the Minister of Magic could pardon anyone, but did the fool woman not know what she'd done? Voldemort was still out there and if all those wealthy and influential men were allowed to go free? Without so much as a slap on the wrist? Forget a fighting chance, when he returned the Dark Lord would have the British Isles served up to him on a silver platter.

"Quite right, quite right" agreed Dumbledore, while behind his gentle smile his thoughts raced. Wizengamot members. Ministry officials. Aurors. Wealthy landowners. Sponsors. So much influence... There had to be a way to somehow salvage this...! And then it hit him.

"In that case, in the light of this new development there is just one matter to attend to today.

Fellow members. We have just barely managed to put behind us perhaps the darkest period in living memory. Though we have triumphed, it was at a great cost. Many noble bloodlines have been extinguished. Many have given their lives for a better tomorrow. Many have been corrupted by the most wicked of sorceries.

It is only by sheer happenstance that we have survived. Even those sitting among us didn't survive unscathed. There are here those, who had succumbed to the insidious danger of the Imperius Curse. Those who are to sit here with us and decide the future of wizardkind, as is our right, had been compromised!

How can they help us guide our brethen if their thoughts can be replaced? If their wills can be bent? They've been targeted once already because of their prestigious positions and their great burden and duty.

Never again, I say!

Today I propose the first of laws that will safeguard our future! The Imperius Political Excemption Act!"

Dead silence.

//////////////////////////////

So things like:

+ If you've been under Imperius, then you can't sit on Wizengamot or appoint a proxy. The seat will be counted as abstaining until passed on.

+ You may not assume any leadership position or run for any Ministry office.

+ If signing a contract, a Ministry representative shall be dispatched to check for signs of dark magic or impaired judgement.

+ It is the recommendation of Wizengamot and the Ministry that you pass control of businesses or similar assets onto a heir or another eligible relative at the soonest opportunity.

/////////////////////////////

Just a "well meaning", "concerned" and "benevolent" Dumbledore utterly gutting political capital of Imperius victims. How would you approach this topic? How would you formulate such a bill (so that no one could question it without drawing suspicion to their pardon)?


** I like it. I don't know if Dumbledore would actually manage to get it made law, but I would be interesting in finding out.

I don't know if occlumency actually helps to resist the imperius or not but I think if this law passed you'd see a resurgent interest in the mind arts.

** Unless you want the story to focus on the trials themselves, you could have this scene happen off-screen and then make use of Daily Prophet articles to give the readers snippets about it. Something like McGonagall reading the newspaper and commenting on how enraged the purebloods were. That's how I'd do it because I wouldn't know what to write during the blank period until Harry started at Hogwarts.

But if the trials are the focus of your story, make the members of the Wizengamot whose relatives had been killed by Death Eaters to vehemently refuse accepting them being pardoned so easily for their crimes.

Focus on creating a climate that would allow Dumbledore to take advantage of it. Make the light faction use the mass media to make the public opinion hate on Death Eaters (which would be easily achieved after such a cruel war). Make the light faction protest vehemently against the former DE and shout for them to be thrown into Azkaban.

If you create the right situation, you will have 2 camps:

- the 'light faction' which will push for former DE to be thrown into Azkaban

- the 'dark faction' which would do anything to escape Azkaban

While both of these camps refuse to yield, Dumbledore will come up with a compromise: former DE that claimed imperious will not be thrown in Azkaban but they will lose all their political power for the reason that they are weak willed and not apt to lead the country.

In this situation, both the light and the dark faction will take what they can get rather than start another war. That said, it's very important to create the right climate. Otherwise, Dumbledore's proposition would logically be rejected if it came out of nowhere.

** If I remember correctly, wasn't there dozens of legitimate cases of the Imperius curse too? My personal headcanon as to why the Death Eaters' Imperius defence worked was because it wasn't possible to punish them for it without having to punish the many who were infact under the Imperius. Besides wasn't resistance to the curse rather rare among the common populace too? It would be unfair to punish someone for not being able to resist it if that is the case.

Yes, there were. Sirius said that during the first war you didn't know who was friend and who was enemy because everyone could have been a spy or a victim of the imperius curse.

Crouch as Moody also told the class that it was "a pain in the ass" to figure out who was really under the curse and who was just using the excuse to escape Azkaban.

** Neat idea.

Unless I'm remembering wrong, aren't most people unable to resist the imperius? In GoF, iirc the students get better at resisting it, but that's because they're being trained to. Most people aren't. It's never implied that wizengamot members, MoMs, etc. are trained to resist the imperius. So Dumbledore's opponents could argue that the bill would force all but a few people out of their positions, which would cause chaos.

Perhaps Dumbledore could counter that those who are in/applying for those positions should be trained to resist the imperius. If the training succeeds, they're in -- if it fails, they're out. But then it could be argued that such training would be time- and resource-consuming, and the trainers would need thorough background checks because what if they 'forgot' to cancel the spell after a failed training session? It would all be a very involved process. I imagine Fudge would reject the idea on account of that, but I'm not familiar with Bagnold.

Skipping ahead a few years (should the bill pass and function as Dumbledore hoped), the wizarding world may face an entirely new problem. With the most politically influential figures in the wizarding world all fully capable of resisting the imperius curse, there's the possibility that someone would try and get the curse taken off the Unforgivables list due to it being 'not as threatening as it used to be'. Supposing it passes (because everyone voting on it is immune to it anyway, so why should they care), a lot of lines for abuse open up. Hopefully, misuse of the curse would still count as a criminal offense (ex: using imperius to make someone give your their money would count as theft). But what if there's a dark period of a few months where everyone's using the imperius to commit crimes before the government goes "Actually, maybe we shouldn't have legalised this. Perhaps we should do something?"

I wouldn't read a fic that's solely about this, but I think it would be an interesting sub-plot for a story set in the time period to have.

*** I feel yes and no. The problem is the way we see the Imperious work and the way it is implied to work bare almost no relation to each other. Whenever it is performed on Harry, the caster seems to have to 'hold' the curse on him while continually repeating a simple instruction. As the victim tries to resist the curse, they have a chance of messing up the order or breaking it completely, and the longer they fight against it, the weaker the curse gets. At no point do we see the effects of the curse continue after the caster has stopped actively focussing on the target or someone using the curse on multiple people at once.

The 'Imperius Defence' and hearsay from what is going on at the Ministry during book 7 implies that the Imperious acts as some sort of deep implanted programming. You can cast it once and the victim then spends months performing their job well enough that nobody notices that they are under it, yet you are completely unable to even slightly sabotage your instructions or give any clues that you are not yourself. A single caster can apparently keep up many curses for long periods without particular stress ('hundreds' of people are meant to have been cursed by Voldemort alone).

Hence, if you are claiming that you were Imperiused into helping the Death Eaters, then either you were threatened with punishments including being forced to do things under the curse, if you didn't comply, or you are so spectacularly weak willed that the curse has long lasting effects far above and beyond what it was actually meant to do.

That's actually not the case; it's noted after the Imperius Curse lesson in GoF that Ron is still skipping, despite the curse having (presumably) been lifted from him. It's part of a theme in the book suggesting that he has a weak mind - he's also badly affected by the auras of the Veela at the world cup and Fleur.

**** I don't see it as a sort of deep implanted programming. I think it's more like they're given a single, but much broader instruction, such as:

You are to continue all your daily activities in such a way so as to not raise suspicion, but henceforth you are a loyal servant of the Dark Lord. From now on, you will continue your current position and try your best to imperious others. You mustn't get caught.

Something like that. Obviously I thought of that off the top of my head, but you get the gist.

** Huh, at the start when Bagnold interrupted with 'He's pardoned', I thought that you were going to go with 'the Minister was Imperiused just to make it doubly certain the Death Eaters would get off'.\\
 \\
I don't know if this would be well-received in a normal fic; functionally, it punishes people for being the victim of a crime.\\
If someone is put under the Imperius and forced to commit a serious crime, then they're put in a lose-lose situation, where they claim Imperius (and lose their position) or go to jail (and lose their position).\\
Worse, if someone uses the Imperius for rape or other abuse, the victim can't testify against the perpetrator without, again, losing their position.\\
 \\
...In fact, that might enable Death Eaters, rather than hinder them. Sure, they can't be on the Wizengamot or in the Ministry themselves (due to Imperius), but they can still put the Imperius on whoever /is/ in the Ministry/Wizengamot; even if their victim gets out from under the Imperius for whatever reason, if they're not caught in the act doing something incriminating, they can't testify to being put under the Imperius without getting fired.\\
 \\
So...I'd probably lose that provision entirely. Avoid kicking people out of the Wizengamot or Ministry for being put under the Imperius. Arranging a standardized test for impaired judgement or mental manipulation when signing a contract is a good idea (aside from Imperius, there's Confundus, love potions, false memory charms...), and it might be good to put funds towards research and development for an Imperius screening method; if it were possible to create a warded room that jams a link between a potential victim and whoever may have Imperiused them, that could be incredibly useful.

*** But that's just it:

*If you're Joe Average, this does not change much for you.* In the Imperius scenario, you're not in a leadership position anyway. In fact, you can leverage this into some paid leave while you go to St. Mungo's. And then you return to your mundane job.

If you're an important person, you most likely can afford to retire anyway, and *if you're any kind of elected official you would have trouble getting elected again* no matter what you do, because there would always be doubt if your decisions are your own. Plus, you should get therapy.

The law would allow those dependent on public opinion to retire in a 'honorable' way, while *those with lifetime/inherited seats should not be making any kind of important decisions if they can be compromised that easily.* And they should get therapy.

Please read the provisions again: they do not affect everyday person, only those holding public offices. It's why I worded the "rich people" part as a suggestion, rather than law - it's something that normally wouldn't be suggested (socially unacceptable), and still would not be forced (because this is about ensuring competence in administration, not curtailing rights), but would allow the MoM to make allowances and smooth over the transition if someone decided to do it.

#1: This applies to using Imperius as a defence during one's trial.

#2: If someone breaks out of the curse before commiting any atrocities, the law doesn;t apply - they've proven strong-willed. Would be good if they still saw a mind healer.

#3: If they've been freed or broken out of it after being forced to do some fucked up shit, then one, they are not to be trusted with the office, and two, they should deal with the trauma of their experience instead of having to deal with the stress of their position while surrounded by mistrustful glances.

#4: If in a mere week a group of 15 year olds could learn to resist the curse (second Moody lesson), and to block it completely in about a month, with some managing it earlier, then adults looking to decide the fate of Wizarding Britain should have no trouble either. Have Aurors offer it as a course: it will look great on CV.

** This would be /massive/ bad news for the light as well, the dark might even vote for the bill just because it's so incredibly useful for them. Dark houses simply imperious a political opponent, they don't even have to make them do anything illegal, just make it blatantly obvious they were imperioused. Boom, political opponent neutralised. As for the 'imperioused' death eaters, they just step down as heads of house/wizengamot member and let first cousin XYZ take over with them controlling them from behind the scenes. They still have the same political power as before, but a highly abusable and sure-fire way to wipe political opponents off the board.

The dark would be ecstatic to abuse this bill to its extreme whereas the light houses would be unlikely to do the same.

Furthermore, in more moderate houses or houses without heirs/replacements, they'd never dare report themselves as being under the imperious for fear of losing their positions. The dark could happily imperious one of them in secret and then hold that fact over their head as blackmail to make them vote the way they want, turning their political capital to their ends instead of simply negating it.

This bill would result in imperious crimes rising /dramatically/ while being reported far, far less as a result. A semi-competent dark faction would be controlling the country in no time at all and be toasting Dumbledore's name for handing them such a potent tool to do it with.

Does his disability make him someone lesser? No, of course not!

Does it prevent him from fulfilling the minimum requirements for the job (not crashing the damn plane)? Yes. Yes it does.
