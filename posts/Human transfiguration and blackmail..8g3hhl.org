Recently I was reading a crap ton of fanfics which had the transfiguration of humans into tiny objects (like a coin). So, here you go:

The fic should involve a person/group (doesn't matter if they are light/dark/gray) transfiguring multiple other humans and holding them hostage for blackmail. Other than that, go wild with the plot +but a crackfic would be great :)+

Point of terminology: this is kidnapping, not blackmail.

*** Mm, the technical definition of blackmail is a bit vague, isn't it?

In this particular context, though, taking hostages and using them to pressure a third party, I'd probably call it extortion.

As an alternative to transfiguring someone and holding them hostage, in Blood & Honor by Simon Green, one of the antagonists, Dominic (I think that's what his name was) keeps a spy enslaved using a lethal injury; after making said injury, Dominic suppressed it with a temporary spell. If the spy doesn't satisfactorily do his work, or fails to return within 24 hours (the spell's maximum lifespan), or Dominic is killed, the wound reopens and the spy bleeds to death in a few seconds.

I actually saw something similar in a Harry Potter fanfiction I read once; after a healer from St. Mungos was killed in a Death Eater raid, Madam Pomfrey walked right up to Voldemort, called out the Death Eater who did it, then explained about how there was a contract that everyone had to sign before being magically treated, basically saying that if they hurt or killed a healer than all of the magical healing they had ever received was forfeit. Cue death of a thousand cuts as various cuts, bruises, broken bones, hex effects, etc, are un-healed all at once.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

*** It seems that /ransom/, not blackmail, might be the term OP was searching for here.
