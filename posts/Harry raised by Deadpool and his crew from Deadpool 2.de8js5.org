I dare you to think of this scenario and not come out with something hilarious. Here's something I came up with.

â€‹

The tension was palpable in the air, the crowd's cheers were deafening, the champions tense as they prepared to enter the emerald maze. Harry was focused completely on his game plan for the event until he heard the crowd go silent, then he heard.

"Whoo go, Harry, kick those little cunts asses,"

Oh god not again, please no, gods why. Harry thought as the entire groud was both disgusted and transfixed by the sight in front of them. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and shut his eyes tight trying to ward off the headache that had suddenly appeared. Cedric put his hand on Harry's shoulder in sympathy and said.

"Does this happen often," motioning to the topless, blind, black women swinging her burning bra around.

"Too often," Harry's dread seeping into every syllable.

"I feel you," Cedric motioned to his father, also topless, his chest pained with Cedric's face, the elderman's neon, flashing nipple piercings flashing yellow and black.


** Does it have to be the movie? There's a crossover with comic Deadpool, "Thinking in Little Green Boxes", which otherwise covers the prompt.

**** It isnt. Though it should be.

My theory is that the author is purposely letting this go on (A Deadpool thing to do!) Only ti come back when the Next Deadpool movie comes out in the MCU and crossovers fully.

And it wont be a chapter, just a rant and then a new chapter comes out the next day.
