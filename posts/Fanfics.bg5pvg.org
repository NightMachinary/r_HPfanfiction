Are there any fanfics where Harry Potter gets hold of Tom Riddle's diary instead of Ginny?

Don't be misled by the fav amount, it's an OC that replaces HP that has been posted in one drop. I have read it and I can confirm the fic is on the upper end of the HP fics. Maybe not the top, but definitely solid
