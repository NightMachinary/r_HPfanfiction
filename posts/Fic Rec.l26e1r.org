Does anyone have some longer fic recs that aren't Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, or Harry/Voldemort? I'm fine with almost any other pairing, I'm just not a particular fan of those, and the fandom's pretty inundated, so it can be hard to find something without those. Thanks!


** Are you ok with other slash pairings? All my favourite stories are mostly plot and story based anyway but I highly recommend these..

​

linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) -- 10/10. Harry ends up back in 1976 but doesn't find his parents. Instead ends up being dragged into the war on his own terms. Its fantastic. Theres mystery and Harry grows up and has to make choices and the characters are great and its funny and sad and terrifying at times. Couldn't recommend more.

​

linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) -- 10/10. The OG Wolfstar story but its so much more. It follows a little carehome kid Remus from 1st year to OoTP. Fully canon compliant. You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll fall in love with Grant and then cry some more. The side plots are great, the characters are great. Its all just great!

​

linkao3(Their Hiding Inside Me by TheDivineComedian) -- 10/10. Everything by TheDivineComedian is incredible you should read all their work. This one is an outside look on Sirius's family? But Regulus in it is just eugh, fantastic!!!

I have a bunch of others. Id you dont want Harry/people pairings I recommend looking at Marauder Era fanfics? Some of them are genuinely brilliant and the only real pairing you see is Wolfstar (Remus/Sirius) which sounds odd but really if you go with it, it makes PoA and OoTP WAAAY sadder stories.

*** I'm good with slash pairings. I just try to avoid what I feel to be potentially abusive relationships, where one party has been awful, hence the nixing of Draco, Severus, and Voldemort.

I just read All the Young Dudes, which rekindled my love of the HP fandom (and broke my heart), but I understand that fics of that caliber or rare.

Your recs are definitely going on the list. Thanks!

**** Their Hiding Inside Me is a Black family story which means Orion and Walburga are generally shit parents... It's a form of abusive relationship, just a warning but obviously not the same level as Voldemort/harry.

It's still brilliant! ATYD also brought me back to the fandom 😋. It's been nice! Problem is I'm stuck in a big aul marauders rut and am running out of fics to read because of it... I'm sure I'll find something 😊

***** Yeah, I'm cool with that sort of abusive relationship, because with those stories, it's falling ‘out of' rather than ‘into.'

I'm all about the fics that involve the main character rising out of bad situations and coming to terms with what they really deserve. It's cathartic.

**** Also, Here's oneshots if you want to read them:

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12391806][where there is a will]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry writes the first draft of his will when he is fourteen.
#+end_quote

I really love the trio portrayal in this. It's pretty morbid, but pretty much highlights the danger in Harry's environment for the entirity of canon.

2.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13106128/1/A-Clean-Shave][A Clean Shave]]:

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry's being an orphan has an unexpected side-effect, and Ron helps him out---learning a lesson in gratitude along the way.
#+end_quote

My favourite Harry-Ron friendship fic.

3.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry gets another chance - and another and another. At some point, they stop feeling like chances at all.
#+end_quote

(Be warned- this is pretty dark.) A unique twist to the peggy-sue time travel trope.

4.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry suffers a few side effects from dying but not dying.
#+end_quote

Trio friendship fluff. Can be read as platonic, or Harry/Hermione/Ron.

5.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916][there will come a time, you'll see]]:

#+begin_quote
  A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione.
#+end_quote

Another trio-friendship oneshot.

6.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/][Cauterize]]:

#+begin_quote
  "Of course it's missing something vital. That's the point." Dennis Creevey takes up his brother's camera after the war.
#+end_quote

This is a very popular oneshot. Post-war.

7.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/400319][Eternal Return]]:

#+begin_quote
  "For the Greater Good. Harry understands this.
#+end_quote

A creepy time-loop fic. Read the first few sentences and you'll get the main plot.

8.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11746692][Five Facts you won't find in 'Hogwarts: A History']]:

  Hello journal. Today we have a prompt. Our prompt is our favrit family tradition. I do not have a favrit family tradition because I do not have a family. Signed, Harry Potter.

  Harry Potter's third form journal. A peek at pre-Hogwarts life.
#+end_quote

My favourite pre-hogwarts fic- Harry's childhood with the Dursley's told through his third-form journal. Still a WIP, but ends at a note that feels complete.

1. [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/6246406/chapters/14311300][Not from Others]]:

#+begin_quote
  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen.
#+end_quote

Canon-compliant narration of what happened at Hogwarts while the trio were out hunting horcruxes. Ginny POV. Deals with the revival of the DA, and a few mysteries.

3.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][dead things]]:

#+begin_quote
  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.

  Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

My favourite Dark-Lord Harry fic- I try to rec this whenever I can.

A dimension travel fic, except Harry isn't the only one who travels back. (FYI: the others who travel with Harry are Ron, Hermione, Luna, Blaise and Draco.) It's a Gen-fic. (WIP)

** Okay hi. If you haven't read this one, you need to it's so great. It has two sequels, and several one shots and alternate ending things as well so it'll keep you busy for a while. I'll just link the first one.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1][The Darkness Within]]

It's basically a "What if instead of trying to kill Harry as a baby, Voldemort kidnapped him instead?" So James and Lily survive, while Harry's raised by Voldemort. I don't want to spoil anything, so let me just say it's very good and if you haven't you NEED to read it. Okay bye.

Edit: Ok here's a few more. Make sure you read the one above first, but in case you need something else.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4198643/1][Timely Errors]]

This one isn't that long, but it was decent I think. Harry time travels to when his parent's were his age for like a week.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4144226/1][Dimension Father]]

I haven't read this in a whille, but I think it was good. Harry travels to a dimension where Harry and Lily died, but James survived.
