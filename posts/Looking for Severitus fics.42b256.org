It's been a while since I've read a good Severitus: Snape as mentor / guardian / or even parent to Harry! It's especially hard to find because writers tend to go out-of-character: Snape goes soft or Harry accepts Snape as his father too easily.


** "By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept". Doesn't go easy, doesn't go quickly, lots of complications.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

*** I've read that! I liked the concept, especially Petunia getting magic, but the later chapters just seem to go totally off track. I feel like the author has written himself / herself into a rut. :(

Yoooooo this is the best Severitus I've ever read in my entire life. I will probably reread this fic one last time on my death bed. And the characterization is beyond excellent.

** linkffn(3766574) - Prince of the Dark Kingdom - sort of does this. It takes a bit to get there, and there's.... someone else.... acting as a mentor too - trying to avoid spoilers - but it's a great story even if it doesn't quite fit your criteria. It's unfinished though, alas.

** My absolute favorite is [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/gatewaygirl/BM.html][Blood Magic by Gateway Girl]]. It was written after OotP came out, but the author started work on it before that, so it's not completely canon compliant after GoF. That said, the characterizations are very accurate for having been written so early, and the author is very good at giving Harry the one-liners that he's so good at in canon.

The summary is: Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.

** If you're still looking, here are some of my absolute favorites. (Apologies if the bot doesn't work, first time thing to use it and on mobile as well)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Enemy Within) and the sequel, Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chained Souls). Two of my absolute favorites that I reread all the time; essentially very well-written AUs to HBP and DH, with very realistic Severitus.

Linkffn(The Guiltless) and the sequel, Linkffn(The Poor of God). Harry tries to cover up abuse and fails miserably; Snape's reactions to Harry suffering in these are very satisfying.

Linkffn(Never Say Remember) Alternate universes make for twice the Severitus and twice the awkwardness.

#+begin_quote
  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
