On that fateful Halloween night of 1981 when Voldemort attacked, James and Lily Potter were not home. They had left their twin boys and a house elf to tend to their needs for the evening.

When Voldemort attacked and their house elf sacrificed himself, he saw two children looking at him curiously. One was a redheaded boy with brown eyes, and the other was a black haired child with green eyes glowing with power.

Voldemort thought that this was the child of prophecy, and cast the killing curse, which rebounded off of the green-eyed boy.

Falling debris gave the redheaded boy a V on his cheek, and the other boy had a lightning bolt scar on his head.

When the Potters returned home and flooed Dumbledore to let him know what they had found, Dumbledore said that the redheaded boy, Adrian, was the boy-who-lived. He recommended that James and Lily send young Harry away to the Dursley's so they can raise Adrian as they need to.

Dumbledore had just made the most grievous mistake of his life. Never mess with the child of a protective mother. And never piss off a redhead. He had done both.

"Are you KIDDING me?! You want me to abandon MY child to those magic HATERS?! Get OUT!" She yelled at him before sending a string of hexes at him.

James chuckled in amusement at Dumbledore's misfortune, but quickly shut up so as not to draw his wife's ire as she turned her glare on him.

Lily and James decided to raise their children equally and as brothers. Because what kind of parent would abandon one child simply for seeming to not be as important to some weird old man. And never let it be said that Lily Potter was a bad mother.


** linkao3(1115311) Accurate reaction of any halfway decent (if slightly scary) magical parent to the basic premise. Also very close to 100% this prompt, minus the V-shaped scar on one of the Potter children.

If you can't tell, it's a parody of WBWL fics, while also at the same time mildly parodying the "Lily Potter is a badass" trope on the other side.

** I feel like if Harry still ended up with the Dursleys despite James and Lily still being alive, then it would've been because James and Lily sent him there, not Dumbledore. Why the hell would Dumbledore go out of his way to try and split the family up? Even if he did want to do that, then surely it would be The-Boy-Who-Lived that he'd want to take away, and not the normal brother.

**** Well yeah. I'm pretty sure that 99% of WBWL fanfics are created so that the author can bash Dumbledore, James, Lily, Harry's twin, Ron, and Hermione. Which is a shame, because WBWL fanfics done well are my favourite type of HP fanfics.

***** Got any recommendations? (Not Antithesis because it makes me cry lol). I go through the WBWL tag on AO3 every so often but I get so frustrated by all the bashing. I can pretty much tell a bashing story from the summary at this point- there's normally a ton of rhetorical questions one after the other that give away the whole plot like, “What if Harry had a brother who is raised as the boy who lived? What if Harry has a dark childhood and teaches himself all kinds of powerful magic? But what if Harry is the BWL after all?” ugh it kills me.

****** HP and the Bwl who lived which is abandoned has loving parents, a good twin brother and is really well written. It has has some good OCs.

Sarcasm and Slytherin Series is pretty good. It has pretty ridiculous bashing but there's so some excellent characterisations and character development.

Then there's Prince Of Slytherin, where again Harry is sent to the Dursleys. The first year is pretty shit but it improves extremely in the second and third years. The worldbuilding is pretty amazing and the the number of simultaneous plotlines are mind boggling

Family Bonds has a good potters and good twin with good Snape who raises Harry. It was good last I read it though abandoned.

Three Black Birds(abandoned but adopted by someone else): The negligence by the parent sis realistic and they actively attempt to make up to Harry. The chracters are fun and their interactions believable. The romance is atrocious but the story ends directly after the romance happens so you get some closure at least. It's a pretty humorous fic

Ashes Of Chaos is a pretty recent fic. Harry gets sent to the Dursleys, and the reasons given aren't particularly amazing either. But other than that, the fic doesn't bash most characters unnecessarily ( other than slight Dumbles bashing who other than that is a good character). The writing is pretty good a nd the update rate is fucking amazing. The first few chapters are shit, the first year as a whole feels very derivative of some fics but it improves immensely in second year. Also has a femvoldy

***** Yeah, WBWL fics are really nice, but often much too trope heavy to feel special. I don't seek out bashing, but I tolerate it, though some characters like Ron I try to avoid reading about. I dislike Ron a lot so I just try to ignore his presence or accept the bashing. The problem is writing a fic for the purpose of bashing makes it lose any possibility of it being really interesting

*** Because little Harry obviously died that night. The crying baby is only a vessel containing a horcrux. It's only a matter of time until the Horcrux fully takes over the body and Voldemort lives again. Best thing to do is to starve the abomination of magic by taking it out of the wizarding world.

***** Yeah I mean it is wish-fulfillment, but sometimes characters seem so far removed from their traits to be OC's, which annoys me, at least if there is no defined reason in their background that causes it, as in some fics with more world-building. I'm actually fine with some bashing to a certain extent, though I don't love it. Bashing generally takes characters and makes them caricatures, exaggerating certain characteristics while marginalizing others, but at least those traits were somewhat present. Dumbledore was manipulative, so him being bashed for that is something I can tolerate. Dumbledore being bashed for being a super dark lord rapist though? Hell nah. Best case is it is in a good fic so I'll ignore it if its a minor plot point.

*** No I know this wasn't supposed to be unique, it was just what I would imagine what the Potters would actually do if it started following all the cliches like the V scar and the Dumbledore saying send them away. If we were going based off what the characters would actually do I agree with you, I was just doing a mini-fic with the cliches until that ending part. I don't actually dislike Dumbles at all, just said it for the point of being cliche.

*** I will never understand why people have such hang ups on that man fearing woman thing part of anime culture.

Did someone hurt you in the past?

It's not meant to denote abuse, at least not all the time. Yes, it comes from a culture filled with by beta herbivore men where politeness is prized, but most of the times, it simply shows affection and is a metaphoric way of showing a more subtle interaction and dynamics between the two of them. As in, he will give way for her, and no one else, until it comes to things that really matter, where he will stand his ground.

But of course, the sheer number of macho, manly, aggressive readers (90% of which tend to be freedom shrieking Muricans) who I've had rushing in and immediately yelling "abuse", "weak ass pussy" or some other variation therewith, with a buttload of aggressiveness, seems to imply that the subtler part of the scene is completely wasted on all of you redneck wannabes.
