I saw one incomplete fic with this pairing which was really touching. I'd love to see more of this rare pair with good writing.


** Oh man you HAVE to read [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=11240][Becoming Neville]] ! It's one of my very favorite fics and it feels so much like canon even though it's not. You'll love it!

**** Don't use this link though bc the ffn version has all of the slash taken out. It is a totally different fic without the harry/Neville relationship.

****** Right!? I guess the author didn't want to turn ppl away from the mystery aspect of the fic just because of the slash - which I totally get because the mystery is really good!

** I would recommend Green and Blue. It hasn't been updated since a couple of years but it's a nice fic. I really liked the interaction between Harry and Neville. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5354181/1/Green-and-Blue]])

  ON HOLD. Thanks to a sacrifice by his closest friend Neville Longbottom, Harry is given the chance to do it all again. What will he change and what will he keep the same? And more confusingly, are his feelings for Neville more than platonic? Harry/Neville.
