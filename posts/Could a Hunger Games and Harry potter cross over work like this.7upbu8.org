I had an idea where either Voldemort, or another dark lord, sometime in the far future took over and conquered. Once the wizarding world was under his control he turned his sights to the muggles to enact his second phase of muggle subjegation. And created the Hunger Games for not only the wizarding world's entertainment but to sort out the strong "worth-ier" muggles than the other ones. Where the winners would be put into positions of power somewhat to keep the others in line, this would also pick off the lesser muggles that lost. Kind of like the puppet Minister of Magic in book 7.


** Sounds interesting. I guess with a bit of ironing up it would work.

But would muggles know who the elite really are?

*** Know they'd only know the winners but the winners would just be obliviated and imperio'd, except the really high up ones who would be death eaters

** I had a somewhat similar idea a few weeks ago (exam times brings out the best of us), but I don't think I have the guts to actually write something like that.

My idea might be a bit AU regarding magic, and revolves around Muggleborns who are not allowed to attend Hogwarts (beacuse Voldemort), and doesn't really know about what magic is. Then one day they are abducted and forced to compete in a Hunger Games/Battle Royal kind of game, with one difference: They have to learn magic in order to defeat the others. No silly muggle weapons, but little cards that tells them how to do different kinds of magic, shields, spells etc. They have to use these informations to create traps, and most importantly survive whatever the evil wizards have though out.

If a muggleborn survives the games, he/she would be quiet a competent wizard in the end.

If I would be a writer this would be a survival + learning and adapting kind of story and not a bloodshed kind of thing, and definitely not resolve around Adava Kedavraing everyone until one remains.

Also if someone do try my idea, or know something similar, I would be happy to read or even help with ideas/betaing :)
