Hi, I just posted my first six chapters to a Harry Potter / OFC fic and if anyone is interested in reading I will leave a link. Do want to say, I plan on consistently updating it and I have only shared 15k words of the 75k I have already written.

Light in the Dark

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25899208/chapters/62938435]]

In the dark times of Voldemort's second rise to power Elise finds herself entwined with Harry Potter and joins him on his journey to Voldemort's defeat. The darkest time in their lives was brightened by a ray of hope lighting up their lives.
