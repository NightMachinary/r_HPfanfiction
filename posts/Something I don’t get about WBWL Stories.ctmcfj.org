** Everything about WBWL is like that. The tittle the Boy-Who-Lived wasn't given to Harry by Dumbledore it was given to him by the people, or more specifically the press, for not dying when Voldemort went to kill him. EVERY child in that house that night, from older siblings to twins to Neville Freaking Longbottom, that survived would be a Child-That-Lived. Who the Prophecy was referring to is a separate matter. These should be called Wrong Chosen One (WCO) fics.

*** The thing is, Harry labelled as BWL because he survived a Killing Curse so only who have attacked with KC and survived is labelled as B/GWL not every person in the vicinity.

**** He was named Boy Who Lived because he was the first person to survive Voldemort directly attempting to assassinate him. The Killing Curse survival thing wasn't introduced until book 4 if memory serves.

**** Is there a particular source for that? If I missed a definitive answer on that bit, I'm sorry. But I'm under the impression that until Harry had the Horcrux flashback memories no one but Voldemort knew what actually went down. Less so the public, who only know what the Prophet published and Hagrid blabbed after a few pints.

The Lightning Bolt (wand movement for the killing cure if you alow secondary sources) is how Dumbledor identifies Harry as the Chosen One. That Harry is not dead is how he gets the Boy-Who-Lived tittle.

*** Well see the thing was no one really knew he was there to kill Harry. They didnt know about the prophecy so there was no reason for Voldemort to go out of his way to personally kill a random baby. Now personally kill people who were actively in his resistance and likely had rumors about being against him? That made some more sense. Then he figured hed kill Harry because why not he was there already and then somehow failed and got the spell turned on him. The scary efficient mass murdering nazi failed to kill a baby and dissappeared. So no it would only be the person who failed to die under Avada Kedavra with that title

**** If I recall correctly, Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived because "No one lived once You-know-who set his sights on them". And he was well known for eradicating whole families. So, while the public didn't know Harry was explicitly the target, he was still part of a family that was targeted.

And anyway, if there were more toddlers it would lessen the likely hood of any of them gaining the X-Who-Lived moniker because if multiple kids survived then how would then know who he supposedly cast his final killing curse at. It's all the more reason to torpedo the BWL malarky in all Harry has siblings fics.

***** I mean wasnt the scar because of the failure to kill Harry? People knew about it before ever seeing him before he even came back to the wizarding world and knew why he had it. The one with the scar would be the BWL.

Course ...if the scar could be hidden and the rumors werent confirmed then ya there would be no one BWL but more than one kid that Voldemort mysteriously let live while diasappearing himself.

****** The scar being known by the public is likely from Hagrid blabbing. And the ONLY way the scar is connected to the killing curse, and not just a random stray spell, is the shape, and we don't know that within the books.

** WBWL is a really weird... Genre? Oeuvre? I'm not even sure what to call stories following that particular trope. The vast majority of them seem to be about demonizing/bashing James and/or Lily and praising Slytherin House, but enough of them have subtlety and inventiveness that I keep getting sucked in.

*** The only one I actually enjoy is linkffn(The Green in the Grey)

Dumbledore's motivation is pretty shit, as there's no reason for him to not go along with Sirius's plan to have him take Harry and just wear magical suppressors (honestly all the author had to do was make it so there was no way to suppress magic and Harry absolutely /had/ to live in the Muggle world), but after that I feel like it's fairly well-written.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF

**** I remember liking linkffn(Harry Potter: The Forgotten Brother), but I don't remember much about it at all, or if I would actually like it now. I also remember one called something like 'The Unsung Hero' but I cannot find it anywhere, I think it's been deleted.

  For years, the world has hailed Arnold Potter as the Boy-Who-Lived. For years Arnold was said to be the one who will throw down Voldemort. But now Arnold is dead, and the world turns its attentions to Harry. Mostly H/Hr/L. Finished.

** I have no use for this genre because every example I've seen is a Lily (usually) and James (always) bash-fest. Sure, they canonically died for Harry but if they had lived they totes would have dumped him in an abusive situation and forgotten about him!

Though obviously a lot of people enjoy that, so they're the audience and I'm not. Which is fine; I'm sure they aren't interested in the fics I love either.

** A good explanation would be that the horcrux in the scar is manipulating with subtlety everyone, to not be seen, nor perceived.

The other one motive is that being placed with the Dursleys is a crucial part of the training of the true chosen one, or that Dumbledore think that (the lesson is about being hard, run fast, have good reflexes avoiding things, not knowing the wizarding world to not have its prejudices, have low autoestima to suicide easily). Then, Dumbledore, for the greater good, lies at everyone.p

** Most of those fics are also manipulative Dumbledore who either coerces or magicks them into sending away Harry. Either to give his brother all the attention or to "protect" Harry from the attention of Death Eaters. Sometimes he knows Harry is the real BWL and wants him to grow up humbled and pliable (standard manipulative Dumbledore tripe). I don't think I've seen many fics where they give up Harry entirely of their own accord.
