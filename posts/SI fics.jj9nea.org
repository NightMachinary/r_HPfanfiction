I know i know. Self inserts what a dumbdumb learn to read good fics (insert haughty laughter).

I like them. I want more.

I dont care who it is into i dont care when.

(Preferably male and no slash)

Thanks.


** What's Her Name in Hufflepuff is definitely the best one. To The Next is pretty good too. I've liked very few others (in this fandom) and they are all long abandoned.

  The fuckery of Lyra and James, two idiots who can't agree on how their thrust into the wizarding world should be handled. Double SI. Co-written with darienqmk.

** The ones I like most are:

Linkffn(To the next)

Linkao3(throw me to the wolves by Sunnystar)

Linkao3(Friendship and Magic by Aiashi)

This is one has lots of potential but it's only 11k and really incomplete :'(

Linkao3(What A Bouquet by TheCurat0r)

Don't really remember these ones that much, but I bookmarked them, so they must be good enough:

Linkao3(Strings of Fate by clobrandwell)

Linkao3(No Gryffindor by Nia_River)

Linkao3(Pro Potentia - For Power)

Ironically enough, I think I read almost every SI OC in the HP fandom except What's her name in hufflepuff. Legends say it's pretty cool. One day i might give it a shot.

  This is a Self Insert. He's a bit of a grouch and doesn't like people, but he also hasn't had any friends for a while so he might be willing to give it another go. He's never seen Harry Potter or read the books. But it's a children's series, so it'll probably be fine. His name is Art. Artorius Caecilius Crouch, to be exact. But don't call him that or he'll get sort of annoyed. DEAD

  Interacting with Petunia Dursley is an exercise of patience. Without time served in the Eternal Void, Mari doubts she could manage it. Listening to Petunia describe her---their?---family still tests it.“What about our nephew?”Mari asks only when Petunia breaks for a breath after a long-winded personal essay about how her Duddykins hung the moon. Petunia's gaze shutters and her lips twist as if Mari has interrupted her.“The boy is,” Petunia raises her teacup to her lips, “disturbed.”Mari curls her own hands around her cooling teacup and imagines tossing the Earl Grey into Petunia's face at the blatant dishonesty.“Losing both of your parents would disturb anyone,” Mari comments and raises her teacup for a sip.  That's the tea.

  He's been wandering London for weeks when he sees him. The pale faced child with wispy black hair, skinny shoulders covered in threadbare clothing. He's soft in the way children are, but amidst the gaggle of little bodies sheltered within the battered gates, he stands with the air of a man grown. Marek glances at the pinned sign that reads ‘Wool's Orphanage' and then back at the child. He's seen this boy before. With Evelyn, who insisted on marathoning the films every year; who liked to regale him with stories about the characters. This boy was Voldemort.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]
