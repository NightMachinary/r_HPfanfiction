I like Haphne as a pairing, but getting over the "keeping it a secret" phase is always a hurdle. If like some fics where their relationship isn't some big mystery.

Completed, preferably.


** If you like evil harry too then i highly recommend the downward spiral saga.. takes a couple books but it ends up them

  After four years working overseas for the shadowy Department M, a world-weary and dispirited Harry Potter returns to the land of his birth. He meets some old friends and makes some new ones, as he learns that much has changed since he left home. AU, a 'Harry never went to Hogwarts' story.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** There is one that is quite nice. But it's quite sexual in nature, not explicit or porn per se, but its focus is on the sexual nature of teenagers. I'll post it anyway, since one of the main points of the story is Daphne accepting that she should be open in her relationship with Harry.
