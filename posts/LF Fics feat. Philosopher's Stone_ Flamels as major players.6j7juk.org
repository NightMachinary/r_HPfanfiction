Bonus if no Dumbledore bashing.

I'm most interested in a canon point of divergence where the stone is kept from Quirrelmort and not destroyed at the end of the book.

Perhaps with the evidence that Voldemort's shade has renewed his sphere of influence and so forth motivates Dumbledore and the Flamels to train Harry or utilise alchemy/ other magical artefacts like the mirror of erised to do something about the big bad.

Alternatively, any fic where the resurrection stone were the philosopher's stone rather than the gaunt ring.


** I've always thought it would be neat if Dumbledore stumbled upon an unusual solution to horcruxes by Voldemort successfully resurrecting in first year but Dumbledore managing to obliviate him because he doesn't have a wand ready to use.

Doesn't know how to destroy the horcruxes but you can destroy the mind attached to the soul if you let it gain a body first.

Ends up stockpiling a room full of mindless Voldemorts somewhere but can't kill them because he needs to keep them trapped in bodies so uses the stone to keep them alive.
