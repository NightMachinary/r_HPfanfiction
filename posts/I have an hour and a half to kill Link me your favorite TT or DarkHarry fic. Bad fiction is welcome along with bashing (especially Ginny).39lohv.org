** If you don't mind Fem!Harry then I highly recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9937462/1/Black-Princess-Ascendant][Black Princess Ascendant]] which is currently being updated.

Really original concept and dark as fuck, also has Voodoo, which is incredibly rare in HP fics.

** ... TT? Terrible Twins? Terrible Trio?

Dark Harry could be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3464303/1/Dark-Lord-Potter-Part-1][Dark Lord Potter]]

Erm... atleast I think that was the one I remember.
