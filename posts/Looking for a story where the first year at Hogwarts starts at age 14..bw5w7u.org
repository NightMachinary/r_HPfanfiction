:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can only remember a bit of the summary, which is that Harry is going to a boys school (it was called Stonewall High or something) and doesn't receive his Hogwarts letter until he's 14 years old. I can't remember more than that, unfortunately. No hint of a title or anything.

I'd appreciate all the help I can get trying to find it.


** Is it linkao3(Grey Space by noaacat)? Or could it be linkao3(Muggle-Raised Champion by Stargon)? In the second fic, Hogwarts starts at age 11, but Harry ends up going when he is 14.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
