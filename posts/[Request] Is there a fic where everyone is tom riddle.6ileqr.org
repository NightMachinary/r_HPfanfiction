Like harry is tom riddle because of his soul fragment, ginny is tom riddle because of the diary, dumbledore is tom riddle from the ring, hermione is tom riddle from the ravenclaw diadem, etc.


** "I'm Tom Riddle!"

"No, I'M Tom Riddle!"

"I'm Tom Riddle, and so's my wife!"

Sorry, couldn't resist...

*** "I am Lord Voldemort! You are just my Diary."

"No, I think I am Lord Voldemort, you filthy imposter!"

"No! You were all wrong, for I am the real Lord Voldemort! And I will show it you!"

Green lights filled the scenery, and each one of the Voldemorts dodged the others' spells effortlessly...

** I seem to vaguely recall seeing this done once, except with evil Dumbledores.

*** Maybe it was me? I posted a little snippet idea a few months ago which featured a gathering of Dumbledores across the multiverse: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/606ogn/request_a_character_from_the_movie_universe_ends/df5d9na/]]

**** No, it was a full length fic, possibly complete. It had ridiculously evil Dumbledore with a dozen horcruxes and people programmed to use them to bring him back to life if he died, starting with Snape. Something went screwy and resulted all of them activating at once or something. And something about Harry taunting him by pretending to be Colonel Sanders. I seem to recall it getting pretty terrible, which is why I stopped reading it.

***** Oh, Yeah I remember that.

I think it also involved timetravel.

**** I don't know what it is about that author, but I just don't like reading anything of his. Every time I try, I get bored and pass it up for another fanfic. Hell, from the story descriptions, I shouldn't be, but I just can't.

***** Most of this sub doesn't like him and for good reason. There is no depth to his plot, there are good guys and there are bad guys. Nothing more. In his stories, Harry is also the biggest gentlesir, with sword, fedora and euphoric at all times. Dumbledore ist Dumbles, Voldemort is Moldy Shorts and Ron is often bashed. Hermione instantly drops all ambitions to be with Harry and Harry allows her to pursue them. The worst thing is, His writing isn't too shabby and the ideas are often good too. So most new members search by most popular and read his fics, I should know as I fell for it too.

Sorry if it seems a bit all over the place, I was venting a bit here

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr

** I read an HG/SS fic loosely like this once upon a time by Aurette (everyone who had destroyed a horcrux had a sort of curse tying them to Voldemort).
