** Too many spelling and grammar errors. They distract from the story when I have to figure out what the hell the author is trying to tell me. Their/they're/there and your/you're are the most common. And if they can't even spell the character's /names/ right? There's no excuse for that. If you can't be bother to get a beta reader, then I can't be bothered to read your fic.

Characters wildly out of character. Dudley Dursley casting a patronus with Harry's wand, and on the first try? Fuck off.

Two-dimensional characters. JKR's characters are wonderfully complex, the good guys have flaws, and the bad guys are still human. Please leave the two-dimensional black-and-white worldview to Disney.

I like super harry but making him super from the start of the story and just making the whole thing a revenge fict is boring as shit. Same applies to any character that gets the super! treatment. Pass.

Diatribe and author soapboxing just augh. I don't mind OOC characters but using the cast as your mouthpiece is boring and makes me even less interested in your cause that normal.

Oh god, the fics where every character gazes at Harry with awe and adoration every time he opens his mouth (to say something that's almost guaranteed not to be very clever). And then after the monologue we have to sit through a couple paragraphs of people telling him how brilliant he is.

Unspeakable Harry, if it had ever been done, hadn't been done with any sort of length or quality, or a seriousness and fleshing out that LordDwar did. Tonks had hardly been written about, either. After reading something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Silens Cursor's work with Tonks]], it's easy to dismiss LordDwar's as amateurish and clunky, but Dwar is the giant upon whose back Silens stood when he thought "I can do better".

2. Characters who act completely different from how they are portrayed in the books. Things like Hermione bursting into tears at every little thing, Ron being a complete prat for no reason, Harry being constantly angry and not willing to forgive people, etc.

3. Original characters who are just awful. By awful I mean, they are most of the time extremely powerful, the main characters are in love with them for no discernible reason, and they grate on my nerves every time they show up. Usually they also giggle constantly. This is not to say there are no good original characters of course, just that a vast majority of fanfiction with original characters don't seem to be very well thought out.

Also, something surprising that I've noticed in the Harry Potter fanfictions is that review/fav count does not mean it is a good fanfic. I mistakenly thought it would be, since higher review/fav count /should/ mean the fanfic is better quality...or so I believed until I tried reading the top rated HP fanfictions and was baffled at how horrible they were.

When women are love interests, 95% of the time they're /only/ love interests, /only/ interested in helping Harry Potter and staying near him and keeping his regard. They don't have their own motivations and their own narratives; they're just a simple role with a bit of flavor (and often not all that much flavor).

Characters should learn and change and grow after repeated exceptional circumstances. Alexandra Quick, I'm looking at you. Even then, I stuck it out for 2.5 books.

Other than that, no single issue tends to kill a story unless it's quite severe. Grammar and spelling problems hurt. An overpowered Harry hurts. Harry getting away with insulting and badgering Dumbledore in his own office, especially a scheming and controlling Dumbledore, really hurts.

** I can be lenient regarding some spelling and grammar errors, but when they can't be bothered to spell a main character's name correctly, I want to punch a wall . It's HermIone not Hermoine or Hermone. Lucius not Luscious. Seriously. It takes two seconds to google it.

Slang (outside of character conversations) and text-speak. The second I see "plz", "bcuz", or "b4", I get the hell out of there. It shows a serious lack of regard for the English language and intelligence. If JK Rowling can write 7 novels without text-speak, the fanfic author can write a single chapter using proper English.

Characters who are WAY out of character. If there is some progression that shows a slight change in characterization, then I don't mind. But if Hermione suddenly develops F-cups, gets overly sensitive, and stops caring about school, something is wrong. Harry, while relatively smart, should never be some genius in school. Ron, despite his faults, is not the world's biggest jackass. And Draco will always be a bit of a prick.

Having characters suddenly be friends without any explanation at all. If the author provides a Prologue or a few paragraphs to explain the situation, and they still show some awkwardness to the relationships, no problem. But Draco will never be Ron's best friend, no matter what. And Hermione would never get super chummy with Pansy. We need some background to know why the characters got to where they are.

A total lack of understanding of Hogwarts and the Wizarding world. Like assuming that technology works at Hogwarts without any problem or without explaning why.

Any Snape/Hermione (or Harry, Draco, etc) fics. He is the same age as their parents!!! (This also includes Dumbledore/student or Lucius/Harry/Hermione/etc..)

Clichés can also get frustrating, but if they're well-executed, then I can deal. If every single line is a cliché, well, I'm out.

And people, for the love of god, if you can't write a character well, then avoid them. So many people screw up Luna or Dumbledore because they exaggerate them or have them be the opposite of their personality. When writing Luna, I want to think of a fairy/muse, not a hippie tripping out on hard drugs. If someone really just can't write a character, I will be frustrated and jump ship.

Essentially, if an author can't be bothered to try to write something decent and well-executed, then I can't be bothered to read it.

** A couple of things-excessive bashing, magical cores as a plot device, everything miraculously going right for some reason, hammy romance sequences, everyone conveniently forgetting ultra-important information until plot development time comes along and in wrong-child-who-lived stories, James and lily being dicks to their kids for shits & giggles.

There are others that rear their ugly heads at random. I'm a picky reader.

** Here is a short list:

The Dursleys being ridiculously abusive (Vernon raping Harry, etc.).

Spells or skills being used before the characters should know about them or generally characters having information that they should not have without explaination (e.g. Accio before 4th year).

Character Bashing, especially Ron, Molly and Hermione.

Voldemort/Umbridge/Bellatrix/etc. being the 'good guy'.

~12 year old children being more eloquent then any adult in the story.

Mpreg.

Plots that have been reused a hundred times... Oh, so Draco is a Veela and Harry is his mate? Original -.-

Harry's twin or other sibling being BWL and being Harry abandoned because... reasons.

Characters behaving extremely ooC for no reason other than 'it looks cool'.

Anyone other then Lily and James being Harry's parents without a well worked out explaination (e.g. James being sterile).

** *Evil!Dumbledore*\\
Seriously people seem to completely miss the point of the character.

*Extremely Abusive Dursleys*\\
While the Dursleys where dicks to harry its never stated on cannon that he was hit until his whole body was purple.

*Badly written Snape*\\
Another Character that people miss the point, he isn't evil, neither he likes harry at all. yet people seem to either cast him as a death eater murderer or Harry's parental figure.

*Character Bashing*\\
for me, character bashing, is the sing that the writer doesn't understand the character and just wants an excuse to bash them.

*Harry/Hermione*\\
even thought word of god says that this should have beem canon, I can't see them together for whatever reason.(I have yet to read a well written one)

*Slash*\\
Not my cup of tea

*Powerfull!Harry* This type of fic is a wishfullfiliment where thanks to harry power the story becomes dull. it can be done right but it really hard/uncommon

** One of the things that turns me away from an otherwise good /idea/ of a fic is really, really bad dialogue. It just grates on me when the writer can't write natural sounding dialogue. Even if the characters are acting OOC, if the dialogue at least sounds right, there's a chance of me getting over it.

** - Bad spelling, grammar and dialogue tagging - more than a few random errors; I'm talking near-illiteracy.

- Harry or other characters speaking in American slang. Was it that tough to find the swear words in the book?

- OCs who are too cool to be believed. It's obviously a case of the author projecting herself into the stories. I don't have time to be your therapist, honey.

- Stories longer than 50 chapters. IMO, authors who write such long fics have commitment issues. Get in, give us a tasty plotline or two, crunch it to bits and get out.

/Edit:/ What's with the downvotes? We were asked "what makes /you/ want to quit reading a fic." I was just answering honestly, for myself.

**** I love longer stories as well. But I get eviltwinskippy's point. 50 chapters+ (if they are of any decent length) is usually just an author eeking out as many reviews as they can from faithful followers, not really about neatly wrapping up a fantastic, sprawling, epic plot.

******* I would say that once you reach the 250-300k point if you aren't finished you should probably be splitting your story into more than one book. I have read single fics with word counts over 600k, though.

The accusation of doing it just to collect reviews is weird to me, though.

******** Yes, if it's reaching that length, it's better to split it up. Keeps the fic fresh and easier to redefine your plot if need be. And that would be stopping it around 50 chapters, which was my eviltwinskippy's point, I believe.

Of course, we're speaking in generalities, but if a fic is going that long with no end in sight, I find it to be meandering and pointless. I guess that's where the 'accusation' comes from, I suppose.
