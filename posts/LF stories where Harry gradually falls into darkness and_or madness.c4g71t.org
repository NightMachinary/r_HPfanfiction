Harry has had a very difficult life, but he turns out remarkably well adjusted in the end, and a force for good. All the terrible things that happened to him could have easily turned him into a monster, yet did not. I'd like to see a story, preferably from another character's perspective, where the constant stresses and horrors did not leave him so... Untouched. Specifically, I want to see Harry gradually fall further and further into darkness and/or madness while his friends watch on helplessly. Nothing so dramatic as the usual Indy!Harry tattooed, pot-smoking 5th year divergence. No sudden bashing of everyone and realizing that meddling old coot is responsible for everything from world hunger to Mrs. Figg tripping over her cats every second Tuesday.

I don't want stories where his fall is sudden, either. A gradual, realistic descent as he stares into the abyss until he becomes what he beholds. I'd especially like to see him researching forbidden magic, eldritch powers, and truly nightmarish darkness. No bashing, no romance (and especially /no HP/LV!/), no Dark!Trio, I want to see him fall to the point he is completely alone in his darkness.


** The Hallows led his descent in this two fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/][Hallows and Pathos]], linkffn(4889913): Hermione is affected even more.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11564067/1/][The Last Enemy]], linkffn(11564067): He slowly becomes a serial killer in search for immortality.

------------------

After being failed again by the establishment after the war, he began carrying out vigilante justice in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). But in the end, he became a full fledged dark lord ruling Magical Britain with an iron fist.

*** I've read The Last Enemy and The Sum of Their Parts before, and both are excellent, though TSotP isn't quite what I'm looking for, but I'd been putting off reading Hallows and Pathos for some reason. It's excellent, but left me feeling slightly confused as to how quickly it escalated. I'm left both wanting more and wondering what the hell I just read...

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

** There was one that I read that I think fits this but I can't remember much. I know it was set post-DH, Harry made a contract with something for the stability of Magical Britain and the ability to remove the pureblood supremacists from positions of power, but in return he has to kill once a month or something like that.

It was a solid story but my quick google search didn't turn it up. If anyone can recognize the story from this please let me know i'd like to reread it.
