Are there any fics with a yandere type character after harry? Example: Yuno from future diary.

Edit : bonus points if they are actually in a relationship and it's not just character bashing.

  The word "yandere", a term that blossomed in moe fandom, refers to a character who is crazy about someone else...often literally and violently.

So basically Obsessed!Ginny, or rarely Obsessed!Cho. I'm thinking Gin Gin the Erection Killer from SoG but she lacks the violence part of that. I wouldn't think Potions!Ginny or Ron would fit this because it's usually due to Harry's wealth or the fact that Harry might want Hermione respectively. You're looking for someone closer to the movie Obsessed but I don't recall ever reading anything like that that wasn't altogether poorly written Weasley bashing. Hopefully someone else sees the definition above and finds one for you though.

edit: The thought just occurred to me that Draco from SoG fits that pretty well lol.

**** That'd be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]], given the references above (and a quick google of the phrase "Gin Gin the Erection Killer.")

** Oh there's also a very smutty one on AFF (adult fanfiction) I think that had Daphne or Luna (I don't remember which) be very aggressively dominate (as in borderline emotional and physical abuse) with Harry including tying him up and polyjuice gender changing. I can't for the life of me find the link now though >_<

edit: took entirely too fucking long (no, not the whole 6 hours, more like half an hour once I really started) but I found it: [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600022799&chapter=1][Girls & Boys]].

** My fic Hogwarts Shuffle! has a Ginny based on a rather Yandere anime character. She's not totally off the deep end yet, but if I ever finish writing it there will be several freaky scenes.

Also a good Tsundere can be lots of fun too, usually a Pansy or Daphne pairing will get you the tough attitude but caring on the inside type.

*** As a reader of your work, I want you to know that Kaede really fucking freaked me out, both in the games and the anime, and I dread similar scenes to come.

That doesn't mean I can stop reading though.

**** Ginny's borderline personality disorder and yandere tendencies have been established at this point. She's not going to be grabbing kitchen knives and giving other girls the crazy eyes.

Although....
