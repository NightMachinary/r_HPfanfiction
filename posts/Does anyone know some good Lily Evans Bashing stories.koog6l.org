** I'm honestly surprised there aren't more stories where James and Lily don't hook up and Lily regrets it (I made a request/prompt of this months ago); a more vanilla role-reversal where a bitter Lily feels conflicted and torn on seeing James' children; simple Hogwarts fics where James is starting to move on from a clearly "uninterested" Lily and she becomes more than just a metaphorical green-eyed monster (jealousy).

There's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11575970/1/i-want-no-world-for-beautiful-you-are-my-world]]) but that's pretty much it as far as I've seen.

Mentioning [[/u/BleedFree]] so that they can see this

*** This isn't bashing, just an alternative intepretation of Lily's reatively blank canon character. Highly recommended: anything that combines semtex with magic is worth a read.

  Lily Evans got described by many adjectives: vivacious, charming, bright, natural, talented, brave, funny, witty, kind, popular...Truly, she was an exceptional witch who for some reason left behind her a trail of deeply troubled individuals.Answer to the question: What would change in the story if Lily Evans had been born a sociopath is: not necessarily anything.

#+begin_quote
  Up at the teacher's table, professor Quirrell was talking to a teacher with dirty red hair hanging around her sickly pale face like a curtain. Looking past Quirrell, two poison-green eyes, devoid of any warmth or empathy, found Harry's own brown ones, and he felt a sharp pain on his scar.“Who's that teacher talking to professor Quirrell?”“Oh, you know professor Quirrell already do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's professor Evans, the potions mistress. Don't get on her bad side, the old hag hates students.“Harry looked again, but the teacher was no longer looking at him. Still, Harry could not escape the nagging feeling, which he had gotten just from a glimpse of her eyes and the cruel twist of her lips, that professor Evans did not like him very much.

** Bashing as in everyone hates her, or as in she gets reinvented as an evil caricature of her canon self, or as in taking a hard look at her canonical mistakes and calling her out on them?

That's more of a critical fic to me. The first two are what I'd call bashing.
