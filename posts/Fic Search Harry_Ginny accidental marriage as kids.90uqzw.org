I'm searching for a fic that takes place pre-first year, where Ginny encounters Abused Harry. Harry gets injured and apparates to the Weasleys. They get married for real after reciting vows from a book, and they do it several times with different ceremonies. There's a good Aunt Muriel and Harry living at the Weasleys underneath his invisibility cloak. I think it ends just before Harry gets discovered.

Thanks for any help!

  It was a small wedding, and the honeymoon was, fortunately, delayed.
