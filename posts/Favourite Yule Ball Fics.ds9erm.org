Just wondering what are fics featuring the yule ball people enjoy most? Maybe a fic that follows a minor character experience at the ball or goes into great detail describing the evening more than what we got in canon?. Or is there something like a random disaster strikes and there's a mad duel in the middle of the ball between Harry and Malfoy after they piss each other off? haha

Perhaps its even set at Beauxbaton or Durmstrang for a change after one of them is chosen as the host school instead just to be completely different? Anything cool like that around? It can be any pairing LF or one-shots! Just like to see what some alternative Yule Ball stories look like that people enjoy. thanks :)


** I really like the one in A Champion's New Hope... shame the rest of the story kinda takes a downturn from there

**** I was going to recommend the exact same one, but I actually really liked the rest of the story as well. Part of what made the Yule Ball good was the backstory behind it.

  What if Harry's friends tried to help him out in getting a date to the Yule Ball and he suddenly found himself with too many dates? Hilarity and romance ensues of course. Harry/Multi and eventual harem.
