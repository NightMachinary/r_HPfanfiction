All too often, we see Manipulative!Dumbledore as being in direct opposition to Harry (often: Harry needs to die to fulfill the Prophecy, after which Dumbledore can step in and be the hero), and having nothing to offer for Harry to /actually/ go along with it.

He's almost always an antagonist, or downright irrelevant because all his "machinations" immediately come a-cropper.

I'd like to read a few stories where he's still a chessmaster, but his goals and methods /don't/ put him in opposition with Harry - in fact, he actually /wants/ Harry to succeed because it aligns with his own goals.

He might be maneuvering politically in order to oust all the Death Eaters from the Ministry, he might want control over the Resurrection Stone as well as the Elder Wand to bring back his sister, he might be grooming Harry as his successor, whatever - as long as his plans involve Harry also achieving his goals.

As always, preferably no bashing, and no abandoned fics please.


** That's the standard Dumbledore in most of my fics, and all but the current one are completed.

You might want to give "Patron", "Divided and Entwined", "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief" and "The Dark Lord Never Died" a try.

Which of my stories I'd recommend depends on your preferences - I've got gritty civil war, Indiana Jones style Tomb Raiding, Heists pitting Gentlemen Thieves against cops, Shipgirls in the Wizarding World, "Pureblood culture" that's far more fantastical than in canon, Lucius Malfoy taking over Wizarding Britain in 1981 and a Harry Potter/Buffy crossover featuring the Slayer before Buffy.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I'm going to offer Saphroneth's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/][Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay]]. Dumbledore remains fairly true to his canon appearance, but he shows incredible amounts of sneakiness such as twisting the passing of a law in such a way as to allow for non-human students at Hogwarts, including a three-headed dog, a merman, two kitsune, a sphinx and even more.

Another story is expanded Enter The Dragon (not linking due to being on QQ, albeit in the SFW section (for now)) where Dumbledore proves he's a Magnificent Bastard when he forces Lucius Malfoy to share a meal of Voldemort's Basilisk with the threat of sudden death if Lucius doesn't eat every bit he was given in the full knowledge that Voldie would be highly wroth if/when he returns.\\
The original ETD was written by Doghead Thirteen and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][can be found here]]. DT has confirmed that he gave permission for and approves of the expanded version.
