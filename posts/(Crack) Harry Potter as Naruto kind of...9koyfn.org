** kind of interesting.

They sort of do that sometimes with his Horcrux, but I've never seen it with Voldemort himself as a sort of Kyuubiesque power source.

**** don't ever worry about a concept not being good enough if you feel like writing it.

The best writing is something you are passionate about, and even the worst concept can be redeemed :-)

Having said that, I do like the concept and I'm looking forward to anything you write

** This reminds me of a fic I wrote a loooooong time ago (before DH was written) that Harry would defeat Voldemort by trapping the evil soul in Harry's body and Harry would isolate himself from the rest of the world. Never posted it. Heh. Contained an OC who discovered Harry's whereabouts.

*** Sounds kinda similar yeah :) though mine would end up being more comedic and developed around the whole events panning out as if Lily was still alive.

** The main problem would be coming up with a primary antagonist that would be on par with the new Harry + Voldemort combo. I suppose you could borrow a little bit more from the Narutoverse and militarize Magical Britain. People would know that he's got the Dark Lord inside and he would be thus shunned by the magical community at large, the opposite situation from cannon. Since he's holding one of the largest threats to society and he's going to be mistreated by the wizards it wouldn't make sense for Dumbledore to send Harry to the Dursley's--after all Harry doesn't need grooming to sacrifice himself in book 7. Also Voldemort is very different from Kurama, you could hardly get away with making him a misunderstood character without some major OoC so a significant part of the story could be dedicated to finding a way of harnessing Voldemort's power/knowledge... I think the situation would play out similarly to the diary in book 2 unless some type of mechanics are implemented in the sealing. i would read it.

*** Yes I was thinking of that but maybe not so much Naruto. Instead could use the diary of Tom riddle and sacrifice ginnie

*** Some ideas:

- Voldemort's main soul (now within Harry) starts to talk to him, telling him that he wants to rejoin the other soul fragments and mend his evil aways. Harry's innate good soul and innocence change him over the years. (The 7th Horcrux does this very well without even directly mentioning it). The rejoining is incredibly painful and comes with great sacrifice (on Voldie's part not Harry's).

- As a voice inside Harry's head that only occasionally takes the wheel in emergencies, he first steers Harry into outright cruelty and near evil, but over time his actions improve (but not his words). When in control around Hogwarts, he often tries to teach DADA classes to humorous or disastrous effect. He also tries to prank and insult Dumbledore.

- The other soul fragments somehow determine that he is trying to redeem himself (possibly a botched divination spell because Voldie doesn't respect divination?) and decide to work against him, start possessing people, and can move around by happenstance One Ring style. Unless they are found and destroyed (or consumed by the main soul) they will always find their way into some poor fool's possession and possess him/her in turn.

- The soul fragments vary in terms of power/ability, with the oldest one being the most sane and least evil but also least powerful. Harry faces escalating threat from the soul fragments, from moderately dangerous pranks to outright warfare and cunning betrayal. Some (maybe just the first one?) soul fragments willingly join after some persuasion, while most must be defeated.

- The final soul fragment obtains a twisted body of it's own, and attempts to destroy both Harry and the healing main soul within. Death Eaters rally around this final and most insane soul fragment. I think a Return of the Jedi ending would be most satisfying, with Voldemort paying for the crimes he committed and dying, and Harry finding out the power was in him all along.
