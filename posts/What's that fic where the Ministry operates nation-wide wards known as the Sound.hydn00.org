:END:
Looking for at fic where the Ministry of Magic in a state of emergency can disband all magical communication by operating some special wards called the Sound. I think Scrimegeour is the Minister and he is at first unwilling to active the wards because that will bring society to a halt, and he's afraid how people will react. In the end, I think he just manages it before he's killed by Voldemort.


** It's the one he feared, Dumbledore leaves Harry his old wand(the one he had before he defeated Grindelwald) and all his memories up until that point, giving Harry a massive power-up and an identity crisis wrapped up in one package.

He proceeds to wreck Voldie.

I actually liked it, because instead of just making Harry OP it also explores how he would cope with decades of memories from Dumbledore while he himself has only his.

He even feels confused about being attracted by Ginny(due to age, not Dumbledore's preferences).

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

**** It seems that's the one. It's very different from what I remember. But thank you anyway. Though the concept was interesting.
