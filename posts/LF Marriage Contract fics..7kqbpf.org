  'Don't think of it as a marriage contract, I don't! It makes it easier- think of it as ... an amalgamation agreement. Makes it sound less complicated.' Harry/Daphne. EWE.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper?

  Why is it when you're drunk you come up with the greatest ideas! Well they aren't really great, especially when your father and his best friend, forget they did this and it comes back to bite you squarely in the ass. Thanks James, thanks Sirius. Marriage is a beautiful thing, when you are aware of it. But what happens when you're 15? HP/NM/AB Response to a whitetigerwolf challenge

  It's been done, but here's my shot at the old Marriage Contract type story. Harry and Daphne Greengrass find out their parents put together a marriage contract when they were born, now they must deal with it.

** The only marriage contract fic I really like is /The Marriage Contracts Redux/ by Clell65619, linkffn(5835213), where it's a major plot point, but Harry isn't forced into one.

I think it's the basic premise of an inescapable marriage contract that gets to me. I'd really like to see a fic where Harry finds out he has to get married or lose his magic, and he just snaps his wand and walks away without a second thought because the one thing Harry would never do is give up his chance for a loving family.

#+begin_quote
  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

** Many of James Spookie's stuff involves some sort of forced pairing (usually a marriage contract). His writing isn't noteworthy or anything, but it's of acceptable quality and he usually completes all his fics
