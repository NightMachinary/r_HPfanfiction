So I've recently started reading this story and I really like the premise. Now I've noticed the author likes to add unnecessary (in my opinion) drama just for the sake of drama which I'm not too fond of. For that reason I'd appreciate it if someone could spoiler me if either Harry or Acquila will be in (a) romantic relationship(s) before the two of them get together as if that's the case I don't think I'll continue reading the story


** Yes both of them do get interested in another person but only Acquilla properly dated someone else. In fact they don't even get together properly in the end. Last I read it was not completed.

*** Oh damn okay. Normally that wouldn't bother me that much but with the soul bond thing it seems kinda weird dating someone else. Anyway thanks for answering!
