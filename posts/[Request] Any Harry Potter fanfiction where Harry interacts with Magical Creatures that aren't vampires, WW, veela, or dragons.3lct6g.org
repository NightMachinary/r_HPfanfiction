  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

*** While Sacrifices does have tons of creature interactions, it's not the driving force of the fic... Likely OP won't be interested in some of the other aspects. I always like to rec this series with a pretty explicit disclaimer, as it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. (:

**** Really? I would say that it is one of the driving forces - with the understanding that the fic isn't about one thing. It's about Voldemort, and Lord-level magic, and Light and Dark magic, and creature interactions, and child abuse, and probably one other thing that I'm forgetting, but creature interactions are definitely one of the major plot lines.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
