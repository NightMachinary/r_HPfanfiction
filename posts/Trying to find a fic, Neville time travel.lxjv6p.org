:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a fic I read a while back. Neville came back in time to 5th year following one of Harry's and one of Ron's kids (I believe James and Rose? I'm terrible with all of their names). I believe it was called Harry Potter and the War Hero, but I can't find it anywhere. Any help is appreciated.


** Some locket shenanigans at Grimmauld Place and sudden pregnancies?

**** Oh, no link. It was taken down years ago. But the author is going to rework it and reupload it. Eventually

******* Ah. Well I enjoyed the fic, so thank you! Any suggestions for other fics of a similar style, or something that inspired you? I liked the Neville time travel angle for sure

******** There are a bunch of time travel fics out there. But most of them are bad. Like, how many times can we hear "Okay, we're all going to say our names, parents, houses, Quidditch positions... One at a time. Then we'll erase everyone's memories and leave."?

I think good time travel fics need to have consequences. Alter the timeline or create a different timeline from the original one, coexisting. And flow as naturally as possible. I write a bunch of those, but they are all WIPs.

I guess there must some good ones around but I find them difficult to find since I abandon ship as soon as I notice OP or OOC characters or bashing... Etc...

********* Yeah I agree. Probably my two favorites in the genre are Oh God Not Again and Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. OGNA is pretty light hearted and funny, and just overall a fun read. HPNFP is literally gut wrenching, and definitely has consequences like you said. I just re-read both and want more lol.

********** I do too. That's why I write my versions. Though I keep coming up with cool premises and stories that make it less likely that I finish stuff. I am trying to refocus my work to get at least one story finished before the summer.
