A lot of times in fanfics, Harry talks about how he re-defeated Voldemort at age 11, or killed a sixty-foot Basilisk at age 12, or drove off a hundred dementors with a patronus. Sometimes he's doing a well-earned boast; other times, he just says it matter-of-factly and doesn't realize others will see it as a big deal.

What I want is a Harry who, when asked about what happened at the end of his first year, starts gushing about Hermione's amazing researching, and Hermione recognizing and defeating the Devil's Snare, and Ron's amazing chess game (he doesn't mention the winged key room and possibly has forgotten it entirely), and Ron's courageous sacrifice, and Hermione's brilliant puzzle-solving skills in the potion room. The last room is barely an afterthought, just a mention that someone was there but accidentally killed themselves on the love magic protection thing Harry's mother left him. When asked about second year, he talks about Ron facing down an army of giant spiders, and about how Hermione figured out everything. He just describes the monster in the chamber as "a snake" ("It was just a snake?" "Yeah, a pretty big snake"), and talks about how Fawkes blinded it and it ran around blindly bumping its head on things until Harry did the honors of putting it out of its misery. And as for third year? "Well, it felt like millions of dementors, so it was probably really like four or five of them. /awkward laugh/"

This isn't because he's trying to get people to underestimate him or anything like that. Maybe he's just super uncomfortable with any kind of praise or positive attention. Better yet, maybe he tells the stories that way because he legitimately remembers them that way.

** If you want something good with it, you should read Sacrifice Arc, it is Harry Potter series if Rawling knew what she was doing and actually was trying to write a mature book from the begining. And oh god is it good. And also long and complex. Just... Trust me, you need it.
