I couldn't find an official affiliation anywhere online and I'm hoping to use him for a plotline in a fanfic I'm writing. I need him to be a former Hufflepuff, do you think that would work?


** I have him noted as a Ravenclaw alumnus in my notes, but Hufflepuff can work. I have him as a Ravenclaw because he's so much passionate (in a boring and dry way) about his subject and outside of him being a boring intellectual, he's not much. You can also find his character coin just outside of Ravenclaw's common room in the Lego Harry Potter Years 1-4 game.

*** Dang that definitely sounds more Ravenclaw to me. I was reasoning that he's been so loyal to his job at the school that would put him in Hufflepuff.

** Although I can see him being a Ravenclaw since he loves history, I think he's too close-minded and unobservant. I imagine him as a Hufflepuff since he's extremely hardworking, dedicated, and loyal to his work as a history teacher, even continuing to teach after his death.

** What if he is a griffindor and the reason he talks about Goblin rebellions a lot is because he died while fighting against one and likes to brag about it.

** He belongs to the Founders era. He never went to Hogwarts so was never sorted into a house but he is the first teacher to ever work there.

*** I wouldn't say he was Founders' Era. He uses /A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot/ in his classes. For someone that never changes his lectures, he wouldn't be using something published after he died.

So, he's older than Bathilda Bagshot, yet still alive when she published her book.

There is a chance he didn't go to Hogwarts.
