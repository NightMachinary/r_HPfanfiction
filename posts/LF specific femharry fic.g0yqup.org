:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember for the life of me what it was called but it involved malfoy slipping Harry a potion from Voldemort that caused a like mental battle between Harry and Voldemort which resulted in Harry being turned into a girl

A bunch of girls in hogwarts then swore an oath of allegiance to help Harry which they later found out was also a marriage vow

Then Harry in gringotts somehow acquired the entire black, malfoy, and lestrange fortunes to supplement the large potter fortune which involved draco trying to kill Harry in gringotts then being excecuted

Then a whole lot of Harry training for Voldemort with his wives

Thanks for the help

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.
