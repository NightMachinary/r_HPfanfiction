  So, Iden Versio didn't shoot to kill. Lux was still alive. But where to go now? The Empire wouldn't have him, that's for sure. The Rebellion was the closest thing he had to being a partisan. Being neutral was nearly impossible. He may as well join the side that he hates least: and maybe meet some old friends along the way. (Post-Inferno Squad. Spoilers for that book.)
