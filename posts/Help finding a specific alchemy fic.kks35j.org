:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been trying to google but no luck so far! It's either a Harry/Draco of Draco/Hermione fic. It's eighth year or something and the pairing end up aprrenticing in alchemy or something similar, they're basically trying to make a new philosopher's stone. They fall in love during this process, there's some minor accidents with the creation of this thing and I seem to remember some bonding or blood magic to finish the stone. I know it's not much information but I feel this was a pretty popular fic. Thanks!

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
