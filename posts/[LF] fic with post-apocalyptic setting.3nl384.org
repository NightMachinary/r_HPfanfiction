Hi everyone,

I'm looking for a fic with a post-apocalyptic setting. I would like that the wizards and muggle population are mixed because both worlds went down. Something like that, someone got any recommendations?


** I'd recommend linkffn(Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma) without a doubt! Wizard and muggle mixing is one of the very main topics of this post appocalypse.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** +linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma]]) comes to mind immediately.+

Also, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10912355/1/Revenge-of-the-Wizard]]) is also technically post-apocalyptic, but is more focused on the Star Wars universe and an angry Harry mucking about trying to avenge the dead Earth.

Edit: Ah, damn, ninja'd. Also, I'd love for there to be some good Walking Dead crosses, but unfortunately HP/WD crosses seem to just be a platform to write slash instead of the far more interesting, y'know, *end of society as we know it* and the implications of magic on survival in the zombie apocalypse.
