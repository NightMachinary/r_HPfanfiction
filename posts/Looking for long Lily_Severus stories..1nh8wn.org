I really like Lily/Severus stories. I've only ever found one where harry is actually Harry's dad other than ones where he was adopted. Does anyone have any recommendations for me? Your help is much appreciated!!!


** I really like 'Ananke'. it's long and very unusual but well developed. The characters are also fleshed out and believable. I'm on my phone so I can't link, but it's defo on fanfiction.net

*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4400517/1/Ananke][Ananke]] is indeed pretty good.

You might also try [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]], though be warned there is some broken base as far as later events.

** Mulciber pranks Lily instead of Mary Macdonald, which is the catalyst for Snape turning away from the Dark Side. Amazing story with believable Snily in the first half and an epic war/battle plot in the second half. My only quibble with it is that Snape and Lily's relationship seemed kind of strange to begin with - they dated for a year before they even kissed - ??

Snape/Lily AU. What if Lily and Harry were saved from Voldemort on the night of October 31st? How would the plan to defeat Voldemort be laid out? And what if Severus and Lily had a second chance to reconcile? Unfinished, unlikely to be finished. Haven't read this one, but the premise sounds fascinating.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8134710/1/A-Dream-Carved-in-Stone][A Dream Carved in Stone]] is pretty good.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3694608/1/Some-Things-Run-Too-Deep][Some Things Run Too Deep]] is also pretty okay, I think. Been a while since I read it, but I have it saved, so it must've been at least readable. :)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7361398/1/Not-a-Fairytale][Not a Fairytale]] is one I really like, but it is not complete, and I waited more than a year between the last update and the one before it. But the latest update was only about six months ago, so I still have hope that it's not abandoned.

I will edit as I think of more, but I hope that helps. I've read a ton of them, but I save fics in a bunch of crazy places, so it's a bit of a search. Haha.
