Any good fics with a believable build-up? (I prefer fics where their hatred aren't just thrown out of the window, but it is worked around?)


** i think linkao3(Hermione Grangers Crammer for Delinquent Students) is a really funny and sometimes appropriately awkward Drarry fic

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

** My new fav is The Man Who Lived linkao3(9167785)

The first person POV present tense takes some getting used to and it's essentially all OC except Draco and Harry but it is really a great fic

  Draco breaks a cup, and one thing leads to another. A story of redemption, tattoos, dreams, mistakes, green eyes, long conversations, and copious amounts of coffee. Set in New York twelve years after the war.

** Two of the stories that come to mind where their hatred is worked around are [[https://sites.google.com/site/harrydracosmoochfest2013/home/fics-and-art/kiss-the-joy][Kiss the Joy]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879835][Salt on the Western Wind]]. Kiss the Joy is set in the Room of Requirement just after the Battle, and is one of my favorite "after war healing" Drarry fics. It features plenty of antagonism between the boys and arguably some of the best intimacy scenes I've read because of the emotional way they're written. Salt on the Western Wind uses a type of bonding to get them to further the process of getting over their hatred, which normally I consider to be a copout, but it uses the troupe well in my opinion. I also enjoyed having Ron and Hermione's characters included; I like it when Harry's friendship with them shows some depth in fics, beyond the basic "I support you and your choice" or "I don't support your choice to be with Draco".

I also would recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]]. It's one of the most believable build ups that I have seen (aside from The Man Who Lived, that was already posted).
