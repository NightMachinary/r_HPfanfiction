Many have wondered why, in /Goblet of Fire/, the Triwizard Cup portkey still takes Harry /back/ to Hogwarts upon second touch, when the first one took him from Hogwarts to the graveyard. The most common explanation is that, while tampering with the Cup, Barty Crouch Jr. was only able to add one more destination in-between the intended steps of the Maze's center and Hogwarts, but not to remove the original enchantment. However, I have found a fun theory on the Internet that has more respect for Crouch's magical skill: he /purposefully/ left the Portkey's go-to-Hogwarts enchantment, with the intent that Voldemort and the Death Eaters could use it to take Hogwarts by surprise as soon as Harry was dead, circumventing the no-Apparation rule and the protective enchantments.


** Considering that the maze was only indirectly monitored, I'd say the return trip was entirely intentional, but that the planned end-move was for the champion(s) to be returned to the maze with the trophy, inexplicably dead. That way Riddle could get his restoration and yet appear blameless of Harry's death. Albus might suspect but would have no proof to support a deeper investigation.

That's why, when I wrote the graveyard scene, Wormtail used a stolen Time Turner. They arranged it so that their ritual would take no perceived time away from the grabbing of the trophy at the center of the maze and appearing [dead] at the entrance of it.

Good point. Voldemort didn't want to publicly declare himself until he was stronger and had more of his followers back, so I don't think he intended to invade Hogwarts at the end of GoF (or at /any/ time when Dumbledore was alive, for that matter - hence the murder plot involving Draco in HBP).

[[/u/UrTwiN]] goes into more detail about this farther down in the thread.

*** But you also have to take into account that there would be teachers who put themselves in charge of taking all the children back to safety so that would deplete the numbers, not to mention some teachers were previous death eaters and might possibly join Voldemort the moment they see him back in power (the one that comes to mind is Karkaroff). Sure, there are teachers who would fight Voldemort & Co. but when you really consider all factors, I think it would be a pretty evenly matched battle in the heat of the moment where adrenaline is rushing and nobody is stopping to think about strategy because they were taken off guard and had no advanced warning

***** Okay, yeah I see what you're getting at now. I (having no previous experience in war) don't exactly know what steps to take when and in my mind my priority would be to always save as many people as possible so I think I was thinking more biased than actual canon when thinking about how the teachers would react in the panic that ensued. Many thanks for your explanation, it really helped clear things up for me :)

** I think the Graveyard stop was an inbetween that Crouch Jr. put there. The end station for the portkey probably always was some dais for the winner to land on, otherwise they would have to make their way all the way through the Maze again to return.

*** That is, as I said, the most common explanation... but /why/ didn't Crouch Jr. remove it?

**** Ah, well /that's/ easy: I don't think it was expected that a 14-year-old Harry Potter would survive against the resurrected Voldemort. It's not an unreasonable assumption, mind you---let's not forget just how much his escape was down to luck. In fact, if JKR hadn't foreshadowed the twin wands in the first book, it would have been a blatant deus-ex-machina.
