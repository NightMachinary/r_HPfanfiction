*** OP misspelled it. It's Laocoon's Children, and is a mythological reference - Laocoon and his sons are part of the story around the Trojan War.

Both fics OP mentioned are by an author called copperbadge, who is no long active in the fandom. He still writes a LOT of fic (and a lot of original work...Sam is great) but hasn't written Harry Potter for years.
