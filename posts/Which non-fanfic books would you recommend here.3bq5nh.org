So, I've recently stumbled upon a story called [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] (W: Words: 261,515; active WiP; [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][[Groundhog Peggy Sue]).]]

It turned out to be surprisingly well-written and light-hearted; and maybe it's because to a hammer everything looks like a nail, but it kinda felt like a HP fanfic to me too (even if a more original one than the Alexandra Quick series were).

I thought it would be fitting to recommend it here, and that got me thinking --- which non-fanfiction books would /you/ find suitable to recommend to readers of this sub?


** Worm [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-1-gestation/]]

*** Hells to the yes. Also, the amount of good fanfiction for Worm is staggering. You will probably have to go to Spacebattles, Sufficientvelocity, and QuestionableQuesting, but it's so worth it.

** Do you want a book about magic for young adults or more general recs?

It's written for a young audience but Diane Duane's Young Wizards series is great. First books in the series were written years before Harry Potter, but she recently revised the series to smooth out some continuity issues (only a few years had passed in series time but the first books were set in the 1980s while the more recent books included ipods, etc.). A wonderfully imagined world that sets up wizards as essentially being the caretakers of creation attempting to slow entropy where possible, avoids simple "good vs. evil" dichotomy.

As a general genre fic rec I'd offer Lois McMaster Bujold, either her sprawling Vorkosigan space opera series or the Chalion fantasy series, both are fantastic, funny, good characterization, and well-written.

My other recommendation for book series would be The Dresden Files! I alternate between rereading Dresden and Vorkosigan pretty much constantly.

** The Malazan Empire series by Steven Erikson. I tend to gravitate to well-written fanfics with a lot of world-building, so the Malazan books are right up my ally. They're definitely not young adult or light-hearted, though.

** Lev Grossman's /The Magicians/ is excellent, along with its two sequels. The first half of the novel takes place in a school for magicians. The book has been called "Harry Potter for adults", but this should be taken with a huge grain of salt. It's not merely a sexed up and more mature Harry Potter. Nevertheless, I imagine that many who read fanfic would enjoy it. I certainly did.

[[http://www.avclub.com/review/lev-grossman-ithe-magiciansi-31495][This short review]] (no spoilers) doesn't do a bad job at explaining the appeal of the novel. [[http://www.tor.com/2011/08/03/the-magicians-by-lev-grossman/][This review]] goes into some more detail, but also includes several massive spoilers.

** The Bartimaeus Trilogy.

It's about a world where almost all magic is a form of summoning magic, rather than personal spell casting. The main character, Nathaniel, summons a spirit named Bartimaeus (also an important character) for petty reasons, only to find himself in over his head in politics and conspiracy.

** David Drake's General series is history fanfic with scifi and his Belisarius series is history fanfic with time travel. Then there's the Ring of Fire for more timetravel wackiness(20th century American town gets transported to 17th century Europe). Bonus you can get them and the first half of Bujold's Vorkosigan online [[http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com][here]] or [[http://hell.pl/szymon/Baen/][here]]

  Alone of every power in Middle-Earth, Saruman innovates, notably gunpowder. But he lost. What if he had a little help? Actually a cross-over between LOTR and the General series by David Drake. Uses both book and movie elements.

** Seriously? No one's mentioned The Dresden Files yet? I'd definitely recommend that series to anyone that's a fan of urban fantasy, or that likes the idea of a badass, gun-toting, wizard private eye.

EDIT: On further thought, this series has, besides the first name of the main character and the presence of magic, very little in common with the Harry Potter books. It's still a great read though.

** Technically, /Alexandra Quick/ is a Harry Potter fanfic, but it is so far removed from the setting of Harry Potter and so independently fashioned that it reads pretty much like an original series. TVTropes.org says,

#+begin_quote
  "The series is notable for being Darker and Edgier while still managing to capture the same feeling as Harry Potter, as well as exploring magic beyond that the students are taught in schools. With one of the most realistic and coherent portrayals of Magical America, Alexandra Quick is a lot more than fanfiction, it's closer to the Star Wars novels set in earlier eras with less Lucas guidance."

*** My phrasing wasn't very good then. I mentioned AQ precisely because it's still inside the HPFF realm. The intention was to describe /Mother of Learning/ as a story /feeling/ like a fanfic, but one that's so original that there's /nothing/ left from the canon in it (while in AQ, at least HP's magical system and universe were still there).
