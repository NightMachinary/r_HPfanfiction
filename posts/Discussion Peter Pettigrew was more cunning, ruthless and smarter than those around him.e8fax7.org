People often forget about Peter Pettigrew, or try to sell him short.

Okay: Let's forget that Peter was James and Lily's friend; he was imo very smart, cunning and ruthless.

He was able to trick the Aurors into thinking that Sirius was the Secret Keeper, it helped that Dumbledore and Remus thought Sirius was Secret Keeper, but still, he had faked his own death, and had somehow managed to kill 12 Muggles (Can someone explain that one? How did he manage to kill 12 Muggles without being noticed by it?)

He was able to become an Animagus; something that is said to be extremely difficult to do; but not only that, but he was able to do it while underage, making it even more difficult. He might have had helped (who knows) but he was still able to do it, when it's incredibly difficult for fully trained Witches and Wizards.

He might not be as powerful as his friends, but he was smart, ruthless and cunning, for reasons above.

He was also able to stay hidden in years as a rat, we see Sirius in hiding as his dog Animagus, that's not good for him, imagine that for Peter, before he came across the Weasley family.

He was also the one to bring Voldemort back, I'm sure Voldemort could have contacted Bellatrix Lestrange or Lucius Malfoy, but it was Peter Pettigrew that found him, that helped bring him back.

Was he a coward? Hell yes. Was he not as charming or likable as his friends? Hell yes. was he not as powerful as his friends? (Maybe). But I'd say he was very cunning, ruthless and smarter than those around him.

Do I like Peter Pettigrew? Hell no. But I do think that people give him not enough credit for the stuff he's done. Yes it was on the wrong side, but still.


** Peter is cunning but you are giving him way too much credit lol. /He/ didn't trick the aurors, they already thought that as Dumbledore thought that because James and Lily told him that. It helped that Sirius said it was his fault (I think) and Barty/Fudge didn't try to investigate. And Peter killed 12 muggles by blowing up the street with the Blasting Curse.

With the help of a transfiguration prodigy.

Because no one but Lupin knew he was an animagus and we know what Lupin does in lieu of facing or admitting a truth.

Sirius was already thin and haggard from Azkaban and, I could be wrong, but I believe Peter specifically sought out a wizarding family.

Voldemort was a wraith who had to posses rats for 12 years he couldn't contact anyone. Lucius wasn't trying to look for him and Bellatrix was in Azkaban without a way out. /Peter/ knew about Voldemort in 1992. He /only/ sought him out because he had no where else to go.

TL;DR Peter just had the stars align for him in the form of trust, grief, incompetence, and cowardice

Lupin also assumed Pettigrew was resting in pieces so even if he knew the Weasleys had a rat with a long lifespan, I doubt he would have thought to say anything.

Yeah, I think Sirius did say that Peter would have sought out a Wizarding family in order to keep an ear to the events of the wider world.

Sirius had to live in a cave and live off rats. He relied on rare chances to eavesdrop and get information.

Peter, on the other hand, found a Wizarding family with a bunch of kids so he ate like a king, could listen in whenever he wanted, and lived the life any fugitive would dream of up until Sirius escaped Azkaban.

** I believe JKR has said that the sorting hat might have put him into either Slytherin or Gryffindor at the sorting, and that this was one of the people she had Dubledore refer to when telling Snape in DH that he "sometimes think we sort too soon." So yeah, I think she definitely imagined him as cunning when she wrote him.

Remus says in PoA that he "needed all the help he could get" with becoming an animagus, and that it was therefore lucky Sirius and James were "the cleverest students in the school" and could help him. It seems they tried for a very long time and then "finally managed it" in their fifth year. He absolutely couldn't have been completely stupid to manage it, although I think the impression from the books we get is that he wasn't necessarily book smart. Voldemort makes fun of his potioneering abilities in GoF and Sirius makes fun of how much he struggles to describe the physical appearance of a werewolf in their DADA OWLs. He killed the twelve muggles with a single spell, however, and that was clearly very powerful magic and means he must have been good at some types of magic.

He was never seen as as good or as brave as the other three Marauders, which is said to be the reason that nobody suspected he was the secret keeper. Sirius and James clearly knew he would not be suspected, and from that point of view the idea to switch secret keepers worked as they intended. In PoA Sirius says that Peter began passing information to Voldemort a year before the Potters died, and a year is a very long time to be a successful spy. It's suggested in the books that Remus thought Sirius was the spy and vice versa, so that maybe explains part of his success. Maybe Peter even helped to sow those seeds of doubt between his best friends.

*** When people talk about the Marauders being Animagus, they seem to forget that they all became one when they were underage, not saying you forgot, just in a general sense.

If it's difficult for a full blown Witch or Wizard to be one, it by sure is difficult for a teenager, to become one.

I could definitely see Pettigrew as a Slytherin, I often think many of the time he acted like a sniveling coward, he was very smart, and acted, of course I could be giving him too much credit, but with everything he's done, it wouldn't surprise me in the least.
