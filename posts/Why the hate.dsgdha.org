I've noticed a really weird trend in at least 3 fics where Zacharias Smith is portrayed closer to how Draco Malfoy normally is-- a hateful, spiteful coward who ends up hating Harry with no provocation. Where did this trope come from? I've seen it mostly in fics where Draco starts off on a friendlier path with first year Harry, do writers just need a bad kid to make an enemy?


** He was snide to Harry during the inaugural DA meeting. It's easy to extrapolate from there, and the writer doesn't have to come up with an OC.

** Yep, people who want to redeem Draco need a douchey kid to fill that role in their fic. Zacharias Smith is probably related to Hepzibah Smith, who was a pretty unpleasant character, so you can do a lot of the same tropes of an ancient family of snobs that you can with the Malfoys.

I've always been kind of interested in the idea of a nasty Hufflepuff and I'm sure others are too, so that might also be a factor, particularly if the author has a soft spot for Slytherins and portrays them more sympathetically.

This is probably my least favorite trope for this character. That connection is always made.

It's, like... people have to know Smith is a super common last name, right? I must know at least 4 Smiths and none of them have any familial relation.

**** Yea, but the wizarding world is very small, names are important, Smith is in Hufflepuff while Hepzibah Smith claimed to be an descendant of Helga Hufflepuff and the wiki acknowledges it as a "possible but unconfirmed relative". We also know he's not a muggleborn. Could easily be a grandnephew or some such. I mean, it makes sense.

***** And Zac Smith doesn't really seem like a typical Hufflepuff either.

Edit: I am saying that the only reason Smith is in Hufflepuff is because of a Hufflepuff descent.

****** Which is exactly why I (and I suspect many others) like him being nasty. Slytherins among us persuaded us that not all Slytherins are Death Eaters (thus Daphne Greengrass and her popularity), by the same logic there must be some nasty Gryffindor and Hufflepuff. The Gryffindor one is canonically at least Cormac McLaggen and Zachariah Smith can serve the same purpose for Hufflepuffs.

******* My thought with McLaggen is that while Gryffindors can be noble and chivalrous, they are also known for being bullheaded and rude. Thus, while the “Noble Warriors” like Harry, Ron, Hermione, and others are one side of Gryffindor, the Cormac McLaggens are another side of the same coin. Perhaps they'd be more prevalent if there were more children in Harry's year. As for Smith, I think the main reason he is in Hufflepuff is as a descendant of Helga Hufflepuff.

** I mean, in canon there isn't really anything /positive/ about him that can be said (you can easily rationalize his DA attendance for say peer pressure or self-serving interests). None of his behaviors are particularly egregious, its mainly that he is at best a snobby loudmouth and at worst a cowardly arse. Harry generally only makes note of people who do things he doesn't like, so if you see Harry's viewpoint (i.e. canon) as entirely accurate, than its perfectly acceptable to depict him poorly or in a negative light.

Its also a bit helpful for authors who, contrary to what Rowling set up, actually want some of their villain/antagonists to not only be Slytherins (not including Peter, but that is never really addressed in any regard and its implied that Voldemort threatened or coerced him somewhere down the line). Rowling really only started to show the flip-side of the houses in any way in the 5th book, where for example we get Smith and Edgecombe who show off the darker side of each of their houses traits. In the 6th book we see the other sides of Gryffindor and Slytherin as well, what with McClaggen, Vane and Slughorn showing up to sort of defy the stereotypes.

TLDR: Smith isn't shown in a good light in the books, somewhat justifiably and somewhat in a biased manner, and authors really only have a limited set of antagonistic or 'bad' characters to work with at Hogwarts anyway.

** If you put all his canon mentions together - more than just the one time he was a douche at the first DA meeting - he IS written as a thoroughly unpleasant and selfish individual. Unlike a Draco Malfoy however, he is not openly boasting about and supporting discrimination, nor is he out to actually hurt people with anything else than derisive words. He is, however, shown to be self-serving, cowardly and derisive to others and is never really shown to be anything else.

Smith seems to only be at the first DA gathering to get new information out of Harry, he questions and criticizes everything he teaches, got cursed by Ginny for badgering her so incessantly in year 6 about what happened in the ministry, uses the quidditch commentary spot to insult Ron and Gryffindor the entire game despite them winning convincingly (when Ron thought he drunk the felix felicis) and does this so much that Ginny dive-bombs him claiming she "forgot to brake" with a smile to a raging McGonagall, flees hogwarts and does not join to defend in year seven when Voldemort attacks but was there before that night and a couple others.

To answer your question though : yes, writing often needs an antagonist - or it certainly makes things easier. Small-time antagonists like this can also easily be used for smaller sub-plots while the bigger threat isn't showing much at present time. Also gives an easy outing the flex the MC's muscles against.
