Years ago I read a fanfction that was non-magic. Harry's parents were alive and Tom Riddle was a obsessed stalker. One scene I remember clearly, Harry was at the mall with his mom when he run into Tom. later in the parking lot, when they get back to the car, there is a painting of Harry in the car. Or something like that. If you have any idea let me know, I would love to read it again!
