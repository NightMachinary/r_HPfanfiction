I recently posted a fic request relating to fics that are similar to the fic Patron. Its been getting down voted like crazy ever since I posted it. It jumps up to 4 or 5 upvotes then crashes back down to 0. This is not the first time I have posted a request for fic recommendations and been down voted a TON.

Why? Can someone give me an acceptable reason to down vote a fic request (unless its against the actual rules of the sub or extremely controversial like child abuse focused fics?)

If you do not like what someone requested, simply ignore it. The thread is not intended for you. But for those who ARE interested, down voting does not help visibility in any way. Its kind of a dick move to down vote like that.

*** Comment down votes due to not liking I can understand, even if its not the intention of the down vote button. But a request thread is not about opinions (or like/dislike) but is about an information search/request by someone. There should be no reason to down vote it even IF you dislike it. Its sad if folks go that far.

** What I downvote requests for:

- Bad, unclear naming or post content
- Abundance of grammatical errors
- Asking for the same stuff that was just asked by somebody else
- Troll requests, and similar.

Those don't pertain to your request though, but I have strong suspicion that people might've downvoted it because they are tired of how most fics exaggerate levels of prejudice in Wizarding Britain from how it was presented in canon.

If that's truly the case then that's extremely pathetic by those down voting, and does not bode well for the future of Fan fiction if folks are afraid to explore beyond canon. Fan fiction is LITERALLY about exploring outside of canon, whether on the extreme end or not. So even if the fics exaggerate levels of prejudice, that's what fan fiction is meant to do.

Which is a problem I have with you, as you're apparently willing to shamelessly take from a community and not give anything back. Interestingly, this also fits the whole Malfoy theme you have going.

DLP's Work by Authors section doesn't exist to be a secret library, but rather a forum for authors to receive feedback from fellow writers and readers of fanfiction. It's where many authors, myself included, honed our craft, not a place to go just to read the last few chapters of The Santi's story.

******* Its inevitable that story-tourists would enter the DLP forums, since it's almost impossible to keep word from getting out that there are more chapters of someone's favorite fanfiction out there.

The only solution would require a isolation of the forum, or the authors posting their missing chapters for everybody to see. Neither solution would be ideal or feasible, I think.

So, I guess the DLP forums will have to deal with the fact that some users come for 1 story and are then off again.

Never did I state or insinuate that. I'm stating that their opinion is oftentimes not mainstream, given most HP FF readers have far lower quality standards than the average veteran DLP user, who has likely been reading HP fanfiction for over a decade.

Some of my favorite stories were ones recommended by them, I'll give them that. But I just don't think their type fits the mold of the majority of people here, let alone on communities that solely exist on fanfiction.net.

I've never had a bad experience with them. Just my opinion on their standards for a good story.

There was only 4 last year (Hallowed, What You Leave Behind, Shadow of Angmar, Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much.) Of note, that's just when the story was put up for review, not when it was actually written, in which case only a single one of these stories was actually written in the last 2 years.

This doesn't mean that they necessarily have high standards, it could just mean that there simply aren't that many good stories being written these days, and when you see these stories and think back to proven classics, they're mostly not anywhere close to the quality.

* I sometimes upvote a comment if it appears that a valid comment is being persecuted for being unpopular (usually only if it goes negative)\\

I'm pretty sure that Starfox and InquisitorCOC alone gather that much easily on "good" days.

****** It gets recommended a lot. Part of this, no doubt, stems from [[/u/Starfox5]] being a regular to the sub and he/she having a solid group of fellow travelers who promote the story, a bit like JoeHundredaire and his posse back in the day on SpaceBattles. And part of it is because it's objectively good fiction (for fanfiction). There are a lot of words, interesting concepts and world building, and largely competent execution.

That said, it's arguable that it's not quite so ultra-mega as to deserve priority billing in every other thread--and there have been times when it at least seems to have gotten that kind of exposure. It's one of a handful of stories that show up all the time (along with /Seventh Horcrux, Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, A Black Comedy, Catharsis, Stages of Hope/, ...) on here and I can understand how folks get a bit weary of the broken record of recs.

****** It's a long fic, and it it does fit a larger number of requests than shorter stories. For example, it has an alternate Triwizard Tournament (four tasks, events for other students), it includes werewolf politics/society, not too common pairings (Krum/Tonks, Ron/Pansy), general world building (Magical France, Bulgaria, Turkey, Jamaica), an uncommon main character like Aberforth, a manipulative but benevolent Dumbledore, and that's without touching the main story of the AU.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** The whole point of Reddit, as a content aggregator, is that content that people want to see drifts to the top and content that people don't want to see gets effectively removed. If a thread, request or otherwise, gets downvoted, it's because it is unpopular content. That is Reddit working as it is supposed to.

**** I almost never vote on threads, largely because I can't bring myself to care enough to click, but I do wonder what's the point is of having such functionality if exercising it means the offenders are "acting like dicks."

Recall the boneheaded decision some months back to add a (selectively enforced) subreddit rule to forbid discussion in request threads. If discussion is forbidden (to those of us who follow the rules), then the only way to express disapproval of, say, a six-hundred-fifteenth "looking for time travel fics" request would be through a thread downvote. Again, I don't do this, because I seriously don't care, but I could understand how someone, tiring of watching the same requests for the same fics pop up again and again, might do so.

Perhaps we should just remove all up/down votes on threads and comments and be done with it.

****** Why allow any up or down votes on anything since having an opinion means one is "acting like dicks" or being "petty"?

Though it's inconsistently enforced, discussion is already expressly forbidden on any request threads, the majority of the threads on this sub. In your most perfect vision of nobody being permitted to express an opinion (lest they be a "dick"), even through the soft opprobrium of a downvote on content they find distasteful, redundant, or objectionable (again, something I generally don't do), then it seems reasonable to disable voting altogether.

Though let's entertain carrying your vision to its idyllic extreme and consider enacting a rule to forbid posting any content whatsoever, save for links to the bot. That'll make for a lively forum, a perfectly fair, lovely aggregation of fanfiction links and little else. I know I'll be happy to never read another "DLP sucks" rant by a butthurt author or yet another tired iteration of the "MOR sucks!" "MOR is awesome!" 'debate'.
