**** what play on words.

But seriously i facepalmed every time he used disarming instead of either stunning or something more harmful while being in a battle to the death situations. Pepole kept jumping in to save him while he basically fought with a hand behind his back.

***** That's to highlight the fact that he doesn't fight to kill because he is the good hero. During the first duel with Voldemort it made sense throwing the spell he felt most comfortable with in front of imminent death. In Stan Shunpike's case he said he didn't want to stun him so he won't fall off of his broom. In the final duel, he was pretty confident that the Elder Wand won't harm him and just wanted to take it from Voldemort.
