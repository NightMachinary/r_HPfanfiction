The title says more or less everything. After having re-read Out of the Night for the I don't know how many time, I'm still sad that it's incomplete and the one try of someone to continue it that I know of went down after a chapter I think.

Is there anything that is similar in that Harry "finally learns to be a wizard"? I loved that Hermione thought about "people did things for me because I'm muggleborn, but nobody ever did anything like that for Harry because they didn't think he'd need it" - I really can't imagine that they just dumped the muggleborns at Hogwarts without basic things like how to write with a quill, some "these are the electives you can take later, if you want to do x you should take care to get good grades in y because what you learn there matters" and stuff - and also that being lazy and doing things with magic is just natural for a wizard.

I also really enjoyed closed community of the dark wizards - and that it wasn't some "sacred 28" or whatnot thing, but in essence nothing more then a minority religion that's prosecuted might be in the real world. They don't do anything bad, they aren't anything special, they just see the world in a different way that the majority doesn't like and branded to get rid of it. And you don't have to do anything more to join then "really mean it when you say you want to join". And suddenly they are all more or less your friends and willing to help you and overlook things about you that normally would have made them keep their distance.

And of course, that Harry becomes part of the same group as lots of death eaters without them knowing was hilarious - I tried so often to imagine how the huge revelation would turn out.

Lot's more things I enjoyed about it, but I suppose that's what I'm thinking about when saying "similar". Is there anything else like that?


** Linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) has a very interesting take on how muggleborns could be integrated into the wizarding world, but it's not a main part of the story. The fic is amazing as far as worldbuilding goes though

*** Thanks for the suggestion, sounds intresting enough on it's own, even if it only fits very loosely what I'm looking for - bookmarking it :)

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
