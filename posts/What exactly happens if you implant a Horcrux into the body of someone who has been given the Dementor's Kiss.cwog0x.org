As the body would be living but vacant, do you think the Horcrux would be able to possess the body?

If what Voldemort did to Bathilda Bagshot is any indication, yes.

***** Yeah, but a snake can't exactly puppeteer a limbed creature, regardless of how ghoulish it was.

**** Maybe, but I don't think so. The body was reanimated, but Nagini was inside it.

** Pretty sure it would be able to do so. We know that Horcruxes can possess a body and I guess it would be a lot easier for it if it doesn't need to share the body with another soul.

** Insta-possession IMHO (so you basically have a copy of the guy who made the 'crux runing around with another body now)

** Now I'm imagining a chapter of 7 Voldemorts running around instead of 7 Potters. Voldy could fire all of his death eaters and just do the work himself.
