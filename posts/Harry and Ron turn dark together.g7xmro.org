You get all this Ron Bashing but I really want some of them working together, rebelling against all expectations placed upon them! Preferably not including Hermione Thanks! :)


** I seriously don't ever think I've read such a fic. It's really hard to find some good ff's without Hermione in them and people are just so eager to see Ron Bashing for some reason... I'll look for some ff's. Sorry I couldn't be of more help...

** I was thinking about writing a fic exactly like this before but the plot is still on my mind not paper

*** I might have some ideas of how they could go "dark", although it would be closer to grey

**** I already did imagine how they go dark in my script and they go extremely deep in there:

To keep it short it's an AU where a Gryffindor's dark wizard rise, he get so pissed off at Voldemort and the DE that his main goal is wiping off every singles Slytherins of Earth, Slytherins are the embodiment of evil and must be purged. This dark wizard will brainwashed Hogwart's students into hating this house and he'll use Harry as a weapon against Voldemort. At the beginning, Harry doesn't really buy the whole "kill all slytherins and this world will change for the better"... However when he was held captive in the Malfoy's manor during the horcrux hunt, Bellatrix killed Hermione which caused both Harry and Ron to go insane and slaughter every single DE in the manor while a terrified Luna watch. They fully embrace the anti slytherin bias afterward.

I was inspired by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][this]] fic.

** I know Gryffindors Never Die has Hermione bashing with Ron and Harry being friends, but I'm not sure how dark they go. Might be worth checking out?

*** They don't go that dark... just morally grey. It's a good fic, I've read it a couple of times
