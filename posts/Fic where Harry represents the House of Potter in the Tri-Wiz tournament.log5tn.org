** It might be A Godfather's Promise by TheMetalSage. The potter crest is an extinct Iceni Black dragon and Harry decided that he would represent the house of potter in the tournament. The story is heavy BDSM and I don't remember if the author aged the characters up so that's why I only provide a link to the author's page.
