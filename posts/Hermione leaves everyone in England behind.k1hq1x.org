:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Essentially Hermione leaves for the US and gets a job at the ministry there but cuts off all contact with people from home. Harry/Malfoy are auror partners and transfer to the US for like 3 months or something and Hermione/Harry reunite and rebuild their relationship. Only other plot point I can remember is Hermione having a panic attack when she sees Harry and Malfoy practice dueling. I never got around to finishing this one and can't remember the title or the author so if anyone knows it I would really appreciate the help. Thanks everyone!


** Not exactly “Breakfast In New York by Radaslab” linkffn(5141159), but it seems pretty close (see [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/live-like-you-are-not-a-christian.html][my review]]).

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.
