I haven't seen this brought up in the last few days since the Pottermore info about other magical schools came out, but everyone's favorite super Harry cliche is now "canon". (I've seen varying opinions on whether the Pottermore info should be considered canon or not but for now lets just say that it is)

#+begin_quote
  The wand is a European invention, and while African witches and wizards have adopted it as a useful tool in the last century, many spells are cast simply by pointing the finger or through hand gestures. This gives Uagadou students a sturdy line of defence when accused of breaking the International Statute of Secrecy ('I was only waving, I never meant his chin to fall off').
#+end_quote

Rowling has made it official that wandless magic can go beyond the simple lighting up your wand that Harry did that one time. In fact being able to make someone's chin fall off with a simple wave of the hand seems rather advanced to me.

Not only did we get confirmation of wandless magic but we also got some info on advanced self transfiguration among young students.

#+begin_quote
  Many older and more experienced witches and wizards felt threatened by fourteen-year-olds who could turn at will into elephants and cheetahs, and a formal complaint was lodged with the International Confederation of Wizards by Adrian Tutley (Animagus: gerbil).
#+end_quote

So how do you think this will affect the way fanfiction views these kinds of advanced forms of magic and how they are used in Fanfiction?


** The existence of wandless magic has always made sense - isn't that what accidental magic with little kids is? Changing a teacher's hair to a new color is fairly advanced for a little kid, I'd say.

Maybe we'll see more of it, but I hope that it doesn't go overboard. Good stories have limits and challenges. With wandless magic, making it more costly and/or less precise ensures that a person doesn't become too godlike. It also makes a certain amount of logical sense - tools help us do things more easily and with more precision than we can typically manage with our bare hands.

I fear, though, that it may just be employed without limits and sense. It aleady is in some cases, after all.

***** I disagree. According to the new material, they'd have to be fairly powerfully adept to make the Ministry appeal to the ICW about it. Further, they've spent centuries blending both wanded and wandless magic. On another note, the general assumption is that wands lend ease and precision, but not necessarily power. I'd surmise whatever power benefits derived would depend almost entirely upon the wand materials and branch of magic practiced. All that to say, a better analogy to me would be: some people can easily lift 150lbs unassisted. And some can do it easier and faster with a forklift. In a one on one battle, I'd be more inclined to believe they both have an even shot all things being equal. Additionally, my own head canon ( and others I've read ) lean toward the strength of wandless magic being derived from practice. This lends itself to the analogy above. If you don't workout your muscles or your magic, neither will be strong. Also, on a logical note, the wandless strength required to damage a human would probably not be a massive amount wizard or muggle, piercing flesh ( or even just destroying organ, etc) probably not that hard.

This is assuming the arsenal of spells castable by a reasonable wizard without a wand contains such magic and that it's precise enough to actually aim it at said organ, all at a meaningful range (because if you have to touch someone to do it, you might as well just stab them). Or, is this one of those "I can cast an Engorgement Charm, but only on their brain, so that they suffer a cerebral edema!" acts of cleverness?

#+end_quote

In my own fic, wandless magic plays a very small role and I've emphasized that without a wand, magic is harder to do and is a lot less precise. A wand is frequently referred to as a "focus," and so consider what a lack of focus does.

Shield? Summon? Banish? That wouldn't be too hard.

Transfiguration with a lot of delicate details? Almost certainly not.

*** Why should it have - a lot of - limits?

I mean people were clearly doing magic before the wand was developped! The wand may cut down on expended magic or maybe it makes focusing easier or something, but all in all it's just a tool - a crutch!

They just depend on their wands now and don't even believe they can do without, which renders them a muggle without it basically (ok: They can still "teleport" (and do animagus transformations if they ever bothered to learn how - sadly Harry the slacker didn't, despite it being possible to ask damned Sirius Black for the process and it being another link to his father and maybe even helpful for survival -.-) but that's it and even that doesn't work if there are wards in place!)

I always thought it strange that something like this was not utilized in the books - is it a form of government control (like some fanfiction suggest that declaring stuff as "dark magic" because most wizards and witches can't cast it and because it's tremendous advantage if you can) to keep the population more docile (as in: Easier to subdue? I mean a simple disarming-charm is enough in most cases!) or is it because it can't be tracked (some fiction suggests that they trace underage magic through the wand, so a witch/wizard not using one could get away with a lot!)?

**** A tool's not always a crutch to make things easier. It also can allow you to do things you couldn't do otherwise. So it's possible some things cannot be accomplished without a wand no matter how well-trained someone is at wandless magic. I mean, African wizards and witches must have adopted the use of a wand for a reason. Another possibility is that it requires so much increased focus and power that it's actually a handicap in a fight. I consider Voldemort's use of a wand as evidence that wandless magic should have some serious limitations. He traveled extensively. He was all for power in any form. Why would he rely so heavily on his wand unless there was an advantage to doing so?

As for it not being taught, we don't actually know that nobody taught wandless magic in Britain. It just wasn't taught at Hogwarts. 3-year auror program maybe? We know there's exchange student opportunities too.

Why else would African wizards, who are very proficient at wandless magic, adopt a foreign tool? This heavily implies that using wand has a huge advantage over wandless magic. What that advantage is, is for the writer to decide.

Sadly though I think that many writers will fail to read this, and simply use wandless magic as a way to empower their favourite character without giving it any form of disadvantage. Basically no different what is currently happening, /oh joy/.

Simple common sense really. If wands were simply a tool that makes casting easier then they wouldn't have adopted it, both pride (in their wandless casting) and cost (wands are expensive, more so for Africans as wandmaking isn't a native profession) would prevent adopting the wand.

Now if casting magic with wands produces better results then adopting it would make sense.

Except mobile phones have a huge advantage over landline phones: able to receive and give calls where ever you are. It's also personal, you don't have to share it with others. These advantages outweigh all the negatives hence its successful adaptation in the late 90s.

Applying this to using wands over wandless magic means that, again, using wands has a huge advantage over wandless magic. Hence African wizards are adopting it.

Complex tools create new problems that need solutions. Wands, however, are much more like hammers or axes than they are like PCs. People were building things and using wood long before they started fashioning stone into axes and hammers, but the creation of such tools made the work easier - and was a very important step in our evolution as a species, too.

There are certainly situations where being able to do something without a focus is handy, but there's no obvious reason why doing so should be assumed to be superior. The use of tools is what's helped propel us to the top of the food chain, not shackled us.

What's more, let's not forget the fact that in HP, non-humans are /forbidden/ from using wands. Forbidden. Not allowed. Banned.

Does anyone here really think that the Ministry is likely to force goblins and other creatures to use a superior form of magic? Of course not. If wands made you weaker or helped the Ministry control you, goblins would have wands fused to their hands at birth.

Goblins aren't looking to use wands because they want more shackles from the Ministry. No, the only reason for wanting wands - magical /tools/ - is because they would allow goblins to perform magic /better/.

#+begin_quote
  Not really, which of the tools we (muggles!) use weaken us?
#+end_quote

A wizard without a wand is a muggle. A muggle without /any/ tools - which is the /correct/ comparison - is a weak, slow, soft bit of lunch. Strip /all/ the tools away from you, and you're slower than other predators, have no claws, have little protection from the elements, and likely won't survive for very long in the wilderness.

We muggles depend on our tools even more than wizards and witches depend on their wands. Because we don't have magic, we don't have a single all-purpose tool, but the dependency is still there.

It makes sense to me that wandless magic would be harder to control and less precise (since the wand acts as a channeling tool) but I do think it's strange that there was seemingly little to no wandless magical instruction. Like you said, it leaves them almost completely defenseless if their wand is taken or broken. JKR deciding that there are some cultures that only very recently began using wands makes this even more baffling, since before I just always assumed that it took an especially talented witch or wizard to be able to pull it off effectively.

Tool creation and use have been critical in making us what we are as a species. I'm frankly astounded that anyone would call them a crutch.

Is electricity a crutch? Is your computer a crutch?

Is a Stradivarius a crutch? Did Michelangelo use crutches when he created his statue "David"? Should he really have used his bare hands?

A tool can only properly be deemed a "crutch" when a person is capable of achieving the exact same effect with (more or less) the same effort, but allows their dependency on the tool to impede the development of valuable or necessary skills.

Writing fanfiction is arguably a "crutch" if, by doing it, I avoid developing the skills necessary to create my own, original fiction that would be just as good or better than my fanfiction. Training wheels are a "crutch" if my use of them allows me to avoid learning how to balance on a two-wheeled bicycle.

There is no evidence that wands are a "crutch" and, based on millions of years of history of tool development and use, absolutely no reason to think that they would be. We can add to that the evidence from canon that wands are a desirable addition rather than unnecessary.

I've been working on the assumption that wandless magic was harder, simpler, had shorter range and really couldn't pull off transfiguring other things but it would be optimal for self-transfiguration.

Also, Harry lighting up his wand in the alley wasn't exactly wandless magic- he made the wand light up. If he had lit up his shoe, it would have been wandless. Instead I see that as a case of a well-trained wand responding to a vague, distant invocation.

Basically, make wandless magic a nice trick, a thing African Wizards do for cultural reasons, and something that can be a life saver in some situations.

I'm really split about this site. On one side I'm glad that Rowling still tries to deliver, but on the other side I feel like a lot of what is delivered is inferior to what is already written somewhere in the "Professional Novel-tier" on ff.net.

She has a tendency to make stuff super-OP. I mean, if wandless magic can deliver as well as any seventh year with a wand, why use a wand? Why aren't Aurors trained in Africa to at least have the "secondary" option of blowing someones head off with a hand gesture? I know the arguments of tradition, isolationists british,... are going to be named, but over the course of the centuries, someone with power ought to be like "hey, this could be really useful" and "why are we using something any fifth-year could take from us by a simple spell?".

Well, at least this explains one way of how the Marauders were able to become Animagi that soon.

Also, the comment:

#+begin_quote
  Much (some would say all) magic originated in Africa,
#+end_quote

I'm not sure what to do with that. Who was the first wizard/witch/shaman/mambo/priest that made something glow white, or summoned flames to feed and protect the tribe/clan/nation? Was the first kind of magic some ritual of a natural religion? Tell me, Joanne! This is was infuriates me so on Pottermore. Any kind of worlbuilding is done with a wordcount that other fiction authors use to introduce you to something. This only leaves me with, at the end, barely more than I had before.

Anyway, if this is what wandless magic is like, I think its entirely too strong. I was always a fan of wandless magic being unfocused, hard to pull off and time-consuming to learn. Now it seems like you could just not use a wand and be fine. Then why use it at all? Wands are chunky, wands are feeble wooden sticks that can break, wands can be taken from you, wands are simply the inferior way of spellcasting if there is close to no advantage to wandless casting. If the africans adopted the wand as a useful tool (for whatever spells - Rowling worldbuilding once again in action), why didn't the europeans adopt the wandless casting? At least for their elite troops. At least for those guys who could really do with some sort of secondary weapon should their foci break. I'm not inclined to take colonialism as an answer to that. For one because the Statute of Secrecy got established before colonialism took on its most ridiculous forms with the introduction of Darwinism and second because colonialists (despite what people might say) were rather eager to copy or steal as much unknown know-how from the natives as possible. If some wizard colonialists came, they ought to be fascinated by the wandless casting and try to learn it.

In the end this is gonna be just as much ignored by me as the Potter family tree. Charlus and Dorea all the way, and african wizards use wands or other foci as long as I don't get some limitation to this blatant OP-ness of african wizards.

** I think this might lead to more people using wandless magic as another avenue, instead of something to simply achieve out of strength. Clearly they're all capable of it, it's just a matter of figuring out, or remembering, how. When you've been trained to channel your magic in a specific way, I can see it being difficult to relearn that. I'd love to see that explored.

Some people are bound to be stuck in one mentality. Like Neville for instance- he's learned to channel his magic in a specific way, using a specific tool, and up to a certain point he had little confidence in his abilities. He seems like someone who would be stuck in a 'this is what works' mindset and thus be relatively unable to make wandless magic work. But someone else who could sort of *tell* what their magic felt like as they channeled it (something I've seen in fics) might be better able to change how it works.

As for the self transfiguration, that also seems like a "Well this way works, let's use it!" that's less hindered by strict processes and rules. It does specifically say 'self transfiguration,' not 'animagus,' so for the time being I'm considering the two to be different. We know that wizards can self-transfigure, Slughorn transfigured himself into a chair, didn't he? This is similar, they're changing themselves into animals though. But the Animagus process is a strenuous and long process, involving holding I think it was a mandrake leaf in your mouth for a solid month.

Tl;dr, if you've learned how to channel it one way, learning to do it a different way might be really difficult. So start young! And the self transfiguration doesn't really change anything, and probably ties into the channeling it a certain way.

** I personally love this.

I think a lot of people try to approach Harry Potter too literally. Me personally, I've always been a sucker for the symbolism.

So what is a wand? It's a piece of mundane nature (wood), coupled with magical matter (magic core) that chooses a person based on their personality (self/soul) and says something about your character and the way you use your magical power.

So it is a sentient tool which helps you tap into your magical power. Without it and learning to use it, your self is what causes magic. Accidental magic is this sort of magic.

So if the self drives wandless magic through emotion, need, conviction, very primal needs and wants. The wand chooses you based on it's attraction to your self, arguably knowing what type of character you are better than you (a la the sorting hat). The wand also allows more mental/specialized tasks without primal convictions.

What would allow that much control over wandless magic? I think it would be self-knowledge. Maybe the greater African wizards have a great cognition of who they are and what they are about. 'Knowing thyself' is really hard to do, having an aid at really knowing what you'r about, such as your wand, might help in honing in the intent and conviction at channeling magic.

One other thing that this might imply is that different cultures and ways of life affect how magic is used or allows itself to be used. It's not exp. 343 to level 13 mage, it's organic and mercurial and extremely contextual, maybe even sentient. It could work against you, such as Harry's luck and path to victory against Voldemort (who I don't think magic liked very much).

She could research more into these cultures and differentiate further, but Harry Potter isn't particularly about world building for me personally. But I wouldn't mind if she acquires more of a world building focus.

** I thought wandless magic was already part of canon. Didn't Remus conjure flames in his hand without a wand in PoA? And aren't animagus transormations wandless as well?

I think wandless magic can be a really good tool in your story. Like "Harry loses his wand while he's on the run and has to relearn magic." But you've got to be careful not to make it too overpowered. Maybe make it wild, sporadic and somewhat out-of-control? Like Harry has no real control over it?

**** exactly. i was just wondering if there are benefits to a wand, if i were imaging it then i'd go with more precision or more power; or possible there aren't any wandless spells so things to abstract become difficult.

** I think part of the support for wandless magic comes from a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy][naturalistic fallacy]].

*Wands = technology*

*Wandless = natural*

Natural is always better, right? The imperialistic, industrialized Europeans have cast aside our harmony with nature and our own bodies. The Asian and African magicals laugh at how the Europeans limit themselves with their wands!

That aside, I quite like when it's used cleverly, or just for fun (like in Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch).

** Wandless magic even shows up in the very first movie. When Harry and Hagrid enter the Leaking Cauldron(?) the first time, there is a wizard in the foreground using wandless magic to stir his tea while reading /A Brief History of Time/ by Stephen Hawking.
