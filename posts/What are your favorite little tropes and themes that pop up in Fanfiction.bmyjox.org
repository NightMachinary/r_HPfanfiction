One of mine is the idea that the Horcrux in Harry's Scar is the cause of his bad vision, and when the soul piece is removed his vision corrects itself in a bout of accidental magic.

*** I am a bit split of the issue. From one side, Parseltongue can be learnt (since Dumbledore could understand it, and Ron managed to activate an Parseltongue password with some hissing). So the whole "talk to serpent" is not a "physical" trait but a magical one. And magic seem to be linked to the soul (since Horcruxe can speak Parseltongue when in another's body). So the idea that the soul left something behind after he died is not that far fetched.

From another side, "Harry marching to his death" plot was made with the destruction of Voldemort' soul in mind. The complete destruction. Harry keeping some part of this soul leave a bad aftertaste, as if it had not completely worked.

*** You could even make that canon-compliant, if we assume the Peverells to be decendents of Slytherin, or if Slytherin is the decendent of one of the Brothers but Parseltongue is a trait he inherited from their line, then it'd make sense for the Potters to inherit that ability as well.

***** I like the idea of it coming from Lily, especially if no one ever confirms in the fic that Lily was some long lost heir to some wizarding family.

That would imply that her family had some genetic marker or trait that allows for Parseltongue, but that it is only activated when mixed with certain traits only found in the Wizarding community.

** Harry was offered Slytherin by the Sorting Hat and was picked by a phoenix feather wand at Ollivander's due to the horcrux. The Hat also offered Slytherin to Ginny because of the horcrux in the Diary, and from JKR commentary, she was chosen by a yew wand at Ollivander's.

Later, her (his?) skills are very much responsible for their lucky escape from the DoM; her airtight magical contract is the key to DA's safety during Year 7; and her killing of large number of Death Eaters during the Final Battle prevents a collapse of the defenders. During her duel with Bellatrix, she holds back a little too much and is almost hit by a killing curse. But alas, Molly takes over and finishes the job just fine.

After the war, she continues to use (guide) the Trio to advance her cause, while playing the role of a popular athlete herself. From time to time though, she needs to kill and torture some pesky enemies just for stress relief. Twenty years later, the Trio does indeed make it to the top, and she can happily rule behind the scene. Both Tom and Ginny should be proud of her achievements.

*** The idea is pretty believable for Harry, but I don't think Ginny had had the Diary /nearly/ long enough for it to have that kind of influence on her by the time she bought her wand. Its yew-ness is likely related to Ginny's own propensity for cursing people (¨cough¨ Bat-Bogey Hex ¨cough cough¨) rather than anything to do with Diarymort's interference. As for the Hat offering her Slytherin... it's possible, y'know? But I doubt it. Even then, she hadn't had the Diary for a very long time at all.

And either way, the obvious flaw in the theory is that surely, if the Hat can detect the presence of Scardemort in Harry's head, it would have /said/ something about it, no? “Now see here, Mr Riddle, I already Sorted you /once/ --- splitting yourself is no excuse, the rules are the rules. Now stop mucking with my Legilimency and let me Sort Mr Potter in peace.”

************ I'm struggling to understand what you're not getting here.

Metamorphs can alter their appearance by deciding to do so.

Metamorphs' appearance also changes spontaneously, outside of their conscious control.

Therefore metamorphs cannot control everything. They are only exerting control in the first situation. Spontaneous changes outside of their control is inconsistent with the idea that metamorphs control everything.

The reason why Harry cannot be a metamorph is because if he were, then like Teddy Lupin and Tonks he would be showing constant signs of it outside of his control such as his hair turning red when he was embarrassed.

*************** I have a metamorph!Harry story in my head, and if I ever get around to writing it the explainatiom would be something like this:

For this story, Harry would have been more abused than in canon. Harry, having been physically abused, starved, and forced to live in a cupboard, would have also not wanted to draw attention to himself. He doesn't want the Dursleys retaliating if someone suspects something is wrong with him and asks questions, and he doesn't want to draw attention to himself. He just wants to blend in and be "normal."

So, his metamorph abilities would (subconciously) be keeping him looking the same way he always does. He's smaller than normal because he needs to be able to fit into a cupboard, he's unable to fix his unruly hair because his magic keeps it looking the same, and, yes, his hair grows back to the same length when it's cut for the same reason. I don't think him getting a haircut is ever mentioned in the books other than that incident, so that could also be some evidence: his hair never growns and you can't cut it. This subconcious metamorphmagus ability would also cover up any scars he has from being abused.

This is, of course, fanon/fanfiction. But, it does use evidence from canon to explain everything.

****** 1) Metamorph learn to control their power. Teddy Lupin is said to have his hair change color randomly minutes after his birth , and apparently it was the same for Nymphadora. If Harry had that talent, at least some people like Sirius Black would know.

2) Metamorphagus just have the talent to effortlessly change their appearance, a skilled wizard in Transfiguration can also alter his own appearance (like Hermione did to Ron in DH). Harry's hairs growing back overnight would (and probably were) a fit of accidentale magic. And this is without mentioning the possibility of a charm having the same effects (when the Goblet of fire cursed Fred and George and made their hair/beard grew, was it a jinx, a charm or transfiguration?)

3) By admiting that Harry truly had a Metamorph talent (something I don't believe), what would it change? It most of the fics I read that mention it, Harry just use it to hide his scar (would it the metamorph talent even work with a cursed scar?) and maybe change a little something else to be anonymous. Harry could easily reach the same result with almost any effort (a charm or potion to change hair color, a hat to hide the scar and voila nobody recognize him, could even try something for his eyes color to be really sure). I don't see the point to give a special talent for the MC if he is not going to use it meaningfully (just like an author gives him 5 Animagus form with awesome animals like Phoenix or Dragon but then Harry never transforms except that one time to show off).

**** I like the idea of ancient wizarding lines having secret "powers" like potential metamorphs, animagus, parselmouths, affinity to certain latent / wandless magical techniques. This is why pureblood supremacy is so rampant -- it was, for many generations, a way to preserve these talents, and I like the idea of these abilities coming about through old family ritualistic magic, prior to the invention of the wand.

The Potters are an old family but not so old that they would have participated in such a ritual. I'd like to think their "thing" is messy hair that regrows overnight.

** The prophecy makes it so Harry is on the same tier of power as Voldemort.

A Harry that doesn't want to be normal, unlike the Dursleys, but earns it.

Symbolism is also neat when done properly. Having Voldemort, Dumbledore, Harry, and Snape being the 3 brothers and death was a brilliant theory and whoever thought of it deserves a cookie.

Genius/Perfect Hermione being subverted. I like the character, but she started regressing after the goblet of fire to me.

Contrasting Luna and Hermione. I mean canon Luna, a weird, smart, open-minded girl who trusts her Dad immensely. Not the seer Luna or manic pixie Luna.

Neville being helped earlier. He gets screwed over almost like Harry.

A Ron on the same level as the rest of his Siblings.

Love potions being taken seriously.

House-elves being an enslaved species from a thing like a curse. Some better explanation than needing the bond. Psychological conditioning being shown too.

Dobby being a badass.

Social issues being considered. SPEW left a bad taste in my mouth for being a horribly run activist organization. If the people you

A Dumbledore that has to justify denying Harry the prefect badge. That sort of unilateral decision making perhaps made me dislike Dumbledore. It should have never been his decision to make.

Following up, a Dumbledore that has to resign a position or two from being stretched thin. Also who gets called out on his very bad decisions, like Snape, Lockhart, the Dursleys.

McGonagall getting called out for her lack of care for her charges. Aside from the Dursley dropoff and the career advising, she's done nothing.

Interhouse unity to take down Snape.

Electives that make sense. Frankly all of them suck.

** I really like Desi Harry. It's not something I thought about before when reading, but Potter could well be an Indian origin name and it's a nice link to the Patils, visual distinction from the Dursleys, and just broadens the world a bit for me. It's not how I always think of Harry, but it's how I can imagine him sometimes and in some stories.

*** I agree. It may not have been the original intention, but I hate that so many readers are anti-POC Harry, like it affects the outcome of the books in any way. I think it's fantastic and a great headcanon, and also could explain further why the Dursleys and to a degree even Snape (a Death Eater, clear analogue for Nazis and the like) hated James Potter.

It really does open another little dimension to the stories if you let go of the idea that all the characters who aren't specifically given a certain race must be white or white-presenting.

**** The only time this ever bothered me was a fic that ignored that his mom was white, and that he would have been biracial. If they wanted to rewrite the Evans heritage also that would have been fine but it just kind of ignored his mom completely. I don't remember exactly what the fic said/did, but it was more than one thing in it. Oh and that same fic had his green eyes coming from his dads side. But generally I like Harry as a POC and definitely black Hermione.

*** Potter is probably an Anglo name...but that doesn't preclude PoC Harry, whether that's Desi or anything else (I headcanon ties to Singapore, or possibly to Shanghai).

James Potter had *two* parents. Even if his father was Anglo as they come, we have no indication about his mother. For example, my headcanon has the very Anglo Fleamont Potter marrying a decidedly Asian Euphemia Lau. My James could speak very good Chinese.
