So yeah, we all know the story, Voldemort learn about the Prohphecy from Snape, find the Potter and is destroyed trying to kill Harry. But my question is more about his motivations about this murder, was he truly afraid about the Prophecy, or did he not really believe it, but though it was better to not take any risk, just in case?

*** I can understand his later obessession with Harry:

After his first defeat, he met Harry again at the end of PS. Voldemort, at that time, didn't seem set on killing Harry, he did no tentative to kill Harry during the year (maybe once in the forbidden forest, but he didn't really plan to meet him there and just tried to take his chance after seing him alone outside of Hogwarts protection), and proposed him to join him at the end of the year.

In the cemetery, he wanted to kill him, but it was more a show for his follower to prove he was the best that he true personal desire. Even the whole plan to get Harry's blood was more to bypass Lily's protection (and not let any weapon to be used against him) that for Harry himself.

Even his quest for the Elder wand, that ultimately killed him, was after seing he could not use his wand against Harry, neither a "normal" one.

​

Most of Voldemort actions seem to be dictated by circunstances rather than decisions. Even his obsession for the prophecy in OotP is after Harry manage to survive him 3 times (4 if you count the Horcruxe of CoS). I would also be pretty pissed at that point and want to know if the prophecy is the reason he survived or not.

​

PS: Just a though but, since sharing Harry's blood permitted Voldemort to bypass Lily protection and touch him. Shouldn't it also permit him to bypass Privet Drive protection to attack him in his own home?
