Like the title says, I'm interested in reading something about quidditch league; I'm a fan of the main pairings but really if it is well written I'm all for it. Romance doesn't have to be really involved in the story but bonus points if it is!

Anybody have anything that can help me out?


** This is one that features "Quidditch League" (think endorsements, contracts, training, and day to day life) rather than Quidditch Matches. Be forewarned that this is by TheEndless7 and their endings have... Well anyways it is a solid read regardless. linkffn(9444529)

I find it safer to just say "their" work to avoid inevitably making a mistake.

** linkffn(7711029) fits your criteria, I figured I'd link this before someone else does. Harry/Daphne pairing, story is incomplete but what is there is solid.

** I will shamelessly self-promote. linkffn(12972704)

It is Harry and the other three champions organising a Quidditch tournament during the Triwizard. Not much in terms of 'professional' Quidditch but they play against Holyhead Harpies too. Hope you like it.
