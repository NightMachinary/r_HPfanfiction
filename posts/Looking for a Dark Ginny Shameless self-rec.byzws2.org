** I love this story. I came for the Ginny/Bella moments, but the slow burn is really doing it for me. I'm glad you're not rushing this along. I enjoyed the joy Ginny is taking with the dark arts and the fact that Voldemort isn't stupid. He knows that he needs to keep people happy and willing to do little things to placate his followers.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from filling her mind. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix
