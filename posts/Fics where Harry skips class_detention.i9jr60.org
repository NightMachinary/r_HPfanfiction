** Some 10 or 15 years ago, I read a story that did this. I can't recall the title, sadly.

But since I played through that scenario often myself, to answer your question: Dumbledore isn't, of course. However, Dumbledore might not always be in control here. There is still the Board of Govenors, and then keep in mind the most relevant year for this would be OotP and Umbridge's detentions, and she has an authority that can overrule the headmaster's. Her authority on paper would be backed up by physical authority, like the Aurors they send to retrieve McGonagall or Dumbledore.

So a sequence of events that goes like this: Umbridge assigns detention --> Harry refuses to show up --> Umbridge expells him --> Harry refuses to leave, ends with Umbridge sending Aurors to drag him out. /Outside/ of Hogwarts, he is then subject to Ministry law, and since he hasn't completed his education, just like Hagrid, his wand will be snapped and he will be forbidden from doing magic.

At which point he could probably live with the Weasleys, so no need for the Dursleys, I guess, but his future is surely ruined.

.

Anyway, it doesn't have to happen like that, it's just a speculative (if realistic, IMO) outcome. But the point is that there might actually be a reason for not going all out, beyond an inability to conceive of defying authorities in such a way.

*** Yup, 5th year/Umbridge probably wouldn't work. But the other years - namely first, second, third years - he could probably skip classes and detentions.

It'd be pretty fun to read, especially if the POV periodically shifts to the teachers!

** I remember one it was called /Enough is Enough/. Although it's incomplete and abandoned

After finding a muggleborn girl crying about losing points Harry decides to take a stand. He calls a house meeting about a boycott and they agree. They get the Ravenclaws, and Hufflepuffs in it.

Next morning after only Slytherin rises to go to class they all kinda just stop everything. Nott proposes Slytherin join in the boycott and the entirety of Hogwarts just boycotted class

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

Actually, that would make a hilarious premise for a fic. Snape having to find and chase down Harry to attend a class or detention.
