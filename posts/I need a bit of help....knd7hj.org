** If you don't want "serious dedication" then you be better off doing one-shots or doing one of those things that skip plenty of stuff and just focus on the "juicy" parts. Though those usually leave readers trying to understand the pacing.

If you want to have a decent pacing then you would need to let the story breath. Not necessarily fillers, but put chapters that favor world building or character development over action. After all juicy parts are more juicy in a story that doesn't have them every other sentence.

If you are doing a new school you need world building. Otherwise readers don't see what you see. You need character development in either case.

**** Fair enough. You need to work out stuff like:

- Does Hogwarts exist?
- What relationship does it have with this new school?
- what kind of students go to one school or the other?
- If you're puting students there that would normally attend Hogwarts, why did they couldn't go to Hogwarts?
