** I'm not really big on just rehashing canon, but I did recently see [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822-1/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm]], which seems to be rewriting the story with advanced technology substituted for magic. It didn't really grab me (not really my thing, as I said), but the writing quality seemed solid, and the conversion from magic to tech already had some clever moments by chapter 5 (out of 200).

Edit: Recently gave it another go, and finished this time. Impressive effort by the author, and definitely had its moments, such as Umbridge >! attempting to claim the Headmaster's office and having the stairs dump her into a septic tank!<. Wasn't keen on the seventh-year lemons, though I'll grant that they did fit logically into the story.

** I'll recommend my own story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12866177/1/Dysfunctional]['Dysfunctional']] It's ongoing and actually follows a point of divergence: that of Sirius never having fallen through the veil. Updates every weekend.

  Post-OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. The war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge to prepare themselves for a war of the ages. OR What if Sirius never fell through the veil but lives instead? No slash/bashing. Harry and Sirius family fic. HBP Semi-canon compliant.

** I dunno if you'll like it but this a series seem to match your request:\\
[[http://siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=120][Beginnings and Endings by Breanie]]\\
This is the story of what happened to Harry if he didn't live his life at the Dursleys but with his father? Where was his mother? Why was it different?\\
I didn't read it because I didn't like the ' Draco's a good guy' part in the summary of the second story.
