As the title - I'm curious why he bothered with the cabinet at all? It's not like there were any protections against Dark Magic being cast or Death Eaters entering the castle: Possessed Quirrel in the first book, the Diary Horcrux in the second, Peter Pettigrew since Percy started at Hogwarts, Snape since the war ended, Draco the entire year, etc. What reason was there to bother with the cabinet and not just walk right through the front door/myriad of secret tunnels?


** Same reason Dumbledore didn't call the trio into his office September 2nd and told them all about Riddle and the Horcruxes and Hallows: JKR wanted the big climax at the end of the school year, and if she had to lobotomize every damn character, then so be it.

** Perhaps it was just strategy. Instead of coming in through the doors or tunnels, which all would allow entry to the lower levels, they enter through the cabinet and are on the seventh floor right away. This would allow them to reach the astronomy tower much faster and therefore complete their objective much faster.

***** According to the wiki, it's on 'the third floor, off the Gargoyle corridor', which is apparently on the second floor. I'm not sure if the wiki is written by an American or not, so I don't know if that's three floors or four floors up (we use Ground Floor, First, Second, Third where you'd say First, Second, Third).

** Because of the war, HBP' Hogwarts is pretty different compared to the previous year.

- All the protective enchantment (read "wards") have been strenghtened
- Filch search the castle in order to find, and seal, most of the secret passages
- All the entering students (and probably even the non students) have to be searched by some Dark Magic detector at the door
- Aurors and teachers are patroling the corridors

Basically the same reason why Harry could not enter by the front door in DH. A group of Death Eater trying this way would have been found out before even reaching the castle, and confronted by the Aurors/Professors present there. As for the Secret Passages, most of them were sealed, or at least monitored at that point, so these option was also out.You also have to remember that nobody "really" expected Draco to kill Voldemort, he was supposed to fail and be killed by Voldemort as a punishment for Lucius failures. So it's not like he really received any support from the Death Eater outside of the power the name brings and maybe his parents. Maybe another solution existed to complete his mission, but the Cabinet was the only one Draco could think of that had a true chance of working (he did try other option in desperation thought).

  Dark Magic detector

Huh. I'd forgotten about that. So, how did apparently Dark-Marked Draco make it in the building? Surely the snake-headed magical tattoo would bing some kind of Dark Magic detector. If not, then Polyjuice the lot into students and just have them walk in, then sneak-attack AK the Auror's in the back. Probably more on-brand for the DEs, being Nazi-esque Terrorists and all.

But you have a point. The little idiot was basically operating on his own purposefully, so they'd not actually help him with options likely to succeed. Makes as much sense as anything else, really. :D
