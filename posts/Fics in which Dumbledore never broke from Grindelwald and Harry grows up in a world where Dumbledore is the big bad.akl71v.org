** I think linkffn(Phoenx Corrupted by iamneverwhere) fits your request at least partially. I am currently in 4th year so I can‘t be certain in which direction the story will go and how the open questions will be answered, but the fic has:

- a different outcome to the duel between the two Dumbledores and Grindelwald
- an antagonistic Albus Dumbledore
- a good Tom Riddle that is not simply canon Dumbledore with a different name (he‘s quiet different from canon Tom and less egoistic because of a different upbringing. How his upbringing is related to the point of divergence has not yet been explained at the point where I‘m currently at)

When I started reading this fic, I expected a bad fic because with this rare premise I thought I would have seen it recommended more, especially around here, but up to this point I have been positively suprised.

*** Came here to recommend this fic. It does some interesting things and is well written. I wish there was more of the background material available (particularly on Tom's time in and immediately after Hogwarts), but other than that it is a solid rec.

#+begin_quote
  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

*** Does it stick to the stations of canon or does the plot go its own way? Like, is there still a troll, a stone, a chamber, etc?

**** The plot goes its own way mostly, although there is a triwizard tournament in 4th year, this one at Durmstrang though and some other smaller similarities. You will find small things and events from canon picked up and used in a different way, e.g. the chamber. So while you will recongize some things from canon it never feels like a revisiting of stations of canon, imo.
