This seems to be incredibly hard to write, since it almost doesn't exist.


** The best examples of a straight-up powerful protagonist that is also truly a good person are (in my opinion) linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and linkffn(Victoria Potter).

A few other examples would be:

- linkffn(A Long Journey Home), where Jasmine has done a lot of horrible things, but for a very understandable reason (not some psychopathy or in some attempt at upping her coolness factor)

- linkffn(The Arithmancer) where Hermione is a decent human being, much like canon, but isn't inherently overpowered. Her intelligence enables her to do extraordinary things though (for example: She invents a spell that stops the heart because of her understanding of biology and muggle medicine, one that any first year can cast. She uses physics, chemistry and above all, math, to do many other never-before-seen feats of magic as well. ).

- If you're ok with a crossover (and /extremely/ overpowered protagonists), [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/felix-fortuna-worm-hp.771298/reader/][Felix Fortuna]] is a relatively new one that I find promising.

It depends on how edgy is over the line I guess, but there's also linkffn(The Archeologist) where the protagonist might be described as a little edgy, but it seem more accurate to say he's a bit on the spectrum with how he isn't very sociable and doesn't realize how powerful he is.

But yeah, looking at my list of read fics, it seems like it's very common for OP protagonists to be a little trigger happy and ok with murder.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** I have been writing unpublishable garbage the last few days just to keep my creative juices flowing, and I've got a powerful, reincarnated, slightly-insane pseudo-SI whose major problem is "I have no idea how to deal with small children and now Hermione's crying and won't make friends with anyone else and I am so fucking lost what do I do?!?!" The general immaturity of children baffles him, but he's having his protective dad instincts flair up for the first time in his life despite the fact that he's in a terrible position to parent any children and is terribly unqualified.

I'll share a link to the google docs if you're interested, but I'm warning you now, I put absolutely no effort into making it readable as a story.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)
