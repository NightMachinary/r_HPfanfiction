For some reason I can't find this story through google-fu. Basically, Harry is a skilled fighter and kills Death Eaters by the dozen, adopting a vigilante persona to confront Voldemort. The fic has lots of well-written action. Harry wears a ring that slows down time, which causes a dangerous magical reaction later on from overuse.


** Is this the one where multiple people dress up as "The Phoenix" so that Voldemort doesn't think that it's Harry?

*** Was this an "I hate Hermione" fic where they gave her a potion "therapy" to help her with something but in reality they were using her as the fall guy?

I do think this is what you're after. The phoenix vigilante, complete with strength enhancing, and speed enhancing rings that are dangerous af.

** James Spookie has a fic called linkffn(Rise of the Phoenix by James Spookie) where Harry is a masked vigilante that kills a bunch of Death Eaters. I'm not sure about the ring that slows down time thing though.
