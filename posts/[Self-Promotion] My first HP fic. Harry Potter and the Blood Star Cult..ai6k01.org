Rated PG. Or E for Everyone.

Description: It's another semester at Hogwarts, and the new subject in the Defense Against the Dark Arts class is the ancient wizard, Count Dezeed. When a new professor brings a dark artifact to class, along with it comes Count Dezeed's followers, the cult of the Blood Star, and they want Harry out of Hogwarts...but why?

Authors Note: I guess I would call this an AU fic since Harry's time at Hogwarts is so packed, it's hard to find places to add new adventures. Let's say this story takes place after Chamber of Secrets when the kids are still on the younger side. I hope you enjoy it.

** The first thing to note is the summary - semester is an Americanism (we use "terms" over here) and Dezeed is a rather odd sounding name. Not in a scary way, it sounds like a pun or a joke that I'm not getting.

Your writing is technically sound with few grammar/spelling mistakes, but your style is a little show rather than tell - you have characters over explain things to one another and the effect is that it feels like a young children's book. This might have been what you were going for, idk.

*** Thank you for reading and sharing your thoughts.

When you say my style is show rather than tell, isn't that a good thing? I always thought the rule in writing was to show not tell.

And yes, I was going for a bit of a children's book style.

As far as Dezeed, idk, I'm not great at names. I thought it was fine. I'm pretty sure I thought Dumbledore sounded weird when I first heard it.

**** Sorry I had a brain melt moment and meant tell rather than show!!

In regards to names, try to look up old English names rather than making something up.
