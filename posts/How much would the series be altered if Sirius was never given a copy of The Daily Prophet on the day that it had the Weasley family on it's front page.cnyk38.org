The thought came to me while reading [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cnvtm6/sirius_meets_hagrid_in_azkaban/][this thread]], and now I'm wondering how big of a Butterfly Effect it would create.


** Sirius would still rot in prison, Pettigrew still live as a rat, and Voldi would not return. A lot, I'd say.

*** Eh, not so sure about Voldemort not returning. Crouch Jr showed he could throw off the Imperius Curse and Crookshanks is still there to run Peter off.

**** Crookshanks would /run him off/, yes, but that doesn't mean any humans would find out Peter's identity, so I think he'd just find himself another cozy place to hide. He went to seek out Voldemort when he thought it was his best shot at survival, but if his cover remains unblown, why take such an unncessary risk when Voldemort is /himself/ a potential threat to Pettigrew's life (just one he was willing to take when the alternative was Dumbledore getting him)?

I do agree that Voldemort would find some /other/ way to return eventually, but I don't think Pettigrew would really be a part of the picture.

**** Ah, but even if Crouch Jr threw off the imperius and still believed the Dark Lord was alive, how would he find him?

Peter found him by using his Animagus form to talk to local rats, remember. At minimum, Crouch Jr would have had a much harder time and taken a lot longer to locate him. And without the convenient timing of Bertha Jorkins to extract info from, and the TWT to get ahold of Harry, he'd have a much harder time resurrecting the Dark Lord.

Eventually, inevitably, Voldemort would return, since he's an unkillable shade that can afford to sit in a tree and wait for a passerby to possess, as with Quirrel. But without Pettigrew seeking him out, kidnapping Bertha, and thus providing Volde with the info that Crouch Jr was alive, it would have taken several more years at minimum. Harry would have at least been able to finish his NEWTs before having to face him.

**** u/GMantis:
#+begin_quote
  Crouch Jr showed he could throw off the Imperius Curse
#+end_quote

Yes, and when he did so he was quickly recaptured. And it's certain that after this incident his father would keep him under much closer guard.

#+begin_quote
  Crookshanks is still there to run Peter off.
#+end_quote

Pettigrew only ran off after it became clear that Sirius was close to catching him. He had no reason to abandon the Weasleys just because a cat was chasing him. Even if he run off, going to Voldemort would be still be less preferable than hiding with another wizarding family.

Not quickly at all.

  "But Winky didn't know that I was growing stronger. I was starting to fight my father's Imperius Curse. There were times when I was almost myself again. There were brief periods when I seemed outside his control. It happened, there, in the Top Box. It was like waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in public, in the middle of the match, and I saw, in front of me, a wand sticking out of a boys pocket. I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole it. Winky didn't know. Winky is frightened of heights. She had her face hidden."
#+end_quote

And, according to BCJ, Crouch just put him back under the curse.

****** It would still be difficult for him to escape out of Crouch's home, even if he managed to throw of the curse. Nor does the text exclude Crouch Sr strengthening the protection around him.

** You can just look at the movies for that answer. It's never shown that Sirius saw that particular newspaper at all, so we're left to assume that Sirius arbitrarily waited 12 years to break out of prison. Apparently that works, since PoA is often cited as people's favorite movie despite the dozens of gigantic plot holes.

*** PoA is a better made movie in terms of filmmaking, directing and pacing. The dialogue is iconic, and so is the acting and effects. It's not anyone's favorite for the story alone.

*** I don't think that's a fair argument; the thing with /PoA/ is that no, it doesn't make any sense as a standalone story, but reading it as one is a mistake. For better or for worse. It's more of an illustration of the book, meant for people who already know the ins and outs of the plot but want to see the big set-pieces on the screen. If we're not told that Sirius read the newspaper, it's not that he didn't in this continuity, but simply that the movie assumed whoever cared enough to ask (HP fans) already knew.

Similarly, it's never quite explained who the Marauders were, but that doesn't mean that Prongs /wasn't/ James Potter, it's just that the movie assumed this went without saying.

**** An insane amount of people have watched the movies but never read the books. Trust me, I'm 18 and even one who dubs herself a ”huge Harry Potter nerd” hasn't read them. It's way more common than one would think.
