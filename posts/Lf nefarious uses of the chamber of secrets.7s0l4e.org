I don't recall any fics using the chamber for anything other than a hideout/ study space. Wouldn't it be a pretty decent place to make people disappear?

** An evil Harry could use it to store an Inferi army, and also to do magic experiments on students every once in a while! OR the Inferi army could BE the students! Maybe Harry uses the basilisk to kill everyone in the school, and then he moves all the corpses into the chamber. And then when they reopen the school again, he can unleash his army!!! That is just my evil brainstorming. :)

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  Rewrite of original story Shadowed Malice on FF.Net.Finished over six years prior, due to the painful plot gaps and spelling errors the story is being entirely rewritten.Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived written in a realistic way.Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Considering the only family he trusts is a reckless snake and a falcon-looking owl, Harry has quite a bit of work.That won't be a problem, after all, playing chess he always wins in the end.
