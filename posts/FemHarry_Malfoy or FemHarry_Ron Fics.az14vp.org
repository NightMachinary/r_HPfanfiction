im mostly interested in Fem Harry and Malfoy. She is born as a Girl. It doesnt have to follow the Canon, but im open for the timeline. It would be good, that Malfoy gets attracted to Harry either during the Years or Post-Hogwarts and has a Crush on her. But Harrys interest wouldnt be primaly on Love or attraction on him, but the possible Fun, that she could have (like testing his capabilities in Bed). I would be ok, if there is a Fem!Harry/Draco/Hermione or Ginny situation.

So, im not looking for a Romantic fic (well, Malfoy can be romantic to charm her, but she wouldnt get catched that easily), but mostly like one that have her wanting a Friends with Benefits Relationship.

As for Harrys Persona, well i would like her to be a seductive one, not always, but at some Points she is seducing Draco.

​

Lets consider, that the Fic doesnt follow Canon, so no War: Then i would like to read Fics that have said Love Triangle with Harry, Draco and Hermione. If it gets hot between them, it doesnt have to be a Threesome. Maybe they arrange for a Friends with Benefits Relationship. Draco couldnt decide who he likes/loves more, since he is attracted to both females.

​

If its a Fem!Harry/Ron fic, then its actually the same situation, so Ron wouldnt know, who he should choose. the both of them maybe would have a One night stand, but then he decides to choose Hermione. Or....Ron is having an affair with Fem-Harry....although the idea is attractive (im open for it), i want her and Hermione to be best (and close) friends...Hermione possibly is attracted to her, but not necessary.

I can imagine a Fem-Harry seducing Ron is quite funny, since he would be overstrained by it, while Hermione wouldnt need to seduce him and because he is not used to this "attractivity"

​

A Fem Harry that gets on with Draco just to have advantages in High Society is also fine. Or Harry regularly sleeps with Draco because she wants to have sex and said Guy is good, but she cant imagine a solid Relationship with him, to his disappointing, but he is happy, that they can be "together" in the late Hours.

​

To not forget Ginny, she can also be with Draco instead of Hermione. Or her having a Crush on Harry is also ok.

​

Fics that have a "Catfight" with Pansy or other Females that Draco is with are also ok.

​

I know, that this request sounds very detailed, but all of that doesnt have to be in one fic. I think i listed a good amount of content ideas to deliver a couple of Fics for each one, if they exist.

​

The most important thing is: no romance....but just in case i get curious in the end you can give me a Fic, that have them romantical involved, you can list it, but please make a note for it.


** Ellory on FFN has a couple. Most of them are “Pure-blood culture,” with a lot of gender bent pairings.
