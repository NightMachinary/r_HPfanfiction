I've recently found out that HBO has some rights on HP or something (correct me if I'm wrong, I'm really not sure about that). What I can't understand is why no one wants to make a prequel tv series about the Marauders and the 1st Wizarding War? I mean, I think it would've had a tremendous success! Why isn't it a thing yet!? Ah, it's just so infuriating!


** I don't know who has rights to it, but honestly I would be kind of nervous if they did. I really think the HP books are wonderful and trying to add to or change the existing canon is a bad idea.

I mean if you take a look at Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts, do we really want those people making something like this? They don't care about Harry Potter as much as we do, they don't respect canon enough to stay true to it.

*** Yeah, I guess you're right, which is super sad:( I wish there was someone in the indistry who would stay true to the canon and the story and who could do it justice. It's just such a pity that even JK doesn't want to tell us more about the Marauders' Era and all we have is fic-established canon (which is more than amazing btw, totally not complaining)

**** The dollar is king when it comes to these sorts of things. Hell look at what they did with the [[/r/Eragon]] movie. That absolutely ignored canon completely. Or the recent Hobbit Trilogy. As long as it is profitable they don't care what happens.

I honestly am ok with JK remaining silent on these sorts of things. Pottermore and the interviews aren't my favorite; the books are my canon. Some of the stuff she has said and decided after the books isn't the greatest and doesn't make sense.

***** It seems like there's a lot of critiquing of the movies, but at least they didn't massacre the series like eragon or *shivers* Percy Jackson

** I wouldn't like it simply for the fact that most of the fandom's headcanons and best stories wouldn't be acceptable anymore. And a lot of them are amazing, such as The Life and Times, and I'd like them more than any Netflix series.
