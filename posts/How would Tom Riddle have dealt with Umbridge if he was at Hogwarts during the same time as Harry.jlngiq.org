**** "Ever seen a snake eating a toad, Miss Umbridge?"

Hermione at least maintained a level of plausible deniability with the centaurs. Pity Albus had to step in and ruin things.

** I think he would have done what the slytherins did except he would have done it in a way that ingratiated him with both sides slowly influencing them to more violent measures until they destroyed each other and he came out the victor

** If he had been on the good guys' side (why else would he have needed to "deal" with Umbridge?) he would have kidnapped her, taken her out of the Hogwarts grounds, killed her, and conjured the Dark Mark. Two birds with one stone!

*** IDK, I can't imagine Tom Riddle, who so desperately wanted to teach DADA, would be content in a class where they were reading a dry textbook with no practical exercises.

**** Good point. However, as we speculate what the cunning and resourceful Tom Riddle (the one JKR /told/ he was) would do instead of the blunt and impulsive one (the one JKR /showed/ he was), I have an other idea. Cunning Riddle would think that anything can be an opportunity (this is his motto in my ongoing story with him as the main character), and would do as the Trio did. Start a study group with him as the teacher, but use the opportunity to manipulate the other students and turn them his willing minions. Having Umbridge at Hogwarts would be a remarkable asset to him, and he would do his best to keep her there terrorising the school and driving more and more students under Tom's wing.

***** I can totally see this. He'd grit his teeth through the dull classes and use it to his advantage. Teen Tom had more social savvy than adult/resurrected Voldemort, which fandom almost invariably theorizes is a result of having split his soul too many times - as opposed to someone who at the height of their power can afford to be arrogant but an impoverished teen with no backing has to use every little bit of control they can wrangle from others.

*** I mean, you don't necessarily have to be /good/ to dispose of someone that's being a pain, do you? Being on the bad side is all about lack of morals and common decency. Perfect combination to see that Umbridge is being a pest, that you don't like her, and then /being able to do something not necessarily allowed about it./ Including murder. Not sure if a Dark Lord To Be would've hesitated if she was annoying him enough, to be honest, regardless of how much of a bonus she could've been when it came to the other side.

** Voldemort: /Crucio, Crucio/, a bit more of /Crucio/ oh and just to spice things up here goes /Fiendfyre/. Uh, I wonder if I can torture ashes, only one way to find out /Crucio/... maybe with a bit more hatred and power? Yes! Hatred and power solve all life's problems!

Tom Riddle: Oh, hello Madam, I secretly agree with everything you say, which means that you should kneel down and obey my very whims... oh, one of the things you said was that I should be tortured with a blood-quill for not being a pure blood? Well never-mind then, /imperius/, well, last time I killed someone in Hogwarts it didn't go well for me and as a professor you are a much riskier target, but no reason to not try again. I know! This time I will even plan it! Ok, so how likely would it be for someone to accidentally use a blood-quill to write a 600 foot treaty about my utter perfection without noticing the agonizing pain that would be constant during the whole process? Eh, probably above 98% I guess, there is much to talk about over how perfect I am, a little bit of agonizing pain wouldn't be able to distract someone embarking in such a righteous goal. Either way, pretty sure the aurors won't ever suspect I had anything to do with it, I am so confident that I won't even bother pretending surprise, acting with anything other than satisfaction on a well-done job or hiding that I used an unforgivable in case someone looks at my wand-history.

*** Headline and a half, too, if she died writing erotic fanfiction about Fudge and herself using the quill. So much more stylish than kicking her off the stairs, at least.

** IDK about Tom but I have a snippet in my notebook about Barty Jr. turning her into an actual toad and feeding her to the grindylows in the lake to get back the DADA job.

(Obviously an AU snippet where Barty lived. It is a tad cracky too.)
