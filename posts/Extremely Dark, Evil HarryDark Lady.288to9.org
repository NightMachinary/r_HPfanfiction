** I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] by Silently Watches. Its fem!Harry, but the main character is a voodoo witch who tortures and murders people. It contains many other unique elements and is extremely well written, but it does contain some disturbing topics.

  Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. DARK and NOT for children. fem!bisexual!Harry, minor fem!Harry/Viktor, eventual fem!Harry/Luna, powerful!Harry, James and Lily are alive, twin is BWL, year 4, less cliched than it sounds

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.

It's a Hellraiser x HP crossover, but you don't even have to know what Hellraiser is to read it. Not really any romance, but extremely dark and insane!Harry.

** /HP & the Descent into Darkness/ (W:267,992|Complete) matches your criteria perfectly, but otherwise it's of a rather poor quality. HP\LV slash, moral hypocrisy, OoC LV (especially as the story progresses), manipulative /and/ stupid Dumbledore.

There are two stories in which, because of the nature of his magic, Harry is inclined to enjoy causing sufferings and death, but in both he struggles to keep his moral grounds intact and his alliance at least as Chaotic Neutral. These stories are /[[http://reddit-hpff.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sacrifices_Arc][The Sacrifices Arc]]/ (W:3KK|Complete) and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]/ (W:205,387|7 month-long hiatus).

I also second /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]/ (W:283,053|WiP), but it starts as a crackfic and I'm not sure where is it headed now. Still, it will be worth checking out.
