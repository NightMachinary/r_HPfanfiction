** My advice would be not to assume malice. It could have been a mistake, or they could have the feature turned on where they have to approve reviews before they appear.

** I've had posts or comments I write just vanish for no reason at all, or things people say on my stories that are sent to my email but don't show up on the fic itself. I tend to assume anything weird going on is a glitch rather than people's action.

** Could have been a bug or accidental. My rule of thumb is to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to technology. I'll only consider it malice if the behavior keeps repeating itself.

** 1: if they didn't have the time to accept the review yet, that might be a problem. 2: It is not really a review of the story itself (besides saying you were glad they reposted) so they might have taken it down for that reason. 3: It is just a mistake.

Do they reply to other comments?

I wish AO3 had private messaging because when I communicate back to my readers, the reply is made public when I would rather have it be private. If they were trying to be negative to your comment I bet they would have responded back to your post negatively. At the end of the day, it could be a number of reasons (none which are trying to be disrespectful)
