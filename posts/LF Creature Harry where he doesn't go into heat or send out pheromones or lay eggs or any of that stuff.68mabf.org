Vampire Harry, non-sex crazed Veela Harry (does that exist?), werewolf Harry who doesn't find his "mate" or "alpha" at 14, cat-demon Harry who isn't just a frisky "kitten" with a tail and cat ears. Harry doesn't mate with Draco, doesn't go into heat around Voldemort, isn't having butt-babies for Snape. Preferably majorly AU as well, not just canon with a Harry who also hisses at dogs, but I'll take what I can get.

Slash, bashing, crossovers and dark!characters are fine. Please no smut/romance-centric plot, genderbending, harems, mpreg or pottercest. Thank you.


** I feel you, mate. As soon as I see "unexpected creature inheritance" in the summary, I get horrible flashes of all the things you so eloquently described.

*** I'm not sure I've ever read any creature fics that I would consider unequivocally /good/, but I tolerate some of it in linkffn(8813082) and to a lesser extent linkffn(8423230) because there are some imaginative elements.

To be fair that is most of what I find these days. I don't hope to find sparkling gems, just fics where I can tolerate the shortcomings well enough to enjoy some imagination on the part of the author.

  Response to whitetigerwolf's Polyjuice Cat challenge. When Hermione is told her Polyjuice problem is permanent, Harry refuses to let his best friend go through this alone. He chooses to drink a similar potion, and the consequences of that choice are unpredictable and far-reaching. Rating for later themes.

**** Yeah, solid advice. I was planning on going this route. My only fear is their veelaness essentially becomes an informed attribute. Since the character has some real world knowledge and didn't know they were veela, upon finding out they are, they have this whole freak out, terrified about the whole soulmates thing at which point McGonagall steps in, "Miss so-and-so, I don't know where you got the idea that veelas have soulmates and they die if they don't find them.

Also: I'd play up their elemental magic (fire!), maybe not all go for fire? Maybe men (if there are males of the species...they might always breed true after all, so no half or quarter veela!) control another element?

Finally: There are no sluts! This word is an abomination because IMHO there's NOTHING wrong with women doing what a lot of men would love to do: Sleep around!

Don't let it turn into a trashy romance novel, and it'll definitely be better than 99% of the veela fics out there. Or, dare I say, all of them. If anyone has any good veela fic recs, I'd gladly take them.

*** In my stories, Veela have to dance to mesmerise anyone; they don't have an aura or supernatural beauty that does that. So, I'd probably avoid any "aura flaring" scenes. Assuming that the focus is on the Veela heritage, I'd take it slow and subtle - have some affinity for the air, be at home on a broom, yet always thinking there's something missing when flying. Develop some avian-like quirks, maybe a screeching voice when angry, or some hawk-like vision, although well-measured. No supervision or obviously inhuman voice. Whether or not they'd transform would be another question. I'd also have them be or become light of build, less weight than expected, slender body, though more powerful than expected muscles in the arms and chest. Again, subtle changes, nothing superhuman.

If the story's focus is on being able to transform into a harpy-like form, then I'd still take it slowly, but the aforementioned quirks would be more noticeable.

If the story is on Veela culture, I'd keep it subtle, and introduce a Veela as a Mentor, telling the character about their family's traditions and such. Which, of course, you'd have to make up first.

*** Just an idea: make it someone otherwise rather plain-looking. Their discovery of the Veela heritage is when put into a life-or-death situation, they suddenly turn into a fire tossing harpy. Once they calm down they'll find that their hair has turned long, straight, and silvery- whether it suits them or not.

From there on, people will have all sorts of expectations about the 'truth' of their heritage and what it means. As for the 'Allure'- it only applies while they sing.

Basically, make sure it adds complications more than giving them benefits.
