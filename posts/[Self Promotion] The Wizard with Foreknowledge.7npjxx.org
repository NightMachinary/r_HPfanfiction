** Good luck. Writing an SI story is an uphill battle as many of us hate them.

That said, this immediately comes off as a power fantasy. There is little to no explanation of why you are there, what you plan to do, or how you suddenly are good at magic and able to do spells just by having heard of them. There should be more pathos and more stress. Don't shrug off the basilisk, that thing could eat you.

Additionally what is your story about? What themes and emotions do you want to convey? What is Lucas' character arch? How is this story going to stand out?

*** I originally intended to give an explanation but I found it complicated as i stated in the a/n. Starting off an SI is hard. And I figured most people don't want to go though the Diagon Alley, Hogwarts letter parts.

As for the plan on what I want to do. That was the point, Lucas is conflicted on what he plans to do.

I figured I go similiar to the "Curse of Truth" way and put Lucas to a more grounded level. In real life though I'm a Harry Potter nerd and do alot of researching on spells in canon which "Lucas" remembers.

For the duel part with Draco, it could be pass it off as an adrenaline rush.

*** On the flip side, I read almost nothing but OC and SI stories. Spacebattles is great for that.

** Joining the trio right at the start? Nope thanks, I would prefer if you just killed the 3 of them. It is beyond ridiculous the number of stories with an OC joining the trio just to rehash canon. Fuck canon.

*** Though, now that I think about, I did originally intend for the OC to accidentally hit Draco, Crabbe , or Goyle wth sectumsempra.

The only problem is realistically that would end with the OC being expelled. Unless you have any ideas and I can do a diverging one shot or something.

**** Could maybe hit them with Levicorpus instead rather than kill them...

***** Yeah. I kinda wanted to put him in a situation like in HBP where Harry panics and uses a spell he doesn't know. Only this case, the OC panics and makes sure they don't get back up. It didn't really make sense so I scrapped it.

*** Not trying to get him to join the trio at the start. Only friendlier. I can see your point at canon rehash though. Planning on shaking things up as the story goes on. I plan on the OC to go to a House other than Gryffindor to prevent too much communication between them. I'll most likely put him in Ravenclaw.
