'Good' is, of course, entirely subjective, but I quite like these ones.

  Harry thought he would die; had anticipated it, even. So now what will he do in this new world, one without magic? Not to say that there isn't power lurking here... With snakes calling him 'Lord', and everyone else saying 'Abomination', is it any surprise that he's not going to have an easy time settling down? Subtle HP AU. Eventual Naruto AU. Slow paced. Rated M; Dark Themes.

*** Hadn't seen this one before, its really good so far. Wish there was more of it though.

Its only been 4 months since the last update so there's a decent chance its not abandoned yet. However 6 chapters in 2 years for a story that seems like its going to be fairly long in total means its unlikely to ever get finished since it would take like a decade to do so.

Additionally, Tsunade is predominantly featured in Ninja Who Lived, and not as a love interest.

** Of the ones that haven't been mentioned yet linkffn(Growing Strong) is my favorite. Note that it says complete but the author decided to split it up into 4 books, and is currently on book 2. Also it was updating every week till 3 months ago when that stopped and author hasn't updated since. The author has said on their blog and author page that they are still working on it and that the next chapter would be out soon, but that's not a super great sign in terms of it being continued long term.

I like this one too. Premise is a bit unusual.

linkffn(Ain't Never Had A Friend Like Me)

This one is also decent. It hadn't been updated for like a year, and then was updated again 2 months ago, so not abandoned, but very infrequent updates.
