Can anyone recommend me some good Teddy-centric fics? Or let me know what you think this characer stands for his personality traits etc. Things you love about ways authors write him and things you hate. Pretty much all we learn from the books (can't comment on Cursed Child though) is that he likes Victoire.

I have a fic in mind, kind of a Next Gen 0.5 set at Hogwarts where due to his age he's the only canon character, at least at the beginning (until Victoire starts school) I'm having a lot of fun writing character breakdowns for all my OCs but with Teddy I'm stuck on how to portray him.


** I'll throw some stuff in because it's a pet peeve of mine when I see simple mistakes.

*Things we know about Teddy for sure*

His name is Edward, not Theodore. He was named after his late grandfather, Edward "Ted" Tonks. Nobody was or is named Theodore.

Teddy was raised by his grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. Not Harry, and certainly not the Malfoys. JKR mentioned this an a post-DH interview. That being said, I am of the firm belief that Molly Weasley would have forcefully adopted Andromeda and Teddy into the extended Weasley Clan, much like she did with Harry, before he married his way in.

Victoire is 2 years younger than him (at minimum), not one year younger. I did the math, and unless she failed a year at Hogwarts (unlikely with Hermione, Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Molly Weasley in the family), she's 2 years younger, not 1. Not exactly a Teddy fact, but we know they were involved in some capacity over a few years, so close enough.

Teddy is a Hufflepuff.

Teddy was Head Boy in his 7th year.

*Things we don't know for sure, but are reasonable assumptions*

He's not a werewolf. Lupin was worried his kid would be, and he probably would have made some huge fuss about it if Teddy inherited it. That being said, the full moon in april 1998 was on the 11th, meaning there wasn't a night to confirm this before we next saw Lupin (RIP). I would imagine though, that a werewolf would be able to figure something out. But there is some wiggle room if you want to play with lycanthropy. Personally, I'm of the opinion that it would have come up and spoiled some of the "Happy New Baby" mood, and that Teddy is in the clear. Also, it wasn't mentioned in either CC, JKR's writings, or Rita Skeeter's articles.

For his favourite hair colour, you can pretty much go whatever you feel like. Everyone makes it turquoise because that's the colour it was in his baby picture. That being said we also know that he didn't really have control over it when he was born, and never got confirmation on how soon we has able to keep it stable. So knock yourself out, pick whatever colour you like.

On the note of his Metamorphmagus abilities, I always figured there were limitations on what they can do. Like changing the shape of your face, colour of your hair/skin/eyes, are all doable, but not growing/shrinking yourself by a foot are beyond what he can do. Basically, they can play with what they've got, but they can't grow something from nothing. Other magic can do that, but not Metamorphmagi. Again, entirely speculation and conjecture, so go ahead and make it whatever you want.

​

As for good stories, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1459775/sweasley][sweasly]] has some good ones on fanfiction. There are more, but I can't find them/can't remember them...

I find the fandom to be really inconsistent on Teddy. Because there's so little information about him, it lets authors play with an established, premade character in close proximity to the main hero of the Wizarding World. He's like a pre-set in a character creation menu.

At the end of the day, have fun writing your story. JKR built a fantastic playground for all of us to enjoy. Take what you want from this, ignore what you don't want, write what you will.

And for the love of all that is good in this world, Ravenclaw is a Bronze Eagle and not a Silver Raven.

In my AU I /think/ I'm going to have Tonks survive. Of course there will be some angst along the way due to him losing his father but I don't think I can face making him an orphan. I want my story to be light and fun.

It was just a small snecko who wanted a play buddy. I keep wondering whether the Basillisk would have listened to Harry if he had found it without the help of Diarymort. Like is it a first come first served with Parseltongue or how does that work?

Was the snake just so bored that a quick killing round in the castle seemed like a fun pastime?

*** All good points. Just a note concerning metamorphmaguses: I really dislike when the author goes overboard with their abilities. Unless you want to write a lemon, and logic and story doesn't matter, please, don't make Tonks (or Teddy) into that kind of amorphous, polysex (including all bits down there) being like in “To Reach Without by inwardtransience“ linkao3(8495269).

*** I agree with you especially about Sweasley, she has great fanfictions about Teddy! But I just disagree with what you said about Metamorphmagus. They actually can grow or shrink. I think they can do all kinds of weird things with their appearance. In Order of Phoenix Harry noticed that Tonks is about average height when he meets her (that's probably her natural height). But a few chapters later when Tonks needed a disguise she changed her appearance to "a tall old witch". So they can definitely grow. But yes I do think there are probably some limitations, even for Metamorphmagi.

** Teddy's a main character in my crossover story. Although it hits tropes and is technically post Hogwarts for him, I've really enjoyed writing Teddy so far! This is what I've done:

- smart. He was head boy!
- loyal and friendly
- stubborn
- a bit of a stickler for rules (due to Harry's auror position) but has a hint of mischief because he IS the son of a marauder!
- tall and gangly
- natural black hair as a base
- able to handle his metamorphmagus skills, pretty good at minor changes but not large ones (can't quite do a Mystique)
- adventurous
- sometimes lonely. Andromeda raised him, and he saw Harry and Ginny often, but they also had their own kids and there weren't many around his age growing up; he's the oldest of the bunch
- feels close to his grandfather namesake so is interested in muggles and non magical things

*** That's possible... but I find it hard to believe. We don't know much about Andromeda Tonks, but I doubt that most grandparents would dislike their innocent, newborn grandson based on the actions of their dead father (I mean, she's not /Snape/!). We also have to keep in mind that Teddy is not only Remus Lupin's son, but /Nymphadora Tonks'/ as well. I don't know how she felt about Remus, but, like most mothers, she probably loved her daughter.

Don't get me wrong, you could be right. We don't actually know much about Andromeda Tonks (unless JKR mentioned something on Pottermore that I don't know about)... but I like to think that she could consider Teddy as family since they have both lost so much during the war.

*** About Andromeda it could go anyway, first of all, does she (or even Tonks for that matter) know that Remus was planning on abandoning them? Plus you must remember that death /does/ frequently result in people forgiving some stunts like that, even more so if no one was hurt.

And even if she /did/ resent him chances are that Harry would still look for something nice to say about him, even more so considering that neither Harry nor -probably- Andromeda are the type to try turning a child against his parents.

***** Eh, while he ran away considering the war and that Tonks was a member of the order (no way Voldy didn't make Snape give him a list of all the members he knew about to say nothing of just how much he did find out from poking around Harry's head in OotP) and married to a werewolf while her mother could reasonably be argued as not having outright committed any offense against the DE reign (the Weasley for example had many more enemies but still weren't immediately sent to Azkaban) so chances are that the ministry was monitoring Andromeda's house trying to catch Tonks, and even if they weren't the possibility would probably be enough to keep Tonks from visiting and potentially endangering herself, her mother, her unborn child, Remus and maybe even other members of the order that she may know about, same for letters (while sensible the Order was censuring Ron & Hermione's Mail to Harry over much lesser risks and in a much less dire circumstances in OotP).

I guess you are right about the whole forgiveness in death deal being circumstantial, it would really depend on how Andromeda (and Harry I guess) would face the situation.

The difference between a positive and negative comment really depends a lot on how you present it. For instance, “well Teddy, I didn't really get to know Remus as much as I would have liked, he always was a very private person, consequence of losing so many of his friends for betrayal I would guess. One thing that jumps to memory was just how helpful he was, why, in my third year he noticed how deeply I was affected by the dementors posted around school and so he took the time of his very busy schedule to teach me a spell to repel dementors despite it being something that even wizards with twice my skill at that point struggled with. Without those lessons me and Sirius would probably have died that year. Plus when the ministry was interfering on Hogwarts and I was asked to teach defense in secret I got to teach that spell to my classmates, I don't even know how many only made it because Remus had had the forethought of teaching me it two years previous”.

And yeah, he probably could have find more nice things to say about many other characters, even more so those he went to school with and was housemate. No matter how close his friendship with R&H, he would have to at least have some basic contact with his classmates over seven years, and with all that time Lavander (or any other) would have to have been pretty awful for him to not be able to find anything nice to say about her.

Yeah, I get your point about actual parenthood in contrast to just producing a child and wholeheartedly agree with the idea that the actual parents are those who raise the child instead of only those who share half the DNA. But what I was saying is that this is probably how Harry (and Possibly Andromeda) would see it since both knew Remus and Harry at least liked him.

Except for the small tidbit that the 7potter flight ended with Voldemort chasing Harry down to the ward line of the Tonks home. Which in itself already makes it a bigger target than anyone else.

But given that Andromeda's wards were more effective than even those of Hogwarts and Gringotts, I think that Tonks could have easily gone there.

Harry can try to make excuses for Lupin, but it will be exactly that, excuses. And in canon it is Andromeda who raises Teddy, so if she does not like Lupin, which I think is a given, there is not a whole lot damage control Harry can do.

** What We Lost linkffn(13669071)

Not exactly Teddy centric, but he is a major character. And, an infant before a few timeskips, so go in with that expecation.. Harry is basically in shock after the Battle of Hogwarts and decides his priority should be to make sure his new godson is ok. Harry is 'dad' and eventually hooks up with Andromeda.

Goes with the idea that werewolf + metamorphmagus = natural wolf animagus. Teddy shifts involuntarily on full moons at first, but gains control as he gets older. Harry and Andromeda freak out the first time they find a wolf pup in the crib.
