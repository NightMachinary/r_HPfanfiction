Canonically, Aurors are elite dark wizard catches, and Hitwizards are only sent to perform high-profile arrests. They wouldn't be seen patrolling the streets unless serious trouble is expected. Maintaining general order is a job for the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol.

However, MLE Patrol is a mouthful, and I've no clue how to refer to a single... patroller? without coming off as awkward. Hitwizard or Auror sounds so much better I'm tempted to just turn them into the regular police force.

To clarify, I'm struggling to write an altercation on the streets where the presence of an elite force would make no sense. If you wrote Hitwizards, Aurors, or MLE Patrol in your fics, what roles did you place them in?


** Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Couldn't you call those that enforce the law, enforcers? Sounds a bit strong I know but standard enforcement personnel being called enforcers works naming wise.

** Aurors are described as "dark wizard catchers" and "the elite". We also never really see them act in teams, contrary to the "partner" model you see constantly in fanon. In canon they seem to be more lone wolves.

In canon, Aurors never really got a chance to shine because, despite being the elite, they will always fall short when being compared to legendary wizards like Voldemort and Dumbledore. In my fanfic I try to depict Aurors as they were intended to be (the elite), rather than how we ended up seeing them (constantly getting their ass handed to them).

For that reason, I depict Aurors in the following manner:

1. Small in number. In Victoria Potter, the Auror Office consists of 12 individuals.

2. Duties restricted to hunting and capturing/killing dark wizards and, on occasion, protecting VIPs. No general policing duties (though they possess legal powers of arrest).

3. They act alone, being highly autonomous and given free reign by the Auror Office to do things in their own way.

4. A single Auror may play cat and mouse with a single dark wizard for years, that being their only case. There are not, after all, that many dark wizards in a population the size of a small town.

5. Each Auror has a unique magical style. There is no standardised Auror combat style or method of investigation. While Aurors do go through a form of rigorous training, this training is outcome-focused, and different Aurors will achieve those outcomes in different ways.

6. It would take around 6-7 average wizards to overcome an average Auror in a fight.

Basically, the idea is that Aurors are like Ministry-employed bounty hunters.

** The tininess of the Wizarding World makes everything much easier. If there is an at all decent number of Aurors, then odds are there is at least one just walking around Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade at any given time, just in case. Why not? It's not like they have a lot of other places to be.

(Law Wizards from the M.L.E. are bureaucratic paper-pushers who are there to give people fines for wearing regulation-breakingly-long scarves and not charging the proper rate for Newt's Eyes, and would be totally helpless before any even /remotely/ violent crime, so if a fight breaks out, then it's /always/ going to be either the Hit-Wizards or the Aurors.

I imagine the Hit-Wizards and the Aurors are under the control of two rivaling Ministry sub-departments, kind of F.B.I. vs. C.I.A., who nominally handle slightly different things but are just always in competition. In Harry's time, the D.M.L.E. is run by a former Auror, so the Aurors are a lot better-funded and more numerous, so they're usually the ones seen while Hit-Wizards are sent on the rubbish jobs like tracking down dangerous escaped convicts.)

*** From what we know from canon :

- Auror and Hit Wizards are both part of the DLME, and under the control of Amelia Bones in canon, but since this Department is MASSIVE and even Arthur's office, the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, work for them, it's still possible to make the 2 offices rivals in competition I guess.
- Aurors do have some patrol duties, I don't remember if the Death Eater who released the dementors in DH were "officially" Auror or not, but some of them had to patrol Hogsmeades during HBP (and this is why Tonk was close enough to visit Dumbledore for advices).
- Aurors are also charged to track down escaped convicts. In OotP, Kingsley is the one in charge to chase Sirius Black, and he is an Auror. Also, considering Sirius escape was supposed to be "the first" (only beaten by the mass break out organized by Voldemort), it is unlikely any department created before PoA would have the official responsability of tracking down escaped convicts.

​

Considering the Hit Wizards, the Harry Potter wiki presents them as the specialist of highly dangerous combat situation.

If the wiki is right (and I guess it is), that would mean that the Auror are the one in charge of all the investigations, but once the suspect found, and, if he is considered dangerous, they would then have to step down to leave the Hit Wizards make the arrest.

This isn't what happens in canon, though. We constantly see Aurors confront highly dangerous dark wizards and bring them in - e.g. Moody vs Rosier. We also see Aurors are considered to be the natural opposition to such wizards ("The Aurors are on their way").

****** Not within the books, no, though they have been mentioned on JKR's website. Out-of-universe, the likelihood is that Hitwizards were simply what Aurors were called before JKR came up with the name "Auror" in GoF.

In-universe, I have typically explained it thus:

#+begin_quote
  In Dumbledore's day the Hitwizards had been the closest thing to an army the Ministry possessed. They weren't nearly as skilled as the Aurors, but what they lacked in ability they made up with numbers. Their absence from the conflict was most mysterious.

  "The Hitwizards used to be a part of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement," said Kingsley. "Their training focused on maneuvering, shielding, and blasting, and not much else."

  "Like soldiers?" said Hermione.

  "Exactly," said Kingsley. "In a war, the Aurors' job was to find the enemy, then the Hitwizards would bring them down."

  "But now?" asked Harry, hiding his eagerness by fiddling with his napkin.

  "Cornelius Fudge saw fit to disband the Hitwizards in the late eighties," said Arthur with a grimace. "An unnecessary expense, he called them."

  "An idiot if ever there was one," spat Kingsley. "The Aurors now perform the Hitwizards' duties, but there aren't nearly enough of us. Imagine if St Mungo's got rid of all their nurses and had the healers do everything themselves. It'd be chaos."

  Harry leaned back, his curiosity somewhat satisfied. It explained a lot... the Ministry's defensive stance, the lack of successful Death Eater captures. With the Aurors spread so thin it was remarkable the Ministry hadn't fallen already.

** I think of Hitwizards like SWAT, Aurors as detectives and MLE Patrol as normal cops. I think of Aurors and MLE Patrol working more closely together on some things and Aurors and Hitwizards working closely together on other things.

For me personally Aurors are the best of both because they are trained to go after dark wizards but get the feeling that they also have to deal with normal wizard issues too. Hope this helps!

** From what I can tell, it works like this:

- DMLE has the highest employment per department in the Ministry, but this is due to the fact that many of its functions deal with the non-Statute of Secrecy issues as well (not all, but many).
- There are several specialized branches depending on heirarchy of danger or threat to the public good. Aurors are the smallest and more akin to special detectives in large precincts - they operate as investigators as well as enforcement, but are often placed into specialized roles. Next is the Hit Wizards, who appear to be larger and may be organized into units or teams rather than individuals. Think of these like aurors, but less skilled and more in the role of confrontation than investigation, and are not focused exclusively on Dark Magic but rather felony-equivalent crimes. Followed by this is the patrol, which appears to handle the grunt work that you might assign to beat cops in the muggle world - everything from standing watch in particular areas to keeping crowds or riots under control. If they get in a fight, its because they were probably in the right place at the right time on their regular activities.
- Below all of them are what you would consider the purely investigative branches. For example, you have the Witch Watchers, who appear to hold a purely observational role. They provide insight and eyes where needed for the enforcers above them. Their are seemingly several branches (like say Mr. Weasley's) that focus on what you might call misdemeanor crimes, but also serve to report any observed greater crimes to the higher arms of the department (ex. murder, theft).

If your talking about a street encounter in your fic, if dark magic isn't explicitly involved its probably going to be with Patrol or maybe Hit Wizard members. An auror will not randomly stumble onto a crime in place (unless the staff are short-handed for some reason or another I suppose). But I guess it depends on the circumstances.

** For my fics, Law enforcement patrol were dubbed 'deputies', and thus the quick term was a LED. The Aurors were like the ex-Pinkerton Treasury agents in 19th c. America; precursors to Secret Service, US Marshalls, & FBI with wide-ranging enforcement powers. Hit-wizards are a thrid group of officially certified bounty hunters; extra muscle brought in to supplement the Aurors or LEDs in large operations or to face extreme threats like an escaped Nundu or a Giant uprising.

Not all Aurors are certified as Hit-wizards but most are, just because the extra pay is good. The few who don't are usually opting out to avoid being loaned out to other Ministries when they have large operations of their own. That, or they are building a family and don't want to pull extra-risky duties.

That was my take on it, anyway. LEDs are the beat cops. Ministry functionaries like Arthur Weasley also have LED-level enforcement powers but have risen beyond basic peacekeeping.

“Watch out, there's a lepper coming!” “Watch out, there's a copper coming!”

Or maybe give them a uniform and refer to them by that, like the Red Cloaks in Game of Thrones.
