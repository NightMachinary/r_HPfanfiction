** Hokay! this is going to be quick and dirty. Grammar errors could be present. I just threw crap at the wall and this is what stuck.

Edit: I did stick with the spirit of the comic.Edit2: Woah, forgot something big (scarcrux). And some grammar.

Harry Pottɛr

/After hours of searching, Barty finally found one of Harry's DADA assignments from first year. Harry Pottɛr... "Hmm... That's a funny looking e, but that should do it..." He tears off the corner with Potter's name on it, walked out of his office.../

​

With a final look at the corner of parchment, Barty thinks of the weird e in Potter. Shrugging, he drops it into the goblet with his left hand. Right before it touched the flame, it struck him what that e in potter looked like. Epsilon. What they used in Arithmancy for calculation errors.

In a panic, Barty tried grabbing the parchment back with his left hand. He managed to grab it as it touched the flame. Barty instantly realized he messed up. "Bugger!"

As the Goblet's fire turned from blue to red and shrinking to almost extinguishing and flaring back to normal size, the Dark Mark on his arm started emitted light and flared in pain. The goblet started shaking as the age line started glowing and objects around the room started floating. Barty tried to remove his hand from the fire, but couldn't move his body at all.

The goblet exploded in a ball of fire, throwing shrapnel out and an armless Barty into a wall. Not noticing the stem of the cup sticking out of his throat and the strength leaving his body as the polyjuice was cancelled and forcefully changed back to his own form, he thought on how he was defeated by bad handwriting and not searching for a better sample. He started a gurgling laugh as he bled out from his wounds.

The sound of the explosion brought people to investigate, and a dead Barty Crough Jr. was noticed quickly. A group of Hufflepuffs showed up in a panic stammering about how Cedric Diggory fell unconscious.

Around Britain, many a "upstanding member of society" was currently clenching their arms before said limb exploded in a wave of magic that knocked out any spectators leaving them to rapidly bleed out. While this was happening, certain hidden items that had protections with exclusions against those who bore the Dark Mark started to glow and shake, before they suddenly exploded too, one of which sent the Goblins into high alert without being able to find out what caused an explosion.

Meanwhile, Harry was in bed early having a strange dream. Not like the one during the summer. He was in a white room and speaking to his parents. Naked. Which was really awkward, considered he was being crushed in a hug from his mother while his dad was slapping his back while laughing uncontrollably. After a night-long conversation, they had him depart with one parting remark: "Improve your handwriting!" He woke up with his face crusted in black goo. He chalked it up to one of the Twins' pranks, washed his face and went down for breakfast and was greeted by bedlam.

In Little Haggleton, Peter Pettigrew was holding a horribly disfigured baby in his left arm while feeding it a venom infused potion with the other. He froze in place as his left arm started glowing and shaking. "Wormtail! Hold the bottle properly! Crui-" Shrieked Voldemort before he remembered that Cruico-ing people that are holding him isn't a good idea. His head having the dent to prove it. Thankfully, the bruise is almost gone now. As he was about to demand Wormtail to put him down so he can rightfully punish him, Pettigrew's arm exploded, sending hundreds of bone shards through Voldemort, killing him instantly.

Voldemort's shade formed above the wreckage, trying to understand what happened. Feeling a tug on his very being start to happen, the shade started to fade. Understanding started to sink in. "But I'm immortal! This can't be the end, I am Lord Volde-" the shriek was cut off as the shade dissipated completely.

Pettigrew, managed to survive the spray of shrapnel because of his convenient baby-shaped shield, but was still knocked unconscious until he woke up in a muggle hospital cuffed to a bed. He was later recognized by a squib nurse and caught by the aurors.

Weeks later, Dumbledore still didn't know what to think about what happened. The students who submitted their name were fine, only knocked unconscious when the contract binding them was released. They still couldn't get into Snape's office, and judging by the smell coming from his office, he didn't make it either. He was still in negotiations with Gringotts to bring down a curse breaker. He even visited the Hall of Prophecy, and noticed that the Prophecy made in 1980 was dull, indicating that it has come to fruition. How? Looking down, he sees a torn corner of parchment with a barely legible "Harry Pottɛr" on it. And then it struck him.

The power he knows not: chicken scratch writing.

*** /Aside from the Snapicide/ this was most excellent! Like the beginning of a fantastic fic where 14/15 year old Harry can embark on honouring his father's memory properly - by reviving the Marauder tradition!

The funny thing is... I forgot about Snape, until right before I hit reply. And I had to stay consistent. Pettigrew only got off because of the baby-shaped shield and being so close to muggles. Every other death eater was behind tons of wards, in solitude, or in other ways unable to be helped.

That, and I don't like Snape.

Last, this was just a giant middle finger to my teachers who gave me crap for my handwriting back in school. They said it could cause an accident, or a horrible mistake, or someone to die. I just pointed at the computers. They didn't like that. So I made the world saved by bad handwriting.

That will show them...

**** Well, kinda. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection][SQL Injections]] exist outside of xkcd.

Here is a great video explaining them: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jKylhJtPmI]]
