Thinking about this idea alot recently. Im trying to make it as canon as possible, so im looking for help regarding any plot holes/points that I might not have considered.

My plan so far is that James had a double-life relationship with Dean's mum, with neither lily or Dean's mum knowing about the other's existence. In canon Deans dad left when he was very young, and died fighting in the war. Im thinking he left, but to protect harry and lily. Dean's mum discovers a picture of the two of them while moving boxes, she shows him because she thinks it might be nice for him to have.

Dean recognises James because of his spitting image with Harry. The first couple of chapters will be Dean dealing with this revelation maybe as a prologue, and then switching to Harry. At this point I'm not sure which year they should be in book 2 seems too young for the emotional complexity that i want to portray, so I was thinking book 3 or 4 (Sirius/Remus being able to verify that James was having an affair).

What ramifications/reactions do you think Harry finding out he has a brother would have? For example i haven't even begun to think about Dumbledore, Snape (Dean being Potters son) or Voldemort.


** I'd read it, even if there isn't much plot aside from the normal plot of the according book + the emotional new aspects. And I think you could make it work, Lily and James did not have to be perfect just because they married directly out of school. Or rather, because of that. The affair could have started with James getting drunk in a muggle bar after a fight with Lily over something, and him afterwards noticing that he was more relaxed due to it, meaning less fights. Being recruited for a war directly after school, marrying directly after school, having a child just a bit later, during a war, that has to be stressful. So yeah, I could imagine it if you explain it well.

** My first reaction to this is to wonder what the point of it all is. Okay, fine, you've got an AU where James had an affair and Dean is his son. It's a stretch, but I guess if it fit with the rest of the fic I could just about suspend my disbelief. Fine... but what's the fic actually about? Dean being Harry's brother isn't a plot. Where's the conflict going to come from? What's the beginning, middle and end?

*** I'm planning it to be insular dramedy fic that explores the emotional turmoil of Dean and Harry as they attempt to build a relationship. I've decided that it'll be set during the 3rd book so the main plot of the 3rd book will carry the story forward for the most part.

The first act will be primarily working up to Dean finding out about this secret and putting it together (this is where the timelines become important) and telling Harry.

Second act is Harry confirming the story/being confused and torn about the idea of family, particularly because of his budding bond with Remus and Remus building James and Lily up. Harry not knowing what to do ignores it/bottles it up. Naturally there is this awkward period where Dean and Harry being forced see each other every day because of classes/common room etc, until it comes to a head. I'm thinking around the time the fat lady's portrait gets slashed and Harry feeling obligated to tell Dean that Sirius might be after him too.

Third act is Dean and Harry coming together, learning about each other and finally facing Sirius as a team which cements their bond.

***** Well obviously, its the skeleton of the story. There'll be various objects surrounding their father that will come into play as the story develops, opening new avenues of storytelling with particular reference to /the sins or the father are reflect upon the son/. For example I'm going to give magic and the Marauders a slightly darker edge and have the animagus /ritual/ involve the staining of the soul and having some of that passing down to Harry and Dean. Eventually forcing Harry and Dean to deal with some heavy shit about responsibility and what it is to be a man. However, the main theme of the story is brotherhood and the struggles of family.

****** It's very difficult to comment on the viability of themes absent events, so I suppose I'll leave my criticism there until the fic has more flesh to its bones.

*** You've hit on a problem in a large percentage of fanfic - relationshippy stories are all hat and no horse. I would read this Dean-Harry fic if their relationship lent intensity to a story with a plot. Say, Dean hates Harry out of residual resentment toward James ... Harry is threatened by Dementors and Dean distracts them long enough for Harry to rescue them both with a Patronus ... Dean reluctantly joins Dumbledore's Army to learn more ... Dean finds himself defending Harry in the Department of Mysteries because pettiness must be put aside in time of war ... Finally, they bond over the loss of Sirius Black and become true brothers. That sort of thing.

*** Dean's mum is a Muggle, who didn't even know whether Dean's bio dad was a wizard or not. Part of the reason I think it would work is that the 2 worlds don't collide without Dean being a wizard. I don't think the Potters were that famous, and the war was on which gives an excuse to escape into a magic war free zone and meet Deans mum. I could also play it off that James pretended to go on top secret missions (with Sirius covering his back) were he would woo her.

***** I feel that he's kind of a reckless laddish type of character from that motorcycle short story that jk did. I think he would truly love Lily but escape with Dean's mum.

*** u/Kevin241:

  A wealthy and old family like the Potters would make frontpage news if there was a marriage, particularly to a muggle-born witch.
#+end_quote

That's all fanon. The fact is that we don't know exactly what the Potter name was worth (or any pureblood name, really) before The Boy Who Lived legend began. Hell, we don't even know if Harry really was rich, or just moderately well off.

**** Potters as prominent purebloods is indeed fanon, but it's not necessary. In a society where everyone goes to the same single school, they're all going to know that James and Lily are married anyway.

**** Yeah and during the first war I imagine the whole pureblood angle (if there was such a thing) would probably be played down a lot. I never really liked the idea of Harry being super wealthy, even after he got all the black family gold. Plus money seems pretty meanless in a magical world

***** Looking it up, there is one thing JKR said in an interview that supports your claim. Apparently James didn't have a job after Hogwarts because he had enough money to support Lily and himself without it. He also supported Remus because he couldn't gain employment. But it must be said that "trust vault" and "family vault" are purely fan creations.

****** Well it depends on if you take stock in the books or movies more. In the movies, Harry's vault wasn't exactly hurting for gold. And its just Harry's vault, never called the Potter vault. So its safe to assume that James had at least that much gold just laying around. Probably a lot more.

Anyways, I know it sounds like a load of fanon crap but with the combined literary and visual aids from books and movies, my points hopefully make sense. I am just trying to help the OP if he/she wants to make the fic complaint with canon.
