I don't know what it is - there is no indication in canon that he would actually do this. I mean, being forced to cook by abusive relatives should make him hate cooking, but there is something about a hero deciding to be a baker that makes me read these stories. I can't even bake!

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

**** Sounds like a great story! You should link it if/when you post it! I'd imagine Sirius has more of a Father relationship with him, as well as a habit of making Dad Jokes. Remmy would likely be like the cool uncle, sneaking him sweets, and helping teach him things not only about life, but about the magical world.

I imagine that Hagrid was initially teased for wanting to bake, however Lily encouraged it, going so far to put together a massive cook book, only having an equal size in Hagrid. It seems like the type of thing she'd do, and would likely fit in her style of Magic. Perhaps it would be like an Opposite of Tom's Diary? Where you could enter the Book, and see how to make something, rather than just having to Read it?

Maybe there could even be a bit of a bittersweet tone to the Book? Maybe Lily had promised to contuie it, maybe over time it would've had more pages, but after she passed it couldn't add more. So, whenever Hagrid made a new recipe, he put his own page into the Book in honor of her? The Story could give some great Context for the Series, maybe it would help him figure out something was off about the Diary as well as lure him to it? Stuff like that.

Either way, i'd love to read it!

****** Out of the three of them, i'd think Remmy would be the one. As a werewolf he has a much harder time getting work, which leads him to require a drive and determination that you don't get if something is easy. He'd likely be willing to try harder, and learn the business sense needed to run something like that, while Hagrid would likely be the face of the business to avoid unneeded and very unfortunate outcomes

I'd imagine that the bakery would make a good hangout for misfits, maybe even a sanctuary for those without a place to be?

But yeah, Remmy doesn't really have a lot of bite to his bark, and Hagrid is a lot more intimidating when it comes to looks than reality despite his capabilities. It's also why I feel like Remmy would act as more of a cool uncle, than a fatherly figure, he's used to feeling like a hazard and being treated as one which would cause him to build an ice wall that Harry will likely melt as well as his and our hearts XD

** A change to my comment>

Baking and Cooking are two entirely different things and I can see Harry enjoying Baking while hating to cook. I think harry would want to make people smile and make people happy, and giving them sweets like what Mrs. Weasley did for him on many occasions would be something he could do, so owning a cafe that sells sweet cakes and other treats as well as coffee and teas would be something I can see him doing and enjoying.

******* Somewhat true, but then it's a poor choice of summary. And in this particular case:

"Hermione had praised him as intelligent more then once.

She had always told him he could be the top of his classes with her but he just wasn't ever that motivated.

[...] Both would have been jealous. He knew he would have beaten even Hermione if he tried. [...] *He wasn't illiterate either*. He just made sure to do a bad job on essays.

He'd been reading since he was very little though as books were one thing Dudley had never gotten jealous about and Vernon and Petunia had never thougtht about. *He could write well and structure paragraphs perfectly.*"

-Caf√©, Chapter 1 (very near the beginning)-

I honestly didn't make it much farther than a third of the first chapter...

ps: Why does Harry's pov sound like Donald Trump (I have the best words and write paragraphs perfectly [what does that even mean xD?] ) , and why do I suddenly want a fic with a Trump!Voldemort ?
