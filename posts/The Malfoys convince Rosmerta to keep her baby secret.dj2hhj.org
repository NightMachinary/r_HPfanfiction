** Epilogue is shit and I ignore it. For me all Malfoys were in jail. For fucks sake they hosted Voldemort for better part of Second war even with Narcissa's help I couldn't see how they escaped justice again.

Coming to your point, they most likely kill both Rosmerta and child than paying her off. Malfoy is the same guy who tried to murder 11 year old child with horcrux.

*** I'd argue only Lucius would be guaranteed prison in any sort of reasonable regime change, barring Draco actually murdering someone.

Not that I think they don't all deserve prison time, but Lucius was the Joseph Goebbels of the death eaters until book 6.

There's been multiple examples of lenience in the post WWII tribunals.

*** I feel like Narcissa wasn't really allowed a choice. Even her marriage was arranged.

She wanted to keep Draco safe and knew that if she tried anything he'd suffer for her mistakes and there was no way Draco was going to allow his mother to cart him off somewhere safe. He always was a daddy's boy and if daddy said that he should bow down and kiss the dark lord's robes then that's what he was going to do!

Not saying she's remotely a good person but she's mostly guilty of trying to be a, more or less, good mother.

I doubt she'd allow anything to happen to her grandbaby either... I don't know what she'd do but the baby would remain safe. Rosmerta, on the other hand, would probably disappear or be obliviated to the point where she barely knew her own name once the the baby was born.

Lucius though should've been tossed through the veil He's ruthless and not above a little murder of a child even if it is his grandchild.

***** Just an assumption. Just like I assume Bellatrix was arranged to marry Rodolphus Lestrange and Andromeda was probably arranged to marry someone else but ran off with Ted Tonks and that's why she was disowned.

Bellatrix and Narcissa were 'good girls' and if Cygnus Black wanted them to marry into the Lestrange and Malfoy families then they did lest they end up like Andromeda.

Then again most of this is based purely off speculation.

**** How come she didn't have a choice? One of the most important moral lessons of the whole HP universe is that we always choice. Sometimes it is between what's easy and what's right, but there is always choice. Who would stop Narcissa from taking Draco, running abroad, and asking for divorce? Lucius couldn't kill her because that would be too obvious.

***** The wizarding world is a backwards society filled with slavery and bigotry do you really think women are regarded highly enough to take the heirs of house away from the head?

Lucius, as head of House Malfoy, would prevent his heir from being taken. There would be no need to kill her he would just take it to Wizengamot or bribe Fudge and he would get his way.

And when he was in Azkaban I highly doubt she would've crossed Voldemort who wanted Draco to take Lucius' place.

****** That's one your interpretation of the wizarding world, not the canon. House-elves slavery is obviously much more complicated than what Hermione thought it is, and bigotry ... take a look around yourself, if you don't see similar bigotry. "the head of House of Malfoy" is completely fanon concept. In the same manner, complete subservience of Fudge towards Malfoy is fanon as well; yes, Fudge was corrupt, but perhaps bigger crime on the side of Malfoy would be lovely opportunity for him to ship him to Azkaban and clear his hand over him.

***** I mean, he wasn't even convicted of being a death eater after the first war. Dude obviously has some political clout, so it's perfectly viable to assume he could find and murder Narcissa if necessary. I'd say that Narcissa was definitely guilty of at least some anti-Muggle sentiment; it's just that she had neither the skill set nor conviction to follow through as a Death Eater. Her family's fall from grace in the sixth and seventh books also portray her in a more sympathetic light.

Well, a sentiment is not a crime. /Thinking/ that Hitler had pretty good ideas about Jews, doesn't make you criminal (at least in US, Europeans have slightly more complicated thoughts about that, but even then, you have to publish your thoughts).

We don't know anything about her skills. I can imagine that a girl from a good family should be a good student too, notwithstanding her schooling was mostly useless as a wife and mother.

******* Sure, but my point was that the idea of Narcissa not having a choice is kind of irrelevant to the point about her not having a choice. For the most part, I don't think she was just some helpless housewife forced to go along at wand point. Considering she knowingly housed Voldemort and bound Snape in an Unbreakable Oath to kill Dumbledore, she was certainly guilty of some sort of crime during the war, and if we were to have her sentenced post-war, I don't think it's just to wave off these actions as driven purely by fear for her life.

Certainly I can see her being a good student, but I was referring more to her fighting ability. With her sister and husband being Voldemort's chief lieutenants, it seems fair to assume that her lack of direct involvement was due to a lack of martial skill.

******** Certainly, about not being completely innocent, but Epilogue was nineteen years later, she could get out of Azkaban in meantime. I would think that only hard-core Death Eaters (like her lovely husband) would get the life sentence.
