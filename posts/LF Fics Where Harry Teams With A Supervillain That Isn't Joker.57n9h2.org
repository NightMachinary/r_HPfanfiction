I've seen a few fics where Harry becomes a Supervillain but I don't remember seeing any where he's not either teamed with/living with/dating/inspired by the Joker. Anyone know any good fics where he becomes a Supervillain because of someone else? Thanks!


** I think there's a Worm cross where he works with Skitter, which sort of counts?

**** It's a long (~1.6m words) web serial. Original fiction, superhero setting. Very realistic take in that pretty much all the characters are intelligent and leverage their (often very limited) powers to the fullest. Great, very large ensemble cast. Experienced its biggest surge in popularity when Eliezer Yudkowsky recommended it in the middle of a long HPMOR hiatus.

****** Not currently, unfortunately. The author is currently working on editing it for commercial release, so he's trying to avoid widespread proliferation of unofficial releases. Nothing stopping you from making one yourself, though.
