I've recently been introduced to Lavender/Seamus and I'm really liking the pairing. I'm looking for fairly long, complete stories that feature canon Lavender - average intelligence, loves beauty, etc. I like stories where she grapples with dealing with her new scars (from Greyback) although I'd prefer this not be the whole plotline. I definitely love fics that detail how the war scarred the characters, rather than just, "there was a war but we're totes fine now!".

Any reccs would be greatly appreciated :)
