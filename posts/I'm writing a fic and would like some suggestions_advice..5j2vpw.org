Hello all! Long time lurker, first time poster and all of that jazz. I've begun a new fic this week. A mystery/detective piece set in NYC in 1924. It involves the characters of FBAWTFT and two (related) OC's.

The premise is that there is an attack on MACUSA by an unknown No-Maj (which I thought would help contribute to the tensions of the movie.) Cue the wizards investigating and trying to solve the crime.

Now for my questions. Do any experienced writers have any advice for writing? Specifically multiple characters? This is only my second fanfic (though I've written scores of my own stories) and I'm nervous that I won't do the characters justice.

Secondly, does anyone have any requests for characters they'd like to see written, or any dynamics they'd like explored?
