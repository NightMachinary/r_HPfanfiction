If not - prompt! Either a good Snape or an evil one. Stands to reason that if he's attracted to Lily, he might also like her sister, once they'd all matured a little.


** 'Flowers by the Wayside' looks like it'll probably end up that way.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance that will change the course of Wizarding history.

** There is the story “[[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][Terms of Matrimony by Galad Estel]]” (links point to my review on my blog, where I refer to the means how to get the story, it was taken down from FFnet). I really liked its premise, but its end feels kind of fake: like the author wanted to finish it by any means and rushed the job horribly. However, it is certainly worthy of reading.

** Yes. I'll have to search a bit for it, but there's one where Petunia goes to Snape when Harry and Dudley are young. (Either Vernon died or he beat her; I've read stories with both so not sure which one.) At first it's a marriage of convenience but they come to like each other.

ETA: Found the one I was thinking of: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12712205][Petunia Takes a Stand]] by slytherinsal. In the course of my search, I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4923158][3 Slytherin Marauders]] by severusphoenix, which may also fit the bill for you.

*** OK, the first one feels like written by a teenager for their English literature homework. Super tropey (super right Harry, Horcrux removed by gobblins, etc.).

** If one goes with evil or just Canon Snape and Petunia; Harry would hate him with a passion.\\
Canon Harry had a pretty strong spine and lots of humility. This Harry would probably be a lot more timid than that as I can't see Snape tolerating any opposition. He would be more timid and shy than Neville in his earlier years. He would not like Hogwarts if Snape actually is a teacher there and it would not matter to him if Snape is against Voldemort; he would hate him. Merlin I can only imagine Remus' reaction when he sees Snape (or Petunia) as Harry's boggart. Remus and Sirius are probably going to murder Snape and Petunia.
