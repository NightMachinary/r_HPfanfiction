Hello all, Lately I haven't found many fics to read that are finished so, looking for recommendations for it. No genre specific, only that it is not slash, and, if it is with sequels, that sequels are finished too.

My FF acc has ocer 2.5k favs, so, hopefully one of yall can recommend me good finished fics. Either of HP only or crossover, doesn't matter.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
