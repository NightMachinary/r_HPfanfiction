  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** I personally think linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) is your bill. I enjoyed Art of Self-Fashioning, but the Harry from that story was inherently different to begin with.

In OTWtG, it's canon Harry that's sorted into Slytherin. There's a slow burn, as Harry does what he can to fit in and adapt. He starts experimenting with darker spells, and has a different set of morals. In fact, [[/spoiler][Fawkes refuses to transport him because he's dabbled a little /too/ far, and isn't the pure soul he was in canon]]

I truly enjoy the Snape in this fic as well. He's not suddenly a second father/mentor because Harry is in Slytherin and has his mother's eyes. They still aren't that fond of each other, but there's definitely a certain level of respect that doesn't exist in canon.

Out of all the authors who attempt to have a "gray" Harry, this Harry isn't an edgelord, believes he's still an inherently good person, but faces (realistic and not contrived) issues with the Weasleys and the Order.

** "Resurrexit" by Master Slytherin has some of what you're looking for, even though you said "no stories focused on romance" - although it's not really that much of a romance, despite some flashbacks to when Harry's wife was still alive. You'll see what I mean when you start reading it.
