I'd like a good Harry/Hermione Yule Ball fic without any Ron bashing in it, where he gets over it and doesn't wind up splitting from the group because of it.

  Dark times lie ahead, they said. Soon we will have to decide between what is easy and what is right, they said. Yeah, well. Nobody told him they were actually talking about that Yule Ball nightmare that now lies inescapably ahead with no clear answers in sight. How will he ever get out of this mess, and is there any way that doesn't involve dancing? (There isn't.)

** linkffn(12480493) has Harry ask out Hermione for the occasion of the ball; Ron and Harry's friendship is on the mend in chapter 06, although he's not present much before that one.

** I don't think I'd call what happens in Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire bashing. The ire Ron had for Harry is instead directed at Hermione. This damages their friendship more than it damaged Harry/Ron. They both act like children (including a particularly good part where Hermione chews out Ron for acting out without knowing it was in her defense).

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

Needless to say Her going with Harry was not even really part of the drama going on with Ron/Hermione.

I don't recall if the one where Mcgonagall recruits Hermione as Harry's date when he is clueless had any Ron bashing. The premise certainly doesn't require it.

â€‹

That would be Yuletime Blessings in Disguise. I haven't rescanned it to see if there is any bashing, but I don't think so? linkffn(12773140)
