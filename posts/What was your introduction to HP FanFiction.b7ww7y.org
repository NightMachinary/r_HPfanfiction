** I kept hitting the random article button on wikipedia and until it went to Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. I thought the title was so ridiculous that I *had* to investigate further. The first chapter was really boring, but I continued on to the second. By the fourth chapter, I was hooked. I hadn't had a book make me laugh so hard in so long. That and the fact that the author was so good at combining whimsy and world building made me feel like I was reading an updated version of the original series. I spent every free moment of the following week or so reading it.

** Back in the day (i.e. 2005) I used to inhabit the HPANA forums. I mostly discussed canon but there was a small fanfiction subforum there. One day I ventured into it, discovered SIYE, and proceeded to read Harry Potter and the Power of Emotion by Melindaleo. Spent the rest of the summer reading fanfiction dawn to dusk.

** Someone showed me HPMoR a few years ago. So much of that story works so well for me, it was the perfect introduction to something I hadn't really given any consideration to until then.

I'd had a vague idea of fanfiction being basically immature and subpar quality as a whole, and that story showed me that it could be just as well thought-out, plotted, and strong to the finale as any ordinary fiction, but in a familiar and comfortable world.

I pretty much dove in headfirst and haven't stopped yet.

*** HPMoR was my first experience of fanfiction, too. I can't recall how I first came across it, only that I'd seen it mentioned more than once before I actually looked it up.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to others as a starting point, because it's definitely not everyone's cup of pumpkin juice - though as you say, the writing quality is well above average, and personally I really enjoyed it. If I were actually asked by someone to recommend a starter, I'd likely choose something closer to canon, maybe even canon-compliant, like linkffn(The Snape Chronicles), though it's a bit dark (Voldemort isn't much nicer to his underlings than to his enemies), or perhaps linkffn(A Call to Arms by My Dear Professor McGonagall).

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** I ignored fanfics for years since the only side of it I saw was trashy romance with really forced pairings but boredom got the better of me, I googled the most popular HP fic and I read HPMOR, loved it and read it in like a few days ( I don't sleep much), then I read some of Robst fics an kept going 'till today. Nowadays I mostly read SI's and sometimes Harmony when it's not too filled with drama and fluff.

** It was early 2002, before the release of OotP, and I wanted to know more about Snape. Through the magic of Lycos Search and Tripod Webrings, I found out quickly that I was not alone! We scoured canon for every reference, theorized best we could, and when the books did not provide enough detail we made it up ourselves. A magical spy -- what a great concept to spark the imagination!

FFN was the wild west -- you could find /anything/ there before The First Purge, but it was volatile with abandoned WIP or straight-up deleted fics. I remember more than once saving a bookmark to an author page and it was just /gone/ the next day. It was Sept 2002 when we had to scatter to other archives for our adult-rated fics, or other fics caught up in the purge (I remember they also removed some epfics where the first chapter was just author notes).

In 2005 I went off to college and had rather less time for the HP fandom. I did manage to spend some time at WitchFics, but it makes me sad that I wasn't actually paying attention when that archive went dark :(

Snapefic is still my favorite, with a strong preference for SSHG. I have no problem with good Snapefic marked as AU from a certain point in the series... It may mean it was written before that release, and I love finding those old gems!
