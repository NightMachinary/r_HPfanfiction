  Neville walks into a red room. "Hello, Harry," he greeted. "I see you were busy in the last eight years since we saw each other." Some people change their profession after a loss. Harry is one of them. With Neville's and Malfoy's plan, the world will rue the day Harry lost his loved ones... even if the world might not remember it. Time travel! Somehow Dark-not-Evil!Harry

** I'd think by the time Draco got out of prison Harry would have 10+ years seniority so it'd be more of a rookie-mentor thing than partners. His record would hopefully prevent him from a career in law enforcement, too.

*** Not really. If you think about it wizards don't really care. They believed that Hagrid opened the Cos, they expel him but let him work in school. Snape was a known(no imperious excuses) DE but they let him teach in a school. All of that because Double-door said that they are ok. So if you think about it, if Harry said something along the lines "he needs to atone and work for his sins, to cleanse his past and make amends with our society", They would give Draco a badge before they even give him his wand back.

** There was a very old one from 2000-1 (!) which was never finished, but had Harry and Draco working together. It was on Schnoogle/FictionAlley.
