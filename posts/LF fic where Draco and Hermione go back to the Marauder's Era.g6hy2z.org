:END:
I'm trying to find this fanfic I read sometime last year. Hermione and Draco both go back in time to the Marauder's Era using a spell/potion (can't remember) that allows them to get 'reborn' into their magical families (Draco becomes a brother to Narcissa, Bellatrix, and Andromeda Black while Hermione becomes a sister to James Potter after Harry adopts her into his family). They go back in time to stop Voldemort from regaining power for a second time after he wins the Battle of Hogwarts (for some reason I want to say Lucius ends up coming Minister of Magic, but I can't say for sure). Any one have any ideas? It includes some really interesting theories about muggleborns being able to find who their magical families were and then be able to 'claim the bloodline/family magic)

*** Thank you so much! I completely agree. I remember it being so different but so well thought out and intriguing.
