So I was reminded of a weird fic the other day wherein Dumbledore was evil and had his own horcrux. After a bit of thinking I realized that I was thinking of that massive old crackfick "Partially Kissed Hero" by Perfect Lionheart linkffn(4240771) Turns out Snape also had a horcrux in that one.

Anyway, this got me to wondering about what other stories my exist wherein Dumbledore (or some other unexpected person) also had (and used) a horcrux.


** linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool by The Mad Mad Reviewer) features one. As well as venomous squirrels, which is always a bonus in any fic.

The sequel, alas, hasn't updated in nearly five years, with a promise-to-continue posted the year before last.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
