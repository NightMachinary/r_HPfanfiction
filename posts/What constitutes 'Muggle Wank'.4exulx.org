So, yeah. I'm planning a fic where the Prime Minister we see in book 6 actually got to work on creating a task force designed to help Muggles fight Wizards back in Book 2, with their first mission in Book 4. So, what constitutes Muggle Wank and what is reasonable? Like, I know that they are utterly vulnerable to Dementors, but what about giants. Is there any reason a skilled sniper with a lot of bullets couldn't kill a giant by shooting them in the open eye? Or kill the giant with a few thermite tipped RPG's to the face?


** The problem isn't an armed confrontation, but all the methods that wizards and witches have at their disposal to completely avoid that. Memory charms, muggle repellent charms, stealth... Imperius curse + Polyjuice? It seems ridiculously easy to infiltrate all levels of a muggle resistance within days.

Why would wizards ever face muggles in any kind of open conflict?

*** A straight wizards versus muggles conflict would be horribly one sided, for the reasons you mentioned.

I think the OP's intended question is more along the lines of "how effective would muggle technology or weapons be against wizards or magical creatures?" Presumably there would be some wizard support involved, which eliminates the boring answer of muggle repelling charms. It wouldn't be too hard to come up with a plausible scenario for this, such as the muggle PM quietly contributing some troops or weapons to combat Voldemort's terrorism.

**** Indeed!

I think those weapons (in addition to long range missiles and airstrikes if they knew where to strike...we don't know if wards can stop a cruise-missile after all or laser guided bombs etc.) would work just fine on giants, dragons and even wizards (we don't know if the basic shield charm works on bullets (sure you could invent charms that do, but otherwise that's up to the fanfiction-writer's discretion!) and if it does how long it would stand hold under concentrated fire etc.)

I also agree that without wizards helping them, muggles would not even get the chance to fight wizards (could they fight them if muggle-repelling charms etc. didn't exist? Maybe, I mean there's A LOT MORE MUGGLES than there's wizards!) with repelling wards, invisibility spells and cloaks, polyjuice, metamorphmagi, glamour charms (or are they entirely fanon?), imperius curses etc. etc. wizards don't have to fight them in the open and with apparition, portkeys and the floo they can relocate easily if a location would be discovered (as unlikely as it is!)

** Muggle wank has two forms, I think:

Firstly, the unrealistic engineering of situations to make them favour Muggles, most commonly through nerfing magic.

An example of this would be ignoring the effectiveness of wizards' concealment and stealth abilities, often by interpreting them narrowly or writing new loopholes into the magic.

Another example would be though dismissing wizards' pre-existing penetration of the Muggle government. In canon they seem to be aware of everything the Prime Minister is up to and are capable of rearranging his schedule on a whim - including international arrangements.

Another example would be failing to utilise various magics for mental manipulation, or downgrading their usefulness significantly.

A further example is ignoring the constraints a Muggle leader would face from his own world, never mind magical interference. Good luck convincing people you're not insane.

The most common example, however, is just a "general nerf" - making wizards and magic significantly weaker across the board.

Secondly, Muggle wank is also the fetishisation of Muggle institutions or social norms and the blind acceptance that the wizarding world would be better if they were adopted. This is what I've called in the past HealthAndSafety!Harry. It's an approach to magic that removes all of the romance of the HP world and also ignores the many ways in which magic should alter the way wizards think about things (in particular, the existence of magic capable of healing basically any non-magical injury).

*** Agreed on all points.

One thing I'd like to add. I've never seen the "bad guys" in the story respond in a believable manner. Sure, you can make the villains a bunch of bumbling bigots who refuse to touch filthy Muggle tech. I like stories with competent bad guys, though.

The nature of wizard on wizard conflicts is defined by the Statute of Secrecy. If that gets broken and we see more intermixing of the Wizard and Muggle worlds, I'd expect the bad guys to adapt quickly.

A sniper could probably kill a Giant. It might also give Voldemort the idea to go Imperius a few bomber crews at the nearest Air Force base into dropping some cluster bombs on Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley.

I tend to doubt JKR thought these things through, but at least the way I retcon it in my head, the good guys in the Magical world have a huge interest in keeping the worlds separate. Bad guys are always less concerned about collateral damage, and Muggle weapons can be destructive on a scale that makes Fiendfyre - the most large-scale destructive magic we ever see - look tame.

The usual safeguards on Muggle military-grade weapons are also extremely vulnerable to people with teleportation, invisibility, and mind-control abilities. Not something I want Death Eaters to be thinking about, if I'm the MoM.

Wanting to break the Statute of Secrecy and install wizards as rulers of Muggles was more Grindelwald's thing than Voldemort's. Voldemort wanted to rule the wizarding world more than the Muggle one.

I agree about Voldemort's goals, I'm just making the point that I think if someone used Muggle technology against him, he'd be quick to adapt and counterattack using it.

Either side would get one surprise attack with Muggle tech. After that you'd be in a hybrid war where both sides are using both magic and Muggle tech. No one side would be able to monopolize its use.

*** Let me start by saying that I don't like Muggle wank. That being said, the passage that is so often quoted to instantly dispel the notion that Muggles would ever have a chance in any engagement against the magical community is often misunderstood.

The quote from HBP:

#+begin_quote
  "Er, said the Prime Minister, "listen.... It's not a very good time for me.... I'm waiting for a telephone call, you see... from the President of - "

  "That *can be* rearranged," said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister's heart sank. He had been afraid of that.
#+end_quote

Emphasis mine. So, despite Kingsley Shacklebolt being very close to the Muggle Prime Minister, the Ministry for Magic doesn't even know his schedule. There was no indication that the portrait had any idea that the PM was about to speak with another head of state. How effective can the magical response be if they don't have the PM's schedule down? Either Kingsley isn't very good at his job, or the magical counter to the Muggle government is overblown. If the quote had been:

#+begin_quote
  "That *has already been* rearranged,"
#+end_quote

then I would have more confidence in the Ministry's ability to keep tabs on the Muggle PM.

Fighting against magical creatures is hard too. Many of those are invisible to muggles, and many of those visible can be only defeated by certain methods.

You say "the right intel". That's the thing. Muggles have no intel on the magical world. They don't know who's a wizard and who's not, they don't know where they live, and even if they do, the general procedure is not "shoot to kill".

The wiki says nothing about muggle-repelling charms on the Ministry, but it is makes sense they would be there--an oversight from me. Still, I assume there are ways to bypass things like this. I can't remember if it is canon that parents of Muggleborns can enter Diagon Alley. EDIT: Tom Riddle tells Hagrid that Myrtle's parents are coming to collect her corpse. They are muggles, so, unless Tom is lying, the charm can be countered; this obviously requires a wizard, so once again assumes one would be willing to betray the wizarding world.

I did not mean the assassin would enter Wizengamot, simply that Wizengamot is an assurance of Dumbledore's location. They could wait outside and shoot him there, and then kill themselves.

Still, I largely agree with you. Fucking with wizards is going to end badly for both sides. It is not a risk that is wise to take.

******* If it gets to the point where you are considering using it, it's no longer about saving the country, it's about killing the enemy. By that time, the city is basically a city of people that will be dead either way soon enough, so taking them out as a side-effect to your strike has the benefit of denying the enemy the opportunity to use their corpses to kickstart the zombie apocalypse.

If nuking England is what it takes to kill the enemy, then you fucking nuke England because the alternative is worse anyway. If you're lucky, you have biological weapons that can guarantee a 100% kill rate on infected magicals and something like 70-80% of muggles. With numbers like those, you'll use the bioweapons as it guarantees that 20% of the population could survive. Otherwise, keep nuking until the island glows in the dark.

********* That's how they would see it.

Remember that, if you're a general in the British Army and you're facing something you cannot understand, explain or reason with, you're in trouble. When you're faced with a situation where you're actively fighting said thing, you are in real trouble. And when you have absolutely no idea about how to destroy it, you will go for the heaviest option you have and hope to hell you do not have to work your way down.

That's what people forget about arguments like this-when it comes to situations like fighting wizards, alien invasions, blah blah blah, there aren't many options available to a conventional military force. When you're facing someone with what appears to be programmable energy weapons capable of turning a small city into a lake of sentient fire, can teleport, erase your memories and turn a tank into a slinky because they feel like it, you are going to do your level best at killing them as fast as you possibly can.

When you're facing a group of someones scattered across the country, all of them hostile and all of them gunning for the 60+ million people living on the island and you have absolutely zero engagement options, then you and everyone else is more than likely going to die very, very quickly.

When faced with that situation, any means necessary means exactly that.

That's what people forget during the 'muggle vs wizard in HP world-UK edition' arguments-at its most extreme, they're talking about an advanced, heavily industrialised first world nation carrying a sizable nuclear arsenal coming under direct attack from a mini-nation living within its borders with no means of determining how many of them are hostile or not, where their bases are or what can be done to counter them. Unless there exists a means of figuring out where they are, the options for dealing with them get ever more limited as time wears on.

The above post may sound crazy, but given the capabilities of those involved, it's very possible that this /is/ the outcome of such an occurrence-60+ million dead, countless species wiped out and a former global powerhouse reduced to glowing rubble because a bunch of magical hicks decided to play a prank on the UK's MOD.

As I said, you didn't even specify what's so bad about the discovery of the existence of wizards, or what "the alternative" is. Wizards don't generally want to genocide the muggles, and they keep other wizards from harming muggles - while also helping muggles who have been attacked by wizards. Even in the event that wizards would decide they want to rule over the muggles, this scenario would certainly be much more agreeable than nuclearly destroying an entire island full of ancient history, culture, and a population of sixty million.

*********** Well that is the essence of this thread-conventional methods of approach won't work. There is no rapport, no exchange, nothing to indicate who these guys are, what they want and what they're doing there. For all you know, it could just as easily be an advanced alien race beyond the stars instead of wizards, it changes nothing. The fact that it could be a tiny minority means nothing either because just one wizard could do insane amounts of damage with next to no warning anyway.

You would only know of their existence because they got sloppy and/or they attacked something significant enough that it couldn't be erased from public record. Amazingly, no witnesses remember anything, which is even worse.

Now imagine those attacks getting more & more frequent. So frequent, in fact, that you deploy conventional forces to stop them.

Said conventional forces fail spectacularly. So you turn to your not-so-conventional forces. They work... twice. The third time, one of them up & disappears off the radar and the rest of your not-so-conventional forces are either dead or mindfucked into amnesia by dawn the next day.

Then you kick it up the chain and get the other branches involved.

This goes even worse.

It probably doesn't help that British cities are being set on fire by these bastards either.

In the end, there is one conclusion to the matter-conventional weapons do not work. What do you do then? Artillery works for a while, but that stops the second the spotter gets forcibly teleported somewhere and your 120mm guns become ground zero for a sapient bonfire-along with the city they were stationed in.

Tanks don't really work. Guns don't work. Soldiers end up brainwashed into killing their comrades. Everything, in short, goes wrong.

And then an intelligence wonk finds out that London is ground zero for people like that somehow. Where or how is not specified, but you know they're in London in great enough numbers for Military Intelligence to pick up on it.

And then the zombies show up.

You think nukes and bomb collars are insane responses to this? Think about it-by now, know these guys are lethally dangerous. By now, you know they can basically bodysnatch people and you wouldn't know it until it was far too late. They can teleport, kill entire cities in minutes and, most importantly, they cannot be pin-pointed with any degree of accuracy.

Going by this thread, no conventional response will work and every response you try makes things that much scarier as it turns out they can form shields that stop projectiles, teleport on a whim, treat another man's brain like an open book they scribble on the margins of, kill thousands upon thousands without breaking a sweat...

So when faced with an opponent like that, what do you do? You only know there are lots of them in London. You know it's probably not the only place they live in, but it's the best you've got. The likelihood of London being a target is practically a certainty anyway and one gust of sapient fire would see the Second Great Fire of London take out the City in any case. The Queen is long gone by then, evacuated with whoever else needed to be evacuated. You have your orders to stop this madness, no matter what the cost.

So then, conventional weapons don't work. What unconventional weapons are on the table that, in theory, could actually hit a target in a general area without the need for precise (as in, within a hundred metres of the target) coordinates?

Well, biological weapons could do it. Wall up the city and use the general population as vectors for an airborne disease with a 95%+ kill ratio. Set at two-three weeks' incubation and most of London will be infected by it before the first symptoms crop up. Biggest drawback? You won't know if it's actually worked.

Same with chemical weapons-you simply don't know if it works or not. Nerve gas that merely requires skin contact is a possibility, but there will still be survivors even if you successfully deliver the reagent.

Levelling the city with non-nuclear ordinance is not an option either, given that the bastards can teleport.

Besides, there is one aspect of nuclear weapons that is incredibly hard to counter-radiation. The fallout from a nuke capable of levelling London is what guarantees the kill here just as much as the surprise factor of a single 30 megaton warhead dropped dead centre on Military Intelligence HQ taking out the city would. After all, if you had roadblocks set up to stop anyone from entering the city after the bomb goes off, those won't stop any intrepid teleporters at all. If they rush in in a blind panic to try & find their compatriots, they'll be stuck at ground zero of an area so heavy in poisonous radiation that even bacteria struggle to survive it. That's what you're actually counting on too-that they panic, teleport in and then teleport out. If they are buried in an area free of fallout, you can then try & comb likely locations with a geiger counter if you want a general indication of where the others might be.

So if it takes sacrificing the City of London and potentially exposing the rest of the UK to radiation in order to deal with an enemy that doesn't reason, bargain or do anything but make everyone's life a living hell?

Nagasaki was nuked for less.

This is what the discussion of which is better boils down to-neither side will survive a fight. The magicals may well dominate the field, but there have been protocols in place for using nuclear weapons on domestic soil when pitted against an overwhelming invasion force that have existed for as long as nuclear weapons themselves have. It's not unthinkable at all given how everyone assumed that that's how a fight between the US and the USSR would have gone in the 70's and 80's-if there isn't a stalemate, there's a nukefest.

And if the wizards and witches perform such amazing feats that leave the muggles floundering, then the question of if nukes come out to play transforms into when nukes come out to play. And, good as they may be, I doubt that there'd be a defence the magicals could come up with to counter that.

Am I insane? That's a maybe. Is the idea insane? Absolutely not. Indeed, it's the most logical outcome should wizards and muggles get into a serious fight, regardless of how many of said wizards are actually fighting.

Also, the UK submit to the rule of a foreign and malicious power? Dude, no. Would not do to end the 950-year yaynosuccessfulinvasionshere winning streak, now would it? Have you seen how they react to being a part of the EU? Trust me, if the choice is between dying in a nuclear fire or submitting to the crazy magical assholes wanting to paint themselves as their new overlords, most Brits would ride that nuke on its way down.

************ I don't know where to even start with this. Your entire premise is so far-fetched. Why do you think wizards would light entire cities on fire? even Voldemort didn't do it. Why do you think that "those attacks getting more & more frequent"? above all, why do you think that "You" (which I suppose refers to some British General) would escape the Obliviation and Mind Control that infests all others? What makes you think that the wizards won't learn about your plans beforehand?

And, no, even if being conquered by a "foreign power" (the British Wizards aren't a foreign power, and have worked with the muggle royalty in the past) I don't think the Brits would nuclearly annihilate their own country. Hiroshima was nuked by people who didn't live there. And it was nuked as a tactical assault, one that demonstrated to the Japs what would happen if they don't stop fighting. This national suicide of yours will achieve basically nothing. It might kill the small part of the magical population that is in Diagon Alley, but most wizards would easily escape any damage. Assuming that wizards would even suffer from muggle biological attacks (Rowling made it clear that wizards don't suffer from the same diseases that muggles do, and they have very easy and convenient ways to clean the air). As I said in earlier posts, I believe the muggles would have preferred to live under discriminatory wizard rule than to be collectively annihilated. This is, after all, what history shows us about most conquered nations.

Essentially, what I'm saying is that the basis for this scenario would never come to pass, because wizards are too good at spying and mind controlling.

On the other hand, giants don't display any ability to do magic themselves --- and even resent wizards for doing magic --- but they have no trouble killing each other with primitive weapons or just bare hands. If you want canon quotes, Hagrid characterizes one of the bigger giants as having "skin like rhino hide", which is tough, but not that tough against even older Muggle weapons. (Though, Hagrid was probably using that simile to set a lower bound for toughness, not upper bound.)

Something that means both sides have something to add to the mix. The muggles do areas where tech outstrips magic, but not many.

You could keep the idea of the task-force meant to combat wizards - have the wizards call the Prime Minister on that particularly bad idea - and then have them work together fighting monsters.

But as has probably been said. One skilled wizard could infiltrate any purely muggle facility with ease so a straight up war between those two sides isn't viable.

My reasons for this are that there are a lot less magicals which mean fewer people to innovate, and it seems to me that they are also relatively isolationist. Isolationist societies in my opinion evolve slower than those who interact with a bunch of other cultures.

Now this isn't to say that there is no progress just that under normal circumstances their society evolves slower than muggle culture

What wizarding music do we encounter?

At all. That should tell you a lot. Then there's the Weird Sisters, admittedly that is one band that would probably fit right in at muggle festivals. But everyone seems to know them from the wireless or not at all. With how popular they're supposedly are one would think that there are teenage music lovers who go to concerts etc. But that doesn't seem to happen. Oh yes, and the Hobgoblins and Stubby Boardman, the only indication that live shows might be more than a rare exceptions. And not very good ones considering the turnip.

The one other cultural event we see would be the Yule Ball, a one-off exception.

All intellectual endeavours seem to be solely aimed towards magic.

We don't have enough canon material to get a good impression of the breadth of culture; that's perfectly true. There might be hundreds of musical groups where we see a scant handful. There might be ten thousand novels in print.

It's also possible that there are huge differences in areas we don't see. Maybe there's an amphitheatre off Diagon Alley in which there are ritualistic screaming matches, or maybe Harry assiduously ignored the heated conflicts between opposing schools of poetry -- the Modern School, which uses rhyme between lines and open meter, and the Traditionalists, who use alliteration and only three different meters and occasional in-line rhyming. Maybe Harry is just oblivious to the fact that it's polite to greet people by clapping rather than shaking hands, to how people congratulate each other with a thumb on the point of the cheek, that it's considered rude to display any sort of affection in public, that you are more or less expected to have tons of sex in the first half of your seventh year at Hogwarts, that sex shaming is a thing in the muggle world but not the magical one, and a hundred other things we could have seen. Maybe Gryffindor is the House of Muggle-wank and that insulated Harry from the inconvenience of culture shock.

But we have no evidence of this. If we extrapolate from what we do see, we come up with a magical Britain that's a mishmash of Muggle British culture from 1800 to 1960 with a patina of magic and a lack of technology. That's the metric I'd use for predicting what future Potterverse canon will be like.

On the other hand, if you want to make a canon-compatible fic, you can easily create these cultural differences, with a couple lines to explain why they don't appear in canon. If you don't care about being canon-compatible, you can add any cultural differences you like.

We don't really see any defencive magic that would stand up to a bullet. The Protego charm deflects magic, but we don't see it blocking physical projectiles. We don't really see any other shields. The only attested defence that's reliable and usable in battle is a fast retreat, but nobody has the reflexes to Disapparate out of the path of a bullet. (Also Disillusionment, but perhaps infrared cameras would be a reasonable counter. Enquiring minds want to know.)

We don't see much magic at all that can kill efficiently. The best we see is Fiendfyre, which is very difficult to control -- it costs you one mage and destroys an area of unknown size. Aside from that, it's not exactly all single-target spells, but it is pretty limited. A bludgeoning or cutting spell might be able to affect two or three people. The Killing Curse isn't that much better than a pistol. (Plus, what do you do with an ally who's dead? Drink to them. What do you to with an ally who's wounded? Evacuate them, brew potions to heal them, bandage them, remove bullets, etc. That spends a lot more resources than a death.)

We don't see magic working at long range, generally. People duel or battle at a range of thirty metres or less. US Marines, by comparison, must qualify with a rifle by hitting human-sized targets at 200 to 500 yards.

So with actual battles, it's entirely up to the writer. /Emperor/ made it so that many mages could have as much impact on the battlefield as an artillery battery but with tons more mobility and flexibility, for instance. /Old Soldiers Never Die/ had much more limited magic by comparison (though it didn't remove or reduce anything from canon), and a few squads of experienced squib soldiers with some air support were capable of destroying the Death Eaters.

Terrorism is a lot harder. But you rarely beat terrorists at warfare. Instead, you employ politics or police, depending on the size of the terrorist force.

Which may have been intrinsic to the horcrux ritual itself. You need to murder someone for each piece of armour you create, and it rips your soul in two. I don't think I would recommend that for my army. Maybe I could designate one person to make a horcrux out of the walls of my city, then keep them under the Draught of the Living Death forever...

Voldemort applied those techniques to half a dozen objects but didn't produce armour for himself, much less his followers. No one else appears to have armour that's even vaguely useful. From that I can conclude it's difficult, expensive, or time-consuming to produce objects with that sort of protection, even if it's not intrinsic to horcrux creation.

I can decide, for a story that I write that has canon-compatible magic, that portkeys can only transport people and their effects. And in that case, if attrition is a problem (in a society of ten thousand, where your opponent has sixty million, attrition is definitely a problem), portkeying in a combatant to throw a grenade is risky.

** "Muggle wank" is anything that doesn't make muggles look like helpless, bumbling retards, apparently. The most common answer I'm seeing is "anything that invents a situation where magic is not useful", without realizing that in virtually every scenario given here, they've constructed entirely implausible scenarios in which it's supremely powerful.

Look at what's in this thread. Giants tougher than tanks. A muggle-wizard war with no defectors of any kind on either side. Equating magical firepower with muggle firepower (no understanding of muggle military technology at all). Extremely simplistic understanding of espionage and internal security. Ignoring the massive population gap.

There is a very good reason the magical world wants to stay hidden. They have the resources available to them to prevent serious leaks and to manipulate muggle institutions /as long as they keep their heads down/.

** So...wow. I seem to have sparked a debate. First off, let's assume that no, magical creatures that aren't Dementors aren't intangible to physical damage, okay? Second of all, we are not talking about war. We're talking about a task force made to respond to these kind of threats, similar to what the third trailer implies the film Suicide Squad will be, but with training.

Here's my new extra question. Will Fred and George's shield gloves and such work for Muggles? It's all but stated that they work the same for people who can't cast a decent shield charm and people who are excellent at it.

*** magic items can curse muggles so I would say, unless they need activation through a wand tap or spell, that muggles can be protected by charmed magic items.

That being said there are just so many knock on effects. You're already effectively throwing out the Statute of Secrecy even if only for a few. Do they get their mind wiped (voluntary or no)? It may not seem the same but the Muggle Protection Act I believe would cover items that are cursed outright, innocuous seeming but pranked like regurgitating toilets, as well as items that would enhance their life (like enhanced cars) or life expectancy. and so on.

Do as you wish, but I would say it is one thing for the muggle Prime Minister to be a bit of a Bulldog and retain his right t to protect his citizens- ie. form a task force of agents/military/ spotters etc. and have a joint wizard-muggle task force (or magically enhanced task force). If the good wizards are breaking the law and not only 'allowing', but effectively aiding the muggles into becoming a weapon against other wizards (Death Eaters though they be) or magical creatures then that is the Ministry breaking what it was literally formed to do (enforce the Statute) and then there is the ICW that might not take kindly to it either. Regardless I would expect any equipping of muggles would lead to many more deaths via Death Eater retaliation. In other words I think having a force that helps muggles flee and tries to protect them as they do (from 'tornadoes'- giants, dementors, inferi etc.) would probably be more effective than bringing warfare to the wizards and their creatures. Just my two cents.

Not because they're threatening them or in the interest of cooperation, no. But because most wizards won't see the harm. Think about it. In HP6, during the meeting with the Muggle Prime Minister, Rufus Scrimgeour treats him like a child. I mean, this is the man who was the head of the security division for their whole country, and he sees the leader of the Muggles as a child. And it'll be worse when Fudge is in charge.

They will have help from some wizards, those like Mr. Weasley who don't think Muggles are basically children playing with what they don't understand, but much of it they're going to have to do on their own.

** A couple of ides to consider:

- Will this taskforce have muggleborn on their side? Given that this takes place in book 6 with Voldemort in the open I can see how many muggleborns would be willing to help. In that case they immediately have an enormous boost now that they also have access to magic, a lot of the cheaper "muggle-repelling"-bullshit would be immediately neutralized.

- Less "snipers", more bombs. Our modern military greatest weapons are not singular soldiers with a gun, but massive amount of explosives that rain down from the sky. Would bombs or drones even register to a defensive ward or would they be mistaken as simply an object?

Remember that canon has flat-out no rules on what would or would not work. Even statements like "only a patronus can stop a dementor" was said by ignorant wizards who never even tried dousing them in napalm. I see no reason why an assault helicopter couldn't just decimate almost every single magical creature, like WTF is a dragon going to against a gunship??

*** From everything we've seen from the shield charm, it seems to be highly unlikely that it stops a rigidly defined set of things. Rather it seems to stop (or attempt to stop) anything that would cause harm to the caster or that the caster wants to stop. I.e. it protects.

I actually think snipers are the biggest advantage Muggles have. Bombs I feel will be completely useless. Fire and kinetic force are well within the class of things wizards have comfortable control over and can stop with ease. The best way - the only way, really - for a Muggle to best a wizard is for the wizard to not realise he's under attack until it's too late. This also requires the wizard be outside his protective enchantments though, so it might be tough finding them to shoot them in the first place.

Shield charm seems to be a standard protection on any permanent place of residence, if we judge by the standard protections used by Harry, Ron and Hermione on their camp sites on DH. So protections seem to be in place as standard.

But I doubt it would ever come to that. You still have the problem of not knowing where to fire your missile. Actually, that understates the problem, because it's not just direct knowledge of the location that's blocked but rather any kind of mapping, which presumably includes mapping by landmarks. I.e. "next to the lake" is still a form of mapping so cannot be done if the thing is under an unplottable charm.

I'm not sure that it makes a difference. Do we think that the shield charm blocks bullets by creating an equal and opposite force under the rules of physics? Or do we think that the shield charm stops bullets by completely ignoring the physics of kinetic motion and simply saying "these things are stopped"? I opt for the latter: if you go for the former, then some back of a beer mat calculations end up with a wizard having more energy at their disposal than every nuclear bomb ever built combined. If you want to go down that route if anything it just leads to an even greater wizard dominance.

If we're going for the latter and saying that shields ignore the laws of physics and work instead under the laws of magic, then adding more kinetic energy wouldn't seem to pose any more of a threat. Magic has complete dominion over physics (JKR: "broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature") and kinetic energy doesn't seem to be a physical concept with a counterpart in magical law (unlike time and space). Shield charms are by no means unlimited, but their limits are magical, not physical.

Basically what I'm asking is if someone shined a laser pointer at the target location and the missile tracked the laser pointer would the charms to prevent knowledge of a location prevent the missile from tracking?

And in regards to shield charms, even if there is no problem with increasing KE I still think that there would be a psychological difference between small arms and cannons. That might be enough to cause a shield charm to fail if the caster is 100% sure his magic will stop the damage. And one slip might lead to further slips by other wizards who suddenly are not as sure of their invulnerability anymore. But that is probably a minor effect.

I disagree. There is no real evidence that "technology" (what does that even mean?? electricity??) stops working by merely being around magic. In fact there is evidence to the contrary:

- Charring Cross Road is completely unaffected by the presence of the biggest hot spot of magic in all of Britain.
- Neither is the rest of Grimmauld place, nor are the Dursley's appliances influenced by Harry living there. Their TV and phone work just fine even after many years.
- Arthur Weasley manged to put several charms on a car that never once impacted its ability to drive.
- ...

There could be spells that are specifically designed to interact with certain technology sure, and there is definitely a cultural tradition of not using the more modern muggle items until years later (what is a "Wizarding Wireless" if not a radio??) but there is no evidence that "technology breaks down in the face of magic".

Unplottability is interesting, but I don't think it's quite as strong as you make it out to be. For example, Hogwarts is under an unplottable charm, but its location relative to Hogsmeade, the lake, or other places is regularly discussed.

This doesn't really fit with what we see in canon regarding how magic interacts with physics. For example, the levitation charm is described as becoming more difficult with increasing mass, and the summoning charm with increasing distance. There's presumably a reason why the first year students start out levitating a feather, and are unable to levitate buildings or mountains.

If we follow the same line of reasoning and apply it to the shield charm, it would make sense for it also become more difficult to shield against stronger physical forces. An average student might be able to shield against bullets or small banished objects, but they would be less likely to be able to shield against a Hellfire missile. Dumbledore on the other hand might be able to handle virtually anything short of a nuke, especially with the Elder Wand.

There's presumably a reason why the first year students start out levitating a feather, and are unable to levitate buildings or mountains.
#+end_quote

Disagree. The levitation charm is never described as having difficulty relative to mass. Indeed, on the same day as he first learnt the charm, before he had properly learnt how to do it on feathers, Ron levitated a troll club.

The summoning charm is affected by distance because distance is part of magical law, not because the magic is struggling to overcome physics. Snape told us so in OotP: "time and space matter in magic". That is, they have a role in magical law separate from physical law.

Mass doesn't seem to be similarly featured in magical law. Rather, volume seems to be a much more operative concept (perhaps by virtue of space). For example, the first transfiguration students ever attempt keeps volume, not mass, constant. The upper limit of what people can transfigure is described in GoF by Hermione by reference to size not mass (dragon-sized being borderline possible).

From what I remember, transfiguration always seemed to have difficulty that was a function of the degree of difference between objects, whether that was mass, volume, or other characteristics such as living versus non-living. We see all of these factors change at various times, so I don't think there's any reason why volume would be more important than mass. For example, Malfoy the amazing bouncing ferret clearly changed in both mass and volume.

Book of Spells is not canon. It's a video game that, like the movies, JKR contributed to but didn't control 100% or write 100%. There's no way to tell which parts of it are authoritative and which parts are not.

And even if it is written by JKR, it's not clear that she would be meaning "mass" in the strict sense understood by physics. She's not scientifically inclined. She could easily be using it loosely to mean size - "a massive object" is commonly used to mean big rather than having a large mass, for example.

He states it in general terms "in magic" not limited to legilimency. Not sure what your point is about him not mentioning mass or energy, as I never claimed he did. Indeed it's the absence of mass which I am claiming - in the absence of any real indication that mass is a factor, we need clear evidence that it is to suggest it is a part of magical law like distance and time.

There are two separate categories of factors which seem to affect the difficulty of a transfiguration.

Firstly you have the ones you identified: the relative factors i.e. the similarity of the antecedent and resultant objects. The more similar the easier, and the magic takes some pretty interesting things into account, such as similarity in name - beetles are apparently easy to transfigure into buttons, guinea fowl into guinea pigs (indeed, this kind of wacky, completely unphysical way of working is one of the main reasons why I'm so against incorporating too many physical ideas into magic, as it clearly doesn't work that way). There isn't really any evidence that mass is a factor in transfiguration difficulty in terms of relative factors.

Secondly you have "absolute" factors which seem to affect a transfiguration independently of similarity. Bigger objects are harder to transfigure than smaller ones, no matter how similar the two objects are, for example (if we can trust Hermione in GoF). And transfiguring multiple objects simultaneously seems to be more difficult than transfiguring one object at a time - we see Dumbledore do the former, so we know it's possible, but the students always seem to practice with single objects, implying that's easier. But again, mass doesn't seem to enter into things here.

The difficulty here is that we have no example or case where mass alone changes. It's always accompanied by some other change in composition, shape, or structure. Even if you transfigured a rock into a rock with less mass, it would presumably still have to either shrink in volume, or alter its inner composition to account for the reduction in density. Given how time, space, and volume seem to have an effect on magic, I think the real question is why we would expect mass not to have an effect? It's a fundamental property of the universe just like the other properties that require magical "work" to change, so why would we expect mass to be any different?

The thing is, JKR supposedly approved the movies too, and was said to have provided all the spells that appeared in them. And yet the movies contradict the books all over the place and often the spells are different (e.g. flipendo vs depulso as the banishing charm).

My general approach to canon is that it has to be both written by JKR AND a published work. So, for example, the script of Cursed Child will be canon as it is written by JKR and published, but the play itself will not be, even though approved by JKR, because it is not published and not entirely JKR's work.

Re: feathers. I always thought that was because feathers are associated with flight. I mean, the spell even has "wingardium" in it. (I sometimes wonder if JKR originally planned for the levitation charm to be like locomotor where the incantation changed depending on the object, keeping the "leviosa" part constant).

Even with that aside though, feathers are small in size as well as mass, so it doesn't really resolve anything between them.

It's never stated. Very few things are ever stated in the HP books. But what is stated is that in transfiguration they start with the easiest transfigurations and move up towards the more advanced ones (which McGonagall says when she talks about invertebrate vs vertebrate vanishing). So I think it's safe to assume that beetle -> button and guinea fowl into guinea pigs were chosen because they were considered easy transfigurations.

Incidentally, visualisation is never stated to be a part of transfiguration in canon. It's one of those fanon ideas that somehow caught on (unfortunately).

I think we think about these things very differently. Time and space matter in magic, but they matter because they form a part of magical theory rather than because they're a part of the physical world. It's pure accident that they also happen to be important in physics. And actually, it's extremely likely that we're not even talking about the same thing here - "time" as understood by wizards is likely a very different thing than "time" as understood by Muggle physics. The same for space, and probably even volume (there's a reason why I've been saying "size" rather than "volume", as I think it's more the sense of size than the strict mathematical volume that counts).

Given those considerations, you can see why I would see no reason to assume that mass is a part of magical law. I mean, even within Muggle physics "mass" has different meanings (i.e. Newtonian mass vs relativistic mass have been argued to be so different as to be almost entirely separate concepts). So even if mass was a part of magical law, I would expect, like the others, that it was a different concept that shared the same name.

Perhaps this is just my headcanon speaking here, but I tend to interpret things in a way that lines up a bit better with physics. To me, it just makes sense that there would be some correlation between the work required to do something physically and the degree of magical difficulty. One of the big issues I have with the books in general is their lack of clarity on this subject. Perhaps I'll eventually get around to writing some fanfiction myself, and go to the effort of making a more physics-consistent set of rules.

Theory number 2: As the shield is active spell, big enough amount of bullets would increase the difficulty of keeping it on beyond manageable level. Theory number 3: The shield symbolises protection, but not the impenetrable protection, meaning that it can be broken by a mere nature of spell.

I would reject the third theory here, because that requires creating specific flaws in the spell that was shown to be rather universal and powerful when used by skilled wizard. And with the theory number two, the shield would be useless if it happened quickly. So it probably should be at the very least significantly more durable than police shields. And its longevity would increase along with skill of the wizard. Of course we know that not everybody can cast shields, but the people who are likely to end as targets probably can.

And there are many other differences between those shields to make comparison moot.

I personally think that between disillusion, muggle-wards and mind control spells, muggles need wizard support in any actual conflict once exposed or the prime minister, who's under wizard surveillance in canon, won't even remember there is a thing like magic.

That said, muggle weapons should be quite effective. If a magic creature with pure physical attacks is an actual threat to wizards, then that means wizard shield spells cannot be that effective against firearms, or no creature would be any problem.

Further, the idea that a giant can withstand weapons meant to push through heavy armor is kind of odd, given that a troll was easily defeated by dropping a tree trunk on it. I'd say a single RPG will wreck any magical creature it hits at center mass or so, provided it's armor-piercing.

Except that the creatures are magical, not purely physical. There are so many examples in canon of having magic affecting the significance of apparently physical actions.

Making a potion, for example, looks to be purely physical. You put in the ingredients, you stir, etc. And yet the mere fact that a magical person rather than a Muggle is doing it changes things. There's some kind of magic in the physical movements, because when a wizard does it they get a potion, but if a Muggle did it they'd get sludge at best.

We know magical creatures are imbued with all sorts of magic, and especially their hides are often highly magical. When they come up against a wizard it's magic vs magic at work, not physical strength vs magic.

Would that be the same with people?? meaning the only difference between a Muggle and a Squib is that the Squib Grew up around magic and it has left traces on/in them.

********* I agree with half of your statement.

Yes, the vast majority of wizards are kinda useless. If they found themselves face to face with a Muggle with a gun and didn't own any kind of protective enchanted item they would be fucked. But in a way those people don't matter, because a single Auror-level wizard is probably enough to take down the entire Muggle government. The rest of the magical world can hide behind the skirts of their betters.

However, shields do not have to be actively maintained. They can be cast and then left by their caster who goes on to do other stuff. We see this with the campsite in DH, Flitwick's shield charm over Hogwarts, and then Harry's shield charm across the Great Hall in his final duel.

  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening. This is the reason that (...) Bill Weasley is irreversibly scarred after his meeting with Fenrir Greyback.

***** How long does the Imperius take to wear off? What's the range on it? What sort of control do you get with it, exactly? It can't be all that awesome if Voldemort didn't win within a couple weeks with it.

We see Potter use it as an improved Confundus charm, and it lasted a minute. He also used it to exert control over one person's actions, and it lasted at least twenty seconds. Crouch Jr used it on a bunch of schoolchildren and they each seemed to recover within a minute.

Using those observations, I could come up with limits: the Imperius curse can ephemerally alter someone's beliefs to a small extent ("I believe that I've already seen that Bellatrix Lestrange's identification is in order" as an example), and that will last a few minutes. It can seize control of another's behaviour, and that can be sustained with concentration at a range up to twenty metres. (A bit lacklustre for an Unforgivable Curse, but by comparison, the Killing Curse just kills one person painlessly, which is a bit paltry.)

In this scenario, the Imperius Curse would add a small measure of safety and cost a lot of time. That time allows military officers to notice and implement safeguards -- the simplest of which is to stay on the move, not informing people of where they will be.

In your fics, the Imperius Curse might be much more effective, and then you would need to explain why the wizarding world isn't a hell of Imperius'd thralls. Or perhaps in your writing, the Imperius is supremely effective against Muggles but not nearly as strong against mages and squibs. Perhaps in my writing, the Imperius seizes control of a person through their magic, making muggles immune.

I've written one story in which muggles don't have souls, and that means it takes specialised spells to observe their thoughts and alter their memories and so forth. The idea isn't quite canon-friendly -- Dementors affect muggles in canon, so reconciling the idea would require a fair bit of extra work -- but it would suggest that the Imperius Curse doesn't affect them in that story.

Okay, there is no excuse for Voldemort not ruling Britain within three hours of learning the Imperius curse. I cannot write a sensible story in which the curse has the powers it does in canon because /every/ nation would be in the thrall of a succession of dark lords, with only brief and violent interruptions when key Imperius-casters die. And that's simply not fun to write about.

But, since it seems that magic powers come with debilitating stupidity, I'll hold out hope for the muggles yet.

I think you see my point though, that muggles who have no defense against magic pose not threat to wizards on scale. A muggle can kill a wizard, but if muggles try to organize against them they'll fall apart on first contact through a combination of veritaserum confundus, legilimency, imperious, and anything else really. Which is why from my point of view any fic that tries to make muggles and technology a solution is muggle wank and I close the tab.

It took years for Crouch the Younger to develop a resistance. Crouch the Elder, in his old age, lost his mind after eight-ish months, but he might have developed a resistance. Harry Potter was unusual for being able to resist. You'd be stupid to rely solely on the curse, but you could take over in a few days with it and then work out a more permanent solution at your leisure. Possibly based on the Goblet of Fire, since it can bind people without their consent.

I can control two people. I control you and order you to control two others. I control another person and order them to control two others. Everyone's commanded to obey me.

Nobody controls more than two people, but I indirectly control the whole world.

Unless you think the curse has a builtin limit that no more than X people in the whole world can be affected by the curse simultaneously, so I can't use it if a few people in Madagascar were a bit enthusiastic about using the Imperius. That would be /original/, but it also seems artificial.

The Imperius scales outrageously well in the magical world because it chains. (Malfoy enthralled Rosmerta, who enthralled Bell.) It doesn't do that with muggles.

Riddle didn't take advantage of its ability to chain and only managed to enthrall a handful of key Ministry officials. There were plenty of people left to oppose him. We would see the same thing happening if everyone capable of using a wand used the Imperius curse on muggles in united purpose.

** Honestly, muggle vs wizard confrontations are basically magic vs infrastructure & tech. With the right numbers, you can, in fact, fight a magical force and nuke whatever you cannot. It'd just be ridiculously expensive doing so. Same vice-versa. You can, with a wand, stop an army. The problem is the amount of time you have to spend learning how to do so.

In short, the fight would be long & arduous for both sides. Every single senior officer would be walking around with a bomb collar set to go off when mental tampering is detected. Wizards & Witches would abandon broom-riding almost entirely as AA guns lie in wait.

It's all very dramatic and not-serious as neither side cares enough for the other to engage in direct conflict. Material and logistical support though? That's another story.

People scream muggle wank when you say that a muggle with a pistol can kill a wizard. Or two. Or three. You hear 'lalala impervious bullshit' every time that comes up. Fair enough, maybe a spell designed to keep clothing from getting wet in the rain would work as a shield, but it doesn't take another variable into account-what if a wizard used a gun? What if the bullets were hollow point ones with the hollow point being fitted with an undetectable expansion charm and stuffed with unstable 'Neville Special' potions that had all the effects on their targets?

The idea of wizards wielding muggle weapons isn't really ever properly examined. Bog-standard guns wouldn't remain bog-standard guns for long, that's for sure. So maybe that's the way to go-a blend of both.

Maybe have that going instead? Use the task force as a training batallion designed to equip muggleborn and muggle-raised half-bloods with the knowledge to turn muggle weapons into magical muggle weapons and go out to fight with them. Over time, both sides learn what works and what doesn't.

And that's the end of the argument. Neither side is superior and neither side cares about the other-which is ideal, really. Everyone expects a short, sharp victory, but the reality is that both sides are human and if there's one thing that humans are ridiculously good at it's surprising and killing the fuck out of other humans. So go ahead and make it happen. If anyone gives you trouble over it, just go 'hey, write your own' in response.
