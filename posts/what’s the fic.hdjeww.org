#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger is not your typical muggleborn student. First off, her first day in the wizarding world finds her catching the attention of one Lucius Malfoy who makes a split second decision to take her under his wing and educate her on all things wizarding world. Second off, she ends up being sorted into Slytherin House, which is notorious for its pureblood mania. As soon as she's sorted into Slytherin, the entire rest of the school is against her, as nobody cares if she's a muggleborn or not, she's a Slytherin so she must be evil. One of the rules of Slytherin House is to present a united front, so Hermione is immediately defended against the other three houses and accepted into Draco Malfoy and his first year friend group. Follow Hermione Granger through her years as a Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.
