Basically, before his death, Albus visits Nurmengard Castle to visit Gellert Grindlewald and tells him of his upcoming demise.

He also tells Gellert about Voldemort's Horcruxes and his guilt over nearly leading Harry to his death before the Horcrux within him was removed by the Dementor on the train in his 3rd year. Harry grew more powerful as a result without losing his Parselmouth ability as well becoming healthier and more active in his studies but it is still not enough as Albus' was too much of a coward to tell him about the prophecy and wanting to let him have as normal a school experience as possible.

Another of many the mistakes on his part regarding Harry which he feels guilty about not trying to prepare the young man sooner. He plans to use this year to train Harry himself along with continuing their investigations into Voldemort's past to identify and destroy Tom's Horcruxes. But Albus' realized that this wouldn't be enough and that someone will have to prepare Harry for his eventual destined battle with Voldemort. And who better than the only other wizard with comparable magical knowledge and prowess to Albus.

Albus convinces Gellert to take up his task to prepare Harry to face his destiny. Gellert agrees and they facilitate a means for him to escape to be triggered upon Albus' death. When Albus dies, the plan is enabled and Gellert escapes with everyone thinking he died. Gellert then goes out to seek Harry to pick up were his old friend left off and train Harry to fight Voldemort while also helping deal with the Horcruxes.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), is basically that, although the ensuing chaos is probably a lot bigger than most readers expect.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.
