** Dumbledore - a man who was overcome with grief in his past and was ultimately very lonely. Wanted to believe that people like Snape and Draco could chang because he needed to believe that he had truly changed from who he was. Obviously very powerful, and like Harry, believes the world is on his shoulders. Willing to do things that make him unpopular for what he believes is "right." I look at him with fondness.

Snape - A man who spent his teenage years being bullied, but also wasn't an innocent victim. He clearly had feelings for Lily, but I don't believe him to be a good person. I think his treatment of the students proved that he wasn't caring, he was a bitter person, who did one really risky thing in spying for the order. But it was selfish, he did it because his love was killed. I honestly think it Neville had been the Chosen One, and Lily and James went into hiding and weren't being attacked, Serverus would've stayed a loyal Death Eater. Ultimately, I respect the risk he took, but he's a POS in my eyes.

Sirius - it was clear that he was a bully to Snape, but he also did not have a happy childhood and upbringing. Despite being a bully, whatever bad karma he accured from that was paid 10 times over by going to Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit. I think despite his past, he clearly wanted to be better than he was, and some of the things he said prove that, for instance: "We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are." Unlike Snape, I think Sirius ultimately was a good person, who struggled with moments of darkness, particularly when he was young and had a more black/white view of the world.

Draco - The one I'm least sure of, for starters, he is a total spoiled rich kid. Anybody who says "my father will hear about this" is not somebody I'd personally want to hang out with. Clearly, he did believe in the pureblood ideology, and we can argue about the impact his parents would've had on that. But when it came down to actually doing bad things, he didn't have the stomach for it, but he still did terrible things, knowing they would cause actual physical harm. Once confronted with the ideology he "supported" he saw the effects of it, and he didn't like what he saw. However, he definitely deserved to be punished for the actions that he undertook in getting to that stage. Overally, he's an unpleasant person in my eyes, but not evil, just a rich twat.

*** There is nothing in Snape's memories to indicate he had any problems being a Death Eater until Lily was threatened. He would likely have gladly killed James on the spot if he had the chance with his mask on.

In his memories even Lily knew that he was already planning on joining Voldemort even before his worst memory.

When he betrayed Voldemort because he targeted Lily Dumbledore looked on him with disgust. He only agreed to swear to protect Harry because Dumbledore "coldly" twisted him into it.

** - Dumbledore: I /hate/ that all of his character-exploration is post mortem. I think that a "Harry's Wise Old Wizard gets his pedestal slowly broken and then rebuilt just in time for said Wise Old Wizard to pass on the mantle" storyline would have been great - he makes mistakes, he's had a shady past, but ultimately he's still working towards the same thing Harry is.

- Snape: Didn't deserve to have Harry name his kid after him - he was just too unlikeable as a person. The man bullied, belittled and antagonized Harry&Co at literally every turn out of a petty grudge with Harry's /dead/ father, a last minute "oh, by the way, I totally wanted your mum" does not redeem that.

- Draco: Deserves a stint in Azkaban, frankly. No, running away at the last minute does not excuse the repeat attempts at murder, being an accessory to multiple kidnappings, helping an unrepentant bitch torture children, et cetera. Doesn't help that literally everything Draco did before that was "be a bully and a wannabe Death Eater".

- Sirius Black: Fundamentally a good person (at least, as an adult - he was a little shit in his Hogwarts years), but frankly the man needs therapy - which he's not going to get due to being a wanted criminal up until his death. I think if Harry wasn't a teen, his response to Sirius's offer to take him in should have been "Okay, but the moment we get your name cleared you're going to St. Mungo's first."

**** I'm not claiming Dumbledore is a saint. In fact, I outright state I would have loved to see more conflict around his character, with Dumbledore being on the wrong end of it, before he died - the books never really do that. The books treat him as nigh-infallible until he dies, and /only then/ does all this stuff about him come to light - too late for maximum story-juice.

Snape, meanwhile, /started out as a hate-sink/ (which was deliberate on J.K. Rowling's part) and then got an explanation post-mortem - which is treated as a redemption in-story, but to me it doesn't really /work/ as one. Nothing he does before then even hints at the redemption potential, and the moment itself still shows him in a pretty bad light.

Frankly, I think they have the exact same problem, /as characters in a story/ - too little character exploration, too late for it to really matter. It just... Kinda goes in different directions.

EDIT: I have never worked this hard in my life to get one-and-a-half paragraph of writing to sound right with what's in my head, and I still feel like I haven't done that good a job of it.

** They're all often less adroitly used in fandom than they could be.

Dumbledore heavily interests me and is probably the only character besides Luna that I'd actually like to meet and get to know. The juxtaposition of power/self-confidence and guilt is fascinating and exploring the contradictions of being the only one who can do things and being utterly terrified of having power is definitely something I'm musing on while plotting out my initial HP fics. Like, dude probably has the /worst/ imposter syndrome, but he can't ever show it and break the reputation.

Snape bores me - as much as I sympathise, abused kid gets a light in his life then struggles when that light is extinguished and gets angry at the person who tamped it down isn't really all that interesting to me.

Draco is a shithead rich-kid racist who got in way over his head and could've been explored far more interestingly in the period of the books after he got some reality crucio-ed into him. Anyone who's seen those videos that pop up where ex-KKK or ex-Westboro types talking about how they changed their views knows how interesting that journey can be - changing your entire worldview is tough and hard work and it's thoroughly fascinating.

Giving an opinion on Sirius is complicated. He spent years in a prison surrounded by creatures that suck all your good memories out - frankly, his personality and general confusion about life are completely understandable, I'm astonished he wasn't completely broken by the time he got out - so I'm not entirely sure that who he was when Harry met him was even close to how he was pre-Azkaban and thus judging him by that might just be judging an empty shell going through the motions he only vaguely recalls. That interests me, but it makes it difficult to establish a conclusive opinion.

** Dumbledore - overworked by all the posts he hold, means well but can be patronizing (understandable when he's Dumbledore). Too soft to be a war leader as an old man but took up the mantle because he was the most capable.

Snape - unpleasant, awkward child from a bad home with bigoted beliefs grow up to be a spiteful, jealous, bullying, bigoted teenager grow up to join a genocidal group grow up to be a spiteful, jealous, bullying adult that hate and work against the leader of said genocidal group because the woman he wanted to fuck as a teenager died.

He absolutely deserved what happened to him in SWM. Not condoning any hypothetical bullying the Marauders did to him before that scene but by then Snape was hanging out with future death eaters and throwing around slurs. It's ok to take Nazis down a peg or two. I personally wouldn't do what James did but I'd be in the crowd of laughing people.

He actively chose to become a death eater. I refuse to believe the whole he was pressured by his house shit that Snape fans like to peddle. Lily singled out Mulciber and Avery and didn't say "you are always hanging with Slytherins". Even if Slytherin house was full of bigots there are degrees to bigotry. There is your aunt who believes affirmative action is stupid and clutches her purse tighter when she sees a black person. There are the fuckers that post "Well actually, if you look at the crime statistics" on the internet. Then, there are crazy people who believe black people are lower than animals (This is what Death Eaters are).

Sirius - Reckless, hot-headed, arrogant, slightly cruel teenager that tried very hard to distance himself from the bigoted beliefs he grew up with as a child. Very broken adult.

Draco - spoilt, bigoted, cowardly, arrogant child that never grew up. Has delusions of grandeur.

**** Going to ignore your spiel about affirmative action because it's completely irrelevant.

And no you don't become like the nazis by treating nazis as monsters. That's such a load of "both sides" bullshit. We need to treat the nazis like the monsters they are or else they will take every opportunity to spread their ideology and further their agenda. You can't be tolerant of an intolerant group. Imagine blaming opposition to nazis as the reason for people becoming nazis.

And there's no proof that the Marauders' bullying led Snape to be bigoted or Marauders' bullying of Mulciber and Avery led Snape to group up with them. Snape already held bigoted beliefs before he even started Hogwarts and actively sought out people who shared his ideology. I've already said even in Slytherin (where he apparently didn't have the opportunity to socialize with decent people) he could have befriended the milder bigots instead of the most violent ones. It's about taking personal responsibility for his actions. Not all bullied children joined genocidal cults. *Don't join genocidal cults just because you had a shitty childhood - it's not a high bar to clear.*

And sure, Lily was the light of Snape's life but his love for her was more sexual than pure. If his love was pure as you claim, he would have abandoned the ideology and people that considered her unworthy of existence. If as you said treating nazis with kindess worked then why the hell didn't Snape turn away from death eater ideology even though Lily remained his friend and was kind to Snape even when Snape hadn't deserve it for a while.

I don't care to argue about what happened between Snape and James Potter before fifth year because it's all headcanon. The only two scenes we saw them interact were 11 year old James trash talking Slytherin and Snape insulting James and his dad. And SWM. Surely, you can't claim that trash talk is enough to make a person join up with the death eaters. If that's true all the Russell Westbrook fans I talk shit to online would be lining up to join the KKK.

(Don't make this about me being biased against Slytherin just because I tolerate trash talk against Slytherins either. It's trash talk not purity motivated hatred. Just grow thicker skin. I took the Pottermore quiz way back and got Slytherin. Not my fault, Rowling couldn't write good Slytherins for shit and a bunch of Slytherins ended up identifying with fucking Snape of all people).

By the time of SWM, Snape was already a monster. He held bigoted beliefs and was not afraid of voicing them. And a few years later, he willingly joined a group whose goal was to eliminate/oppress a subset of people. He presented himself as an unpleasant bigoted hateful individual and therefore shouldn't be surprised when people treat him as the unpleasant bigoted hateful individual that he is.

***** However, There is proof that snape already was bigoted against muggles - he does not care that Lily says that her sister hates her, and is clearly meaning to say 'she's only a ' muggle.

This is not condoning the marauder's actions, but it is accepting that they were not the cause of snape's bigotry.

** Dumbledore: I've said before and will say again and again 'til the day I die: most of the reasons people hate and bash him are a result of people applying Watsonion logic to questions whose Doyalist answers are all either "because otherwise there wouldn't be a story," "it makes for better pacing," or "Rowling just kinda wanted it that way."

Why couldn't he figure out that Slytherin's monster was a basilisk? Because CoS is firmly a children's adventure story, so the children have to be the ones doing the bulk of the work. Why doesn't he tell Harry everything he knows about Voldemort all at once in HBP? Because it's a mystery that's meant to be gradually unraveled, and most people don't enjoy having a story stop dead so the author can exposit the entire backstory all at once. Why does he dump Harry on his abusive relatives? Because the story was about an abused boy, so /somebody/ had to leave the kid with abusers.

The first three books were mostly just whimsical fairy tales, and things like the Dursleys' abuse weren't /meant/ to be taken seriously, which is fine in that context, and decidedly /not/ fine when it becomes an increasingly grim and gritty war drama, where actions have consequences and child abuse matters. People judge the actions that Dumbledore took to facilitate the fairy tale that Harry Potter initially was by the standards of the surprisingly dark coming of age story it became, and while I understand why, I can't pretend I don't find it /very/ tiresome.

Snape: I'm pretty sure this is a controversial take, but I honestly think that Snape is irredeemable trash /not/ because of his history as a Death Eater, but because of how he spent his life after defecting: he was a lonely child who was radicalised and subsequently joined a hate group/murder cult. Obviously, /nothing/ excuses joining up with a terrorist group that hunts people for sport, and he is entirely responsible for his doing so, but I can genuinely sympathise with the suffering that led to his doing so. Relaying the prophecy to Voldemort, not caring in the slightest that he's endangered a literal infant in doing so, attempting to barter for the life of a woman he claims to love with the lives of her husband and son, wallowing in self pity after her death, and abusing her son while acting as though he's worse off for her death than said son utterly destroys that sympathy, though.

Malfoy: I don't remotely understand why the fandom finds him compelling, or at least sympathetic: he's a bigoted and cruel bully who bandies about his inherited power with impunity until Voldemort comes along to inform him that there are people who are outside the scope of that power and unwilling to put up with his shit. The only thing that keeps him from being a completely one note wannabe villain is the fact that he's not willing to personally and directly inflict violence on others. I honestly think his breakdown in HBP is more cathartic than tragic.

Sirius: he's a much better exploration of a "dubious good guy" than Snape, /do not @ me./ Like Snape, he's an abuser with a checkered past, but unlike Snape, I can call him a decent human being without willfully ignoring 95% of his screentime, and the retroactive exploration of just how awful he was to Kreacher in OotP and DH, for my money, is way more effective, simply because Sirius' hatred of Kreacher stems from the latter's words and actions (not that it excuses Sirius abusing his slave), not from an unrelated grudge (against a man who bullied him in high school but who also saved his life) which you'd think would've been satisfied by indirect murder.

Draco - repulsive neo-nazi asshole. Irl this kid would be a school shooter, or otherwise a far-right goon.

Snape - same as Draco but with the added incel touch. He helped save the world, true, but his motivations and personality--all wrong.

Dumbledore: One of the world's most powerful wizards. He isn't infallible and drops the ball sometimes. I do like a good manipulative!Dumbledore though.

Snape: An unrepentant bully.

Draco: A spoiled brat. He ended up in Slytherin due to process of elimination: he's not brave enough for Gryffindor, not hardworking enough for Hufflepuff, too stupid for Ravenclaw. He's not that cunning, either, but he is ambitious.

** Dumbledore - Doesn't really live up to the hype of him being able to do anything that is built around him. Is someone who wants a better world but doesn't actually know how it would be done , and is also too secretive for his own good . But in the end I think he's a good person ( if too manipulative ) who at this point is both too old to really deal with most of what is happening in the series ( he is 110 in harrys first year , my 87 year old grand father spends most of his time sleeping or sitting , not running around dealing with resurrected dark lords)

Snape - the movie snape is actually a person I actually like considering most of his interactions with Harry seem more professional and like if he was actually his teacher , not to mention how many times he helps Harry just because, not to mention his always calm and cool demeanor . He also doesn't really do very many bad things in the movies mostly just being snarky or annoying towards the trio . Book snape however is just a straight asshole. He goes out of his way to antagonise the trio , straight out bullies them , sabotaged their studies , is alway raving about his hate for harry and only helps harry because of his obsession with lily and his debt towards James.

Sirius - Essentially he was as a child the jock bully although he did apparently grow up considering he became friends with lily who hates that kind of person . He had a unpleasant childhood being the black sheep of the family and that combined with his long stay in azkaban has caused him to be very mentally ill ( although he doesn't show it as much ) , even so he still tries to be there for harry .

Draco - the guy is a coward . The thing about draco is that he was never good , he never regretted being bigoted or elitist in fact he was perfectly happy being these things the only thing he seemed to regret was siding with voldemort and that was only when he saw the punishments for failing him , heck at the battle of hogwarts he still went to Voldemorts side because he was too cowardly to make a stand against him . He only sabotaged Voldemorts search efforts because of hesitation on whether or not he wanted to support Voldemort after everything he'd seen him do.

**** His constant sniping at Snape implies that he didn't really mature though, and I get the impression that the biggest reason he wasn't as bad as Snape towards children was mostly a result of not really being close to them. How would he have treated Slytherins as a teacher?

That being said, I think canon events was harsh enough on him as-is though, he deserved way better than being thrown into Hell on Earth for over a decade. He never really got to become his own person in the end. I don't like him, probably because I read a lot of Snape fics and like ones where he becomes a better person during Marauder-era, a time where Sirius was very much a jack-ass and bully.

***** I think when you look at some of the lines he said to Harry, you can see that Sirius always /wanted/ to be better, and sometimes struggled when he was confronted with somebody like Snape.

Just a few:

"We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are."

"If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals."

"The world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters."

"Well, bad times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others."

Sometimes he didn't live up to the ideal, but I think he was a good person who struggled with his own demons and didn't always win.

***** Kind of a big jump to make about Sirius' character, isn't it? To assume that he wasn't as bad towards children like Snape was only because he didn't get the chance to be around many children?

It's not hard to be nice towards children. Sirius was able to show kindness and praise to Harry Ron and Hermione and appreciate and recognize their efforts after being locked up in Azkaban for 12 years - away from all kids AND adults. Snape couldn't even be civil towards kids despite being around hundreds of them for 12 years.

The actual line is "you're less like your father than I thought." Which, while mean, tells us he saw a difference between the two.

And narration tells us Snape criticized everyone except Draco the 1st potions class. Irrelevant, but I was always under the impression that while he let Slytherins get away with everything he wasn't particularly fond of anyone except Draco.

******* Okay since you changed your reply, I'll reply to this too. Sirius is nice to everyone who isn't an asshole to him. He's nice to Hermione and Ron too, he's nice to all the Weasleys as well because he knows how to act as a human despite being locked away for so long. We only see him being nice to the people he knows because they're the only ones we saw him interact with (he wasn't allowed to be seen). If he interacted with more people, he would have treated them better than Snape still.

Not sure what point you're trying to make by making the second comment about Sirius. Yes he lived in isolation and was trying to live vicariously through Harry as a coping mechanism, Hermione already said this in the books. What does this have to do with Snape?

I compared this to how Snape wasn't cruel to Slytherins, which I see as the same thing really, just opposing sides.

Even then, he would not be as bad as Snape because Snape hated everyone who wasn't a Slytherin for no reason. He favoured the Slytherins, yes, because it was his own house, I'm sure other Heads favoured their own houses too. The difference is, Snape treated his favoured house with some civility. Everyone else he treated like trash and bullied and humiliated for no reason except that he didn't like them. No matter what you say, this type of behaviour from a teacher is inexcusable.

Both Sirius and Snape is still taking potshots at each other constantly while in the same room with each other, which is a major sign of a lack of maturity on both parts.

In OotP, while Sirius aggressively asks Snape why Dumbledore can't teach Harry, it's Snape who takes the first jab : "I'm rather in a hurry Black...unlike you I don't have unlimited leisure time."

Sirius threatens him with "if you give Harry a hard time, you'll have to answer to me"

** I hate snape since he really is a horrible human being. He takes out his frustration on Harry when he was 11 years old because he didn't like his dad. He openly favors and protects the bullies in his house letting them get away with anything. He was obsessed with Lily and was happy to let Voldemort kill the woman he claims to love's husband and child as long as she was alive.

Sirius is flawed greatly. He is the epitome of “if you don't agree with me then your my enemy.” Ultimately I feel like he isn't a bad person, he just never truly had a chance to grow as a person nor did he ever have a chance as a kid to learn morals. It's hard to say about Sirius further than that though because he was in Azkaban for so long and while he said that his knowledge of his innocence let him remain sane, I think it only let him remain partially sane.

Draco was a kid following in his fathers footsteps who idolized his dad. When I was younger, my whole family supported one political party. I agreed with them on a lot of stuff that I don't now simply because back then, it was what I heard from my family and what I grew up around. It's hard to say how willing draco was to take the mark but I think he was well aware of the consequences he'd face for failure. I can't say he's a good person and I hate the fics that make him out to be a good person with no good redemption arc where he realizes he's wrong and tries to change simply because regardless of whether or not he was a kid listening to his dad and was raised like that, he is still ultimately responsible for himself.

Dumbledore is a character that I really do like. He was full of himself as a kid like many geniuses are and constantly hearing his praises being sung didn't help that. Then he met someone as talented as him who agreed with a lot of his beliefs. Over time he began to realize the consequences of what his plans were and distanced himself from them. When he became the chief warlock/supreme mugwump it get like he took up those positions because he didn't want a worse person to be chosen. I've always felt that it's hard to judge him for not being more proactive in the fight against Voldemort and his death eaters because he never wanted power (didn't trust himself with it) and he loved teaching but still tried to do the right thing. He put Harry with the Dursley's and knowing Harry would suffer “many dark years” because of it but at least he would be safe. With so many death eaters managing to bribe their way out of prison how could Dumbledore guarantee Harry's safety otherwise. Not only that but imagine being a kid raised with most people making him a hero with another portion of the population trying to kill him or at least wishing him harm. I don't think Dumbledore knew Harry was a horcrux that long (CoS at the earliest I think). Even if he did plan for Harry to sacrifice his life there's a similar type of thing in another book series. “Yes the knowledge he showed Harry would effect Harry's decision greatly. But is the truth really manipulation. If something is true and a big deal, shouldn't it effect a persons decision?” Because let's face it. As long as Harry was alive, Voldemort would be able to rise again and this time his followers would know it was possible and would spend more effort looking for him.

** Dumbledore: 'good' but utterly without ordinary empathy that would let him put himself in another's shoes. It's all about the Grand Plan, no thought to simple things like food, clothes, any happiness at all. He reads like a sociopath with a moral code.

Snape: an abuser and oily self-serving creep, but, like, a /really interesting/ oily self-serving creep because he really does read as though the right intervention might have made him less awful, and even if he can't be redeemed, he serves interesting and useful roles within so many potential plots. Also, I am pretty sure Lily liked Petunia better than she liked Snape, she just thought James was utterly rotten.

Draco: rich kid bullyboy from a landed estate, boring and easy to write because he's so predictable. Writing things happening /to/ him is fun though. Yes, he got scared but he was casting cruciatus curses and doing well at it, before he got blackmailed into the hopeless task he was crying about. Post-war, he might have learned a thing or two and be less banally evil. His role within the plot is to be a nasty person and he's good at it.

Sirius: hypocritical drunken self-pitying loser with no real empathy and a moral code he doesn't follow through on. Fun enough to be workable in a number of roles within potential plots, but when I reread the original, I always want to kick him up the arse. His primary motivation seems to be to hurt 'the enemy' which is whoever he has decided upon at the time, it's just easy to get allies when 'the enemy' is Death Eaters.

** Dumbledore: As a character in universe is a once respected old man that is set in his ways of thinking. Despite a personal reluctance to exert authority and wield personal power, he has reached the point where the weight of responsibility hangs heavily on him and has for decades. Having so much responsibility laid on him has resulted in him accepting that responsibility, as well as responsibility that isn't his to claim. While his personal code prevents some actions, there are others that he feels he has no choice but to take. He's the only one that /can/ do certain things, so he is the one that /must/ do them. Having been the one that everyone looks to for advice for so long, and having taught or been headmaster to such a large portion of the population, he doesn't know how or when to take advice, trusting instead to his own counsels. He enforces his will and morality on others to their own detriment from the belief that it is for the best. While his motives are good, as well as many of his actions and their outcomes, many things he did were incredibly harmful in both the short and long term.

Overall: A conflicted and overall good man. Deserves to have some sense knocked into him to understand how his actions affect other's and how he has reached a point where he is making unilateral decisions with other peoples lives. If he was brought to face that, as well as his unresolved issues from Ariana and Gellert, he would have become an even greater man than he was.

​

Snape: Young Severus is a tragic figure with a troubled childhood and a bad situation in school. His bullying at the hands of the Marauder's combined with the internal pressure from other Slytherins truly put him in an awful situation. He reacted to being saved by James with anger rather than thanks though, and he reacted to being defended by his best friend the same way. I don't think he ever grew in maturity beyond that point, only in resentment and bitterness. Severus Snape is self centered obsession personified. He is the perpetual victim of his self narrative and is unwilling to let anything go. He holds onto his "love" of Lily long after he drove her away with his actions, he holds onto his hatred of James long after James matures and then dies. He projects his anger onto Harry and Neville and all his students. He acts only to soothe his obsession's, whether that's ignoring the truth about Pettigrew in order to try to get Sirius and Remus killed, or swearing to follow Dumbledore in return for protection for Lily. Canon Severus Snape was not redeemed by his actions, he did nothing for anyone else but himself. He did things because of oaths he swore, and out of personal vengeance.

Overall: Snape is a bad person. He did important work for the war, but he did it for himself, not for anyone else. No one should be named after him. He deserved a better childhood.

Draco: Draco is a spoiled brat born and raised in privilege and prejudice. His actions were those of a child who didn't know better, until everything became real in sixth year. Then it was his life and his parents lives on the line. Even then he couldn't bring himself to kill Dumbledore. Draco is a product of war, a child soldier as much as Harry was. He didn't deserve this. Draco had the chance of redemption in a way that Snape did not. His personality, life, and choices were ripe for change and redemption after sixth year. Rowling dropped the ball entirely by not taking that option. As written though the rest of the series, Draco is a coward. He lacks conviction regardless of what he is doing. He can't kill Dumbledore, he doesn't expose Harry in the manor, he doesn't turn away from Voldemort, he still tries to stop Harry in the Room of Requirement, he doesn't try to kill Harry, he doesn't fight in the battle. Draco takes the path of least resistance as written.

Overall: Draco deserved better than Rowling gave him.

​

Sirius: Snape's literary Foil. Shitty childhood, dark impulses, and more. A childhood bully picking on other's to hide his own insecurity from his family issues. I won't blame him for letting Hagrid take Harry to the Dursley's. He almost certainly didn't expect to lose to Peter and thought he would be back soon. By the time he got out of Azkaban though he is as obsessive and stuck in the past as Snape. He sees Harry as his father the same way Snape does, he obsesses over Peter to the point of neglecting Harry. Unwilling to let go of past grievances with Snape.

Overall: A broken man that really needed serious psychological help rather than to be locked in the childhood home he had run away from.

** Dumbledore- Master manipulator. I believe that he set everything up from the prophecy to the Forbidden Forest. He must have blamed himself for Voldemort's deed because he brought him to the magical world. So with divination he found how to win with 100% certainty. He admits that he has a tendency to become powerhungry and seek control,that he tries to temper. Still after Harry has a breakdown in his office he realizes what he has done and tries to change the future that he set in place, only to doom himself. Final thoughts: I respect him for trying to put down Voldemort no matter the cost, but I fully despise his methods.

Snape- The most interesting character. He came from a broken home straight into the snake den. He brought his greatest nightmare to life by pushing the love of his life to his greatest enemy's embrace, because he needed the acceptance of his new house/family. Final thoughts: He's an angsty arsehole, a most interesting angsty arsehole.

Draco- Not much to be said. Shity father and rolemodel. Ultimately just a kid way out of his depth.

Sirius- A grown-up rebellious teenager. A true Black, arrogant, spiteful, mean and murderous. It's not often that you see the rebellious phase affecting someone in a good way. Sirius is the embodiment of "Is it better to be born good, or to overcome your evil?". A remarkable character you can't help but love.

** Unpopular opinions over here.

Dumbledore: He did what he had to do. That's it.

Draco:

The character of Draco Malfoy has the /potential/ for a redemption arc. I'm talking about- if we were to expand the series and include certain circumstances that could aid the possibility of enough character development to be able to say he /deserves/ the redemption arc.

My thoughts:

Draco had a unsettling upbringing. Raised differently given his blood status, his family, father, imposed beliefs from friends and family, etc.

Even as ambitious and smart as I believe he was, he wasn't one to defy or question what he knew or he thought was right. He admired his father and I think he wanted to BE him. To make him proud and to make the cause proud, out of fear and rejection. He was a bully from the moment he failed at his attempt to befriend Harry; which I'm sure hurt his pride beyond repair.

I don't condone his mistakes or his hatred towards muggleborns. But I do recognized that in his eyes it all was justified.

Pressure came from everywhere, including his house. We all know that there was a big favoritism towards Gryffindor and big stereotypical ideals when it came to Slytherin which was understandable but- they were just kids. We know things would've been different for him if he had had Dumbledore's guidance. But he didn't.

He had Voldemort in his house. He saw things that probably traumatized him in ways that we didn't exactly see--- he lived in fear. Gut wrenching fear that overpowered any intentions of doing the right thing specially bravery.

But remorse was there. Not an arc of redemption but remorse. From the moment he “failed” to recognize Harry at the manor. I think that that's when we saw the first glint of internal conflict.

And then with his task, he might have been a bully for the wrong reasons but he wasn't a killer. And I think that by HBP a lot of his mentality had already changed. (Could've maybe even been thanks to Snape because in his own way he tried to protect him too.) At least, when it came to right and wrong.

I like reading fics where Draco is the main character or the love interest. Mostly because It's so interesting to see how the authors create certain circumstances under which character development would be impossible to avoid.

I like to see how easy it would've been if little things and tiny actions from other people could've changed him for the better in the long run. It's a long shot but theres a lot of complexity to draw from and I haven't witnessed an author that has failed in the attempt to make you see Draco a little tiny bit different.

He made bad decisions but I think that he genuinely believed he never had a choice, after all he wasn't a hero.

Snape:

We all know he is a very complex character. We don't get any insight on what he's thinking, how he feels or why did he do the things he did. We make assumptions, we connect the dots and we all see things differently. Which is why I think when it comes to Snape, a lot of us are divided.

He had a rough childhood. From the start he wasn't “normal”. He met a girl who saw through him. Who understood him. Who liked him. They get into different houses, befriend different people and turn into very different persons something that never phased Snape on his feelings for Lily. I think back then, Slytherin was still very deep into their stereotypes and that is obviously what made him who is and what twisted his opinion on Muggleborns. Even more when Lily chose a guy who had bullied him for fun. James wasn't a bad person but as a kid he definitely influenced Snape just like bullies makes us insecure, unwanted and freaks.

A lot of people say the only reason why he joined Dumbledore was because of guilt. That it was all for Lily. That the remorse he felt was only for choosing to become a death eater for the wrong reasons hence the danger Lily was put in.

We know he always meant to protect her and we know he was torn between the two sides. We know he joined the order and stood by everyone through the way becoming in my opinion: the most successful in his tasks than all of them together. He played a roll that only him, with the best intentions could've fulfilled.

From the moment he saw Harry I do think he felt resentment towards him due to James and the betrayal he had felt from their relationship. But I do think that that feeling was overpowered by the Lily that he saw in him and the protective instincts that came with it.

Snape CHOSE to protect Harry, to risk his life for him and the cause, he chose to follow every order Dumbledore gave him and everything he could do to protect him. I am not by any means condoning the way he treated the trio and everyone in Gryffindor house. I am not condoning the way he most likely scarred Neville. I am not condoning his favoritism for Slytherin.

But I do believe both things were justified in his eyes. He had hated Gryffindor for the way they had treated him and the way the world saw them. Heroes. We know that even though Snape had always cared about Harry, he still saw James traits in him and that resentment led him to treat him the way he did. Slytherin was closer to his believes to his cunning personality and the ones that he was raised with.

But he wasn't a bad person. I don't believe that. He made wrong decisions. He did. But I will always think that deep down he loved Harry and that Lily wasn't the only reason why he did good things and why he protected him.

After everything Harry had gone through with Snape after the image he Snape had created of him in his mind, after all the hatred Harry felt for him at times in a matter of seconds the truth hit him when he saw everything he had done. I can't imagine how WITH TIME Harry truly felt, and how, at the moment, surprised he was or how fast or why his feelings changed and took a giant turn towards Snape ENOUGH that he even named his son after him.

I think that he saw things in Snape that he would want his son to channel. Snape was indeed incredibly brilliant in every sense of the word. And I think that Harry understood everything I said and that led him to forgiveness and admiration above all. I live by this.

Or the time an exclusively Gryffindor group got speical privileges and rights to punish other students .....

Or how the Gryffindors repeatedly face no punishment for constant bullying and hexing...

** Dumbledore, in my mind, will always be a powerful wizard with a badass reputation who very much uses his positions and said reputation to his advantage to use and manipulate those around him. He keeps information from people he supposedly trusts (don't get me started on how much he kept from McGonagall and Harry throughout the OG series) to the point of causing problems, getting them involved in dangerous situations, and harming them. It makes for great plot and adventure, but the man and everyone would have benefitted from him actually TEACHING them things. A lot of it boils down to JK creating this all powerful wizard but also needing the other characters to figure things out on their own to drive the plot, so Dumbledore became a secretive/absent man instead who lacks empathy and believes he is SO moral that nothing he does can possibly harm others (it does. it does a lot).

My feelings for Snape have totally shifted around over the years. When I was younger, I saw him as an asshole for the way he treated students. I was a little older when Deathly Hollows came out and I started to feel sorry for him, and I can buy the whole, ok, he decided being a Death Eater was not for him. But now? Nothing about his relationship with Lily or the way he treated her or her son was healthy. I think Lily would punch Snape out for how he treated her son, and see him for the "nice guy" creep he was. That said, I love Alan Rickman and his portrayal of Snape will always make me still love his movie character for being the guy you love to hate and sometimes feel sorry for. That's just Snape. He is a classic "nice guy" who made a few mistakes.

Snape- I don't think he was a man who never believed any side he joined. He's a person for most out to protect himself. I think while he loved Lilly I think he saw it as a betrayal of their friendship. I think his friendship with Lilly is the only reason why he warned Dumbledore. He's basically a person who lost everything in the war. Sirius- a person who had the tendency to do things before he thought things through. (The whole Lupin thing plus Petagrew) probably mentally scared from Azkban but "gained" his freedom and some sort of normalcy with Harry and Lupin.

Draco- probably someone trying to live in what he thought was his father's legacy. Head cannon he probably tried but failed to live up to his father's expatiation. He probably was protected growing up. Probably near the end of the war shown how his father's name and persona destroyed for him.

Draco: a stereotypical egoistic rich daddy's boy and a proud bully. Draco was taught from his childhood that pure blood is best, and anyone else is either mudblood, or blood traitor, and he didn't have anyone to teach him anything else, he was his father's child arrogant and typical rich bitch, I can forgive his younger days for the same reason as Sirius but not when he became a death eater, and running away is not repenting for murder, aid in murder, torture and other crimes he did.

** For canon, and please don't blow up me. If you want to debate, I'll debate. Just calmly, yeah?

Dumbledore: I don't like how manipulative of Harry he is, and I will never forgive him for putting Harry with the Dursleys. I think he genuinely wants to defeat Voldemort and win the war. But I also think he believes strongly in the 'for the greater good'. He put Harry in an abusive household 'for the greater good'.

Snape: I trust him not to be evil. That's about it. He bullied teenagers, his students.

Draco: He was 16 when Voldemort told him to kill Dumbledore or else he's kill Draco and his parents. Then Harry used Sectumsempra(which translates to 'to cut forever' or something to that tune) on him that same year, which basically ripped him apart. 17 when he almost died in the Fiendfyre, his friend Crabbe died in the Fiendfyre. I think he's just as much a victim of the war as anyone else. I also think he didn't have any choices; take the mark or die; kill Dumbledore or die.

** Dumbledore: a man willing to go to extreme lengths to achieve his goals in accordance with his skewed sense of morality.. I find his decisions questionable for the most part considering they tend to involve children and I refuse to accept "it's for the greater good" as a valid reason. Kinda biased on this one, I have feelings about utilitarianism... Snape: a beaten down man who decided to make it everyone else's problem. His treatment of his students was inexcusable but the fact that he was kept in his position is just another example of Dumbledore looking past any and all suffering that he thinks justify the end. Snape "being in love" with Lily does nothing to redeem him in my eyes and I have to wonder at what his definition of love is when it motivated him to be such a miserable sack. Draco: a spoiled rich kid raised into bigotry. I can feel sympathy for a child raised to believe bullshit but there comes a point in everyone's life where they must forge their own path and think for themselves. Draco is a self motivated and self absorbed child that was motivated by what would put him on top and when things got to real he left others to help him out of his mess. He's just lucky not everyone is motivated in the same way. Sirius: another spoiled rich kid but this one had the luxury of having an older brother to bear the brunt of his families expectations. He was a bully in school and only got slightly better as he grew older. Probably mostly due to the fact that he had no one to torment sealed away in Azkaban. An imprisonment that could've been avoided by him taking responsibility for his godchild rather than hightailing it into a trap for the sake of revenge.

For me the draw of the Harry Potter series will always be the world, not the characters and that's not explored nearly enough for my liking. Maybe that's a good thing though because I'm sure jk would've managed to fuck that up too. The characters are 2 dimeional, uninteresting, black and white blah. The series serves as groundwork for better writers to expand on in more interesting ways or even just rewrite entirely. Fanfiction is a blessing I give thanks for every day.

- Snape is functionally irredeemable, didn't become a Death Eater on a whim and is ultimately redeemed entirely because he died but, for some reason, the fandom fixates on how bad a teacher he is (that's like the least wrong thing with him)
- Draco was a racist tosspot but he never really wanted to be a murderer and his characterisation in HBP is a redemption arc, it's just that redemption for Draco means "we feel sorry for/can understand him". There is no way that a canon esque Draco could be friends with canon esque Harry or Hermione (or Ron, but that doesn't seem to be a Thing people want).
- Sirius and James would be called "evil" if they were real people, the werewolf stunt is unforgivable and I don't understand where the playboy Sirius trope comes from. Like, I don't think Wolfstar makes any kind of sense at all (see: the werewolf stunt) but I know where it comes from. That being said, I really don't think Rowling was fully conscious of exactly how much worse Sirius and James were than Fred and George.

It aged like milk.

As for the werewolves stunt. I do believe that JKR wanted us to think both Sirius and Snape are equally to blame. Sirius for giving the info to Snape out of frustration and annoyance, and Snape for trying to spy on the marauders, Lupin especially, and trying to get them in trouble.

Without Sirius lack of forethought and Snape desire to get Remus into trouble, nothing would have happen here.

However, i think she didn't do a good enough job showing how Snape wasn't a defenseless victim and it wasn't one-sided. And also that Sirius was stupid reckless that didn't think of the consequences instead of the wanabee murderer Snape thought he was.

Draco deserved to be killed due to his stupidity as of book one, I'm shocked he didn't get himself killed in any number of ways, and the fact he survived was a cop out.

And Sirius played the role of an innocent man that just survived a torturous hell hole quite well. He was haunted and then killed before he really recovered, and played a key role in showing Harry what war was like. I wish more people had died, on both sides. I wish one of the older muggleborn had brought a gun to school so we'd get to see a basic shield stop bullets. I wish the light people had stopped holding back and started actually killing people, but no.

Sirius could have been much better than he was but he got even fewer chances than Snape. Awful family and upbringing, barely had any life as a free adult. I pity him.

Draco is spoiled and indoctrinated, barely able to form a thought that didn't come from his father. He commited several crimes that should have ended with prison time.

** Dumbledore--- Love him and hate him. He's quite the case study on the pitfalls of a utilitarian perspective and how that can lead people to do terrible, terrible things, for “the greater good.” At the same time, he's not some evil cartoon villain we should endlessly demonize or anything. Living as long as he did, and having to do the things he did (defeat and imprison his lover-turned-Dark-Lord, live with the uncertainty of /maybe/ having killed his sister---- while also knowing that either answer wouldn't absolve him of responsibility----, hold some of the greatest power in the world and not be tempted to become the next Dark Lord, etc.) ... it's not an excuse, but I don't think anyone could go through that mentally unscathed. He's flawed and imperfect, but he's not just /evil/ either. He did a lot of good things.

Snape--- there's not really any excuse for his behavior. Everything good that he ever did for Harry was something any teacher or member of the Order would have been obligated to do anyhow--- and he did many of those things pretty poorly anyhow. His endless bullying of a child for the sins of his father (who was also a bully, straight up) and terrible treatment of children in the HPverse all around is inexcusable. Not to mention his entire motivation for turning good was seriously messed up. We all know that if there was a way he could have just whisked off Lily and left her son and husband to get murdered, he would've done so. His being selfishly in (unrequited and infatuative/obsessive) love with Lily doesn't make him a good person. Neither does doing the bare minimum to fulfill a life-debt to Harry (through James) and then mind-raping him (without mercy) and making his school life hell, and going with Dumbledore's plan to sacrifice him, a 17 year old kid, to do the job they couldn't. I don't have a problem with fics that reimagine him as a character entirely, but the ones which just try to excuse his past canon behavior (or explain them away) always just make me uncomfortable. He did /not/ redeem himself in the end, IMO, and just sucked.

Draco--- also a bully and a bigot. But there's potential for change. Under a shit ton of pressure from his parents, brought up in a life that he couldn't comprehend walking away from until it was too late, etc. That said, there's something I think a lot of people don't give enough recognition: even a 12 year old who's grown up learning pureblood bigotry, should not be looking at a situation with multiple Petrified students (one initially presumed dead) and say “I wish I knew who it was, I'd help” or “You'll be next, Mudbloods.” Even a 13 year old Draco Malfoy should not be goading Harry Potter to go after Sirius Black, who was (at that point in canon), Draco's insane and murderous cousin. Even Draco should have felt at least a bit /guilty/ about Katie, even in the midst of his worries about his family, Voldemort, and Dumbledore. And even when he didn't identify Harry in Malfoy Manor, he certainly had no qualms about trying to capture him in the Room of Hidden Things.

Draco Malfoy is a terrible person with little-to-no empathy, period. That's not to say he can't (and didn't) change. But the problem with a lot of fics that put him on a redemption arc with a canon backstory is that they don't always make sense when accounting for these facts. The only thing that ever prompted him to think about changing was an appeal to his selfishness, when shit directly threatened him and his family. And even in the end, if the final battle of Hogwarts had ended with Voldemort winning, he probably would've done the same thing he did in canon--- quietly faded into the background, only caring about himself and his family. Although it's fair to say that he never had anything else to tempt him into being a decent (or even subpar) person by the time he “came to his senses) in the final 2 books, and if he did, we might have gotten to see a /real/, developed redemption arc, as opposed to an incomplete suggestion that he just slinked off out of sight, and went with the flow, going with each side once they had won.

Sirius--- Eh. I'll be honest, I just don't like him. Good friend, but /terrible/ bully. Tbh I think in a world where Sirius had been cleared of his alleged crimes in 3rd year, and become the DADA professor the following year, he probably would have treated any children of Snape's the exact same way Snape treated Harry, if not worse. As for his previous behavior (like trying to get Snape killed by Remus in his 5th year)---There's not really any excuse for the type of hateful spite that can inspire a 15 year old to not only have a classmate (whom he bullied) /murdered/, but have his alleged /friend/ do it, when said friend (Remus) would have spent the rest of his life blaming himself for it, likely driving himself insane, and almost /certainly/ being forced to leave Hogwarts. It's not like he ever felt or showed regret for it either--- calling him /Snivellus/ at every opportunity, and provoking him time and again, and even stating outright in PoA that he “had it coming to him.” He was as much a bigot towards Slytherins as Snape was to Gryffindors. I wouldn't trust him to treat his own child properly if he/she/they were in Slytherin.

Finally, there's the way he treats Harry. I get that he's a bit insane from Azkaban, and never quite got over James and Lily dying, but he still owes it to Harry to not just use him as an extension of James. He's the boy's /godfather/.

When Harry tells him it's too dangerous to visit in Hogsmeade, he insults and guilt-trips Harry by saying he's nothing like James, who would have relished the risk--- that is completely unacceptable, especially given the person Harry is and what he's been through (and his desperate yearning for a connection to his dead parents, since the living family he does have treats him like shit). Harry was being the mature one in this situation, but Sirius provoked his /worst/ impulses. Not to mention, it's ridiculous that Harry /needs/ to be the adult in their relationship--- the kid has quite enough on his shoulders (with no real support system of his own) without this adding to the weight of it all.

I would have preferred to see Harry get close to Remus rather than Sirius. He seems much more deserving of the relationship.

Yeah, it's weird to say that his death somehow redeemed him. He didn't even really die so another could live in his place.

I don't think dying in a war redeems someone, especially given tonnes of other actual innocents got killed too trying to do the same thing.

** In some way, I detest Dumbledore. I'm so used to Dumbledore-bashing that it's uncomfortable for me when he's a good person.

I like Snape's sarcasm. He's clever. Of course, he's also a git and I don't like how canon Snape treats Harry. I like fics where they're both in good terms and are friends (or family).

Same thing with Draco... He's obviously a spoiled brat in canon, but I understand his character. He was basically alone and was forced to do something he wasn't comfortable with. I love fics where he's Harry's best friend and they're both Slytherins.

Now... My favorite character in the whole HP world (after Harry of course) is Sirius. I don't know why, but I love him. I'm in particular attracted to fics where he manages to be Harry's father and he doesn't die. His death is what I hate the most in the whole saga... It's just soooo sad! Also, I'm not particularly fond of how JK described him in the story. I kinda wish he had been treated better... But no, he was locked up in Azkaban for 12 years for something he didn't do, subjected to his worst memories and if that wasn't enough, he was forced to stay in a house where he was abused as a kid and later on, was treated as garbage by strangers of the Order of Fried Chicken 🙊😂

Still love them though. The trio just feels bland compared to them.

** I feel bad for being a Hufflepuff stereotype but I have a hard time actively disliking any of them--- Sirius is my favorite character, actually. Snape is definitely a horrible person, I'm well aware, but reading fanfiction where he isn't as much (and isn't that what fanfiction is for? Changing the original series?) is something I like to do on occasion. My opinion of Draco is, of course, terribly biased by fandom perceptions of the character (he's alright, but wowheiwgwiw do drarry writers write good fanfiction). And Dumbledore has, of course, made many many many mistakes but I have a hard time reading fanfiction where he is outright just a bad person. Like, misinformed and an idiot and willing to acknowledge his mistakes I can read easily, but otherwise... I don't know.

TLDR; I'm a sucker and I can't bring myself to truly hate any character (except a certain fifth year DADA teacher...), even though I know their flaws

  Tell her what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation: an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone. I'd as soon put that little canary into the park on a winter's day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him! It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing else, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don't imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior! He's not a rough diamond---a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he's a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. I never say to him, “Let this or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them;” I say, “Let them alone, because I should hate them to be wronged:” and he'd crush you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if he found you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn't love a Linton; and yet he'd be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations: avarice is growing with him a besetting sin.

** Dumbledore - I like him as the old wise mentor figure who is there to help the main character grow. Not really into the whole manipulative characterization (regardless whether with good or malicious intentions) because that's not his purpose. Sure he had a convoluted plan but its ultimate purpose was to help Harry grow, accept death as a natural part of life, learn about the importance of friendship and love and keep him alive.

Snape - he is one of my favorite characters. That's not to be confused with the fact that I like him as a character but in contrast to Harry who is all good and Voldemort who is all evil, his grey nature adds a realistic dimension to the story. Also since we mostly him for Harry's POV we get a biased opinion of him. He is a dick to Harry, but objectively, other than the first book, he only punishes Harry when he steps out of line and generally seems to be quite respected by most of the Hogwarts staff, his House, the Order and the Death Eaters alike.

Draco - considering how much fans were expecting a redemption arc, DH was quite disappointing. He is a spoiled bully who happens to love his family (like most people that come from functional families). Sure he ends up in over his head but it is because of choices he made so at least a few months in Azkaban would have helped me view him less critically. Would have loved to also see Draco's lost chapter that JK was talking about where she showed him how he was like when he was around people that he considered his equals.

Sirius - he is similar to Snape and also one of my favorite characters. He is a grey character. He is a good guy who cares for his friends, but even in his later years he still seems reckless and cruel (he treats Kreacher horribly). We don't get to see much of his growth in between his graduation and his arrest but the two memories of him in Hogwarts as well as his plot to kill Snape would indicate he was not a good person in his youth. We see him in a favorable light because Harry likes him but, even if he didn't go to prison, I think it would have been very bad for Harry to be raised by him.
