Am I the only one that thinks this? I remember reading PS for the first time thinking wow this world is cool. But by the end of the books I was left with the impression that the wizarding world was really pretty boring. Except for a few niche roles like wand maker, curse breaker or dragon tamer most wizards and witches live quiet, boring lives despite having the ability to use magic.

I would probably leave that world behind as soon as Hogwarts was finished. Why work as a bureaucrat in the MoM or a shop keeper in Diagon Alley when you could spend your life travelling, spell crafting, enchanting, building amazing structures, making a philosophers stone etc


** I think that's intentional on JK's part. The early couple books are through the eyes of a young child experiencing some fantastic stuff. Then the later books introduce an unwieldy bureaucracy which stifles society and gives Harry (and the reader) a much more cynical view of the magical world. The characters grow up and settle into "adult" roles in the bureaucracy, accepting that living a less adventurous life can have value and happiness too. With the exception of Luna, of course.

For an in-universe explanation, I think that experimenting with magic is very dangerous. Luna's mom died from it, after all. I imagine the big schools like Hogwarts drill into their student's heads early on that messing with magic even with proper training, practice, and preparation is very dangerous. My personal head-canon is that the big schools all tend to steer students towards a civil service and business track because of their narrow curriculum and emphasis on tight rules and regulation. While you get obvious exceptions (Luna, Bill, Charlie, etc), most Hogwarts grads probably leave with skills that best suited for Ministry work.

*** I think danger must be part of it. But still, look at the average 18 year old male and their risk taking behaviour. I reckon most male graduates of Hogwarts would do some pretty stupid things in the first few years after leaving school.

Maybe wizard raised kids learn nothing but cautionary tales for the first 11 years of their lives.

**** Probably! Most fairy tales were cautionary tales for children about dangers in life. I'd imagine wizards have a culture of discouraging rampant experimentation except by experienced professionals. Plus all the big schools seem to be big on drilling rules and regulations into their students. It def reads like a society built on discouraging reckless use of magic.

***** Aurors are not police. This is a fanon misconception. Aurors are not there for general law enforcement e.g. theft, common assaults, etc. There is the Magical Law Enforcement patrol for that, as well as the individual sub-departments (e.g. Arthur has police powers in relation to misuse of Muggle Artefacts, including the ability to raid properties).

In canon, Aurors do just two things:

1. Hunt dark wizards.

2. Protect VIPs.

Due to their highly specialised role, it doesn't seem likely that there are many of them. Maybe 15-20 maximum. We know for a fact, at least, that sometimes years pass without them recruiting any new Aurors.

**** I can't speak for you, but here's my personal experience:

Something I realized is that I have this fantasy of what I'd do if I was a wizard. So right after Hogwarts (where I'd put all my effort in and get all Os in NEWTs) I'd take a few years off to master Occulmency/Legimency, become an Animagus, etc while travelling the world and then return as some kind of super wizard.

But realitically those analogue exist for me. I could graduate college and get a Phd abroad. I could not do anything but study and get all A's on my exams in college. I could take a gap semester to work in a foreign country. I could postpone work for a year or two to work on a personal project. But I don't. Because of reasons that don't factor into my fantasy (I don't want to postpone my career until later, dating is a thing, I don't want to live far away from friends and family, etc.).

I've definitely reprioritized my life a lot after that realization, but there are concerns with my life today that simply don't factor into fantasies.

***** There's one big difference, though. It's the amount of learning you have to do before being able to translate your knowledge into something truly useful. Not that you can't do things before that, but to invent useful stuff, for instance, you have to know a lot of different things, and then work a lot to put them together in a manner that allows you to make a device able to do the intended task.\\
In the mundane world, knowledge doesn't translate directly into an ability to directly affect the world, at least not as much and fast as it would in the magical world.\\
In the wizarding world, it is not as much the case.

Now, as we're talking about personal experiences, like a lot of people I've been mostly a slack off during my days at school, though I was sufficiently bright to make do. I had trouble (and still have to a lesser extent) with self-discipline.

Let's examine a couple of popular tropes, here, to compare two similar scenarios. The Peggy-Sue and the Self-Insert. What would happen if I pulled up a Peggy-Sue and came back to, say, college (in France, it begins around 10 or 11, if I remember well, so around the beginning of a wizard's educational career)?\\
Like anybody else, I guess, I like to think that this time I would put all my effort in my learning, that I would leverage my years of experience living a first life before going back to the fullest...And it would certainly be true to an extent, but really, the same causes leading to the same consequences, I think I would mostly fail at doing this. At the very least it would be an extremely difficult task. Because, seriously, learning all the basic knowledge you need to become really proficient I've always found extremely boring. Going back in time wouldn't change that, although I'd certainly be better at powering through that.\\
Now if I found myself in an SI situation, things would certainly be different. Not because I would be better in any way at bearing the boring, but because the rewards, i.e. the ability to actually do useful stuff, would come to a lot sooner while learning magic. I believe it would be a lot easier to me to dedicate myself to learning in this case. And most importantly, to create the habit of studying hard and the passion you need to truly excel at something.\\
Honestly, the sheer cool there is to learn how to break the laws of the universe, coupled with all the little rewards there are everywhere along the way, simply coming from the very act of learning, would make it a lot easier.\\
Not to say those things don't exist in a mundane education, it's just nothing as direct, obvious and concrete as what one would find studying magic.

Now, why do wizards seem to live such mundane lives despite all the awesome capacities they have, which trump what muggles can do in every way? I believe this is simply because people are humans, be they wizards or not, and most people aspire to a quiet and comfortable life growing a family and be useful to society. Many people just don't want all the danger and adventure and excitement, or at least not in an uncontrolled way. Magic widens up your possibilities, but it doesn't change what humans fundamentally are. And the truly exceptional will always remain few. As will those who are truly attracted to violence or adventure or the ability to lead an unusual life, although those who do would probably have an easier time doing so.

At least it's what I think.

You need money to travel in the wizarding world - see the Weasleys' holiday in Egypt between CoS and PoA, which they were only able to take because they had won some money.

***** If you travel alone, by apparating, with a shorter distance between each stop, it would certainly be cheaper.

The Weasley traveled as a family, with kids who couldn't apparate, and straight from Angland to the middle east. There must be cheaper ways to do it. If you wanted to travel the world as a wizard, I don't think it would cost you that much.\\
I've known people who did travel the world, obviously without the help of magic, and they didn't need that much money to do it (There's a heavy cost of opportunity though, because the time you spend doing it, you're not in education or employment). Although they did need to stop in places they were visiting and work from time to time. There's no security and no comfort, but it is doable. With magic? Even more so.

****** Given that

- apparition is free, as is side-along-apparition;

- at least some of the Weasleys can apparate;

- nonetheless the Weasleys were unable to travel abroad until they won money;

it seems likely that there is some other barrier preventing international apparition which one needs money to overcome e.g. international wizarding border control which requires to you pay for a tourist visa or equivalent.

******* True.\\
There could also be limitations on the apparition, though. Maybe it would simply take too long to chain apparate all the way from England to Egypt, and the Weasleys would have had to take a costly portkey instead. If distance matters or if you have to already know the place where you want to apparate, it could be reasons that just apparating all the family to Egypt would be unpractical.\\
But having to pay for a Visa or equivalent does makes sense.

** i dunno. one of the odd things about the books is how little magic is actually in them. theres no way of knowing if some beurocratic charms work like computers. you can never really tell if a curse breaker is just dithering around with maths to get in a hole, or if they're all epic adventurers. presumably a lot of crafting is a lot like watchmaking, intricate. herboligists may be one of the most dangerous jobs around. in cursed child they hinted that harrys job as an auror was pretty exciting. tracking hordes of trolls moving through europe at one point. another odd thing is that all background characters are so in the background there really is no way of knowing if dean and semus are off having just as many adventures as the main three.

My head canon is that curses are more a poetry thing than an engineering thing: curse breakers must feel the curses, understand how the wizards of 7th egyptian dynasty thought and spoke and wrote and how they would curse you, what would be the conditions of the curses and their exceptions.\\
That makes Bill Weasley a long-haired man with cool piercings, who speak several (dead or not) languages, and able to recite poetry in most of them (maybe even play a few instruments), which in indubitably how he wooed the blonde french chick.\\
Well, that and having a good head on his shoulders for when you blunder and a trap release a few inferii-ed sphinxes. Or for when you want to woo the 18yo blond french chick who wants to be aknowledged for her brain.

And regarding bureaucratic charms, they probably works like an algorithm, except that for you it always put "banshee" in the "pub" section cause you love banshe-enters-a-pub jokes (and in the department of international cooperation, mostly confound Slovenia and Slovakia except for Crouch who speaks both languages)

DH shows this insinuation absolutely untrue. The Trio was using magic in the Muggle world all the time, while being hunted by both Death Eaters and the Ministry. Their magic use was not detected.

In HBP, Slughorn had been squatting in Muggle homes for about a year, without being detected by the Ministry. Then Dumbledore showed up and both of them did more magic, Ministry didn't know.

So the Ministry's ability to detect magic in Muggle areas was very limited.
