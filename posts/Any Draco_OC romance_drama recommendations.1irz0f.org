** While it's not quite Draco/OC, Bad Mum wrote a nice one-shot [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199992/1/A-Strictly-Legal-Matter][A Strictly Legal Matter]], a Draco/Rose Weasley romance/drama that you might enjoy. As a next-gen character, Rose is pretty much a blank slate and effectively an OC.

  Draco Malfoy is employing Rose Weasley to do some legal legwork for him. Their meetings are strictly business, but Draco wants more. Does Rose? For the "I never" challnge at the Sober Universe Forum, and very unlike my usual work. Rated M for a reason.

** When I read Draco/OC drama, I thought OP was looking for an HP/The O.C. crossover. :D
