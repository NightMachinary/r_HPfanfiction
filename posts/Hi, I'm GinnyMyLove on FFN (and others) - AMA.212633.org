** Here's couple questions:

In the vast sea of HP fanfiction, it can become difficult to distinguish yourself as a writer or come up with a concept that draws interest. What would you say is the difference in your corner of the fandom?

Is there a particular aspect of story writing that you wish you were better at?

Is there a story idea that you're saving for some later point or think is too far 'out there' so you haven't written it even though it excites your creativity?

*** There is a lot about fanfiction that I feel "has been done already" so I try to stay away from it. That said, I'd like to write a full 7 year story but I'm super intimidated. The main problem being I know my strength is in romance and smut, and I'd be too tempted to start them young.

I think the only thing that distinguishes me from other authors are:

A) Word Count - I can crank out 100k a month when I'm feeling it. Large wordcount tends to draw in readers.

B) Characters - My characters almost all have a complete backstory in my head, and a full Psych workup so I know exactly how they will respond to any given situation and why. That means I have an idea for a scene, I put the characters into it, and then they do their own thing. I seriously just write down what they are doing, I don't have to think too hard about it ... voices in my head

C) Smut - Write what you know ... and I know sex and I think I understand women as well as any man can so it translates into well written smut. Even people who don't like romance novels can enjoy my version. Romance Novels *for men

I wish I were better at world building; the reason I haven't written my own original idea yet is because creating my own world is intimidating. I could write the hell out of TV episodes or possibly something like a Star Wars Novel... Except the other thing I wish I was better at is writing any sort of fight / battle, and controlling the plot for conflict and ending an antagonist.

Apparently I have no idea how to end Voldemort orignally. It's all been done so I usually end up phoning in an explanation for his demise, or come up with something ridikuous like having God go after him and capture him in chapter 3...

*** I have plans to continue everything... even SFTP and Embarrassment and Contraceptives... even Phoenix Choice.

I intend for Harry to go to Beauxbattons with Gabby (who is his age) and a Fleur who does not like him at first... They will end up at Hogwarts for the Tri-Wizard tourney. Harry will be a real ladies man though, having been practically raised in a "whore house" he knows all the tricks and has no problem talking to any woman. Including a veela at full allure.

** I've heard of you, but I have no idea how I've heard of you. But you like HPMoR, so you're good in my book.

How much do you plan out stories before you start writing? Like how detailed do you go into side-plots and chapters and such?

How did you find a beta?

What type of scenes or interactions do you enjoy writing the most?

Ever thought of writing any next-gen Harry Potter?

How long does it take you to write the typical chapter?

How much do you write/work on stories a day?

  How much do you plan out stories before you start writing? Like how detailed do you go into side-plots and chapters and such?
#+end_quote

I typically get a story idea but don't write a single word until it is fully formed in my head. I like to know exactly which characters will be included and what the endgame is before I begin. Once it is all set up in my head I don't have to work at it, I just write what is happening in my head!

#+begin_quote
  How did you find a beta?
#+end_quote

I've worked without a beta for the longest time and did okay. But on the current story I had someone I know in real life offer, it took me months to realize the person who offered via PM was my cousin! So now we can hang out and bounce ideas off each other in person. Luckily we are both ADHD, both have extremely similar thought processes ... it is actually scary sometimes when we are chatting and both have the exact same though... it happens often.

#+begin_quote
  What type of scenes or interactions do you enjoy writing the most?
#+end_quote

I obviously enjoy writing romance and smut the most, though crack is probably my favorite wherever I can insert it. I love laughing at my own jokes, especially when I come back and read my own story years later. I often think "God this author is amazing!" before I realize I'm mentally masturbating.

#+begin_quote
  Ever thought of writing any next-gen Harry Potter?
#+end_quote

I've thought about it sure, just like I've thought about doing a Marauder fic. It would be much easier to be original... but I haven't read ANY next-gen and only one or two Marauder fics. I'd be coming at it completely out of nowhere ... and still likely end up using all the cliches without knowing it. They are cliche because they work.

#+begin_quote
  How long does it take you to write the typical chapter?
#+end_quote

It takes me a bout 5 days to write a typical chapter if I work on it every night. I can occasionally write an entire 10k or so word chapter in one night if I'm really on my game, but with life interfering it gets hard. When I wrote 'Searching For The Power' I actually wrote the first 170k words or so in one month.

No beta though, having a beta definitely slows things down because I like having his input on things, and because I have to wait for him to clean up my punctuation before I can post. I want to post as soon as I'm done, and I want to write 3 or 4 chapters ahead... but I can't make myself. I'm too eager to post it as soon as it is done; this means I have to make certain I know where the story is going so I don't contradict myself, or paint myself into a corner /cough-dead-character-cough/

#+begin_quote
  How much do you write/work on stories a day?
#+end_quote

I try to write at least 1k words a night, but it doesn't usually work out that way. Working on stories every single night is my hobby. My beta and I will chat about the story for hours on end without writing an actual word in the current chapter. We intermix that with life happenings and the current bleach or naruto manga as well, so it isn't all work.

Typical week... I probably spend between 7 and 20 hours on a chapter total. Only part of that is actual writing though.

  Do you have a main plot in mind as you write, or do you just write and see where your plot goes? If it's the former, how do you keep track of the nuances of your story/plot?
#+end_quote

I try to do a plot outline where I write down like 1-40 on notebook paper, and put the final scene I have in mind at 40 and the first scene at 1. Then I fill in the other 38 lines in the order I think I'd like to see them happen.

It never works out the way I planned it, but at least it helps remind me what my point was when I started. I redo this list periodically at least in my head, and write it down when I remember to do so.

Lately I've kept it as a spreadsheet and try to plan out each chapter in plotpoints instead. I keep fairly copious notes both on paper and on the computer of random thoughts that pop into my head.

And I have a beta/writing partner to remind me of what I've forgotten.

When I wrote Searching For The Power though, I had none of those things. I still had lots of nuance, but I had no idea what I was doing dropping those breadcrumbs until something snuck up on me and I went "oooooooh, so thats where that was leading." At least once though, that painted me into a corner and ended up with somebody dead.... so yes, keeping track is important; but you can do it just in your head if the idea is fully formed enough.

It also helps that I think hard and do a psych mock-up of each character important to the story. What is their motivation? What is their background? Where are they coming from and why would they respond to certain situations. At that point the story can write itself because you just introduce the scene, then let it play out.

#+begin_quote
  Where does your inspiration/motivation to write come from? Putting out 100k a month is rather tough, so I'm just curious if you write because you enjoy it of if it's a cathartic release or any other reason.
#+end_quote

Most of my motivation comes from watching HP Fanfiction die... it has been such a large part of my life. Now all the "good fic" seems to have been written, the old authors are giving up, the new ones are okay but havent completed most of their stories and I hate taking a chance on a WIP only for it to die and never be written again.. (yes I know that is hypocritical of me)

Otherwise, there was a specific girl that inspired Searching for the Power. For the others the inspiration was really the above, being bored and doing something about it. I write mostly to entertain myself.

#+begin_quote
  I want to begin writing fan fiction. Any advice? (I'll take all I can get!)
#+end_quote

Make sure you plan out the story before you begin.

Try to write on a schedule, any schedule. Be it once a week, every 2 weeks, or once a month. As long as you stick to the schedule you will get loyal readers and a fair number of reviews. When you go off schedule without warning, people begin to think the story has been abandoned.

Listen to reviewers but do not let them run your story for you

Write for yourself, if you don't enjoy it you won't stick with it. You can't please everybody so do it for you and others will agree.

Get a beta / pre-reader! Nothing can kill a great story quicker than grammar and punctuation.

*** also a note: a chapter might only be 10k long, but my beta and I probably have conversation logs that are 60k on a semi-nightlly basis.

Being someone who just naturally has a lot to say in print/chat helps a lot when talking about writing a chapter a week. You dont have to write tat much, that often... but I'd have a 5 or 10 chapter buffer if you write slowly, to be able to post something for the readers when you get behind or have to go off schedule...

I need to take my own advice on that last one though, im currently in write/beta/post mode myself.

***** I found my beta by accident, someone I know in real life was reading the story after I told them I write fanfiction. Sent me a PM and I didn't realize it was the same person for like 4 chapters til we were talking IRL again.

When I beta'd for 'Love Has No Age' it was an open call asking for a beta, in an authors note.

You can join the various Yahoo groups for HP Fanfiction to find a beta too. On Fanfiction.net there are people who mark themselves as available for beta on certain fandoms but I haven't looked into it.

Basically, if you put it out there that you are looking, you'll probably get a few nibbles. Might post a chapter or two in those yahoo groups I was talking about, or online at your favorite site; then ask for beta candidates.

The best beta is one who understands your story and is willing to both edit it AND bounce ideas with you. But be careful not to abuse them or steal their ideas because they can decide to stop being your beta just as fast as they joined you (see authors note on the latest chapter of Animagus Mishap).

*** I'm not really following any HP fic at the moment, started reading Animagus Mishap as my Beta was also, but not really "following" it.

EroNinja and Ahsikabi no Shinobi from the Naruto-verse are currently in my following stories. And I'm probably going to read "Here In My Arms" soon, a completed Rosario+Vampire fic recommeded to me by my beta.

Not much in HP interests me at the moment, that is why I'm writing.

edit: Letters from the Asylum is a fun WIP Crackfic that I'm following in HP
