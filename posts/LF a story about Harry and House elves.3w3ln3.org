** The /Harry the Hufflepuff/ series (linkffn(6466185) is the first fic in it) has him doing that.

*Edit:* Wrong story ID.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** There was the Book of Dobby which was good. Basically, Dobby decides to help Harry fight Voldemort by organising a House Elf resistance using WW2 tech.

Harry's reaction is basically: 'sure, okay? What harm can it do'

I don't think it was ever finished.

** I really liked linkffn(Coven of the Rose) although it's pretty crackish.

  Harry's escaped from Azkaban and wants Revenge! Now this isn't your normal everyday kind of revenge, Harry is a second generation Marauder with a bone to pick with just about everyone that thinks they can just discard him like a worn out shoe
