Like he can use the banishment and vanishing charm to kill his target by banishing them to a wall and using a the vanishing charm to vanish their hearts and uses apparition to escape so when they see him and he uses apparitions it seems like he Vanished


** On the principle that vanished objects go into nothing and therefore into everything, once Harry vanishes Voldemort's heart, he realizes that everyone else behaves more like Voldemort a bit. After vanishing several of his enemies' hearts, he is confronted with a mob of people that impart several traits of those enemies.
