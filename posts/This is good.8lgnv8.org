** Wow. I know people's choices differ, but for me, that fic is absolute trash.

Manipulative, evil Dumbledore obliviates Harry, Lord Potter, marriage contracts, block on magic, inexplicable connection to Greengrass, Goblins explain heritage and whatever....

And that was just the first chapter.

**** This is a prime example on how review count and favorites really isn't an indicator of quality at all. It's usually the opposite.

**** Yeah, exactly. Just to get the context, compare it with [[https://imgur.com/Uvuu71Y][this]] and it gets truly mind blowing.

** The only saving grace of this fic is that the "goblin revealing his heritage" scene was not included.

*** Sadly, it was mentioned though.

  "The Old Man. He's been keeping things from me. The goblins brought me in to explain my heritage to me when I was 13, while I was staying in Diagon Alley after I blew up my Aunt Marge. Dumbledore obliviated the knowledge from me after he found out because he didn't want me to be able to take my rightful place in the wizarding world.

**** Yeah, but at /least/ it wasn't the usual copypasted Lord Potter reveal scene.

So... 2/10 is what I give that pile of dung.
