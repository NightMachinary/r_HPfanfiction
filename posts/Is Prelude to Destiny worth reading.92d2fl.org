I read the prologue but it was pretty good. However, I'm afraid of reading it and not liking it later on. Is it the same with the rest of the fic? What are its upsides/downsides? Are tye characterisations down well? Is it like every other Jily fanfiction where Lily is the perfect Hogwarts girl and James the idiotic guy who worships the ground Lily walks on? Are the OC's Mary Sues? Is Petunia portrayed as the devil and Lily as the perfect angel?

Thanks for your help

******** I typically pick up the book, read the back, and open it up and start reading. I don't check Goodreads at all.
