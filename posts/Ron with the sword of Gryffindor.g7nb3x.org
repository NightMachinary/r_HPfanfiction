:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have this very distinct image of tons of dementors swarming the grounds (perhaps after the exams?) and Ron defending Hermione by holding off the dementors with the sword of Gryffindor. I think he even managed to disintegrate one of them. It could be a time travel fic, but I'm not sure. That scene is just super strong in my mind. Something about, "the dementors quailed before the Gryffindor's wrath that they had threatened his girlfriend." I think the story had a lot of battles in it. Thanks!


** Isn't that a scene in Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future's Past? I have no idea where to find it anymore since ffn removed it.

*** Dang it. I was hoping it wasn't nightmares of futures past. I love that one dearly, but it always breaks my heart that it's incomplete. Thanks!

** I don't really think this is the one you're looking for, but I do remember it having a scene where dementors were fought off in part with the Sword of Grffindor. And a time tuner was involved. After killing a dementor, the Sword gained the ability to suck out souls. Harry's afraid to touch the damn thing.

*** I was thinking of this one too. But turns out it's nightmares of futures past. I think I'll go back and read rune stone path again, though! Thanks!

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
