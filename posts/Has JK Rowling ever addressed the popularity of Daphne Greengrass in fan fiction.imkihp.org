I would be hard to fathom her not knowing that a character that is only mentioned once or twice in a 7 book series is wildly popular among a big chunk of HP fans.

** Harry/Daphne makes up 0.17% of AO3 HP stories, and Daphne is a main character in 0.58% of ffnet stories. I didn't even know she had a following until I wandered into this sub. She was probably more aware of people bugging her for details about Blaise Zabini back in the day.

** I think Daphne is just from reddit and dlp, I imagine the majority of fanfic readers (who only read Drarry and Dramione) don't know who she is
