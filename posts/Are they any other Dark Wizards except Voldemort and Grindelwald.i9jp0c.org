On par with Voldemort and Grindelwald? Perhaps they are located in other countries?


** If by Dark Wizards, you mean someone using dark magic (and generally being a bad guy), there are loads of them. Technically, all the Death Eaters (save maybe Wormtail) qualify as Dark Wizards, and there is probably a lot of people abrad pursuing some Dark Arts study without being a follower of Voldemort.

If by Dark Wizard, you mean someone gathering followers and waging war against one of several governments like Grinderwald and Voldemort did (I think the term "Dark Lord" would be more fitting), I don't think there are any currently in activity. Considering the level of cooperation between the wizards via the ICW, I doubt the world would have to deal with 2 world level menace at the same time without the British being informed, there may be some minor one (like a simple run of the mill terrorist and his bunch of goon) but far from Voldemort level. Magical history is probably full of Dark Witches and Wizards though (someone already mentioned Morgan le Fey, Ezekiel of Azkaban and maybe even Slytherin himself depending of how you look at things).

** Well if you want to go by Canon there is of course Morgan Le Fay the Arch-Enemy of Merlin, there is Ezkrezim(I think he is spelled that way?) The creator of Azkaban. Salazar Slyrtherin of course the whole Black and Lestragne Family. Not necessarily on par but powerful. Snape was also certainly a Powerful dark wizard. And there are many more in canon

*** It's Ekrizdis. It's a good list, and you can add in Herpo the Foul, who created basilisks and made the first horcrux.

***** Cadmus may be, but the other two just strike me as very phenomenal wizards. Also, is the Resurrection Stone strictly dark magic? Necromancy is after all magic of the dead.

****** Antioch had the Wand and the Three Brothers tale is a old story that has information that should be taken with a grain of salt. It would've been heavily altered as long as it was passed down.

The Resurrection Stone is mostly grey, souls can be temporarily brought into the corporeal world but they become uncomfortable and suffer if they spend too long there.

*** Salazar Slytherin being on the list is a bit up in the air, he was a person who lived in ancient history and as long as he was dead, the truth could be altered and forgotten.

He bred a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets but for a thousand years it hurt no-one until it was ordered to by Tom Riddle. He lived in a time where the mundane were actively hostile to magicals and the school the built was a castle, a literal fortress designed to protect its students.

And then there's the Forbidden Forest, and what lives in there? An acromantula colony, one that has no qualms attacking and eating students. What do they fear above all? The Basilisk.

The Basilisk might not be a simple monster-weapon for a racist to murder discriminated students. It was a deterrent and defence against attackers (both mundane and magical)and it was safe to the castle until a Parselmouth could find it and enslave it.

** Depends on the when you are asking about. At the time of canon? Maybe I dot. Think pottermore or Rowling explains this. If you if there have been dark lords like them then yes plenty

** No other dark lord is mentioned as being contemporaneous with Grindelwald or Voldemort in canon, but several make an appearance in accidental animagus & animagus at war. I haven't read much of it but i think in the latter part several dark lords and ladies team up in a rather clich√© supervillan way

** A Dark Wizard/Witch is just someone who learns and uses the Dark Arts extensively. That includes Voldemort himself, Herpo the Foul, Salazar Slytherin (probably), Crabbe, Malfoy, Bellatrix, Snape, and, more generally, all Death Eaters that we've seen.

How much Dark Arts one needs to do? It's subjective, just like there is no exact number of kilometres you must run per week before you are called "a runner". It's not actually illegal to practice the Dark Arts, so there is no need for a hard-and-fast definition.

In canon, "Dark Lord" was a title that Voldemort's followers and sympathisers used to refer to him in place of his name (sort of like "his majesty"), the way others used "You-Know-Who".

It is not, however, a generic title given to a powerful Dark Wizard or Witch or a leader who practices the Dark Arts. Grindelwald was a Dark Wizard, certainly, but he never called himself or was called a Dark Lord that we know.

** This is a big part of linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) and especially the sequel. At first it feels like a fix-fic, but then when the war actually starts heating up, you find that Voldemort has assembled a team.
