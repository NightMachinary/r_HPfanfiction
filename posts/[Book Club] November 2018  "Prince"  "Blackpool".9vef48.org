** Blackpool is probably my favourite new fic I've read this year. I love the theme of memories being changed and the unreliable narrator. My favourite part is the last chapter in the cave.

Highly recommend a read.

** Prince is beautifully written. It really is, the entire appeal of the story lies solely its style and nothing else.

Every element of the plot seems to be poorly planned out, and every character feels interchangeable. Everything just seems to be thrown aside to accommodate this focus on pretty writing.

The story itself has no substance whatsoever, but the language is pretty enough that it can hold up on it's own. However, it's just disappointing that there just isn't anything more to it than pleasantly constructed sentences and nice imagery. It's like vanilla extract, it sure smells nice, but tasting it is just disappointing.

** Blackpool is an absolute smash.

It really speaks to me as an older brother from a slightly abusive family. Puts Harry's abuse into perspective, and generally paints a new picture of what magical abuse might look like.

It makes Sirius into the most tragic figure of all time. Endures endless abuse, stays true to himself, saves(fic)/loses(canon) little brother, ... loses best friends, imprisoned in misery-prison for 10 years, meets godson, and dies.

From a storytelling perspective, I like that it is a HP-universe story that doesn't take place 95% in Hogwarts.

** Never understood the appeal of Prince. It reads more like poetry. Pretentious poetry, at that. I have zero interest in poetry. As prose, it's an exercise in tediousness.

** I liked Prince quite a bit, but it lacks substance. I figure with another 10-15k words the story would have been fleshed out a lot better, without losing its unique style. It still works, but it's just good instead of great.

*** Really really good. I cried my eyes out. The mystery that builds throughout really pulls you in. It was a pretty unique story too.

** I've started to read both of these twice and given up all four times.

My problem with Blackpool is twofold. Firstly, it's written in the present tense even though the story is in the past, although it contains flash-forwards to events that happened later than the scene being described but that are still in the past. Confusing?

Second, I grew up only a few miles from Blackpool and any attempt to romanticise it into anything more than a wind-swept, chip-strewn hellhole isn't going to fly for me. Yeah that's unfair but tough.

Prince... Oh boy. This has the same tense problem but it also has the problem that others have already mentioned that the prose is flowery way beyond acceptability.

My beef with using present tense to tell a story is that it's not what the present tense is for. A story is something that happened; something the storyteller is now relating to an audience. So you use a past tense, usually the perfect. The present tense is used for dialogue between characters or, occasionally, and if you know what you're doing, to narrate things like dreams where the author wants to pull the reader into the story and experience something along with a character.

If you're going to write something that deliberately ignores standard grammar then you have to know exactly what you're doing. I don't believe either of these stories work.

*** I know of two stories that pull off present tense reasonably well - though I'll grant that both authors slip up from time to time, especially with flashbacks etc, which often end up mixing tenses.

**** There are definitely some out there. But I should have been more specific: it's third-person, present tense that's the problem. A story with the protagonist acting as storyteller makes more sense: Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time is well-written, for instance, even if I'm not a fan of the plot.

** I'm late to this sorry - I'm going through the past bookclub threads in order to find good fics to read. Blackpool is exactly what I love in a fic - well written and plenty of angst, fills out the canon by exploring characters that are underwritten (though I also like AU stories). Thank you for all the recommendations.

** First time checking out /Blackpool/. Couldn't get into it. It's a novel's worth of words, but written like a one-shot, if that makes any sense. It looks nice enough, but my eyes just kept tripping over these sentences that are trying too hard to be evocative, while the characters and the plot don't have the substance to back up the pretty turns of phrase. That's harder to notice in a one-shot; it doesn't work when stretched out for nearly 70k. It feels oddly twee for a dark fic, too.

/Prince/ ... well, this is my third or fourth time trying to read /Prince/. My issues with it are similar to /Blackpool/: style over plot. The writing is tighter, though, and the stylistic choices are more excusable in a full AU. But it's main problem is one that's the opposite of the other fic -- it reads like the condensed version of what should be a longer story.

Edit: Could not finish either of them.
