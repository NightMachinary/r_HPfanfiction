Each chapter had a different Harry in the Resurrection scene. E.g. Slytherin Harry, Dark Harry, Ravenclaw Harry.

I'm only pretty sure that those were ones that were done. It's been a long time since I read it.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.
