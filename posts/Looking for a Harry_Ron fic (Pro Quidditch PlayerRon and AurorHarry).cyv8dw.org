:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's an old fic that was very dear to my heart, but I can't find it anywhere, so I'm hoping someone here can help me. In this story, Harry and Ron had been together for years, but Ron is terrified of making it public, and he pretends to be single. Harry gets fed up with it one night when he sees Ron getting kissed by a groupie (even though he knows Ron doesn't care about her), and when he leaves, Ron is terrified by the thought that Harry may not come back, and he immediately comes out of the closet over it. Harry, meanwhile, had told his coworkers because, as an Auror, their lives were literally on the line.

Does this ring a bell for anyone? One memorable sequence from it was when Ron was talking to his team captain and said he was keeping his relationship quiet because his partner was famous, his captain replied, "HE'S famous? Who the hell is he, Harry Potter?"


** I haven't read it, but I hope somebody has the link because now I want to.
