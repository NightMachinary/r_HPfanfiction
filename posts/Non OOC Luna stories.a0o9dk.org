I love Luna, but so many fanfics have her as either faking her oddness to be cunning or what not, or portrayed as over the top naive and incapable of using a full sentence without the word nargle. I love that the Luna in the book is whimsical but still an intelligent functional person...


** I liked her portrayal in linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love by billowsandsmoke)

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

***** No, you don't need to be concerned about it at all. It's a funny/then kind of bittersweet/sad canon compliant story with no hints of romance or anything like that. They are both in character and it's from Snapes POV as he tells the story of his interactions with Luna at Hogwarts. It never goes beyond a mutual friendship/understanding that doesn't go anywhere.

** Luna is slightly toned down, but still rather bizarre, in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past). The author explained that since Harry met and befriended her sooner, she hadn't gone through years of bullying and was therefore not quite so far out there. But still very quirky.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?
