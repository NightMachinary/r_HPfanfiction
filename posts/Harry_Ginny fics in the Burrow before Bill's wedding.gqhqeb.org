I've read Ginny and the HBP. Looking for anything within that time where Harry's at the Burrow after his sixth year.

​

Thanks!

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** Not From Others [linkffn(Not From Others by FloreatCastellum)] has some Ginny/Harry moments from before Bill's wedding. It's strictly canon compliant. It's also a better depiction of Deathly Hallows from Ginny's point of view than those 2 chapters in GW and HBP, in my opinion.
