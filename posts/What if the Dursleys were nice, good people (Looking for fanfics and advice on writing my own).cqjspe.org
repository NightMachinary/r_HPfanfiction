So I really want to write a fic where Harry is raised by kind loving versions of the Dursleys, I think it would really open up some interesting changes and dynamics in the story and characters. I thought I should start by reading any stories already published that have good! Dursley family, to see what I do and don't like about other versions and what I'll want to follow or avoid in my own. So far the closest I'm coming up on for a nice Dursley family is the infamous HPMOR where Petunia marries a muggle professor and there's no Vernon or Dudley. Are there any others out there that I'm missing out on that I should maybe read? Do you have any tips for me? What do YOU think would change about the series and Harry as a character if he were raised in a healthier but still very muggle environment?

Thanks for your help!


** Most of stories with good Dursleys have exactly this part just horribly written ... e.g., linkffn(13161688) ... it is like suddenly Vernon slaps his face and cries “Oh G*d, to love Harry, not hate him! That's the right attitude!”, and then suddenly they are lovely parents. It would be completely awesome, if some conversion/repentance story of Dursleys was written, but I have to find one which is not completely horrible.

I have just finished so I may be still in the story afterglow, but linkffn(2531438) seems like a decent one. At least it doesn't pretend some conversion, Vernon goes to the Hell, but then he gets another chance to return to the Lilly & James's wedding and to start again. The story is more about “what would happen if Harry was risen in the normal family environment”, but contrary to many others it is not revived James & Lilly or Sirius or somebody else, but Dursleys who do it.

  At age seven, Harry wants to control his "freakishness". A book in the library calls to him. He finds that he needs to get stronger in order to control what is probably magic that causes all those unexplained events near him. That brings some unexpected changes to his life. Petunia, [Harry, Hermione]

  Vernon changed in the beginning to be a better man, thanks to a wish. How will this affect Harry, and the entire Wizarding World? Now complete! Please R&R. AU, HPGW, RWHG, RLNT
