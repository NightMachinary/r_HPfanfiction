Hey y'all!!

Im just wondering if anyone has fics about the golden trio's friendship and just them bonding and being kids/teens.

I really feel that we didn't get enough and I need some happy friendship fluff right now.

Open for any ship, but I'm mostly looking for shorter fics. I don't mind ships with poly but im mostly here for platonic relationships.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

  A humorous one-shot in which Hermione challenges Ron as to which one of them is truly Harry's Best Mate.
