** For some reason I am thinking of Harry being like Doctor Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins) from season one of /Westworld/.

He never raised his voice or overtly threatened anyone but one word or look could make him terrifying.

**** It was disturbing when he was talking to that lady in the restaurant/cantina and you don't realize he, without a word or gesture, froze all the Hosts until the wineglass overflows. It really gave you the impression that he was a god among mortals.

** I always imagined the same about Voldemort... but I guess a Dark!Harry could do to. Charming and pleasant with his followers, sometimes even sympathetic to his victims but knows that things have to be done. Sort of like Tony Soprano or Vito Corleone.

** Reminds me of that one where Harry can control shadows. It's slash with Harry/Theo Nott (I think).

Harry can be very ruthless and he mostly wants to be left alone but ends up with marked followers cause he's also very protective of his friends and people wanted in on that.

Can't remember the name or author, but I'll try to find it.
