So after reading too many stories where Harry has no issues "robbing Death Eaters blind" but conveniently leaves them alive so they can still cause problems later, I wondered if there are any stories where he wins the war by copying Intelligence Agencies.

I don't care if Harry goes on an NKWD like purge and starts executing Slytherins for "treason against the Motherland", bugs Malfoy Manor, goes full Mossad and uses bombs to deal with Voldemort, uses satellite surveillance or delivers Draco's balls in a box to Lucius, I just want to read something new. Hell, I'd take Lily sharing a bottle of Vodka with a KGB agent and them taking care of Voldemort before Harry was even born.

Please no slash, Death Eater revisionism and preferably no Ron/Hermione.
