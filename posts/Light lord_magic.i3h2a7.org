So many of the fictions you read talk about Harry becoming a dark lord and the big powerful shield are always dark magic, I.e. the unforgivables fed by dark emotions. Why is it that the only lights spell (powered by good emotions) is the patronus and nothing else particularly interesting. I want to see some antithesis of the dark lord where there are difficult spells only used by the most powerful of light Wizards. So what I'm looking for is the light lord fics to my dark lord fics. Skywalker to my Anakin.


** I'm very interested in something like this. Sounds cool.

** The Fidelus is fueled by trust. Complicated healing spells are probably fuelled by kindness and good intentions. Animating great statues to the protection of innocents, cleaning a reservoir of pollutants, regrowing a devastated forest, holding back a natural disaster, all could be done by a benevolent lord. Magic has the potential to be beautiful and kind. In my fics, I like to let it.

** In The Arithmancer Hermione develops an entire set of new light spells for exorcizing Horcruxes, destroying Dementors, etc, also some light attack spells. Although whether a charm that shoots a blinding laser at your opponent's eyes is truly "light" depends on which definition of the word you use.
