*Weapon system:* My idea is for the Mages to create mass drivers that utilize portkeys to transit past shields while negating that advantage by using ship movement to make a mass interact with a deflector shield before the portkey can activate.

Kinda debating also using magicite(my fanon substance which is basically magic that has been solidified and is used to power the enchantments on items[to enchant an item you engrave a runic array that matches the spell, embed the magicite in the array, then cast the spell. Doing it this way the spell runic array makes the enchantment permanent and the magicite powers it perpetually, otherwise it will eventually wear off]) as the mass used so that it can be used in a magic/antimagic reaction that simulates matter/antimatter but more chaotic than explosive, causing strange events unless specific spells are enchanted into the magicite like an expulso curse. Thoughts?

*Enemy:* In TNG's Conspiracy, we're introduced to the body-snatching claymation bugs that send off a request for backup but are then forgotten.

In DS9, the Shapeshifters are beaten back.

And in TNG and the films, the Borg are left to keep coming back.

My idea is to combine the Borg, the bugs, and the shapeshifters into eldritch horrors that can take any form they need, including using their own forms to create their ships and technology instead, and when they assimilate, they use the body for energy/reaction mass to convert it into the fluidic form they now have thanks to their assimilating the Founders. The bugs now control the hivemind as their main queen has been partially assimilated and is the new Borg Queen where as the queen from Conspiracy was just a drone-queen kind of, beholden to the planet sized queen that all drone-queens are born from.

So, anyway, thoughts on how I can make this idea better?

One of the things I'm trying to show is that while Harry's people fear the potential of a new Malleus Maleficarum set against them, they're slowly turning into an Imperial Inquisition of the Warhammer 40k setting but in the STverse without realizing it.


** Couple of questions: Have you considered flipping the magicite substance to the enemy? You could make it like... some Voyager species that was harvesting organs from "aliens" to prolong their life... So the magic needs to be "harvested" from magic users. Or you could have Harry in the dark of the origins of magicite and have him wrestle with using the magicite to destroy the enemy, or allowing the enemy to win .

What about having a group of metamophagi be the infiltrators to the eldritch? Have them learn occlumency in order to safely infiltrate the enemy. (Have Harry be good at human transfiguration. You could make it be a response to being the BWL and wanting to be able to be around other witches/wizards incognito)

Or I'm missing something...

*** That style of magicite would require me rewriting 12 chapters and six already posted because i've already established magicite as something mages make as practice, to 'stretch' their ability to cast magIc as well as established as enchantment material.

The eldritch infiltrators is kind of a bad idea. These are the borg still. Giving them access to magic is... suicidal. It's linkffn(a trek to the stars) to see what i have so far

  When Harry Potter is rescued from a planet he spent centuries on alone, he's happy to find his kind still exist on their new world but he exiles himself amongst the muggles of the Federation, hunting for something. Then when his one friend amongst them is murdered, Harry contacts the one group that knows of his abilities and offers his help. For a price.

**** But would they have access to magic if the witch/wizard was employing occlumency? They wouldn't be part of the collective, they wouldn't actually be assimilated.

***** Harry's no longer the stupid kid he was at seventeen, dumb enough to pull the same shit seven of nine's parents did. He's seen and met victims of the borg. And placing his people in that kind of danger would be irresponsible. And the borg have been nearly genocided in this by picard's introduction of topological anomaly so they no longer ignore those that seem low tech and assimilate anything they can to rebuild their numbers.

So if they assimilated callie lightbottom, all of a sudden they have information about humans able to violate laws of physics with a wave of a wand. Resistance would be futile for the whole universe if they could assimilate two billion people capable of such feats.

****** What about obliviating the sensitive memories, leaving only enough to finish the mission?
