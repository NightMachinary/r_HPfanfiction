:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, I am looking for a fanfic that I read a really long time back, so I am not very clear on the details. But, Hermione has an elder sister in this who takes over custody for her after their parents die and she gets visions, even though apparently she is a muggle.

Through the visions, she recognises Remus and helps him and Harry and take him away from the Dursleys and they start to live together. Eventually they also free Sirius and he gets reunited with Amelia Bones. Hermione's sister turns out to be a bonafide seer, who makes true prophecies and gets hints about what is going to happen in the future.

This helps them defeat Voldemort and Fenrir and at the same time stabilise the magical world, bringing unity and peace there. They later find out the visions had been sent by the four founders who have basically been the custodians of the magical world since they died and they offer the same opportunities to the group of marauders and their family for the future.

I have tried looking for the fic but I can't find it anywhere. It's been a long time, so I might have some details missing or gone wrong but if anyone has a clue. Please, help me find that fic.


** This sounds like the Dangerverse. It's not Amelia Bones but an OC called Aletha Freeman who marries Sirius. There are five or six books in total I believe, book 1 is linkffn(Living With Danger)

** “Living with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow” linkffn(2109424) is really nice, but with the following parts of the series, it drags on and on and on. I have never managed to read through the whole thing.

**** The first part certainly, especially the pre-Hogwarts years are very original and lovely. I cannot say that anything later is really bad, but it is just too long, and gradually it feels less original.

***** I start to get bogged down in I think third year. It just gets so long and wordy, it's tedious. I like it, and I like the characters enough to slog through it once every couple years, but it is rather.
