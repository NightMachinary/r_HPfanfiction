So in linkffn(trek to the stars by cole pascal), harry rather foolishly builds a casino ship to be his new personal ship only to realize that most of the times when he needs his ship it's nowhere near Ignotus. So he goes to his shipwrights and says "i need a new ship because i'm an idiot." Money exchanges hands due to bets over when he would realize his mistake, he's teased, yatta, yatta, yatta.

So then he's told that his people have already been designing him a new ship utilizing a hull they used as a prototype to test everything out which makes him happy his people were thinking ahead.

Here's my problem: the ship is a shapeshifting one, utilizing what is basically the same skill tonks had but right now calling it metamorphmineralus, stone and alloys infused with magicite that gives it the ability to take on the alloy signature of any alloy that is included in the mixture. Fairly useful, right?

But also potentially overpowered. This story takes place during the sttng era but in the abramsverse so the shipwrights have the specs of his k'vort class flagship, the vengeance from into darkness(plan to use the excuse "a second vengeance was built as a prototype and lost during testing, only for it to be found by unknowns"), and the shipwright boss having violated the temporal prime directive while aboard a ship and had high res scans of a future ship and samples of its alloys due to its battle damage.

So that's my issue: the time ship is plot-necessary for an upcoming event. The bird of prey is a ship already known to be commanded by harry. But is it being able to look like the vengeance too wish fulfillmenty?


** Not sure why he would want the ship to look like a Vengeance. As a morphing ship, its appearance is camouflage and misidentification but overall the underlying capacity and drive profiles shouldn't be variable. He'd be better off having it default to a rusty old bird-of-prey (used by Klingon and Romulan fleets in TOS) that he could pass off as a captured raiding ship. Low crew needs and unassuming... with a Cloak of invisibility. How much more Harry can you get?

*** His owning and using a bird of prey is a known event already, he painted it bone white and named it H'dweg. He bought it and another ship, nominally for use in picket duty, after a pretty wild party that bound him fairly close to an old high caste klingon family and used it to travel to earth once already. Typical Harry luck after drinking too much klingon hooch. It would be the default ship.

The master shipwright would be the one who is installing the ship profiles, not Harry, he's just going to be surprised by the new ship. He was going to be expecting to wait a year or so due to design and build time or have to purchase a new one from somewhere that doesn't keep bugging it.

As for drive profiles and capacity: in the magical world, external shape doesn't need to conform to internal capacity, see a mokeskin pouch, the room of requirement, the weasleys's car's capacity, and so on. Drive profiles can also be futzed with by multiple engines held in abeyance by magic and swapped in and out on the fly.

** From a literary standpoint the question becomes does this ew feature resolve conflicts without tension? If so, then yes, it is overpowered. If this is simply a tool in Harry's kit then it's not overpowered.

Power level really doesn't matter in entertainment. What matters is tension and resolution. The more tension builds, the more rewarding the resolution is. In order for tension to be believable the power of the protagonist needs to not overshadow the problems being faced, or forgotten about because they are inconvenient.

*** The universe will soon be at war. That it will be losing.

The time ship is necessary to deal with some accidental time travelers. The bird of prey conforms to known events. I liked the idea of the Vengeance because Harry's a relic himself though an infinitesimal amount of people outside his own know this. His piloting a Vengeance clone that has to be refitted constantly during a war that subsumes at LEAST the alpha and beta quadrants felt somewhat poetic and a prime number is better due to the numerology inherent in the hpverse.

  Exiled for three centuries on a barren rock, Harry's saved by the crew of the Enterprise D. He makes it to the colony world his people planned to go to and finds they're just as insular as ever though Hermione and his friends set them on a better course. Their nuclear option, though, left Harry with no escape. A prophecy is once again in play and he's the Chosen One. Again.
