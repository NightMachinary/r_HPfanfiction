I've been in a fanfiction slump for the last couple of months. For whatever reason, nothing is piquing my interest-good, bad, guilty pleasure, whatever. Instead I've been reading books, baking, and watching anime, but I miss it. I think I'll also get back into kung fu.

Does this happen to you? What do you do when you can't read fanfiction? Can you jumpstart it with a favorite author or story? If none of this applies to you, what are your other hobbies?

**** Am I the only one that didn't like that series? I worked through the first 'book' but quit while reading the second. The headmistress seemed worse than Dumbledore in canon, first years were using Bubble-Head charms (you know, the charm Harry couldn't master in fourth year) and the main character made weird decisions I just didn't understand (not telling the headmistress that she was trying to /stop/ a fight, instead of joining it, up to the point that she actually stopped her friend from mentioning that).

***** Riversz, the way to read Alexandra Quick is to not read it as a Harry Potter fanfic, but more as a standalone original fic series, which it almost is.

Also, the second and third books are miles better than the first - you should retry it.

***** No, you're not. Despite the apparent consensus, a decent number of people have tried the first book and not been inclined to go any further.

That being said, I'm not one of them. I'm surprised that the second book put you off, though given it's easily the most popular of them all.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

**** Try [[http://www.hulu.com/flcl][FLCL]] and [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/gunbuster-2][Gunbusters 2]] -- both are short 6-ep series but you'll see a lot concepts and visuals developed in them that later made their ways into Gurren Lagann and Evangelion Reboot.

Not necessarily your thing, but some classics: [[http://www.hulu.com/death-note][Death Note]], [[http://www.hulu.com/claymore][Claymore]], [[http://www.hulu.com/ghost-in-the-shell-stand-alone-complex][Ghost in the Shell: SAC]], [[http://www.hulu.com/fullmetal-alchemist][Fullmetal Alchemist]], [[http://www.hulu.com/moribito-guardian-of-the-spirit][Moribito]], [[http://www.hulu.com/rod-the-tv][R.O.D. the TV]], and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (streaming anywhere?).

If you thought you might try some shoujo-ish titles I'd recommend Princess Tutu, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Azumanga Daioh, Haibane Renmei, and Kamichu!.
