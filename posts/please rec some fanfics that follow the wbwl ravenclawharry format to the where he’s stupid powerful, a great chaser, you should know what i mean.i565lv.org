  Voldemort has risen once more! Harry Potter and his friends must battle the forces of Darkness, a corrupt Ministry and a Headmaster who has plans of his own. Starts during summer before 5th year, and features proactive Marauding/Slytherin Harry. Rated M to be safe as there will be violence, language and suggestive themes. Title needs work and am accepting suggestions for new one.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.
