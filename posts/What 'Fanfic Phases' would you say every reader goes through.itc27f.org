Pretty much everyone on here knows Harry Crow and Methods of Rationality. We have all read about 'emerald eyes' and 'raven locks'. Most of us have probably had Drarry or Dramione phases. WBWL, time travel, Rosarchs Blot - there's a lot of shared experiences in the HP Fanfic community.

So what are all the different phases a HP reader goes through? All the different tropes and pairings - is there a classical order you think most people go through? What has your personal journey looked like?


** The way you're describing them, I didn't have hp fic "phases." I started off reading Drarry and Wolfstar... and I still read Drarry and Wolfstar. I think sometimes you can get really into a certain trope for a short while, but for the most part I just read whatever I stumble upon that sounds interesting. Since I almost exclusively read ship fics, I haven't read much in the way of big name gen fics, and I definitely haven't read any big name fics for ships I'm not interested in.

** Phase 1 The Newbie:

Your new to the fandom so you will literally consume anything that is long. Maybe it's a Slytherin Harry story?

Phase 2 Romace Dawn:

Here you find a pairing. Most often new fanfic readers tend to go towards there trashy Harry/Daphne cookie cutter combo and consume all of that medium. They can consume 300k words in a day if they try.

Phase 3 Edge Lord:

So you read some Dumbledore bashing Harry/Daphne. Well what's next? What!? Wrong Boy Who Lived with lots of bashing and drama, sign me the fuck up! These readers tend to start to develop their hardest but are still very primitive.

Phase 4 experimental:

This phase is the widest as most readers here tend to go and find recommendations. No longer are they filtering through ffn or ao3 for the most popular or ship but instead tend to see what other people recommend a lot. They can also become extremely interested into crossover fics and start to forget the original HP fandom for a little bit.

Phase 5 The Elitist:

These readers tend to think there tastes are above the rest. Their OTP is right and the rest are wrong, if they don't like a fic they will write a whole essay on reddit explaining why it was bad and generally downvote things they don't like the sound of. Stay away from them at all costs!

Phase 6 The Burnt:

After a few years of reading you've eventually found one or two currently updating fics and are hoping they won't be abandoned. You have been burnt out from reading too much and all the recommendations you have read at least twice so nothing new surprises you, but as a former elitist you won't start a story with less than 50k. Eventually you stop reading all together.

Phase 7 Rebirth:

After some months or maybe years away you return to see the fics that you were keeping up to date on before. They might have finished, or they might have been abandoned. Point is your spark has been revived. You read through them through the beginning along with some of your favourites as you eventually repeat back to step 1, a newcomer to a new era.

** Yeah I think you're trying to classify what can't really be classified. I think we mostly go our own ways depending on what we like. And then what happens to be recommended or popular.

Myself personally started off more Harmony, but got bored because it was the same exact story for the most part in most and I've bounced all over trying different ones out.... Haven't really liked Dramiones because most are god awful( shout out to lena phoria for actually good ones) most Harems are awful and a lot of popular fics are awful because it's over the top bashing for the most part. I stay away from dark Harry because that's not the story I want to read

So I really just look and pray and hope that a good one crosses my path

** I don't really think there's a typical phase every reader goes through.

I never read Harry Crow or Methods of Rationality. Although, I did read excerpts of the latter to laugh at the horrid science within.

I never liked Drarry or Dramione.

To be honest, when I started reading, I started with the same guidelines I do now, only they were less strict. When I started, I would read the occasional story that I would laugh at now. But I never read slash, or bashing fics, en masse.

** Depends on 1) where you start and 2) what you like. People start with MOR and Harry Crow and all because they're the most famous, and they're what pops up when you go to FFN and sort by favorites.

I started reading HP fanfic because I wanted to read an original story set in Wizarding America, and since Alexandra Quick was so good I decided to keep reading. I think I read all of White Squirrel next and then went through kind of a Severitus phase and a next-gen phase. There was definitely a WBWL phase as well.

These days I don't really care what I read; I definitely don't read anywhere near as much fanfic as I did two or three years ago, and I don't have the time to spend hours browsing FFN like I used to. So I usually read stuff only on high recommendation, which means the genres I read are a lot more diverse now. Going through Slide's Anguis series right now and loving it!

** I'd say it's less set phases and more... Set archetypes. So like, the inciting incident for liking the fandom, whether it be a particular trope or particular pairing, and then over time branching out from that initial interest.

I was in LOTR fandom before HP, so I already knew my tastes a bit. And when I was a kid I hated Harry (lol) so I read exclusively Snape/Lily and Snape/Remus. And then as time went on, and my appetite for fics exceeded the quantity I could find, I branched out into other things. Tried some Drarry, tried a bunch of other random pairings, tried some OC fics. I read like 10 chapters of HPMOR and stopped. I eventually developed more interest in genfics which focused on adoption/found family/etc and now I don't read very much, I'm just writing my own longfic about it.

So I think the shared evolution between fans is not of genre per se, but merely "singular focus" to "broader focus".

** Honestly I've never read Harry Crow or Methods of Rationality (although I have heard of both). I have read My Immortal and Partially Kissed Hero though.

I have read about emerald eyes and raven locks, although they sound stupid.

Never read Drarry unless its Fem!Draco; and I've never read a Dramione since I dislike Draco and Hermione anyway. Exceptions are where they are a minor pairing in a fic.

I've read loads of WBWL and Time Travel fics though. Enjoyed several. I think I have read Rosarchs Blot.

My journey however started with Oh God Not Again simply because it was recommended, and quickly went into Harry/Daphne. I have been into Haphne ever since.

*** Harry Crow is... a power fantasy, with Harry about as Mary Sue-ish as it is possible to be, with very one-dimensional supporting characters and antagonists, and with very strong opinions about some aspects of canon. If you agree with those opinions, and you enjoy seeing Harry stomp his enemies, you might like it. Personally, I struggled through the first ten chapters, so that I could say I had given it a fair chance, and I've been happy not to continue.

Methods of Rationality is written first and foremost to be educational, second to be entertaining, and thirdly as a Harry Potter story. It is cleverly written, has excellent spelling and grammar, and plenty of humour, but Harry is nothing like his canon personality at all (for in-story reasons), and is in fact quite condescending and arrogant to most people. (In fairness, part of the educational aspect of the story is that his arrogance comes back to bite him, repeatedly and severely; he very nearly hands the world to Voldemort on a platter, then comes within a hair's breadth of outright destroying the planet, by almost publishing magical knowledge that could be used to create superweapons, and the final chapter has him mentally kicking himself for being such an idiot, and recognising that he has a lot of growing up to do in order to become what he needs to be.) Don't read it as light entertainment, but if you're interested in food for thought, then I recommend it.

** I've always been interested in canon compliant stories and extremely rarely read anything outside of that. I think that's seen as a "new to fanfic" type thing, but here I am several years later and still no interest in some of the more popular stories talked about here.

** I think a lot of people go through a bashing phase before they've taken the time to really research one of the characters, and then figure that the situation was completely different from what they thought. At least, it was like that for me.
