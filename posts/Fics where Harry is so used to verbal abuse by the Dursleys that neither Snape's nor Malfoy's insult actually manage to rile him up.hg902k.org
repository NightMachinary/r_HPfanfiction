Like maybe Harry completely ignore Malfoy's insults and Snape's attempts at intimidation because "Meh, I've had worse" and this just results in Snape and Malfoy escalating into the ridiculous?


** I can imagine Snape escalating to the point that he's not paying attention to his surroundings and a nearby McGonagall grabs him by the ear and starts scolding him

"Severus Snape! I never-, just a student-, how dare... not too old to be put over my knee..." and just sputtering in fury

** There's a currently updating fic on ffn called "Harry is a Dragon and that's OK". It includes what you're asking for but it's so much more. Harry is unfailingly polite, personable and proactive. It roughly follows canon but much of the usual in-school drama just doesn't happen.

**** "Joy" is a good choice of words. After reading canon and so many fics where Harry is full of angst and there's all this drama and tension, I just love this one because Harry's kind and warm and just so damn sensible. And that attitude defuses most of the usual drama.

  "How come /you/ can just say that, then?" Dean asked.

***** Having read further - this Harry is not so ridiculously overpowered as in Enter the Dragon (where he is large and strong enough to destroy mountains, has near-perfect magical defence, and so much magical power that he overloads every spell), but he is in a softer and gentler world. Enter the Dragon is a crossover with Shadowrun, and is bubbling with all the horrific abuses of magic that are possible, from blood sacrifices to enthralled human trafficking.

Both are interesting stories in different ways.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
