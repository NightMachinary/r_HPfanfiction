Where Harry somehow ends up back in time or lily ends up forwards.

There's one I'm trying to find where Harry goes back in time somehow and moves next to Lily's house, he sets up wards and trains lily. (that's all I remember)

*** After a quick glance through chapter one I can confirm this is almost definitely bad.

  She repeated my vow and we were now able to fully trust each other. The vow now meant that I can't allow her to be dosed with a love potion. It also means that I will need to make sure she ends up with a man who won't harm her. I am already falling in love with her because of everything I know about her from her journal. I don't trust anyone but myself.
#+end_quote

The actual vow in question

#+begin_quote
  “I Harry Planter swear on my magic that I will never willingly cause or allow harm to come to Lily Evans.”
#+end_quote

Yeah. This is pretty stupid. They have been talking for like a minute at this stage.

  She at first appeared shocked before grinning widely and throwing herself at me. She kissed me hard on the mouth while hugging me. I tasted strawberries on her lips like she had just been eating the tasty fruit. I felt her breasts and hard nipples pressed against me.
#+end_quote

And that's about 5 minutes in. I'm done.

** Another great fic where Harry meets Lily and trains her:

linkffn(4196344).

And might I suggest that you should change the title a bit. It looks like your asking for a romantic pairing.

** Thank god you are not asking for Harry/Lily pairing.

There are plenty of good Harry meeting Lily stories. My favorite is *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855). In this one, Harry went back to 1975 and turned Bellatrix. The story is creative, credible, funny, and contains tons of intrigues. [[/spoiler][There are lots of actions involving the Marauders, including Lily competing against Bellatrix for Harry's affection]]

Another one of my favorites is *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925). Here Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna travelled to an alternate dimension in which things were significantly better. The last third of the story was basically written in Lily's POV.

**** Honestly after finding some non-romantic fanfics they're beginning to come above romantic simply because it focus's more on plot, from what I've found. I still like the smut/romantic fanfics but every once in a while its nice to take a break and just read a story not smut.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
