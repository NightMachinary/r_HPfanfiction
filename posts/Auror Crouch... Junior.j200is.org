Theory/Prompt

Barty Crouch Junior was an auror, apprenticed to Alastor Moody before Tonks, and colleagues with Frank and Alice.

When Snape brought half of the prophecy to Voldemort and he determined the short list of people who had ever defied him and survived three times, he asked his Death Eaters to find out which ones were expecting children.

Barty and Peter told him about the Longbottoms and the Potters respectively. While Peter was close friends with the Potters and was able to betray them more directly, Barty was only friendly acquaintances with the Longbottoms, and instead could only bring a few of the Death Eaters hunting for them.

Maybe Barty was assigned as part of the protection for them. Maybe Lily was the secret keeper for the Longbottoms and after she was killed, Barty was able to remember their address.

Barty got 12 O.W.L.s and his father was head of the DMLE, so it is not unreasonable that he may have been pressured to pursue a career as an Auror, and Voldemort could have encouraged that to have someone above suspicion in the Aurors.

Could also see the Crouch family being multi-generation Slytherin.

I think a lot could be done on this premise. Feel free to use it or not.


** I can absolutely see Sr as a Slytherin, but I've always thought that Ravenclaw fitted Jr better. And yes, I suspect that there would have been pressure, certainly to join the Ministry at least. I think all of the Aurors seen on screen have long coats as well, don't they? And Jr did have one.
