Ok, so I've read this fanfic ages ago and cannot seem to find it (with my luck its deleted ...) Things I remember: HP/DM happened at the end BUT HP talks to SS (i think in the dungeons) and SS is embarrased/shy/looking away and it looks like the sequel will work towards HP/DM/SS throughout the fic there is always this feeling, that SS/HP <3 each other, though HP/DM is genuine too. So ... I think it might also be a 7th year fic ... There seemed to be a sequel (which I never read) and which I hope to find, too :) It was plotty and angsty and def. in the higher word count region. (maybe 40k+) Thats it. Ideas?
