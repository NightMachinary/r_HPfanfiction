Hey! A couple months ago I started a fic called paid to burn- about a sociopath Hermione who assassinates her pureblood classmates for money in order to pay for her internship (Pm for more info)- but I wasn't interested in the direction it was going so I took it off of ao3. Now I am doing massive editing on it and I could really use some help. PM me if you are interested- also please be a native English speaker who lives in America(just because of time zones). Thank you!
