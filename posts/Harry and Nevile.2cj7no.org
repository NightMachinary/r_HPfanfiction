Can any one recommend a good story which has a strong friendship between Harry and Nev? I can never seem to find any, and I love the idea of them having a James - Sirius type thing going on.


** I have always loved [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux][The Marriage Contracts]]. Harry and Neville work together to defeat Voldemort and then spend months trolling Dumbledore about how they succeeded.

*** I just read that now, and wow it was pretty good. How they got rid of Voldemort was pretty good.

** I'm pretty sure I recommended this one in a similar thread a while ago but I enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/][The Dark Lord's Equal]].

  Summary: Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

Disclaimer- the author borrows a ton of ideas from other fanfic authors so if that puts you off here's your fair warning. Despite that it's a story about a pretty badass Harry and Neville and it pulls it off really well.

At least he freely admits to doing so (and goes so far as to include quotes from some of his favorite sources). This puts him ahead of many.

When Harry receives his letter, his once painful existence turns into something resembling happiness. But when he gets to Hogwarts, the unusual abilities of the Sorting Hat call attention to what he was subjected to at the Dursley house, stopping the sorting, his subjection to the Dursley's, and all of Dumbledore's carefully laid plans concerning Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.

It's in its early stages, definitely, so I understand if it's not something you're interested in.
