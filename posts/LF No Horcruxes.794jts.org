A long time ago I read a fic that was written after OotP was released but before HBP and enjoyed a story that followed the prophecy but, for obvious reasons, didn't have horcruxes. So now I'm looking for more of the same. With/without pairings is fine. Any rating is fine. Just looking for a well written, complete, story that has Harry defeat Voldemort without having to hunt horcruxes.


** Linkffn(To Shape and Change) Harry is a natural parselmouth, there are no horcruxes, just some implied highly dark rituals that allowed Voldemort to cheat death once.

Linkffn(Shattered Prophecy) Horcruxes mean nothing to an Old God in the Fade.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** Linkffn(2163835) and the sequel, Linkffn(2460564)

The Refiner's Fire is the fic that got me into fanfiction. There are a few tropes, but when it was written those tropes were either brand new or didn't exist yet. Refiner's Fire was finished before HBP came out, and Time of Destiny completely disregards Horcruxes (and obviously, Hallows). Hope you enjoy!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746/1/Harry-Potter-and-Godric-s-Legacy][Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy]], linkffn(5270746), does not have Horcruxes, but Voldemort used something even worse to maintain his immortality.

Voldemort still used Horcruxes in both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542;11910994), but in such a way that trying to hunt them down would absolutely fail. Instead, protagonists destroyed him via alternate means.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
