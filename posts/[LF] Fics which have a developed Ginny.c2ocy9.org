I would prefer no slash, no 12 year olds dating, no bashing, and no alternate houses. Just a Ginny that gets into the group and contributes to the dynamic. I would prefer it start earlier than the goblet of fire. Ron and Hermione shouldn't be bashed, but issues are fine and are preferred.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has done a good job bringing Ginny earlier into the group, but she's not the main character in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]], linkffn(6919395), is excellent when it comes to Ginny's character development, but she's in a different house.

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

*** I keep getting rec'd the first fic, even though the second is always a good read, Slytherin fics are always a bit iffy for. Thank you!

** This is an extremely well written crossover fic with Pok√©mon by Mr. Chaos. Kind of follows the HP stations of canon though. It has sequels btw. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9305868/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Master-s-Ball]]

** Have you looked into the Dangerverse? The whole Ministry Six is developed really well. You just have to get through the first book, which is still /good/ if you ask me, but not up to snuff with the later years. Ginny is pretty great in it. I almost like it better than cannon, and the whole series has a lot of heart.

** Just working my way through the series starting with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter by Sorcerer's Muse) and I am on the fourth book and so far I am excited for it (just, as 90% of all fanfiction, it is in severe need of trimming it down). By far the best from retellings of whole canon I have read so far.

#+begin_quote
  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.
