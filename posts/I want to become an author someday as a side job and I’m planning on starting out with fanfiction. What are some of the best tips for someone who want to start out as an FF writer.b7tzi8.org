** Well, those are some big, multi-answered questions you've got there. I've spent far more time reading than I have writing fanfic in the 17ish years I've been around fanfic, but I'll see if I can help.

​

Broadly, the answer to all your questions depend on you, what you're trying to create, and what you learn works for you. But I'm not going to make that my only answer.

In order:

-This really is different for everybody. As you're starting, try out a few different styles, and find out which helps you create a result you're happy with. Some people write out full-fledged outlines, with Chapters, paragraph summaries, arc summaries, character bios, etc. Having such a detailed and thought-out outline can help you through the slow tedious parts, and help make sure you don't contradict yourself later in the story, or create plot holes. Whereas some people (like me) write a rough outline of where I want the characters to be by certain points, and major plot points, and just write as I go. Can confirm, you may have to scrap large portions if you write yourself into a corner with this method.

​

-Depends on how much free time you have. You also don't want to get sick of it. Spending so much time on it you're starting to dread sitting down to write? Take a break. This is fully under your control.

-I don't read too much when I'm actively writing a story. I don't like to influence my story by inadvertently lifting someones good idea, or derailing my own story to address a pet peeve I may have had with the one I read. Again, personal preference.

​

-I sort of addressed this in the second one. take a break when you're getting truely fed up with writing. Not to say that you should quit every time you hit a wall. Sometimes you have to just write down a bunch of garbage to get past a difficult to write part, just to find the one little thing that helps you write that section the right way. Learning to get through blocks is a valuable skill, just don't burn yourself out.

-There are lists and lists and lists of do's and don'ts of fanfic. If I had to pick the top ones...

Do: Proofread

Don't: Not proofread

Really. You'll turn almost everybody off to a story if it's filled with misspellings and grammatical errors. And use formatting. A block of text is difficult to read. If nobody can get through your story, you can't get any feedback, and you won't have much growth.

​

-Post your stories. [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and Archive of our own are the two I use. There are plenty more. A note on this if you post stuff though. People will like your stuff, and some people wont. People can leave some real crappy reviews when they really don't like your stuff, and that's really okay. I used to take it really personally, but then I read the reviews on some of my favorite fanfics of all time. Ones that I thought were the best of the best, and there were people being crappy in those reviews. Some people just can't keep negativity to themselves. It's much easier to just quit reading a fic you don't like, than to flame the author in a review.

A secondary note on that note. Not all flames are useless. I got DESTROYED in a flame-y review of a chapter of mine, but the person had 3 excellent points about failures I had in the story. I actually went back and changed 2 of the 3 points he made. Some angry reviews will have criticism. If you can learn from them, you can turn the negative comment into constructive criticism.

​

-You improve by writing, and absorbing constructive criticism. That being said, don't pander to the reviewers and give them everything they want. This is *your* story, but it doesn't hurt to test their ideas and criticisms out in a draft where only you can see them, then decide whether it's something that works for you.

And just go back and read something you've posted before to see if you've improved at all. If you're halfway through your second story, and wondering if you've improved, go read your first story. You've improved. Trust me. This works. Hoo boy, it can be hard to read old stuff, but writing junk is a necessary step to getting better.

​

-What to expect? I mean, not a whole lot right away. Some enjoyment at having people like what you write. Better writing skills for sure. If you're thinking about what to expect in terms of money, or a career, I'd say don't worry about that. You've got a lot of bridges to cross before you're ready for that one.

Also, expect people to not like your story, or your interpretation of the characters. Like I said, you'll get bad reviews. It's life.

​

-My advice, is save on google drive. Nothing worse than losing A WHOLE STORY cause your computer dies. So there's that.

Also get a beta. Someone to look over your chapters before you post. Fresh eyes can help point out problems that you can't see anymore because you're so used to reading and re-reading the chapters. The can also help give you good ideas that you might not have thought of otherwise. Not all beta's are created equal, and you won't work well with everyone who offers to help, so try to find someone that only enhances your vision for your story.

Take criticism well. You won't learn otherwise. At all. If any negative comment feels like a personal attack, then you won't be able to improve.

Manage your time well. I'm procrastinating doing my creative writing homework as we speak. So there's that.

Take a creative writing course when you can. It really helps point out your weaknesses, and strengths. I'm good at characterization and dialogue, but bad at setting. So bad at setting. Describe a library, don't just say that they're in one.

​

The sky is really the limit for what you can create in a story. Do you want Harry to also be the Hulk? Sure. Whatever floats your boat. Have fun with it.
