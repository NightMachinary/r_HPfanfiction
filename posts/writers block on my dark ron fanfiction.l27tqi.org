hey hpfandom, so, i have a fic im writing linkao3(26759686) or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26759686/chapters/65280652]] where ron gets tom riddle's diary and in the midst of dying he clings to him and becomes his mentor.

im a little stuck on where to go from chapter 6 (click link and read if you'd like) because i do have an idea of what to do (ron is going to try and out scabbers because the bastard is annoying as hell to him, not to mention extremely suspicious) but im unsure as to how to get there.

drop some advice below, thanks!


** How is Scabbers acting suspicious? What is he doing to draw attention to himself? What are Peter's motivations? If you have answers to these questions it might help create a conflict with Ron.

Failing that if you just want rid of Scabbers you could just have Crookshanks eat him...

** Maybe make Ron/Tom do experiments on Scabbers, and ... dunno, expose him or kill him? Dunno, I really do not know where you might go from there.

  “These children that you spit on, as they try to change their worlds, are immune to your consultations. They're quite aware of what they're going through.” --- David Bowie...When Tom Riddle's diary is on his last breath, Ron Weasley picks up the charred notebook. With no where else to turn, the sixteen year old prefect does the unimaginable, and soon Ron Weasley is no more. Well, that's what Tom's aiming for. The kid is a pain to manipulate.
