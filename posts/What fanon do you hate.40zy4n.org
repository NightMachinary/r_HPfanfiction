**** If you consider most spells that we see in canon as originating during the Middle Ages, then having a Latin-like word makes sense. If your story takes place in China... you would obviously want incantations in Chinese.

But in my opinion, if you're dealing with ancient magic (usually deemed more powerful than canon magic) then you might as well do away with incantations altogether. Just have the character think, speak, or otherwise express what they intend to do, and just describe the effect of the spell.

Classical Chinese, likely. For Japan, you'd want stuff like pure on-yomi incantations or weird obsolete yamato-kotoba readings.

I very much agree with this. Firstly, magic is a great equalizer, why the hell don't the girls fight back (especially when they are young enough that accidental magic could occur)? Second, if it is 'tradition' why do fathers who are obsessed with purity let even the possibility of a child out of wedlock occur? Thirdly, Snape's involvement makes no sense at all (even if it wasn't for his love of Lily), he shows nothing but disgust and hate for students. He thinks they are idiots and very much beneath him. Just no. And if Snape isn't involved, he would never allow it to happen! Fourthly, if this has been going on, there would be so many other affects seen in both the children at Hogwarts and the adult population. The women would not just get over it, and the dynamic between the sexes would be very different. That kinda shit leads to riots or revolutions.

On the other hand, several boarding schools had a sexual abuse problem in the past. Such things can be kept under wraps for a long time. I doubt that it's easy at Hogwarts though, much less if a whole house is in on it. Someone sooner or later will spill it.

Sure, it's weird to give that person a title like that. But HP does have prefects, which are formal titles, and nicknames exist. Weirder titles exist in canon.

It is very much possible for a society so strongly traditional to have some sort of legacy position which exists as an elected leader outside of prefects and head boy/girl.

Weirder titles: Supreme Mugwump, Gurg.

'Society' not 'Slytherins' (see quills, robes, candles for light) is traditional. 'Whoever came up with it' would by this stage be long dead and there is nothing to say that Hogwarts students in the 1200s would have the same values as Hogwarts students in the 1990s. I would in fact argue that someone in the 1200s would not see anything wrong with electing and 'crowning' a leader within the student body.

Popular students are popular. In other news, water is wet and the sun is hot, more at eleven. Your problem here is assuming that popularity translates to power in all school situations, and more importantly enough power that even a teenager would /unironically/ refer to or think of themselves as the "prince" or "queen" of a house for it.

And monarchical power here obviously refers to the existence of kings, queens and similar titles. Monarchies are far from immune to upset, btw.

And a prefect is not made a prefect on [student] social power, so that logic doesn't hold up either. Also prefectship is transient, accountable to authority (something that's blatantly absent from insert-term-of-royalty-here fics), and honestly at least half your mates are going to hate you for it.

Idk, honestly boarding school isn't half as romantic or exciting as people make it out to be.

Prefectship in the HP universe isn't as accountable as in real life, nor are the qualifications anything like real life (Ron being the biggest example, but Draco and Hermione too also fits in that I don't believe any of them would ever be prefects in a real boarding school, or any other kind of school). There is evidence that positions which should be appointed on skills can be bought (again Draco, seeker) and that the normal system of highly academic and responsible student -> prefect -> head boy/girl doesn't apply (James Potter being Head Boy).

What social networking? The social hierarchy of the wizarding world has been set in stone for decades if not centuries.

...have you ever actually attended school in a system where prefects and boarding are the norm? Because prefectship is not a reward for highly academic and responsible students, nor should it be. Prefects are chosen by the institution primarily for [the institution's] social reasons, apart from positions that would explicitly require academic prowess (a library prefect, for instance, whose duties would include helping students with research) or responsibility above and beyond the norm (a chapel prefect at religious schools, for instance, usually has keys to the chapel and must be trusted not to misuse them - the stock of altar wine is usually kept there after all). Believe me, a head boy or girl does not need to be any smarter than the average. And Hermione, Ron and Draco are the equivalent of house captains, whose primary criterion is pretty much "how low will you go for your house". They fit perfectly imo.

*********** Does whether popularity /always/ exist matter? I am not saying there /must/ be a K/Q/P of S, I'm saying that is a possibility that there is a popularly elected student position which could exist within Slytherin house, and if it does it could that position be called Queen/King/Prince of Slytherin. It would most likely be an older traditional role around for centuries, and as such what would you name it? A title of royalty sounds arrogant and bombastic /now/, but it might not have always (in the 1000 year history of the school) done so, especially given other titles still in use with the HP universe.

Prefects were brought into the discussion on the basis that a school elected position already existed. However /we do not know the qualifications of such a position/ due to the fact that some of those elected would be unlikely prefects in the real world, and other positions in HP have be bought not earned. Having prefects also does not preclude also having a student elected position.

A) Once again, this has nothing to do with being a prefect.

B) While it indeed wouldn't fly in muggle schools, no Hogwarts teacher ever made a deal about it in the 4 previous years and she consistently scored O's. So apparantly writing more than was asked for is a good thing for them?

Anyway, you completely miss the point. A prefect is simply a glorified teacher pet and a reward for being likeable. It has nothing to do with academic prowess or responsibilities.

Prefects normally have a lot of power (they used to be able to administer corporal punishment). Because of this, prefects are normally some of the best academic students, are strong responsible characters, are leaders and socially active. Their job is partially to interface between staff and students, meaning communication skills and approachability are a must. As for winning by default, there are 3 other girls in Gryffindor in their year. What about Parvati?

I think what you are doing now is very close to moving the goalposts, you know. Prefects are prefects, Malfoy was a prefect and in all of his delusions of grandeur he never gave himself a more grandiose-sounding title and /that/ is a clear indicator of how that simply wouldn't happen regardless of how popular or /alpha/ or whatever someone is.

And while popularity has /something/ to do with it, it's not because of a student being popular directly but rather because someone already used to popularity might handle being a link between the students and the teachers better. But the decision is one made by the teachers, namely by the students' heads of house, and thus every one of them chooses their prefects based on what /they/ think matters.

And going through that bit, it's clear why McGonagall chose Hermione; less clear why she'd choose Ron, yes, but later interactions with Dumbledore make it a high possibility that she meant to choose Harry and Dumbledore vetoed it and thus she chose the closest boy to Harry because proximity. On the other hand, choosing someone who is an “Ice Queen” for prefect duties means that you are choosing someone who most likely will not function well as any kind of social link, so you might as well choose an empty suit of armour for those duties because then people at least will know what to expect; likewise, with three girl prefects per house it would be hard to come up with three such titles for them, without making the whole thing cringe-worthy, and while there might have been students who tried I can see why nobody would care to start calling them with those.

**** "For the five decades before Dumbledore was appointed Headmaster, there was 27 slytherin head boys and 21 slytherin head girls. This should not surprise anyone from the house of ambition. However, after Dumbledore was appointed in 1956 there would be exactly zero slytherins in the Head boy or girl position until his unfortunate death in 1997 (and indeed after until 2001 when a halfblood slytherin was appointed Head Girl). Of course, by the time the change was clear, Dumbledore had been in power long enough that those with the ability to question the shift were either firm supporters of Dumbledore or could not afford to spend political capital to challenger such a seemly petty matter. It was also hard to prove active sabotage of slytherin students to the leadership role. In any year there was always a handful of candidates, and often the position was awarded on the slimmest of margins. The students themselves wanted the appointment mostly for the possibility of future prestige, not for what it came with itself. After all, it was a thankless job for the most part, with very little real power but many responsibilities, and not viewed favourably by the other students.

For Titus Rookwood, would be graduating class of 1967, slytherin student with grand ambitions, the Head Boy position was a long standing goal and a stepping stone for his future career (which had nothing to do with the fact his father and mother before him both also held the post). That he had no chance at it when Dumbledore remained in power just made him want it more. So at the start of his 4th year he started a campaign, not to be appointed Head boy, but to make a position similar enough those who really mattered could recognise it.

This lead him to find a small school policy from the 1720s, when a temporarily created position appeared and was approved by the school governing board. This was a student elected position, to find a student to lead the Harvest festival celebrations and for this purpose was given access to a specific school supply closet which now held broken brooms and a rusty metal bucket, and was required to submit a written report of the progress of the event (to be held on the full Moon that occurs closest to the autumn equinox) every month. They were allowed to meet once a week in an appointed classroom, and on this day their curfew was extended by 1 hour. Due to the timing of the festival (so soon after the commencement of the school term) the board had allowed the creation of a student council of sorts, with an elected leader appointed in 6th year in charge of the festival the year after, their 7th, and final, year, during which they would act as an adviser to the next student council.

The event, and therefore position, had gradually diminished until in 1798 no student was elected. However, it was never removed from the school rules. And so Rockwood campaigned and would though guile, a few subtle words in the right ears and a letter from the Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, recreated the position and was elected unopposed by the 43 voting students to the position. The rest of the school dismissed it as slytherin games. Due to the complete lack of powers and the fact written reports were required (and indeed, some involvement with the food produced on the harvest moon, if only choosing the menu for the house elves to follow) meant there was no competition outside of slytherin house, to the point where the whole thing was generally ignored by everyone else. The fact the it was entitled Harvest King (or Queen) only enhanced this."

***** "It evolves from here. Any student can vote in the elections, but the first students agree to being somewhat selective when and where the elections take place, being the slytherin's common room on the morning of the first full day of the new school term. It only takes 3 elections before the title of Harvest King (or Queen, as that year was) loses the 'Harvest' part. The position will, over time, slowly become something well known in certain circles, circles where the ability to win a student popularity contest is noted as showcase of desirable skills. However, managing to be elected and yet your name remain still relatively unknown outside of the house is an even greater honor. Slytherins, after all, are cunning. It would do no good to highlight who in fact, holds enough power to win the vote. This also serves as to further reduce the care that the other houses give the position. It is clear to them it is just a stupid tradition (by that stage) which means little. And it indeed does mean little within the school (although slightly more outside).

This all changes when one enterprising King in 1972 realises that the report handed in monthly (which by this stage was a single sentence saying "Preparations for the event progress") goes directly to the school governing board. The school governing board which does not include Dumbledore. A communication which can not, due to the system in place, be blocked, intercepted, or read by those outside of the members of the school board. This is in fact the real power of the position. Very quickly, the King or Queen becomes something very desirable, as the reports on the harvest event become highly edited carefully constructed reports on the school itself. These reports are directly credited with the dismissal of Francis Cuthbert from his Runes Post, the adjustment of visiting rules of muggleborns parents when their children are injured, the loaned book limit increasing from 3 to 6.

For those within Slytherin house, the position became to be viewed in higher esteem then the Head Boy/Girl position. After all, it carried none of the responsibilities and held a clear line of power. By 1978 the position was thought to be called the King or Queen of slytherin by the other students in Hogwarts, which had been the result of a very successful misinformation campaign after a few Ravenclaw students asked if they could also be involved in the voting (and be eligible for the position) when it became clear that the reports to the school board could produce actual results. As the out going King/Queen had the power to choose the location, time and place of the elections, and the Board had no wish to change the rules and allow the possibility of Dumbledore influencing the results, the other houses continued (for the most part) to be excluded. The occasional exception was made by specific invitation of the outgoing King or Queen, but such students numbered less then two dozen although the exact numbers were not recorded.

Even after the restructuring of the school board in 1998 and election of a slytherin Head Girl in 2001, the position remains to this day. It has been since 1999 open to all houses, and is known as simply the King (or Queen), and still submits a mouthy report of the state of the school.

The split is too recent, and there is too much movement between them for them to become totally separate. The other fact is that Magical society does not change quickly (robes, quills...). Is 350 years long enough for them to develop to be so very different that someone like Hermione couldn't learn it is she tried?

#+end_quote

So the ISS is signed 1689, which is between the end of Tudor based culture and the start of Georgian society. So if magical culture did not evolve at all from that point on (which is very unlikely, culture evolves all the time) and was similar to muggle culture of the time, you would expect an Elizabethan like culture, with maybe some influence of the later Restoration.

So what are a few things which could be expected then:

- /Blood matters/. Who your parents are, who they are related to etc governs everything. This is due to the highly rigid class structure, with no middle class, you're either poor or rich, and each class has its own culture. This includes modes of speech, dress, education and even food. There is little to no movement between classes. Even if a poor person suddenly becomes rich somehow, they will not be accepted into the upper class. Even the lower class will not interact with them anymore.
- In the upper class, which clearly what those attending Hogwarts are, you would expect heavy emphasis on reputation. It wasn't all about what you owned, but who you knew. The upper class spent all it's wealth to impress those in power. A great example is Walsingham, who spent most of his own fortune to act as Elizabeth's spymaster. Fantastical balls and grand events were hosted to draw those above you to be friendly (and hopefully, form alliances possibly through marriage).
- The pattern of speaking was very strict. All superiors would be addressed very formally and respectfully, and informal talk would only be for close family members in private.
- What you wore was governed by the Sumptuary Laws. For example: Only Royalty were permitted to wear clothes trimmed with ermine. Lesser Nobles were allowed to wear clothing trimmed with fox and otter.
- Newspapers were new, and most people did not get there information from them. Social networking was much more important.
- People rarely bathed. Despite this, being clean indicated you were a higher class, as it meant you didn't need to work. If you were rich you used perfumes. Trimmed nails and soft hands were important. People wore wigs so their hair was perfect. The more time you it appeared you spent on appearance meant the less time you had to work, indicating the higher class you were.
- Upper class women had no power. At all. On marriage everything that a women had became the property of the husband (which is why Elizabeth never married). Only boys were educated. Women could be pretty, but could not have an opinion. Interactions between sexes was highly controlled, both in a physical sense with no touching and very little time spent together, and in how you acted, what you talked about etc. Failing to do so resulted in the loss of highly important reputation.

So all of this is, on the surface, very similar to many things we see in Victorian and regency culture. Victorian/Regency women had more power, and most Sumptuary Laws were gone by then. Newspapers and news was more widely found and mostly less controlled. People were much more focused on personal hygiene. There was more social movement, and a middle class existed (but not what we think of middle class, more a low upper class merged with a merchant class). People still relied on reputation a lot, but there was a consumer society now, all about what you owned and how much it cost you. Interactions between the sexes was still highly regulated. All these changes I could see happening naturally in a society where magic equals power, and magic is equally powerful in either sex.

If they want to avoid the "purebloods are stupid and backwards" trope then they should create a culture for them that is not stupid and backwards. Start with the Tudors, but evolve.

******* Yes, but cultural change is much faster now then it was even 30 years ago. As for wether there is enough time, think of how long it took the hippies to gain power and become normalised into culture. That started in the early 60s and ideas of 'free love' and 'respect nature' weren't mainstream until the late 70s, early 80s (around one generation). Personally, I still think of a magical generation as closer to 50 years then 25 years due to them living around 150 years not 70 years (no matter what JKR has retconned). So 350 odd years is only 7 generations, and the eldest living members alive now could have meet people alive at the time of the ISS. This explains why people still uses quills and wear robes (even if robes are before even the Tudor period).

So the issue you raise is that pureblood culture is not complex enough (I think a lot of people up voting you are doing so for different reasons). That I can agree with, it should be more then calling people 'Lady' or 'Lord' and bows and kissing backs of hands. Even real Victorian and regency culture is much more complex then that! But as I said, introducing a very complex distinct culture is overwhelming for the readers. At least by using Victorian/Regency the writer is trying to give a more complete picture then just ignoring that there would be a distinct magical culture.

That's the BIG thing that always confused me about the ideas commonly presented as pureblood culture is that the wizarding world is only 'backwards' when compared to the *massive* leap forward that the muggles experienced relatively recently.

Go back a generation or two (aka to the childhoods of most of the active blood purists or thier parents) and this would no longer be the case really...

Modern medicine is STILL lagging behind some of the things Madam Pomfrey does over a weekend stay with the SCHOOL NURSE. Regrowing bones? When I broke my leg that was not an overnight visit to the nurse's office. And wizards have had that for a long time.

The floo network appears to have skipped over telegraphs and telephones and gone directly to video-calls (though I don't know what the invention date was on that)

They consider Artificial Intelligence to be... no big deal. Minds just /aren't/ things they worry about. Obliviation is something they accept readily. Why? Because they *KNOW* souls are real. /Souls/ are established *FACT* for them.

Canon was initially children's books, so magical culture couldn't be too alien from what kids knew... but... holy crap are there a lot of issues/societal pressures that would have been completely different for magical Britain both before and after the ISoS that should have driven the creation of a completely different culture.

********* I don't know if 7 generations is enough, especially when magic is around. Magical people are trained to follow set instructions and do not question as to why one thing does something. They are rote learners who lack common sense. That kind of education doesn't encourage the radical thinkers that are required to change a culture. Culture change needs rebels and outcasts and a major technological/economic/or social advancement or change (industrial revolution, wide spread birth control, new king on throne etc). Sure the ISS could be one such impact, but I get the feel that magicals are very much more conservative due to it, not rebellious.

If you make complex culture like that, the story would revolve around it, almost to the exclusion of anything else. Its like those people who jump up and down and say that the government in HP should be more complex. Yeah, it should, but people neither write nor read those stories.

I agree that is shouldn't be some possible love interest to teach Harry, after all, culture is historically taught by the elders of a group (be their the parents or even older). For this reason and more Ron is not the best teacher, for starters the whole blood traitor status of his parents as well as himself means he doesn't follow pureblood teachings. Whatever rules there might be, he might not have been taught them. Especially if it is as complex as you want it to be.

********** Wizards have been shown to suffer from a serious case of "follow the leader" in canon, mindlessly repeating whatever the Ministry and the press tell them. All it needs to change their culture is one powerful wizard taking an interest. (In "Patron", Hogwarts is the most egalitarian School and Britain one of the most progressive societies thanks to Dumbledore's influence after the victory over Grindelwald, for example.)

I disagree about the culture dominating a story. There are always some common traces among human cultures. It just needs to be distinct enough to show it's not old England with some magic added. Some scenes and details that make you notice that no, we're not in Kansas anymore. Often, changing something to a magical version might be enough. Purebloods writing with quills and pots of inks as if they were medieval muggles is stupid. Purebloods having enchanted everfull quills that take write down what is said on floating and magically duplicating parchment is not. Customs dealing with Magic - apparition "dos and don'ts", how to handle mind control, taboos etc. - can be introduced in a story dealing with such things - as most stories are.

If being a blood traitor (aka, thinking that mudbloods are not inferiour or a menace) means you are not part of the pureblood culture and can't teach it, then that also means that said pureblood culture is far too close to Voldemort's views and that those pureblood teachings need to be wiped out before they poison another generation. You can't have a pureblood culture that condemns the canon Weasleys for being blood traitors and yet is worth a damn, and it's already dubious if you can have a pureblood culture where the canon Weasleys are condemened and excluded for being poor or eccentric without rendering said culture evil. Why should Harry want to be part of a culture that excludes the most welcoming family he has met, for example?

Yep. Doesn't mean it has happened though. Although.... Voldemort fits that description. Its also possible that Dumbledore has already changed the culture, and in fact that is what Pureblood are so upset about.

We don't know that being a blood traitor only means thinking that mudbloods are not inferior or a menace (although it is implied, along with the term meaning purebloods who intermarry with muggles/muggleborns). The term is explained by Ron and inferred in canon, not by those actually using it. And Ron is at least a second generation blood traitor.

If Harry doesn't need/want to join the pureblood community (as the Weasleys have opted out for whatever reason it indicates it /is/ a choice), then he shouldn't be forced to make convenient romance opportunities. It also isn't something that you should expect to be able to turn back off again, because if you remain apart enough that you can still leave, I don't think you are really a member of that culture.

As for the basis of Pureblood culture, I always had the impression that Voldemort simply co-opted already existing ideas and made them more extreme. But a few ideas isn't a culture, its an ideology.

The best teachers would be adult (and in fact elderly) members of such a community. Ron is not either of these things, but he does know more then a muggle raised person. If I had other options, Ron would not be my choice of teacher. /Molly/, on the other hand, might be. If I want to learn to a specific new dance, I go to a dance teacher of that style, and if not available, someone who can do the dance, and then if all other options aren't around, someone who has seen the dance before. Ron is the third option, Molly is (probably) the second, and I don't know Augusta (maybe Narcissa or Andromeda, but they are rather young) is the first.

The Weasleys are still part of the magical community and magic raised culture, but is that also pureblood culture? /We don't know/, but if pureblood culture exists, it is distinct from the community the Weasleys are part of, to the extent that the Weasleys are /proud/ they are not part of the Pureblood community. Arthur even says to Malfoy in canon that they have very different ideas about what values are important.

**************** But once again: Why would Harry want to be a part of a culture that shares Malfoy's values, and not the Weasleys'?

That's what I do not get. If "pureblood culture" excludes the Weasleys because they are decent human beings, why would any decent person want to join that culture?

As I see it, its simple: If pureblood culture includes the Weasleys, harry can learn it from them, If it excludes the Weasleys, Harry would have to be braindead to want to learn it in the first place because that kind of culture would have excluded his own parents, all their friends, and anyone else who's not a bigoted scumbag.

** Every single thing mentioned on this page can be awful. It's also possible for every single thing to be done well. Some of them only seem bad due to overuse.

Do bad stories outnumber good ones? Yes. Of course, but that's really just a consequence of Sturgeon's Law - 99% of everything is crap. Some premises lead themselves to bad storytelling more than others, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the premise itself is bad.

Let's get to a few cases.

Yes, the whole Lords and Ladies thing can be grating at times, but stories such as Patron and The Accidental Animagus show how it can be part of a narrative without being overblown.

True, Sirius calling Harry pup or cub seems /wrong/ to me. Harry's patronus is a stag like his father's so why would he get a dog-related name? "Prongslet" makes much more sense though - he's the son of someone with the name "Prongs", and Sirius would have loved winding Harry up once they got to know each other.

I could go on.

The one about 12yo children having the sexual desires of adults is one that I could agree with if I'd ever actually seen a story where that happens. On the other hand, puberty is occurring earlier and earlier in children. My sister is a teacher and tells me that girls as young as nine are starting to menstruate; a situation made more difficult because of the lack of facilities at primary schools (junior schools in the US? Not sure). Is it unreasonable that the magic of a child experiencing such a life-changing experience so young would take a different path to the normal? I dunno. But it might make a good story.

TL;DR, I suppose I'm saying that good stuff can be done badly bad stuff can be done well - or at least contribute to something being done well.

Sounds like its going to be crap right? However it was actually a really interesting read about how the 'dark' side was afraid the machine was going to be used a political tool to discriminate against purebloods (and they were probably right), and how different fractions were trying to sabotage the machine in different ways (one group wanted everyone to falsely read 'white', one group wanted it to stop working altogether, and another group was trying to protect the machine because they truly thought it could do some good).

And then into this Harry volunteers as the first public test to show how no one had anything to fear, only for his core to read the darkest possible setting. Cue assassination attempts, kidnappings, politics, themes of the necessary nature of tough decisions and prejudice and if you can trust a government with such powers.
