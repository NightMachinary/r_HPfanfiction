*** Head-mocking doesn't make you a bastard. Mocking aloud would make you a bastard.

They've clearly read one too many "friendly goblins Lord Potter" stories, and it's now become canon to them, dammit.

*** I'd be strongly tempted to mock them /aloud/. Doing that would probably ruin your fic in the eyes of quite a few people. 90% of Indy!Harry fics suck.

***** This thread might help: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cklrc4/what_exactly_is_indy_harry/]]

In short, the name Indy!Harry means independent Harry, but it's come to mean something else. Now it refers to the trope where Harry goes to Gringotts, gets an â€˜inheritance test' where it turns out that he's Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Merlin-Etc. He later goes to live on one of his previously unknown properties and claims his seat(s) on the wizengamot.

In short, it's a giant trope.

*** Was it Sonia25? In my Fic that I'm rewriting ( not because of their review ) I was told that I need to send Harry to the RoR and have him practice with books from the restricted section.

It was a not a BWL fic.

That account keeps posting those reviews everywhere. Even in some of the Fics I read like Birds and Monsters.

That account is a nightmare amongst Haphne Fics.

** That if Harry was eating properly there was no reason for him to skinny (I will always describe child and preteen Harry as small and skinny no matter the circumstances.)

*** Sigh. If a child (age 4-12) is eating /properly/, there is no reason for them /not/ to be skinny.

I mean, regular non-unhealthy puppy fat on a child is also not a problem. But neither is being skinny. Skinny is a normal, natural state for a human being.

*** Exactly. I remember when I was younger I was hella skinny. I ate fine. My friend actually called me a sack of bones once
