Harry & Remus' relationship has always been my favourite, and I love fics where Remus raises Harry, or is a father-like figure for him. I'm wondering if there are any fics (pre or during Hogwarts) like these where Remus is the adult Harry is most close to? mentor, father, or just friend. (sort of like sirius' position in canon) I love the boys of crowhill series linkao3(5418194) and the secret language of plants linkao3(9323225) for reference !


** I'm forgetting the exact title, but there's one where Snape takes Harry from the Dursleys and insists that Remus raises him. Harry is later removed from Remus' care, and generally refuses to do magic at Hogwarts. (Sorry, this is an absolutely terrible description of a decently good fic).

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.

  ‚ÄúJust... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.‚ÄùWhat was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
