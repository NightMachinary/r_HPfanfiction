That means no forcefully feminised gay men. No seme/uke wtv. No male fantasy fulfillment lesbians. No soul bonds or marriage contracts or Veela or mates or whatever. No overt bashing or Death Eater apologism.

Just canon characters who also happen to be some flavor of queer getting on with their lives in the Harry Potter world.

Could be romance or not. I'd prefer plot driven fics that are full of adventure, and that the lead pairing is not with Snape or Voldemort. I don't mind explicit fics as long as there's none of that 'no lube' nonsense.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** I think linkao3(Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run by wapabi) might be to your satisfaction. I also second the recommendation of "Put your Guns, its Tea Time". Neither of those two fics has any of that fetishized portrayal of homosexualtiy that is so commen in fanfiction.

** Lomonaaeren writes some good stuff with nice rounded plots, often about characters that happen to be gay (mostly Drarry). I particularly love linkao3(685932) (this one specifically deals with homophobia, if that's something you're looking for/avoiding) but Lomonaaeren has written HUNDREDS of stories, so feel free to just browse by your preferences, you'll probably find something you like.

  Need a perfect stranger? Ask Metamorphosis. Harry Potter runs the business secretly and becomes whoever's needed for each occasion. He's not sure whether he should be more surprised, worried, or amused when Draco Malfoy comes to Metamorphosis and requests an actor who can play his boyfriend so that his parents will disown him. Yet Harry has even more dangerous choices after he creates Brian, Draco's “perfect” boyfriend. Draco doesn't know who Brian is, but he's trying to find out---and now so is Harry.

** Linkao3(The Reclamation of Black Magic) has bi-Sirius and bi-Remus flirting around a relationship. They have a past with each other, but for most of the story keep getting involved with other people; but it's pretty obvious they're going to end up together, I think.

** I always thought [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ignipes/works?fandom_id=136512][ignipes]] was good for slash that stuck close to canon characterizations and circumstances. Most are on the shorter side, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17319/][Man-eaters of Kumaon]] is plotty and set during Lupin's Lost Years, with past Remus/Sirius and Remus still mourning his friends and trying to make sense of what happened.

** Casting Moonshadows on FFN is a classic. Its unfinished and gets very rare updates every few years. It's a Wolfstar fic, but it starts in first year and they dont get together until 4th or 5th.
