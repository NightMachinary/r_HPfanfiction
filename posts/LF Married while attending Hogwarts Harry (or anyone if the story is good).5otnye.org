For some reason this is a plot point that appeals to me, so I figured I would go to reddit for some recommendations. So let me know about any good story that involves Harry getting married while he is still a Hogwarts student. Best if it is an important part of the story, but if there story is good I don't really mind. My general preference is Harry/Ginny, but I'll take any female paired with Harry (or any two characters in general) if it is well written. Not looking for harems or for him to be married to anyone more than 2 years above or below him. I'm not into slash myself, but if you know a good story feel free to recommend it here for those who are.

I just read linkffn(5435295) and overall enjoyed it, so I'm not opposed to a plot device like a soul bond, as long as it is used in an interesting way and doesn't result in a boring relationship where they're in love automatically.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.
