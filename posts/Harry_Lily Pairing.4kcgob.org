I am look for Harry/Lily pairing where Harry either time-travels or is a professor at Hogwarts.


** Which Lily? ;)

*** This sounds super familiar too me. What else has this plot? Son in fathers body or looking identical to father having to father himself.

Either way I would be interested in such a FF. Sounds like it could be super interesting if well done.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3703435/1/Sighs-of-the-Neglected-Flower]]) - Harry uses Resurrection Stone at the same time as Lily and gets pulled to her dimension. Abandoned.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9504137/1/Hair-of-the-Grim]]) - This one is pretty nice. Drunken ritual results in Harry getting thrown back in time, taking over Sirius' body and getting his memories up to the 5th(?) year. Only 2 chapters, but it's still worth the read. Not updated in 2 years, but I really hope somebody will pick it up.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9762328/1/Throwing-Out-the-Script]]) - Judging by the writing up to this point it could be one of the better harem HP fics ever ever (at least I remember thinking so, I might've to reread it). Sadly, not updated in close to a year. As with Hair of the Grim, I'm still hoping somebody will pick it up or author returns to continue.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11517235/2/Dragon-Lily]]) - This one's a smut and not that great (or even good), but you can't be too picky when it comes to Harry/Lily fanfiction. Read if desperate, maybe you will like it.

I remember reading few more /readable/ Harry/Lily fics, but unfortunately I recently removed my Calibre library. I will post them when I find them.

One was definitely with Harry being his own father (don't remember how plausible that was), other with Harry making himself believe that Lily was Ginny and vice versa and some others that I can't remember premise of. They were pretty nice.

  What if Voldemort complied with Snape's wish on Halloween 1981? What if the Harry we know used the Resurrection Stone at the same time as a heart broken Lily? Two different eras, two different realities...Post DH

  They say there are many things a wizard shouldn't do while ridiculously drunk; flying, apparition, and testing unknown spells just to name a few. But as the BWL just learned, listening to one of your equally as drunk godfather's 'brilliant ideas' is another one of the things you just shouldn't do.

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.

**** Thank you. I had been looking for Throwing out the script just the other day (could not remember the title) and had been debating posting here, but then I came across this. Sadly I was looking for it to see if it was updated :(
