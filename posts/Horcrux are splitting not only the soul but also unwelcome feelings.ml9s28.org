The Horcrux become humans and act in a particular way.

1. His childishness. That means the Horcrux just wants to have fun and play.

2. His insecurity. This one is self-aware to an extreme about what other people think of him.

3. His fear Always afraid of something

4. His sadness and loneliness. This one's depressed.

5. His impatience and irritation. Angry all the time and short temper

6. His hesitation and disgust toward immoral things. Can't look at blood or spit or anything that's just eww.

7. His leaning to distraction. He just can't concentrate on something for so long

Maybe they need to figure out how to live like that, maybe they all fuse into one individual or they and Tom become one again and he regains his sanity.


** The diary is the part of Tom Riddle that thought using an anagram he came up with while he was doodling in Binns's class when he was 16 was a good idea, hence why Voldemort started killing anyone who said his super serious dark lord name

*** Never heard about it. Sorry.

I thought more in the lines of "Upside down". Just that they're real beings and not inside someone's head.

**** FMA spoilers The big bad removes his unwanted feelings (aka the seven deadly sins) and made them into homunculi who embody that sin. For example, greed is greedy, sloth is lazy, etc. They're not exactly horcrux-like but they are fueled by philosophers stones and can live as long as the stone is fueled. The big bad is also like that, ie immortal as long as his philosophers stone is fueled. He can also reabsorb their philosophers stones so they're basically horcruxes. One of the homunculi also eats another for more energy (or maybe just for their powers. I don't remember exactly)

** I'm not sure about the horcruxes embodying certain feelings or attitudes, but I do feel that the obvious implications of the diary and locket are that there could in fact be MULTIPLE Voldemorts running around at the same time, and I honestly don't feel like anybody has ever tried to run with that or do the concept justice. If Ginny had died in the chamber, there would be a Tom Riddle AND a Lord Voldemort running around. Strictly speaking, this potential exists for every single soul fragment Voldemort split off.

This is also my own personal fanon reason for why older Dark Lords never tried to do what Voldemort did. They were afraid of possibly creating copies of themselves that would try to usurp them. The more horcruxes you have, the greater the odds that one of them will possess somebody and then you have another version of yourself running around that you have to deal with.
