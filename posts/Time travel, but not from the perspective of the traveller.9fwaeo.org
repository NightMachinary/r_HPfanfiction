Hi, I'm a big fan of time travel fics, and I recently read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]], which is a story told from Tom Riddle's POV about a time travelling Harry that comes to kill him, and I thought it was super interesting.

Are there any other fics like that? It doesn't have to be one POV throughout, but I'd love it if at some point there was an outsider's perspective on the time traveller, especially if they don't know it's a time traveller.

*[Edit:]* wow, thanks so much y'all! I honestly hadn't expected so many, and now I'm super excited to read them all :) (that doesn't mean don't keep the suggestions coming if you know any more, the more the better)

  Lost time is never found again, unless of course you are willing to pay the price. Harry is not himself. Hermione will find out why.

Burgundy, however, had class.“And what did you do to your hair?” she asked in horrified fascination.Snape's hand rose to his scalp. “Nothing! What is wrong with you? I just washed it and blow-dried it like every morning...”“Ah, I see.” She nodded and stepped back. “Alternate dimension. It must be.”
