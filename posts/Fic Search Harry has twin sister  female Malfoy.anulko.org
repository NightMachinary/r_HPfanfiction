Hey,

I'm trying to find a fic that I read some time ago. The only things that I remember about it was that Harry had a twin sister who lived with the Dursleys while Harry lived in an orphanage. There was also female Draco and Harry had interaction on the train with her (she slapped him but it looked like they were making out). It wasn't finished and I do not remember if I read it on ff.net or on DLP.

Anyone got a clue about this fic?
