We know that Tom Riddle was forced to go to the orphanage every summer. Tom was a bad guy so no one messes with his things. But there must be few other orphan wizards in muggle orphanages, how do you think they were able to finish their summer assignments and hide their spell books, quills, potions, wand and robes?


** Well for one, orphanages dont exist in the UK anymore. The closest youd get is group homes. And I believe most kids in the fostercare system are placed with a family rather than a group home. So in that case, the parents and family would know about the magic stuff.

Harry's year is apparently 20% muggle born based on JKs class list. Let's assume theres about 800 kids in hogwarts at any one year.

In the UK in 1990 the population was 57 million. Roughly 20% of this is children. A statistic that I just googled is that theres about 65000 children in foster care in the UK and that's probably recent so I'm probably overestimating here. Anyway 65,000/(57,000,000*.2) = .0057

Now I just googled and in the US for all foster kids only about 1 in 5 are in group homes. Let's assume that's true for the UK as well.

So between 1990 and let's say 2020, that's 30 years and assuming 115 students per year that's a total of 3420 students. 20% of them are muggle born and they have a .57% chance of being in foster care. 114×30×.2×(.0057)= 3.9

So rounding up about 4 kids and we can assume only 1 of them was in a group home.

So probably someone made some magical arrangements for the kid to be cared for by either a magical foster family or a muggle family.

True orphans are extremely rare, especially muggle borns whose parents wouldn't have been involved in the wizarding wars. I mean technically Voldemort wasnt really an orphan. His biological father was alive.

Anyway my point is, voldemorts situation is probably so statistically rare that I dont even think the scenario is possible.

**** Theres really different evidence in multiple sources of how many students there are at hogwarts. At one point Harry says 1/4 of students are wearing green when going out to play quidditch in book 3 and says theres 200 slytherin students which is where I got the 800 number. I like to think that Harry's year is abnormally low because it was during war time and people weren't having children.

I like to think theres around 800 students because otherwise the british wizarding world is just too small when extrapolating from the number of students to the entire british wizarding population.

***** I believe it has been retconned that every year group of Hogwarts is exactly 40 students, that are divided equally into each house, with an even boy/girl split for each house.

****** “While I imagined that there would be considerably more than forty students in each year at Hogwarts, I thought that it would be useful to know a proportion of Harry's classmates, [...]”. -JKR

And 40 students per year means extremely low population. It means only 40 births per year, takeout 20% as muggleborns then you've 32 people born in to magical families. The Average global birth rate was 18.5 per one thousand, so total population would be around 2000. A government with multiple departments, a bank, a shopping district and a jail for 2000 people? I don't think that was viable.

******* I agree with you, I think it's well established that JK Rowling was awful with numbers.

******* Who says Hogwarts is the only magical school in Britain? But yeah JKR is bad at realism/math. Also, curious if your pop of 2000 takes into account that magicals are very long lived and a lot of them seem to marry/have children before 25.

** I'm guessing there are charms to hide that stuff and also that a lot of incidents where Obliviators had to come.
