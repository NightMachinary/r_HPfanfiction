Does anyone have any recommendations for a fanfiction with Slytherins in a positive light? Not necessarily a Harry Potter sorted into Slytherin though

  Ginny's resentment at her family's poverty explodes while shopping for school supplies. Under the cover of her mother's embarrassment, Lucius Malfoy slips a diary into her cauldron and suggests she'd be welcome in his home. Throw in a sorting into Slytherin and let the dark games begin. Slytherin!Ginny, Dark!Ginny, AU. COMPLETE.

** Still very much in process, but my stuff has Harry in Slytherin, Terrance higgs, Blaise, and the Carrow twins will all be put in a more positive light. All my stuff is from the same story, but published as one shots so far.

** Ultimately H/D slash, but not until the end as Harry spends much of a fic as a child (de-aging fic). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/627632/][A Change in Perspective]] by RoozetteR (on ao3, bot-blocked).

** The Changeling is probably the best non Slytherin Harry fic with a positive depiction.

These all have Slytherin Harry: linkao3(19312162; 4913998; 5121464; 7189349) They're not all completely positive, but they all have Slytherins as a house that has nicer kids and bullies, like, how it is with regular children instead of them all being baby death eaters.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right?

  “This is Mr Riddle, one of our Slytherin prefects. I'm sure he'll make you feel right at home. Mr Riddle, this is Harrison Peters. He's just been sorted into Slytherin and will be joining you in sixth year,” Dumbledore announced jovially, though Tom could see that sliver of constant suspicion in his gaze that had never quite faded.“Harry,” the boy hurried to correct. “Just Harry.”And then he stuck his hand out. How... plebeian, Tom noticed with delight. Walburga would probably faint.
