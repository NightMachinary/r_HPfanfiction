:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The most impt factor i remember from this fic is that Arcturus Black (if I rmb correctly) is actually a time traveler. I can't rmb the plot a lot but I think Harry either ends up back in time where Tom Riddle is a professor. They end up tgt but Voldemort eventually comes to find Harry but he doesn't kill Harry aft seeing how happy his past/alt self is with Harry... They somehow plan an elaborate scheme to kill Voldemort (with Voldy's help) using a timer turner...Regulus is involved too - I think Harry somehow gets to be in Regulus' body when he goes forward again in time to kill Voldemort and then comes back in time to stay with Riddle (Voldemort still exists with them in the past somehow)

Idk if this is helpful but I rly want to find the fic...I've spent way too long looking for it ðŸ˜…

Ohh and by the way, there's a chapter when Voldy comes to look for Harry in the past where Hogwarts is having a play and I think Voldemort managed to somehow let students steal away love potions to see the chaos is reaps and the play ends up in a hilarious state

If someone knows this fic, please tell!! Thanks!


** I see some surface similarities to linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/7295120/1/The-Time-of-Roses]]) but that's probably not it.

  Harry travels back to 1942 in order to kill the 16 year old Tom Riddle. But apparently, someone else had the same idea. Who is the mysterious Arcturus Black? And why is he kissing Riddle? SLASH HP/TR and...?

*** Yeah it isn't this fic but it's somewhat similar. Thanks for trying.

If I rmb correctly, there's also a part in the fic where Ginny ends up getting tangled into the time travel because she and Arcturus meet while the man pops in and out of time and they end up liking each other.

*** Ohh my friend found the fic for me a few minutes ago!! Apparently it wasn't Arcturus Black but Alphard Black who did the time travelling. I didn't rmb the details well - oops.

Here's the link if you're interested in reading it :)
