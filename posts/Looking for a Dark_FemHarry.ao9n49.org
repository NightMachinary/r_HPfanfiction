** linkffn(11602420) I read this a while ago so I'm not sure how it holds up (there is a ravenette in the first paragraph lol) but I remember enjoying it quite a bit despite the very rushed opening. I think it fits your request quite well. Unapologetic Moriarty-ness and such.

There's "The Long Game" by inwardtransience, where she's not necessarily evil but it becomes clear later on that fem!Harry is a functioning psychopath/sociopath who has been raised carefully by Lily. Iirc it's a fascinating exploration of that mindset, because clearly she has the potential to go dark (and does some questionable things) but instead of being cartoonish she's written as a genuine person. It's subtle enough that you might miss it at first, which is how it should be. It got weird near when it dies though, with some sexual stuff which I didn't enjoy and why I don't think I can link :( But I would recommend checking it out anyway.

linkffn(12188463) Hermione is semi-dark but ostensibly good but...it's complicated. It's one of those "changed by war" things, but I think it fits pretty much everything you listed, unless Tomione is not your cup of tea of course. It's definitely not PWP but the exploration of her relationship with Tom is important.

  Jasmine Potter came out of her abusive childhood somewhat changed, showing a few sociopathic tendencies. When she lays eyes upon the wizarding world she sees oppurtunity, and decides to take up the mantle of her favourite villain. The balance of power shifts as the chessboard is shaken up by a new player. But what of her foil, Miss Granger? AU,OOC, F/F, Fem!HarryxHermione pairing

** linkffn(Moratorium by Darkpetal16) is a dark!fem!Harry who takes to a life of crime---organised crime---with her alter ego "Moratorium". 218k+ words. Completed. I've reread this one once or twice, and it's still a low-key favourite of mine.

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist by BrilliantLady) is a Hermione-centric fic where Hermione summoned her first demon when she was only eight and then proceeded to befriend it---as well as some of its friends. I remember it being somewhat lighthearted, and though I've only read it once, I do remember enjoying it. This is a lot shorter at only 50k+ words, but I don't have a lot of fics that fit your request so I thought I'd mention it. Completed.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

**** Iirc her name is Harriet but mostly she's called Harry. So no real explanation just a way for the author to keep the names close to canon.\\
It is a very interesting story though I'd you can look past that point. There's were a number of elements that I don't recall seeing previously in other stories and even someone of the more common ones were very well done.

  Third in the Black Queen series. Jen chose to embrace the darker aspects of the world long ago, and she has never once regretted it. However, serving Baron Samedi creates its own problems. A new enemy is on the prowl, and now she needs to eliminate him... before he can do the same to her. Jen/Luna; as always, not for children

  Fourth and last in the Black Queen series. Jen has just months in which to kill her destined foe, but after defeating the Turk, she is sure she now has a chance to succeed. Unfortunately, Voldemort spent his year's sabbatical uncovering secrets that she would have preferred him never learn. Secrets that could now prove deadly for everyone. Still not for children.
