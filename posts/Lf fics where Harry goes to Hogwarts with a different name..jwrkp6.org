I was thinking Dumbledore's idea of leaving Harry to grow up without the pressure of being famous could be extended to Harry going to school with a pseudonym so he'd still get a normal education, instead of kids staring at him left and right. Does anyone know of any fics like this?


** Sally Anne Perks was already on her seat when McGonagall saw the next name on the parchment. She rolled her eyes as she read out loud.

"Pottah, Hadrian!"

A black haired boy walked forward. His nose was big and fake by all accounts but nowhere as ridiculous as the thick fake mustache. Still, the students in the Hall didn't seem to find anything suspicious with that, and went on as it was any other students.

'I'll give him an enchanted disguise,' Dumbledore had said, 'As long as he wears it no one will know who he is.'

Minerva had nothing against it, but this was clearly and beyond a doubt the most idiotic disguise she had ever seen.

*** Thank you! Do you remember If in this story Harry knows he is Harry Potter? I was hoping to avoid any "my parents lied to me, I dont know who I am anymore" moments.

**** No, his adoptive parents are very upfront with him, and so is "Aunt Minnie" (AKA Professor McGonagall).

*** Thanks but I was thinking more like I want Harry Potter to be famous, still be the Chosen one and all that, I just want other people to not know that Harry is Harry. Like Dumbledore and the order and imediate friends could know but not the whole School and general public.

  AU: At 5, an abused Harry is taken in by a powerful family. Taking the name Gabriel, he grows up into someone very different. How will Hogwarts and Voldemort react? Soldier!Harry, Neutral!Harry, implied child abuse.
