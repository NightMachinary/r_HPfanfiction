I only know one and its The Perfect Girl where its a HarryxDraco pairing. But its a bit unusual because Draco likes Harry but hes a guy. So he Draxo did something to make Harry permanently a girl.


** Is this the story you are talking about linkffn(1670793)? Please, link, there are so many stories with same name over the Internet.
