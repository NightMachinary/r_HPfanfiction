:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I read this fic where it starts with Harry and Ginny getting together, relatively early in the HP timeline and then Ginny accuses Harry of cheating. Time goes on Harry has moved on and they find out Ginny had been potioned by this other dude, but it was too late. It was not a GinnyxHarry fic. It may have been Haphne but I'm not sure.


** Was it Linkffn(3882344)

I vaguely remember that fic having a plot similar to that. It seemed like Ginny bashing til the Love potion was revealed.

  Harry asks Ginny to the Yule Ball. Everyone believes Harry is destined to be with a redhead. There is more than one redhead in Hogwarts, though.
