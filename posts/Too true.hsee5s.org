/Perhaps you could call yourself Harrison or Hadrian,/ Tom suggested.

/Harry isn't supposed to be short for anything,/ Harry wrote, baffled. /It's just Harry. ‘Hadrian' sounds like I'm Malfoy's brother. ‘Harrison' sounds like that American actor./

** I always find it odd that in cases where the author wants to make Harry a nickname as opposed to his full name, I don't think I've ever seen anybody suggest "Henry" - of which Harry is legitimately a shortened form. Case in point: Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex is actually named Henry Charles Albert David. Harry is the diminutive form of Henry in this case. Plus it doesn't fall into the trap of "Harrison" which does sound to American, nor of "Hadrian" which is Roman. I legitimately don't think I've seen a single instance of this, and I don't know why.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Long ago, Harry Potter was sold by his uncle to the Umbrella Corporation. But when the Goblet of Fire picks the champions for the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Harry, now Henry Ashford, is summoned to Hogwarts, out of the stasis tank he had been in. And so too has his mother. Alexia Ashford decides to use the Tri-Wizard Tournament to test the power of T-Veronica...and her own magic...
