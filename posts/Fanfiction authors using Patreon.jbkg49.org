DarknessEnthroned/TheBlankCanvas, the author of Cadmean Victory, just updated the story to tell everyone that he has opened a Patreon. He will also post a remaster of Cadmean Victory there.

I've seen it done before in this fandom and others, but is this really legal? Especially because he isn't just posting ff on ff-sites and original work on paid sites.

I totally understand that he wants to make the step from fanfiction author to professional(paid) author. But using his fanfictions as a bait to force people on his Patreon profile is kind of questionable IMO. I normally don't have a problem with authors linking to their published works or similar stuff in the A/N‘s of their stories, but isn't this going a bit too far in monetizing fanfiction?


** Honestly, this kind of thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

I think it's generally accepted that expecting people to pay for fanfiction is a no-no. This may not have resulted in much in the way of legal action, outside of some cases where people actually published their fanfiction in honest-to-goodness ink-and-paper format, but there's no real difference between a writer attempting to publish their fanfic on Amazon self publishing, and locking it behind a paywall on Patreon.

Except of course, for the time being at least, Cadmean Victory is not behind the paywall. It's publicly available, and if you do buy into the Patreon supporter levels, you're actually just getting access to the author's original works.

Really, though? The only real content on The Blank Canvas Patreon page is the rewrite of Cadmean Victory, and it has six subs already. It's pretty obviously a case of '/this/ isn't what you're paying for, nudge nudge, wink wink.'

If I went out and started posting all future story updates to Patreon alone (but completely 'free'!), but added some paid tiers to get exclusive, world-first access to random badger pictures I found on the internet, it would be pretty transparent that what is being paid for is /not/ really the badgers.

It seems to me like they think they've found a loop-hole, and honestly, they'll probably make some money from it. It's very unlikely that they'll see any legal ramifications, but if this kind of behaviour became commonplace, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see the coy, 'oh, but I thought they were just paying for something /else/ on this page covered in buttons to give me money, I swear!' fall apart completely under legal scrutiny.

I know people like to feel like they're giving back to the writers that spend so much time creating stories, but in the long run I really do think it is likely to do more harm than good.

If you absolutely /must/ show your appreciation, I'd much rather you donated that money to your favoured charity. Send me a screen shot if you like. That would make me feel /much/ better than something like Patreon.

*** First of al, I'd like to say that my first reaction is to agree with you. However, there's an entire industry - from which this is nearly no different - which no one complains about, at least to my knowledge.

What about artists who draw paid commissions based off of existing characters? Isn't that nearly an identical problem?

I think what it comes down to is Fair Use. It'd be simple to argue that writing fanfiction falls under it, given that in most cases it's entirely transformative or parody. Making money from Fair Use is legal.

I'm not sure, exactly, what my final thoughts are on this, but I'd be open to the conversation.

**** The author would upload their fanfic along with their original content. They'd say something about the FF being a side project and they just wanted to show what else they're doing, but the OC is what subscribers are really paying for. They'll point to the fact that their FF is free on another site and all the subscribers get is access to a chapter or 2 early or something.

What worries me is that fan artists are all over Patreon and make money off that. In terms of copyright, is there really a difference? I dunno, I'm not a copyright lawyer, but the sale of fanart has always seemed like one of those things that gets ignored because it's not worth it. Possibly paid access to fanfic will be the same. Maybe not. Maybe Patreon will have to start shutting down fanfics, and they'll come down on fanart as well.

I have read from authors who decided to monetize their popular fanfics. They found a publisher, took down the fanfic, removed all references to copyrighted material, and published it. Then they told their following about the new book. I am totally okay with this form of ff monetization.

this is never going to happen. fanfiction is incredibly obviously fair use, and the ‘industry' is big enough that someone will lawyer up if it's challenged. IP laws may be awful but they're not that bad, Disney isn't out there suing people for drawing pictures of Mickey Mouse.

** While I would definitely agree that this is over the line, and leaves a bad taste, it also makes me wonder... where is the line exactly?

I've seen a Pokémon romhack whose author has a Patreon, and the romhack is very popular. It still leaves me with a bad taste since they're profiting off what is essentially copyright infringement of someone else's franchise when you get down to it. I think fanfics may also technically infringe, but very few actually bother going after people about it, since basically all fanfiction writers and romhackers give their work out for free. And then I've seen game mods in Minecraft who also has a Patreon... but Minecraft modding is, to my knowledge, fully legal. So where is the line exactly?

** It's a pretty open and shut case of blatant copyright violation. Dress it up all behind words like donations or support all you like, paywalling copyrighted material you don't own is illegal.

But I don't have any strong opinions about it personally. I mean yeah it's illegal and shady, but this is hardly going to put a dent in JK's or WB's bottom line, if it even registers at all. It certainly won't put anyone out of work. Not to mention the fact that companies steal from content creators all the time. The amount of money corporations steal from Youtubers for example is ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised for a second if someone at WB has as well, so I can't be bothered feeling sorry or indignant on their behalf.

Beyond that I'm not a real fan of the practice. A few writers I like do this, and while I love their work I can't bring myself to support such a thing. One author hasn't updated his stories in months on FF.net, but I know for a fact he has several chapters backlogged and updates frequently on Patreon.

** It's a strange legal gray area, because with patreon you're not technically paying for the writing yourself, but you're donating to an artist you support and that gives you access to other work they've done. Practically speaking it seems like there's no difference, but legally there's a world of difference that's been enshrined in law, especially in tax law.

But there's also an argument to be had about the legality of straight up monetizing fanfiction. People have monetized fanart to hell and back, and arguably most fanart is inherently less transformative than most fanfiction, especially when that fanart is of a piece of media that's already visual. Yet fanart has been monetized on official channels without a peep from copyright holders; just wander into your local convention to see the artist's alley full to the brim with fanart for sale.

The reason why there's a stigma on monetizing fanfiction and not on fanart is because of the legacy of people like Anne Rice. But that stigma doesn't carry over to the legal system. Copyright holders who harassed fanficcers in the past did so by overwhelming them with legal resources that they couldn't match, but now we have organizations like AO3 that have lawyers on call to mount legal defenses on behalf of individual fanficcers. And frankly, I think that a person writing fanfic for money has a strong legal ground to stand on, since they are in no way disrupting the revenue of the copyright holder (no one's commissioning Rowling for their Drarry Omegaverse fic) and copyright holders have been implicitly approving of monetized fanart for decades.

I get the concern, but I think that if you disapprove of monetized fanfic, then it only follows that you should also disapprove of monetized fanart. And if you approve of monetized fanart, it only follows that you should also approve of monetized fanfic.

** I dunno. A lot of negative views in the comments here, but I don't really see this as 'forcing' people to pay, or even baiting them. IMO it's as simple as him wanting to write fanfiction, and if people want to support that lifestyle then that's OK. As long as he's not putting it behind a pay wall then there's nothing wrong with it. At the end of the day it's not illegal to write fanfiction, and it's not illegal to pay people who you don't want to stop doing that.

Edit: reread your post and noticed the mention of a pay wall for the 'remastered' version. Pretty sure that IS illegal, but if he didn't pay wall anything and literally just asked for donations and wrote fanfic that was completely open and free I don't think it would be illegal or immoral. At that point I would look at it more as people supporting his writing as a lifestyle, because they enjoy reading it, as opposed to people paying him for his work on any specific piece. Does that make sense? I'm not sure, but it does to me.

** I know some writers who have like, koffee (I can't remember how it's spelled) or patreon because they're struggling moms or something, and their readers know they have like, hospital bills and stuff to pay, the stress of which pulls them away from their keyboard and writing, and these people just wanted to be able to give them a buck or two every month to help them out; but their fic is always freely available on ao3, tumblr and ffnet, and the most the ‘patrons' got was some gossip; or previews; or maybe they got to read the latest chapter a day earlier; or maybe they were able to submit prompts or something, you know?

Those were truly generally small donations that people wanted to give, and they decided they needed that help and felt ethically comfortable accepting it; and you know, these people weren't just working on one long fic, but were those people who contributed a lot to the fandom as a community, not just writing fics.

But the problem I have a big issue with is when someone takes their fic off the free sites and puts it behind a pay wall. Like I'd almost prefer to just buy the story off of amazon for a once off payment of three dollars or whatever rather than be subscribed to a patreon, just so I can see updates.

** I don't think he's using it as a bait. Disclaimer on his ffnet page says:

"Important note on the above: I don't own the rights to any of the fanfiction I write or post, so if you just want to read the fanfiction posted on my patre0n, you don't have to pay. However, my original content, community, and everything I hope to build with the people I've met on this site, is behind the patron barrier. Once again, just to be really clear, because copyright is a very real thing. All the fanfiction I post here, there, or anywhere, is non-profit, so only become a patron if you want to support my writing aspirations, see my original content, or join the community."

so basically one does not have to follow him to Patreon. I know I won't.

The only person I'd follow/support would be Miranda Flairgold series /A Second Chance at Life/ / /Changes in a Time of War/ and the unfinished /A Magical World/. I still go back and reread them sometimes because of the massive worldbuilding done to make it an original fiction.

The problem is that the updated version of it exists solely on a website that obviously and prominently asks you to pay for stuff. But sure, /that/ story isn't part of what you're paying for. Nope. Definitely not. Looks, it's free for everyone to read!

That kind of argument rarely works in other areas. 'Oh, no, it wasn't a bribe, I just felt overcome with generosity, and gave him the money, no strings attached. And he, in a decision completely unconnected to my decision to give him large amounts of money, decided to do the thing I wanted him to do.' Yeah. That's not likely to fly.

** Frankly, I am still firmly of the 1990's state of mind where open source and free access was the internet's most praised and celebrated virtue. When companies started to commercialize the internet something precious was lost.

I have always been very generous with voluntary donations for stuff that isn't hidden by a paywall but rather asks for a donation in order to pay for time or effort in stead.

I might even be convinced to help one of my favourite authors out with a micro donation if they'd put a message out that by high exception they can't pay their bills.

That said nobody has managed to awe me enough into wanting to support a pateron for early access or exclusive content hidden behind a paywall. Maybe it's the knee jerk reaction that keeps me away from it.

Moreover I am mostly concerned that if more fanfic authors put their fanfics behind paywalls, the creators of the original content might start to sue and the fandoms are going back to being big no-no's the way Terry Goodkind's Sword of the Truth series still is.

** There's probably some leeway or technicality someone with actual knowledge of legal systems could find (especially since copyright laws and associated things do vary slightly from country to country), but generally selling fanfic is against the law unless you have permission, yeah. Not jail time illegal or anything, but it does open you up to fines and lawsuits (again, varies by country).

I guess the author either doesn't know that, does have permission to do so, or is falling back on the tried and true addendum to every law - it's only illegal if you get caught. Rowling and Warner can't sue someone for something they never hear about, after all.

Are the BBC/CBS/Warner Bros/literally every movie studio and author under the sun scum because they retold various Sherlock Holmes stories and got paid for doing so?

The only reason it's illegal to break copyright is because Disney pulled the ladder up behind them so they could keep making money off of Mickey Mouse. The first Harry Potter book would be entering the public domain fairly soon under earlier copyright systems.

Why do you consider it "fundamentally immoral" to make money off of your labor, if it's derivative? Every work of fiction is derivative, some just are better at hiding it. Hell, Fifty shades of Gray was Twilight fanfic with the serial numbers filed off. Should Erika Leonard give all the money she made by writing that to Stephenie Meyer in penance for the "fundamentally immoral" act of taking inspiration from the Twilight universe to write her story?

I've read star wars fanfic that has felt less derivative of its source than Eragon was. Why is getting paid for fanfic so much worse in your eyes?

***** "But everything is derivative" is a line commonly deployed, but I think it's one of those arguments which relies on establishing a false dichotomy where everything must be absolutely black or absolutely white with no ability to distinguish even obviously different shades of grey.

"If a work is derivative at all, then it can be treated the same as a work which is entirely derivative" is what this argument amounts to.

But I think that there are distinctions between, one the one hand, drawing on a common cultural heritage and using ideas such as wizards and fairies, and, on the other hand, taking a boy called Harry Potter who is a wizard who attends a magic school called Hogwarts whose parents were killed by a dark wizard called Voldemort. Both are derivative in a sense. But they're also still very much different things.

Not only do I think there is a distinction, I also think that it's a distinction which only takes a peppercorn of common sense to recognise. It takes a special kind of overthinking a problem to arrive at the idea that these things are in principle the same just because they all, at a stretch, fall under the umbrella "derivative".

****** I can see why you might draw a distinction between directly derivative works and more indirect, sure, even if I don't agree. However, it's not nearly the "common sense" thing to recognize. What makes Master of the Universe immoral to make money off of, but all you have to to to make it moral is change a few character names and call it Fifty Shades of Grey? They're the same work of fiction, as far as I can tell you seem to be ok with monetizing one but not the other.

I've read plenty of HP fanfic with no character named Harry Potter, no magic school called Hogwarts, and no dark wizard Voldemort to be seen. Where's the exact line? Plenty of my favorite fics could be given the Fifty Shades treatment and pretty much be perfectly ok to publish. Don't just go "oh it's common sense", you need to justify your point. Where does a piece of fiction go from being "entirely derivative", and immoral to profit off of, to "just somewhat derivative at all" and ok to do so? Sorry if I don't have the same amount of common sense as you, help me out here.

Additionally, I brought up the legal use of works in the public domain as well, since you mentioned "regardless of legality" in your original post... Do you really think that? Is everyone involved in having made every piece of Sherlock fiction fundamentally immoral? Every movie, tv show, manga, comic, anime, stage play, etc? These works are entirely derivative, they have Sherlock & Watson, most have got Moriarty, a ton have the same plots. From what you've written, you seem to think they are all bad people for making them. But who are they actually hurting, and what is making what they're doing immoral? Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has been dead for almost a century.

Do you genuinely think that it's an immoral act to write fiction based on other people's work, and receive financial compensation for your labor?

****** Okay, I just wanna preface this with a quick disclaimer that I don't mean any of this as condescendingly as it may sound. I'm running on low sleep and I struggle with diplomacy when I'm tired. So, yeah, I apologise profusely for how it may sound, and if it sounds negative please know that I'm not intending it that way. I'm also not sure if my thought structure even makes sense, but that's a whole other issue. Feel free to tell me if I'm talking nonsense. :D

Oh, that's undeniably true, you're right, Law is indeed different in every country. And ethics is different for every person. Even if you believe it should be universal, in reality ethics manifests very differently for everyone. Of course, you can evaluate however you choose - that's entirely your prerogative and I'm just a random voice on the internet, after all - but as I said, the rest of the comments on this post show the issue with doing so. You believe it's wrong, they believe it's right... so then what? Where do you go with that? Morality manifests itself far too subjectively to find those common precepts to build an argument upon without it devolving, especially on the internet, and just saying your moral views on a subject at each other isn't terribly productive. But if I go any further with that point it'll start veering into the epistemology of debate and this probably isn't the place. So, I'll simply conclude with the point that ethical valuation has its own difficulties and I would perceive those as harder to work around than debating practicalities, even with country-based variations.

(Also, to clarify - practicalities also includes functionalities, not just legalities. ie. how the behaviour manifests, how/if it works well, what could be done better, what scenarios might ensue, what consequences might be levied, and so on. So, this writer is trying to charge for their fanfic - what might that mean for everyone else and fandom? What consequences might that bring down? What ideas will that propagate through fandom, if any?)

Anyway, regarding the practicalities - whether you live in America or Timbuktu, the generalities are still there to debate and they're a lot less... emotionally charged than ethics often gets. A little Western-centric a viewpoint, I agree, but Reddit is mostly Americans.

#+end_quote

This is not a legal loophole... it's the kind of thing people consider a loophole if they get all their legal knowledge from TV legal dramas.

In reality, the law doesn't work like that. Judges/juries make findings of fact and they're perfectly capable of seeing through convoluted schemes. It's entirely open to a judge to find that, as a matter of fact, there existed an arrangement between the parties of payment in exchange for fanfiction.

So I can talk as much as I like about how technically I'm not paying for fanfiction, I'm just happening to give this person a regular gift, and he is just so happening to regularly post fanfiction. But this is a fairly transparent scheme and the likely finding of fact would simply be "the author was accepting payments in exchange for writing fanfiction".

The only situation where I think you could avoid that finding of fact is where the author in question has a long history of posting fanfic for free, publicly, and then starts accepting donations, which do not alter the frequency or manner in which their works are posted. In that situation, I think it's fair to say that as a matter of fact, no exchange is taking place.

But with Cadmean Victory, that's explicitly not what's happening. The author stopped writing and now is saying he will write again for payment.

He may well get away with it. JKR and WB tend not to act on these things - see when MOR elicited payments in exchange for a faster update rate. But if JKR/WB did decide to shut it down, my money is solidly on them succeeding.

***** In principle I can't think of a logical reason why the arguments should be different as regard visual art as opposed to prose.

Nonetheless I recognise that many people will instinctively feel that fan art is different (and have that same feeling myself).

I suspect the reason for this feeling is that the medium is not the same medium as the original work. Producing artwork of HP doesn't feel like it's stepping on JKR's shoes in the same way as fanfiction.

The test for this theory is to imagine, say, a Spider-man comic produced by a fan. In this scenario the artwork is in the same medium as the original. And at least for me, the idea of someone selling their own versions of Spider-man comics does trigger the same sense of moral wrongness as selling fanfic.

  In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include---

  (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

  (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;

  (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and

  (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

***** And not even a deciding factor. On average, monetization tends to lend weight against fair-use, but monetization doesn't automatically negate the fair-use defense. I know it's not a 1:1 comparison with fanfiction, but many movie reviewers monetize their work.

** In all honesty, I think this falls in a grey area.

As a previous user commented, it is is very similar to artists who draw/animate/paint etc. characters from series they don't own.

I currently subscribe to a Patreon where the entire purpose is comics based around Fire Emblem Three Houses, and I doubt the author owns the copyright at all.

Additionally, the YeseniaFaye patreon page IS exactly this. She makes her own original works but also does fanfictions there as well.

In all honesty, it may fall under the "Transformative" part of Fair Use. It can be argued that it is original work that does not attempt to compete or replace the original works.

** I think it's great of an author can monetize their hobby. Patreon would be a great way for an author to release new chapters in advance to their patrons (and let the patrons essentially be a crowdsourced proofreading service that pay you for the privilege).

** I don't mind it. I'd even consider contributing if I loved the fic. JK is set for life from Harry Potter. I have no moral qualms with supporting value added work from people who write original stories based off her characters.

Plus, I take issue with people in similar situations thinking this is somehow harming Warner Bros ip and copyright. It's not a sum zero game. Me being entertained by a fanfic and paying the author for writing it doesn't make me less likely to go buy canon HP stuff. In fact, I'd say the fanfiction content in Harry Potter is what has kept me coming back to the series, buying the books, watching the movies, etc... good fanfics are good for JK & WB's bottomline.

** Not a lawyer by any stretch of the imagination, but how different legally is fanfiction comapared to artwork or merchandise? I'm sure there are plenty of artists who have been commissioned to draw Harry Potter characters in one form or another, and there's definitely lots of people buying (and making) unofficial merch. Would fanfiction get crushed simply because its also writing?

** Let me be clear. Putting fanfiction behind a paywall is almost certain illegal, and 100% immoral.

But that's not what the author is doing. He's putting them on his patreon but not behind a paywall. He's basically moving his fanfiction to a site with a ton of advertisements.

It still makes him an asshole, but not one that would require complete resection.

** I'm not a legal scholar, but it seems to me that so long as the fanfiction is being published for free, there's a decent case for arguing the patronage money is not payment but a donation.

Either way, there's so little money in targeting a specific creator that it would have to be a very petty rights-holder to file a suit.

Even then, it most likely wouldn't be fanfiction that gets hounded down, but the patreon side of the matter.

** Personally I have a dislike of the paywalling of content where there is a source of income originally - mainly being the paywall behind some YouTube content creators. The paywalling of a FanFiction is almost a blurred line for myself, some authors have a paywall behind their early releases - such as early/unrevised chapters which are coming ahead and mention that they have discussions with their followers about them. Something like this is slightly different in my opinion to a paywall of an entire FanFiction. I don't agree with it, I don't see the necessity behind it either - although perhaps if I was a writer of something which was achieving millions of hits I would feel different and hope that others would support the time and effort that I put into a story they are enjoying. Fundamentally I don't have an issue with it, as long as they're not posting one chapter and telling you that you have to support them throughout the time that they are finishing the rest of the story. However, each to their own.

** I think it's a legal grey area like fanfiction in general is. If the only way to access the work is to pay, then it's clearly profiting from an unauthorised derivative work, so would attract Lawyers. If on the other hand it's only a preview and an opportunity to comment/affect the content before it's made public, that's different as then it's paying for the authors time rather than the work.

** It's shitty practice but until they are paywalling fanfictions on their Patreons nothing really can be done.

There are a lot of fan fiction writers that are making thousand dollars a month there. I know lots of talented authors who are writing their own works and don't make even half of that amount.

It's the same with fan art really. You can find dozens of 3D creators that are making tens of thousands dollars a month by leeching out of the work of someone else and paywalling their works without shame. I think it can really happen in fan fiction too. Two or three years ago nobody would even thought about asking for money for writing fan fiction (at least I didn't notice at that time). Nowadays a lot of authors have their own Patreons.

** I just wanna say that there's content posted two months ago by him that's now under a paywall. 2 months. And his answer is to wait for the chapters to catch up. It's ridiculous and immoral. He I barely even defends it, saying he only cares about the people helping the community. Except there isn't really any community and it's just one guys ego trip as he charges money from people wanting to learn to write or just read the bloody story. I used to be a huge fan and loved the original story. But it's really soured me on him, especially as he just doesn't care about his fans, just about making money. It's against the spirit of fan fiction. Fan art is something I've never thought about so I won't comment, I'd just embarrass myself.

But his predatory, blackmailing and greedy practices are indefensible and keeping your work hostage is over the line. I'm not gonna wait two months and then read a couple of chapters, but he doesn't even care what people in my position think because we aren't putting money in his pocket. He's safe from copyright unless JKR comes after him and he doesn't care about the fans, leaving him totally able to act in a way against the whole ethos of fan fiction.

Christ. I've been a fan since before the original was finished and this honestly hurts, which makes me feel dumb cause I know he has no obligation to care but fanfics aren't supposed to be like the big corporations. He's supposed to care and doesn't.
