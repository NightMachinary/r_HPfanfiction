Due to restrictions from the publisher (and likely personal beliefs), the characters in Harry Potter don't really swear. Even Ron seems to stick to "bollocks", which is rather tame for a British male teenager.

It is understandable for some characters, e.g. Hermione is unlikely to swear, unless the situation is truly and utterly fucked. For me, I would view Harry as a casual swearer, with frequent usage of words like "shit" and "fuck".

Hermione, on the other hand, would rarely swear, but when she does... Oh boy! Expect words like "cunt" and pure, unadulterated rage to come flying out. Ron would be bloody terrified!

But the one I imagine taking the cake, when she isn't in mourning, is Cho fucking Chang! Scottish and a Ravenclaw, she rips into anyone who dares like Malcom Tucker.

What do you think? How often do other character swear, and how creative are they?


** She does write 'they swore' in place of actually cursing, so I do mostly write that too. I use casual swears where it interrupts the rhythm to exclude cursing.

Except James, who gets every west country style swear slang I heard growing up.

*** I always enjoyed Rowling's publisher-induced workarounds (“he called Snape something that made Hermione say ‘Ron!'”). And I do think that through this method, Rowling told us that Ron does swear when Molly isn't around, but Harry/Hermione not so much.

Like you, I mostly use “they swore” unless the writing really calls for a particular well-placed word.

*** To be fair, British 'swearing' is vastly different from the US "George Carlin's 7 Dirty Words" variety.

** I always have difficulty with fics which make the characters swear too much, funnily enough. For the Trio, I agree: i don't really see Hermione swearing. For me, Ron would be the casual swearer, but I've always headcanoned Molly to be severe about it so maybe not so "casual" about it... I don't really see Harry swearing, especially at young age. Maybe growing up, and especially during his book 5 period, when he's angry all the time.

​

As for the others, I would say maybe Seamus for the swearing. Sirius when he's young, especially if his parents are against it.

*** Seamus is Irish. Of course he swears.

** Well, JKR has said in interviews that in her own mind Ron swears a blue streak, but she had to tone it down for publication.

** The Weasley kids swear all the time, and they're creative because all of them together had to have fun just making stuff up.

Harry swears when he's angry. He's not creative, but he's aggressive. Harry swearing at you is actually intimidating.

Hermione rarely swears and she doesn't swear at people. It's just when she's really frustrated and something got done wrong.

Sirius swears like crazy, but it's very theatric. In casual, private conversations with friends, he doesn't swear at all.

** I think that outside of a character flaw; swearing should be used sparingly, with an aim for it being a way to emphasise emotional high points.
