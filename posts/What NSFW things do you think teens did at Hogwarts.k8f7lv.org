** Well there would be a roaring trade in spells and potions that aided self gratification.

1) making things vibrate.

2) partial transfigurations.

3) gratification under the effect of things like the Cheering Charm.

4) Polyjuicing as someone else and 'taking then for a spin.'

5) semi ritualistic sec acts like the one might find in a magical Kama Sutra.

6) consensual and mutual use of love potions to make a fling with someone you only kind of like feel much more fulfilling.

7) replacing one sensation/sense with another using Switching Spells.

8) anonymising spells and masks for casual swinging.

9) Fred & George's daydream potion and all that it implies

10) invisibility and all the implies for exhibitionist

** Several students living in a dorm and (presumably) sharing a bathroom means they've absolutely walked in on each other naked and/or masturbating at least once. Some might be embarrassed to be caught in such a state, some might not really mind, some might deliberately flaunt it. It would depend on personality and upbringing.

There are spells and potions to both enlarge and shrink things, and I guarantee that self-conscious teenagers will try them on various parts of their anatomy. They might or might not work that way (focusing on a part vs. the whole), or maybe they do but it's difficult to make work, or maybe it's actually really easy to get exactly the endowment you want. Also, would it be temporary or permanent until undone? Either way, Madam Pomfrey no doubt has lots of experience correcting mishaps.

The Room of Requirement is an excellent place for nookie, but its existence is not common knowledge. Dumbledore maybe knows about it, but the student body at large doesn't. At most, it's a mysterious room that was there when they needed it (see Fred and George's anecdote about how it was a broom closet for hiding from Filch) but can't seem to find again later. So no "let's sneak off to the Room for a shag" business.

Wizarding porn would basically be a book full of salacious gifs.

There's no way magical sex toys and performance enhancers aren't a thing. The sky's the limit here.

** so I confess. I watched this hentai... and it had a magic small mirror (purse small) and he could see anything in it and also touch through. of course, he used it for rape, but it could be made consensual if the other person had to wear some sort of ring and the mirror would than show body parts only of the person who had that ring on. so a character could finger someone during potions or something.

/that's explicit though...

** Friendly reminder that magic can, in a fanfic, pretty much just Do Whatever.

A sufficiently creative mind could probably come up with several lewd uses for that first-year Charm that makes a pineapple tapdance (let alone other Charms and DADA spells - a variation on the Cheering Charm for pleasure-enhancement? A Tickling Jinx applied gently?), and half the things in that broom cupboard can be transfigured into something usable ("Everything's a dildo. Don't even have to be brave enough.").\\
There's probably a potion out there that works as a recreational drug and/or a little blue Muggle pill (although love potions make things iffy in the same way date-rape drugs would).

Wendelin the Weird was /canonically stated/ to enjoy the sensation of being burned with the Flame-Freezing Charm so much she got herself burned at the stake 47 times. There has to be something there, if you catch my drift.

TL;DR Same things Muggles do, plus MAGIC.
