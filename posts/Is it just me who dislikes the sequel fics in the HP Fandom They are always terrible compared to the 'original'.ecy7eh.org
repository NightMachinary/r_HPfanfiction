** I don't think that's a problem unique to fanfiction. Lots of movie, video game and book sequels are not as well-received as the originals.

*** Book sequels are normally planned before the first book is written though, that's why Cannon HP is so good, there is a build up through the books.

Also cannon characters are good by nature (ie if we are reading fanfics about them we must rate them), OCs are often not great, and it isn't realistic to write an OC to the same standard as a cannon character (a few have, it's just very rare)

** No, it's really a thing that some sequels are weaker in storytelling and storyline and there are many that get abandoned

** I think the problem is your sample size. Sequels in the fandom aren't always terrible. In fact, some of my favourite fics are sequels! Nonjon's entire Where in the World is Harry Potter? trilogy is fantastic; Alexandra Quick also comes to mind.

It's just that, like everything everywhere, some are bad, some aren't.

** The best written sequels I've seen are in those that are in a planned series. Like a constructed trilogy, or even going through seven years at Hogwarts. You are right that a lot of sequels don't live up to the first fic. It takes a lot of planning and work to make a sequel flow nicely from the first book

** I liked the second Weasley Girl fic better than the first, but that's the only exception I can think of off the top of my head.

*** And Hyaroo had planned a trilogy from the beginning, so that's probably why
