Looking for fics that have strong/op Harry, but go to ridiculous lengths to show how hard he works to get there. Fics where he practices constantly, like CONSTANTLY, instead of gaining new powers overnight. Fics that don't instantly start with Harry being strong, but show how he becomes strong. Stuff like that.


** Linkffn(pureblood pretense)

No Harry, but Harriett. Suits your request though.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway.

** linkffn(the many deaths of Harry potter; the art of self-fashioning) kinda fit this, though both have a caveat. Many deaths has a kinda Looper effect but every death brings you back to the last successful near death. Self fashioning just gives him a specific talent for transfiguration, though he does work for it extensively.

** Can we just agree that no matter how competent Harry becomes, or how much he learns, chances are that Voldemort will stick kick his ass unless Harry is trained by Dumbledore? I mean, no matter what Harry learns, he still won't have any knowledge of Duelling or any actual experience with it, and no matter how many times you cast a spell in a sheltered environment, it's likely that the results won't bode the same for a dangerous situation (Harry's lingering thoughts that the DA wouldn't probably be able to face an actual Dementor due to that same theory, Hermione's own incompetence in times of need, etc...) But since we're making everyone competent and realistic, I think a case could be made for Hogwarts having a Duelling Team that competes both against other schools and smaller teams that compete against other houses.

You're right, there are tons of other threats out there when you have magical creatures and all that stuff. But my main point was, no matter how many times you practice against a friend, the importance of the danger is never really engraved upon you.

Agreed, but I don't understand why the Wizarding World doesn't value it more. As far as we see, it isn't a major sport for some reason, and if it was, I have the oddest feeling that Harry would gravitate more towards that than Quidditch.

The Merging handles this just fine. The castle creates Stella, a duelling opponent for Harry. And Harry gets his ass kicked over and over. And he actually improves plenty.

Voldemort, after Hogwarts, went to travel around the world, and he doesn't shy away from immoral experiments and magic. Dumbledore is really damn old and has a lot of experience and still is only slightly more powerful than Voldemort since he's handicapped himself to one kind of magic.

I don't think so, as there isn't that much of a gap between Wizards themselves. Sure there is innate power, innate talent, etc... But I've yet to see anything that Voldemort did or Dumbledore did, that Harry couldn't have learned.

  and he doesn't shy away from immoral experiments and magic.
#+end_quote

What immoral experiments? Honestly, other than the Horcrux ritual, he wasn't stated to have done many experiments. As for Magic, Dumbledore explored the world as well (I don't think after Abeforth punched him, he simply went to Hogwarts) and likely learned more than Riddle.

#+begin_quote
  still is only slightly more powerful
#+end_quote

Actually, Dumbledore is on an extreme of power compared to Voldemort. During the Duel, he himself talked about taking Voldemort's life as if it was an instantaneous possibility, but it would not satisfy him.

#+begin_quote
  since he's handicapped himself to one kind of magic.
#+end_quote

Transfiguration, Charms, Elemental Magic, his Magic-sense thingy, Dark Magic (didn't seem opposed to using it at all), Wandless Magic, etc... Dumbledore has a lot more that we don't know about probably, but he doesn't rely on a single type of Magic.

#+begin_quote
  Harry would have those handicaps and none of the real experience.

I think that the idea is that Harry doesn't have those handicaps because he's Harry.
