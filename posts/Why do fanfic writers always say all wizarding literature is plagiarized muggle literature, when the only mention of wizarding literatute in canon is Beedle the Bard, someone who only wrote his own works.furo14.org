Do they?

Sounds like you're reading the wrong fics.

** Like all fanon, someone did it and it just caught on. But I think the general idea smooshes a lot of canon and real-world facts together:

- The Wizarding population is much smaller than the muggle population
- the wizarding world is very behind the muggle one in technology and arguably culture\\
- The WW contains a sizable group of people who despise Muggles and everything they've invented, therefore won't learn anything about Muggles and what they've done
- There's a shitload of good muggle literature
- Gildroy Lockhart and Rita Skeeter have already put the idea of wizarding authors being hacks or skeezeballs of some sort into the minds of the readers

It's assumed the WW, being so small, probably doesn't have a ton of fiction writers. And there's all this muggle literature just there for the taking. Muggles won't find out because it's only re-published in the WW. And the people who matter in the WW won't find out because they don't know what books muggles wrote. It's like free money for only a little work.

Behind? The WW doesn't have technology, they just ripped it off the Muggles.

**** Some things like quills and parchment are just being used for the sake of tradition, I give you that. But overall, what technology do the Muggles have which Magic can't replicate, and do it better while it's at it?

***** I meant things like the Hogwarts Express, Wireless, Knight bus, camera, etc. Created by Muggles, adapted by Wizards. Hell, they didn't even make the bus or the Express, they stole them.

**** If you're only defining technology as machinery, sure. If it's more like knowledge on how to achieve the practical use of things, it's debatable. Space expansion charms are amazing, muggles don't have anything like them. But the WW is behind in transportation, brooms are impractical when it comes to safety and comfort and the ability to transport large amounts of people, and also secrecy, which isn't a concern for muggles so I'm not sure if it should be counted. Apparition is dangerous to the point where some don't like using it at all, portkeys are controlled by the government so maybe a little difficult for an average citizen to get a hold of? And floo is also dangerous and weirdly inconvenient, as it can just deliver anyone right into your living room at any time if they know the name of the place you live? And the Knight Bus also seems dangerous and incredibly uncomfortable, like all forms of WW transport.

***** Technology:

#+begin_quote
  the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry.

  machinery and equipment developed from the application of scientific knowledge.

  the branch of knowledge dealing with engineering or applied sciences.

Yup, even Harry wasn't the biggest fan of magical transport, other than brooms and later Apparation. I agree with the space expansion charms though, that would be awesome to have. As for the practical use of things, they could have made connecting Vanishing Cabinets that went to multiple destinations, combining Apparation and the Floo Network together and making an easy, comfortable, all-magical Wizarding transport. That would have have been brilliant.

Wizards don't have their own technology by definition, it's all ripped off of the Muggles.

** I have never read a fic where this is mentioned. It's usually where they say muggle fiction that mirrors magical history.

** In my experience, the main reason is that inventing a unique cultural history for the Wizarding world requires more brainstorming and creativity than most fanfic authors are willing to commit to their hobby. Most fic authors stick to just reiterating what has been done before (i.e. cribbing from real world litterature) rather than taking the time to come up with worldbuilding that is completely new.
