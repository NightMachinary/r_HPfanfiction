I'm not sure if I'm just missing stories that incorporate this but I rarely see Hermione cry. And it's jarring for me because Hermione is possibly the biggest crier in the entire series. Hagrid is probably second here. Hermione in fanfiction comes off as too stoic and calculating. She can be those things sometimes, but most times she's very emotional. I really enjoyed that aspect of her as she has a duality to her character. She can be both extremely emotional and a big crier, as well as be one of the bravest characters in the series. I think fanfiction robs her of that.

I think more stories need it, because Harry and Ron don't cry much at ALL. Through my quick skim, I counted two occasions for Harry and one for Ron. For Harry, it was Dumbledore's funeral and visiting his parents grave. For Ron, it was just Dumbledore's funeral. And that's fine, not everyone cries. But some do, and Hermione's character shows that that is fine too.


** I do remember book hermione crying a lot, and she comes off as ooc a lot in Fanfictions unintentionally. I think most of the time Hermione acts as a self-insert, or people just want her to be this strong, female character, which she definitely is, but crying doesn't make you weak. It makes you human, and that's why hermione sometimes seems so surreal in Fanfiction

****** Hagrid is very much a stereotype/archetype. I don't know what the exact word for him is, but I've seen really big man with a sensitive, heart of gold quite a bit in TV and literature. I was instantly reminded of Hagrid the 1st time I read Of Mice and Men.

**** Harry cries after the graveyard in GoF as well, and I always thought that was one of the better descriptions in the text of that tight-throat, burning-eyes emotion. But you're very right, and I wish he showed a little more emotion in the text.

** Yes! I love how Hermione cries because it doesn't make her any less of a strong character. In fact she's much better with her emotions than Ron and Harry. I think it's such a good example of stereotypical “female things” having positive effect proving that there is nothing wrong with them

*** She does have some odd contradictory tendencies in the books. For instance, she shows absolutely no emotional understanding when Lavender Brown was upset about her bunny, while apparently a walking library about Cho's emotions. She has no tolerance for Ron showing jealousy about her relationship with Viktor, but ruthlessly assaults Ron when she can't handle seeing him with Lavender (while he doesn't tear into her about her jealousy, like she did to him)

***** I think of it as a reflection of Hermione's intelligence. When she can approach the issue intellectually, such as for Cho's emotional state, she can conceptualize the emotions in order to understand their relationship to inputs. As soon as she herself becomes emotionally invested, as in the cases of Ron and Lavender's bunny, she can't access her intellect.

This is, as you point out, a common issue for teenagers.

****** I can't remember if this was a fan observation or something said by JK or what, but to paraphrase:

Ron is generally wrong, unless he's joking.\\
Hermione is generally right, unless she's emotional.

Your mention of Hermione not being able to access her intelligence when emotionally invested reminded me of that.

**** I think that as a person Hermione greatly relies on logic to understand things. So she tries to treat Lavender in a logical way like she would probably try to rationalise it to herself. I don't think she was being intentionally heartless. Not to mention that this was when Hermione had the time turner and was super stressed.

I definitely don't think Hermione is perfect. But in that scenario I think it can be understood where she's coming from.

*** It think it's not that "Ginny doesn't cry" per se. I think it's more like Harry has like a world of emotional shit on him already, and he doesn't need more. Needs someone who is simple with things.

If he had someone as dramatic as him or even more... then they would be gloomy all the time...

***** It's more along the lines of Harry needed someone who wouldn't add to his emotional baggage, had emotional baggage that he could handle and he needed someone who wouldn't put up with his shit and also is able to handle his emotional baggage as well.

Ginny is the kind of person who will look at Harry and know whether he needs a shoulder to cry on, someone to actually talk to or someone that just needs to listen.

Hermione is someone who will look at Harry and just tell him what he needs to do to get better which isn't something that Harry needs/wants.

You can see that by how Ginny and Hermione deal with Harry having to mourn. Ginny from what i remember will come up to Harry, give him a hug, and sit with him not really saying much just being an emotional anchor. While Hermione will come up and try and talk to Harry about his feelings and how to handle them, they aren't wrong responses in general, but Ginny's response is what works with Harry most of the time.

*** In my quick search, Ginny cried a few times. I think on maybe three or four occasions. Not quite like Harry and Ron, but still far from Hermione and Hagrid level.

**** To be fair, Hermione appears more in 1 book than Ginny (or any female student) does in all 7 put together, so it isn't a fair comparison.

Maybe it is because I have sisters and many female friends, but I don't think canon Hermione cries that much. Women cry a lot. It's just the way of the world. Maybe men would, also, but we are conditioned to be less emotional.

***** I think it depends on the woman, though I absolutely agree about conditioning of emotional expression. (My male friends, for certainly, have feelings and have/have had mental health difficulities.)

I cry all the time. I've seen my wife cry a handful of times - she goes to shouty which imo is a less desirable trait. Probably some happy medium between us...

** My story (108k words and counting) is written from Hermione's POV. I'm trying to strike a balance between making her smart and defiant and practical but still showing her emotional side. She cries in my fic. Definitely. But that doesn't mean she isn't strong.

I haven't posted any of this. I worry that people will find her ooc but I've come too far to change my characterisation now. I guess I'll find out when I'm finished and start to post!
