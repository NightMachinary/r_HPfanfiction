** "Uncle Sev, what IS the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?"

"Typical Potter, never wanting to do the actual work. Neve-"

"Sev..."

Snape summons a book and places it before the young Potter, "Turn to page 394."

** It's an interesting thought. I think it would depend entirely on his housemates. A significant part of Snape's descent into wizard-nazi degeneracy came from sharing a dorm with Avery and Mulciber for seven years. Certainly he already had those leanings as a boy, seeded by the abuse from his muggle father, but those years cemented them.

If that year's Ravenclaw crop happened to bear similar leanings, he could have still wound up going that way, albeit to a lesser degree. His interest in Dark Magic becoming more academic than practical, blood supremacy views reduced to passive support instead of outright joining Voldemort.

The idea of Snape becoming besties with, say, Xeno Lovegood is comedy gold though.

** Linkffn(Wind Shear) thanks to time traveling Harry's influence, though it is a very minor plot point

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Snape's ultimate canon fate is a result of Muggle prejudice (not Muggleborn at first, or he'd never have become close friends with Lily). Depending on who his housemates are, he may either end up being the same, flourishing (Ravenclaw values academic excellence and intelligence, something he has in spades) and making a much better life of himself, or something inbetween. The fact that there isn't a Gryffindor-Ravenclaw rivalry means it's far more likely that he'll keep Lily's friendship, and perhaps even get some other real friends this time around, but his Muggle prejudices has the chance of being his downfall here too.

There's a bunch of Ravenclaw!Snape Snily oneshots. It's definitely plausible (if he never falls in with junior Death Eaters and his existing prejudices are suppressed by virtue of having better friends, there's nothing stopping the existing friendship from ever become more), so I could see why some would write that, but I haven't seen any longer ones.

There's also the occasional time traveler (typically Harry) that refocuses Snape's Sorting interest by pointing out the problems with choosing Slytherin, as mentioned earlier here (Wind Shear). Ship-wise, those are typically gen when it comes to Snape, or occasionally sets him up with an OC or Narcissa (since Lucius is typically portrayed as just as cruel as canon unlike her).
