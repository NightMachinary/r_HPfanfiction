If you can find anythingwith a crossover from rainbow six, the book by Tom Clancy, not the game or the other game, the book. With Chavez, Clark and the rest go in and ruin the enemy's day, not through luck or whatever, but through skill and professional abilities.

That would be outstanding.

Shit I don't even need Harry in this, I want to see John Clark in his prime, say I'm Fucking SNAKE and your shit ends here. And then shooting voldemort in the head.

For reference, please read the entire jack Ryan series of books that Clancy wrote,started with either "without remorse" or "patriot games" and ending with the "bear and the dragon".

Bonus points for getting references to world events from the time and saying this is why this happened and is glorious.


** I don't know if this exists, but if it ever does, I would read the shit out of that.
