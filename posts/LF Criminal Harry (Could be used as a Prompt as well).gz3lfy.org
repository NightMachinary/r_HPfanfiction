Are there any decent fanfictions where Harry ends up as a criminal? Maybe one where Harry is thought to be a Squib and is forgotten by the Wizarding World, and the Dursleys kick him out onto the streets. Maybe he has to pickpocket and steal to survive, and refuses to go to an orphanage because he was told horror stories about them from a young age. Anything like that?


** first one that come to mind is linkao3(Business by esama) where Harry emulates the villain from Sherlock Holmes, James Moriarty.

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task.AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.

  Jasmine Potter came out of her abusive childhood somewhat changed, showing a few sociopathic tendencies. When she lays eyes upon the wizarding world she sees oppurtunity, and decides to take up the mantle of her favourite villain. The balance of power shifts as the chessboard is shaken up by a new player. But what of her foil, Miss Granger? AU,OOC, F/F, Fem!HarryxHermione pairing
