If you're not familiar with /Carry On/, it originated as a story-within-a-story thing in Rainbow Rowell's novel /Fangirl/ where it was a clear stand-in for the Harry Potter series. Then Rowell turned it into an actual book, using the characters and setting as described in /Fangirl/ but with an original plot.

On one level I liked /Carry On/ a lot. Although the characters and worldbuilding are very heavily Harry-Potter-influenced they are also distinctly different in such a way that they can be appreciated on their own merits and don't need to be directly compared as better or worse. And the writing style's very engaging: I read the book because I'm enjoying Rowell's "Runaways" comic a lot and she's just as good in prose. The story's very good for the most part although I did have a couple of issues: I saw the twist with the Mage being behind it all coming from a mile off -- but I'm prepared to cut /Carry On/ some slack as it's a YA book -- and it bothered me how at the very end the way that the old families just didn't end up filling the power vacuum after the Mage's death: it felt very convenient, kind of cheap, and an easy out for a careless reader to just demonise the Mage and disregard the old families because all /their/ bad deeds are told rather than shown. Overall, though, it's a good book.

On another level, though, I feel kind of more ambivalent about it, and that's directly related to how it originates out of fandom culture and the Harry Potter fandom in particular. Because even though /Carry On/ is very much a work of original fiction -- the Watford School isn't Hogwarts, Simon Snow is not the same person as Harry Potter, Baz is not the same as Malfoy, Penny is not Hermione or Ron, Agatha is not Ginny, the Mage is not Dumbledore, Ebb is not Hagrid -- the /ways/ that they are different are the same ways that the Harry Potter characters tend to get twisted in a lot of fanfiction, and I really hate it when they do. And despite the differences between Harry Potter and /Carry On/, they are still similar enough that /Carry On/ could easily be read as a commentary on Harry Potter or even a how-it-should-have-been fixit kind of thing -- hell, at one point the Mage even rants "What is the greater good?", which is way too on the nose for my taste -- and if that /was/ the intention behind it, then I disagree with it completely.

So, my feelings about this book are kind of complicated.


** I enjoyed reading this perspective because I love this book and am heavily involved with the Carry On fandom.

I agree with a lot of what you said, and can understand how some of these things would turn a reader off, especially one who is very involved in the HP fandom.

I had so much trouble getting into the book at first because the parallels with Harry Potter bothered me and felt like fanservice almost, but by the middle things were different enough that I got into it. I think what I like best about it is that it's similar in some ways to the things I love about Harry Potter, but more accessible to someone who isn't comfortable writing/participating in a huge fandom. Yes, some of it feels like fanservice, but for me that's a big part of why I read hp fan fiction/look at fan art, so by the end I really enjoyed the parallels.

In all I think the book is lovely, if a little predictable, but that might be because it's more relationship/character based than action-y. It's definitely like an homage to Harry Potter like stories, and that makes sense to me since Rainbow Rowell has said she's a huge fan of Harry Potter.

Anyway thanks for this perspective! Like I said the fandom is super small for this book and I love hearing about what people thought, especially since I feel like this book doesn't get mentioned a lot when discussing YA.
