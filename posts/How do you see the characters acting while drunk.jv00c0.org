For instance: Harry is usually reserved, I'd imagine him to have the outgoing attitude of: Let's go karaoke! Let's do this or that, etc.

For Hermione I could kind of see her as a mean drunk.

For Ron I could see him clinging onto people telling them how much he loves them.

What about other characters or even the ones I mentioned. How do you see them if they were drunk? Can be characters from any Era.

** Harry: Impulsive, misadventure-prone drunk. See also, Felix Felicis - but with less guaranteed success and more "what did I do last night, and why is there a lipstick-covered traffic cone on my nightstand?"

Hermione: "I'm not drunk, you are" argumentative drunk. Not likely to escalate into violence, just to get huffy if you disagree.

Ron: Clingy, "I love you man" drunk.

Ginny: Flirty drunk.

Luna: Might be drunk 24/7 and you couldn't even tell.

Dumbledore: I'm-a-failure drunk.

Voldemort: Don't drink and cast Unforgivables. It never ends well. Voldemort routinely forgets this lesson.

*** Harry : "Come on people! When I invited you I never thought the D in DA would stand for dull. This isn't the library Hermione, here, have a drink. Ginny... oh there you are. Let's do something fun. I know! let's go skinny brooming now! It will be legen... Wait for it... Brilliant!"

Hermione - "But I did ask him to go to Slughorn's party as my date, //sobs// Didn't I? //pauses// No, I almost certainly did. And look at him, only stops snogging that bimbo to speak Quidditch nonsense. I just... why doesn't he like me! //sobs//"

Ron - "I'm telling you Seamus, The kenmore... Whatever... Are the fucking worse team in the league. Harry would find a snitch in the dark sooner without glasses, and he's a bloody mole without those. You know Neville here? Her grandma's saggy teat could play better than them! No offense to your grandma teats, Nev"

Neville - //passes out// //twitches dreaming about his grandmother//

Ginny - "Skinny brooming! //laughs, then frowns// Are you out of your mind!? I'll tell you I'm no some scarlet woman. //Frown lessens// But don't think I don't like you, I do, very much. Actually, I know! Let's go skinny brooming! My brothers don't have to know //laughs mischievously, then starts yelling// Potter! Where did you go you prat!"

**** Luna - //smiles madly at Hermione// O doi worry Hermione, he'll come around. Nargles just went up his butt, but they'll go away eventually. I heard Nargles can be sucked out from a boy, from down there. Do you think Lavender would be willing to take them out of Ron?"

Lavender - "Forget about Neville's grandma Won Won. Feel this one... Yes, put your hand there... It isn't saggy is it?"

Parvati - //puts hand on mouth and giggles// "He said saggy teat..."

Dumbledore - "No, I can't do this no longer. I just keep failing you. I shouldn't have let alcohol reach you. I should have tried to manipulate Mr. Finnigan's mother to convince her son of supporting other team, now he has to live with the pain of cheering a team that's pure worthless. Should have locked Miss Granger and Mr Weasley in a broom closet ages ago. But no! I was blinded by my goals. I didn see the greater good. And now we all have to hear about Mrs. Longbottom's decaying breasts."

** Nah, my canon is that Harry, generally so reserved and emotionally constipated, while drunk becomes affectionate and clingy, going around telling people how much he loves them and trying to snog Ginny in public.

Hermione would be sobbing one minute and giggling hysterically the minute later in a never ending cycle.

Ron I see as a fun drunk, making lots of jokes that only he'll laugh to, while answering Harry that "I love you too, mate" and tearing up.

** Honestly I see Hermione the same way I am drunk. People always assume I'm smart because I have knowledge in almost every topic, but when I'm drunk. I give life advice and just loosen up. I'd like to think she's the same way just drunk out of her mind giving life advice on how to break the Trace, how to avoid taxes, and social issues.

Like the best example I could give is I'm at my friends 21st bday, we're all drunk in a hotel room. And I'm sitting on the floor talking to a dude I barely know about the Social Credit system in China. And how it could be implemented in the US. or talking about video editing because one of the other guys wants to shoot a music video and I do that as a side gig.

I just feel like she would be a great motivated life coach drunk and would be hella supportive of peoples goals. I could see her giving lavender clothing advice and like a good idea to get into the fashion world. I feel like she and Luna might bond because maybe all those creatures Luna talks about have some grain of similarity with Muggle legends. Etc

** Okay so as an actual question do people really change that much when getting drunk? I'm autistic so I've never understood the whole "do dumb stuff while drunk" thing because when I drink even, when I've had twice or three times as many drinks as others I just sit there and kinda thinking, like should I go to the gym tomorrow or would this stuff affect my performance? I've gone to parties and drunk a lot but never once did I do something stupid or out of character so I just don't get it.

*** Drinking depends on the person. Some people don't get affected, some do.

Drinking is sometimes called liquid courage. Sometimes it'll affect people, sometimes it won't.

But, a lot of people believe how drunk you are, you become "the real you" rather you're a mean drunk, a clingy drunk, a crying drunk, an outgoing drunk. etc.

** Lmao Sirius was drunk for like half the book in OOTP, so he's the one that seems the least affected and probably would drink many of the kids under the table. I see Ron as more of a clingy drunk than an angry one. Hermione would probably go up to people and start asking questions she wouldn't normally ask, and Harry would just be down for anything
