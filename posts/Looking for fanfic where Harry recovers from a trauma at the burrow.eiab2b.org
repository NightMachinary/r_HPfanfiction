A little while ago I read a fanfic where Harry was recovering from some sort of trauma (might have been torture or abuse or something) at the burrow. And I believe he got a room on his own and he spend quite some time outside to be away from the busy household. The only thing I can distinctly remember is Harry having a conversation outside with Dumbledore and then later there's a witch who gives sort of therapy to Harry? And he finds it increasingly easier to talk about what happend.

I have no idea what site I read this on but early today it popped back into my head and it refuses to leave me alone so now I really really want to find it


** I think I read that one too!!! :) It was about Lucius Malfoy and the manor I think? He got kidnapped by Voldemort?

*** Unfortunately no... Snape might play bigger role in it but I am not 100% sure. Me remembering so little is probably the reason I can't find it since I am generally pretty decent at finding fics. I don't even remember where I read it -_-
