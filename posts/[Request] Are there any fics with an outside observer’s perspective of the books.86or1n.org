I would like to read a fic where a cannon character goes on with their everyday life at Hogwarts but occasionally sees whatever shenanigans the trio does at the time. They could interact with them, but whatever the books have already stated as cannon stays cannon. The characters are essentially outside observers.

An example of who I mean: Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Oliver Wood, etc... No OCs please. And no, not Draco. He plays a heavy part in the books anyways. Just about anyone who is not really ‘in the know'.

I've not read it completely but this might fit the bill

  Admit it, you've always been curious about what the professors were thinking while Harry, Ron, and Hermione got themselves into all kinds of shenanigans.

** Well, if you don't mind slash or femmeslash (don't worry, it's well-written and not graphic!), there's the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/159299][Through Their Eyes series]] by Kicon, which looks at Harry's Hogwarts years seen from the eyes of his fellow Gryffindor students.

The first fic, "Before I knew," centers on Dean and Seamus, while the second fic, "This Is Where" is about Lavender and Parvati. The author's also announced a Neville-centric story called "All I've Yet To Be," but that hasn't been published yet.

Like I said, both these fics end up featuring the lead characters in homosexual romances... but it's never graphic and it always keeps them in character. It's not so much masturbation material, more about being a kid growing up, going to Hogwarts at the same time of Harry Potter (with all that entails), and having the additional problem of confusion because you're trying to come to terms with the fact that you may not be completely straight.

To put it this way: I generally don't like M/M slash at all, but I really liked this Dean/Seamus story.

*** I'm usually fine with slashes as long as it is not over the top, so this sounds interesting. Thanks for the recommendation.
