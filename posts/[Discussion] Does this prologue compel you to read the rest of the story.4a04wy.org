Here is the prologue to my AOC story set in Beauxbatons! I'm not sure if it's good or not, so I would greatly appreaciate if y'all could tell me what you think of it before I publish it. Keep in mind that this version isn't edited for publishing, so it's still a bit rough around the edges. Nonetheless, any constructive criticism is more than welcome. Thanks in advance!

--------------

An entire day had passed since the snow had fallen, and most of it had already been melted by a bright winter sun. Now, only patches of white remained, scattered all over the scenery. On a lone road slithering through the countryside, a lone figure was walking, the snowy-mud splashing with each of his steps. His dark coat was sweeping around his ankles with each gusts of wind, and a shiver crept up his spine as exhaustion, cold and hunger was taking their toll on him. The high trees looming over his head, with their naked branches, the gusts of winds, and the cold only made him more and more frightened as time went on, and before long he couldn't take it anymore. He needed to keep the darkness at bay.

'I know I shouldn't do this, but...' "LUMOS!"

A bright light flicked on from the top of his wand, illuminating the black and white scenery surrounding him. Feeling reassured in his island of light, he was flinching nonetheless every time a bird took flight until he arrived at his destination.

It was a large property hidden deep in the woods, with a sole dirt path to access it. The entrance portal was a forged one, with spikes on the top. It looked old, though. And the fence joining it was a simple one, wooden and easily climbable. There was a golden bell with a string hanging from it, which he rang three times, hoping it would be enough to wake the young couple up. He opened the portal with a loud creaking sound, and walked up the door on a narrow pathway, and waited in front of it for someone to open up. When it finally did, he told the phrase he had been rehearsing in his head all day.

"I am utterly sorry to disturb you at this ungodly hour, Mr.Argante. I was hoping you could...well...help her." He then brought up the bundle of clothes to the young couple watching him suspiciously from the entrance. "May I come in?"

*(o) Marie Argante (o)*

Two hours later, he left the small cosy house, a weight lifted off his shoulders as he knew the first part of his promise was fulfilled. Marie was safe, and she would grow up loved and cared for. But despite this success, he couldn't help but feel the weight of the second one weighing on his mind. But for now, he would enjoy the scenery for a while. After all, passing on watching the sun rising on a snow filled part of the french countryside wasn't something Yves would have ever willingly done.

And for an instant, he thought that in the end, everything would be alright. That the evil he had witnessed for the past few days was nothing but a were whim, an exception. That the world on which shone this bright, new sun, was untainted by the one he had left behind. And that somehow, two wrongs could finally make a right. That sacrificing two lives to save only one, would ensure that this one would be good. That it would be lived through without a care in the world, without a sword hanging above her head. A smile crept up on his face as he narrowed his eyes against the bright light of this winter morning.

'It's shouldn't be a surprise to feel hope again when facing the rising sun.'

/"Hello, am I speaking to the admission department of the University of Paris 12?"/

/"Yes you are. How can I help you?"/

/"I heard that your university was rather advanced in the field of biology, especially genetics. Is this correct?"/

/"Yes, we have a research team on genetics. Would you be interested?"/

/"Yes I would. I just graduated, and I think your university is exactly what I'm searching for."/

/"Very well. If you have your diploma, it should be a walk in the park. I just need your name, mister..."/

/"Oh uh...Yves. Yves Montellier."/*

*(o) Marie Argante (o)*

On this day she is born, A day old and already alone...

Queen she is, by the Will of the Exiled One or by her own...

Two crowns will rest on her head...

One will be of oak, and the other of marble,

And by her word the fate of three Kingdom shall be laid.

Union, Destruction or separation,

On the word of the Queen...

A.C. to M.A.

(?) Orphan born on the 31 January 1996 and (?) Exiled one


** Start the story here: "'I know I shouldn't do this, but...' "LUMOS!"" Everything else before that is filler, and reads like filler. I can't bring myself to slog through it, and just keep skimming it, even though I tried to read it properly a few times.

When you're explaining things, you tend to use WAY more words than are necessary:

"It was a large property hidden deep in the woods, with a *sole* dirt path to *access* it." If you're saying that it's /a/ dirt path, we're pretty aware that there's only the one. The word "to" implies that one accesses the property via the path. The problem is not so much the superfluous words, but that the words interrupt the natural rhythm of the sentence. Nobody speaks like it, and reading it in your head sounds unnatural and stilted.

"The entrance *portal* was a forged one, with spikes on the top." The word portal specifically refers to an imposing entrance. However, in this context, portal sounds unnatural. Just call it the entrance.

"It looked old, though. And the fence joining it was a simple one, wooden and easily climbable." There's a scene in the opening of The Scarlet Letter, where Nathaniel Hawthorne describes the door to Hester's home. He spends about a page in doing so. By the time you've gotten to the end of the description of the door, you're trying desperately to figure out why the hell it matters. You realise it doesn't. Don't do that to your reader. Get to the point quickly, or you're going to lose them quickly.

"There was a golden bell with a string hanging from it, which he rang three times, hoping it would be enough to wake the young couple up. He opened the portal with a loud creaking sound, and walked up the door on a narrow pathway, and waited in front of it for someone to open up. When it finally did, he told the phrase he had been rehearsing in his head all day." Please stop calling it a portal. It just sounds affected by this point. Honestly, you could have cut out everything up to this point, and lost nothing in the story telling. All the in between moments feel forced.

"Two hours later, he left the small cosy house, a weight lifted off his shoulders as he knew the first part of his promise was fulfilled. Marie was safe, and she would grow up loved and cared for. " After this sentence, cut out the rest of the paragraph. While you're there, cut out the paragraph following that one too. It's dragging down the pacing.

(o) Marie Argante (o) "Hello, am I speaking to the admission department of the University of Paris 12?" "Yes you are. How can I help you?"

PERFECT. The pacing is quick, you get to the point without a lot of exposition, and the reader can figure out (mostly) what's going on in a few short lines.

*** Wow! Thanks. That sure was helpful. I now realise using "portal" might have seemed weird, but I think that the fact that the word we use in french for that is a "portail" which has close to no magical connotation. I'll try rewriting the whole thing to give it a more "fast pace" feel. Thanks for taking the time to help me!

** It personally doesn't strike me as compelling, but I think that has more to do with my story preferences that your writing. As [[/u/dsarma]] said, drop the first paragraph. It's flowery and unnecessary.

The dialogue seems stilted as a whole to me.

#+begin_quote
  'It's shouldn't be a surprise to feel hope again when facing the rising sun.'
#+end_quote

This is one of those statements that you want to sound deep and cool and meaningful, but it just comes off as pretentious.

The conversation between the university and Yves Montellier is fine technically. However, bearing in mind my frame of reference is university/college education system in the US, that seems very much unlike how I would expect a conversation to an admissions counselor to go. If it's different in France, then that's just my ignorance. Moreover, is this conversation in person, a flashback, over the phone, through the floo? Also, we don't know Yves Montellier from Adam, so some context before dropping in dialogue would be nice, but that's possibly more of a style choice than anything "wrong". Also also, check the use of idioms with the area in which your story takes place. The phrase "a walk in the park" stuck out to me, because I recognized it and idioms usually don't translate well. It could just be my ignorance again.

Who is Marie Argente and why is her name used as the spacer? The bold caught my eye and I was more focused on that than the story the first time I read through it.

I'm also confused why you're putting this under fanfiction. You will be using no characters and one (?) shared location--Beauxbatons--which we know little to nothing about anyways. Since there is so little about "how magic works", society/culture, etc. in the HP novels, you'll be using nothing from JKR except name(s) and inspiration, or at least that is what it sounds like.

*** The point is to borrow Harry Potter's world to tell a new story. I love this part of the fandom, the one that seeks to expand JK's world rather than endlessy retelling the same story with another twist to it. And I don't think I'm the only one who thinks like that, considering people often reccomend the Alexandra Quick's series.

***** Thanks. I never read Emperor though (the length always frightened me a bit) but I think I'll certainly end up binge reading when I have a few days of free time.
