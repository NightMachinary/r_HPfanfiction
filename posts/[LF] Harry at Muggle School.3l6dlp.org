Preferably an AU where Harry never went to Hogwarts, for whatever reason, but complete non-magic AU is fine as long as Dudley is still at Smelting (or another boarding school). I want to see if/how the dynamics between Harry and Vernon and Petunia changes without Dudley around all the time. English schools are obviously preferred, but if it's good enough then USA-style high school is fine.

Slash, het, or gen is fine, but with a preference for slash (esp. Harry/Draco). Any pairings except incest. Grimdark is fine, but no beastiality, necrophilia, or mpreg, please.


** Oooh. Want a story in which Harry goes to St Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys?

[[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=58563][A Stolen Past]]: /Fifteen-year-old Harry Potter wakes up in his cupboard under the stairs at number four, Privet Drive with no memory of the past five years of his life. What happened to his memory? What do his strange dreams mean? And most importantly, how will he survive in a school for incurably criminal boys?/

***** I just finished A Stolen Past and I have to ask... is it so mushy with [[/spoiler][Ginny]] and Harry in the sequel? The part where [[/spoiler][Ginny tears up just talking to Harry about her feelings]] made me want to throw up. I absolutely loved the first 2/3 of A Stolen Past at St. Brutus's with Harry trying to figure everything out, but it seems sort of blah at this point. Would you say it's worth continuing?

**** Not quite. The memory wipe happens after 5th year ends.
