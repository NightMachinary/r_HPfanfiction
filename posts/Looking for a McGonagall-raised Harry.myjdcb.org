:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I wanted to read one like that months ago, but since then a lot has happened and I couldn't find the time. Forgot the name, but I know the fanfic goes something like that : "Minerva decided that leaving Harry the the Dursleys would be too dangerous for the boy, so she takes him to Scotland in her castle and teaches him magic, making him a better wizard and ultimately he defeats Voldemort way earlier and better planned and done". If it rings a bell to anyone then I'll gladly accept any lead. If this gets lost in new I will search myself tomorrow, but I figured that asking here is more intelligent ; after all I'm fairly new to the rabbit hole of fanfictions, and you are all more knowledgeable than me. Thank you for taking the time to read me, have a great day.
