:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, this is a oneshot fic, or possibly a single-shot-in-a-series-of-oneshots, where Harry returns after a long time away and is greeted by Ron and Hermione. He promptly notices that 'something is different about Hermione' and Ron tells him not to say anything. I think there's also a bit where Hermione starts to suspect that she's become black, but I can't remember for sure.

It's utterly hilarious, but impossible to find in the sea of 'Hermione becomes part of the Black Family' fics that 'Hermione goes Black' and variant searches thereof dive into.

*** Yes! That is it! Or at least it's a close enough version that I'm happy with it. :) Thank you.
