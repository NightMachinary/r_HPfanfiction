Harry had it all figured out.

Step 1: Invite Hermione to the Slug Club Christmas Party to get Ron & Ginny jealous. They're like brother and sister and they know it's a ploy so nothing's going to happen, right?

Step 2: It didn't work/wasn't enough? Go on a bunch of fake dates to amp up the weasleys' jealousy.

Step 3: Harry and Hermione both get together with the redhead they love. Congratulations! It worked!

​

....

​

....

​

"Step 2.5: Fall in Love with Hermione and abandon step 3" wasn't supposed to be part of the plan.

​

*/EDIT (READ THIS):/*

Since people keep badgering me, I'll make it clear: Harry & Hermione are *TRYING* to get Ron & Ginny jealous. I never said they had to be jealous. You can totally decide that Ron is actually extremely supportive of their fake relationship in the story and Harry and Hermione have no idea what to do about it because they had planned for him to get jealous.

I mean, "Step 2: It didn't work/wasn't enough?" should have made it clear enough that I wasn't asking for Weasley-Bashing but apparently, it didn't, so there.

Problem:

Ginny was already a slug club member and didn't need Harry's invitation.

Similarly, Hermione was one too and didn't need his invitation.

--------------

In canon, Ginny invited Dean Thomas and was happy when Harry brought Luna along.

On the other hand, *Hermione purposely invited the git Cormac McClaggen just to make Ron jealous!*

** ... I actually read this prompt as Harry and Hermione both trying to get with Ron as a three, getting him to realize his feelings for both of them.

Completely missed Ginny's name in step one.

Does a good Ron/Harry/Hermione fic, with plot actually exist?

*** There was one I read before that was really good. They didnt get together for the entire fic almost and towards the end they finally realized they each loved eachother. I cant remember the name unfortunately but I know there are some good ones out there

*** At the start of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water by Starfox5), the three are in a reverse-harem of sorts. Basically, there was a period during the war against Voldemort when it was the three against the world, and it just happened. IIRC, there are some flashbacks showing the relationship developing, but it's not the focus of the fic, except to the extent that the three living together is considered scandalous.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

*** I do like the idea of them assuming Ron will be jealous, but him turning out to be incredibly supportive of their relationship - covering for them when they need him to, making jokes about finding them a broom closet, etc - and them just being wholly nonplussed by it in that 'what the heck do we do now? move to plan B, move to plan B!!!' sort of way.

**** Even bolder of you to assume Ron is even a jealous type in the first place that would destroy his friendship with Harry for over a girl.

Ffs understand his character even a middle schooler would understand how his character actually work. But since it's fan fiction. I pretend you already know.

GOF? Hello?

In DH, he mostly left because he thought Harry didn't have a plan, but I dare you to tell me that Hermione wasn't also part of the reason. I dare you.

****** And I don't know why you're being so aggressive, It's not like I asked for a Ron-bashing fic (god knows there's enough of them), I imagined it as being like a romantic comedy.

It can totally be like Avalon1632 suggested it with Ron actually being super supportive of their fake relationship and Harry and Hermione not knowing what to do about it because they had planned for him to get jealous.
