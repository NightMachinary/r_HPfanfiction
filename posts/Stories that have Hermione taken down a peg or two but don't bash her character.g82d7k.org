I love Hermione, but hated several things that she did.

Lavender is distraught over her dead pet rabbit? Don't comfort her, but instead bashes the fact that she believes in Divination.

Doesn't try to talk Harry into showing the Firebolt to Dumbledore or McGonagall, but instead tells McGonagall on her own, with no warnings or regards to Harry's feelings.

Doesn't try to sound apologetic at all about the idea of Ron's pet rat being dead, and Crookshanks being the one to do it, and instead argues over it.

And other similar ideas that she's done, or had, that JKRowling didn't try to use to better Hermione's character and make her grow.

I hate bashing with a fiery passion, so I'm not looking for that. Heck, even stories dealing with Ron or Harry's flaws and having them grow as characters would be wonderful.

No character bashing of any sort. Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

Not looking for Lord Potter, Harem Harry or super smart Harry. Harry Slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be relatively believable.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing.

Hermione's not a major character in this one, but it fits what you're asking for. She's portrayed as hard-working and a good student, but magically a step below Victoria and others who really /get/ magic on an intuitive level.

** I generally dislike Hermione as a character these days, but I can't say I'm on totally on board with your criticisms of her behavior, or at least the examples you give. She's obviously lacking a great deal of tact in the manner she tries to steer Lavender away from superstition, but she really isn't wrong to try. It's when people are in the throes of grief that they are most vulnerable to charlatanry, and standing by while a friend or even just an acquaintance succumbs to it is wrong.

Taking news of the Firebolt, along with her suspicions, to a qualified adult was certainly the correct course of action as well. Children cannot consent to a number of things, and that includes the taking of grave risk to life and limb, much less when the justification for such is nothing more worthwhile than to gain an unfair advantage at sport.

Lastly, if your best friend accused your pet of murdering their pet because they couldn't find them in an entire magical castle and its grounds, and you thought it would have been entirely out of character for your pet to have done so, would you apologize? Both participants in that spat were exceptionally stupid, but Hermione was the more reasonable of the two for never escalating beyond simply showing that she felt the sting of the accusations.

*** To be honest, Crookshanks was after Scabbers for about half a book before Scabbers disappears. Anyone would think the cat ate him. You can't stop Crookshanks, the least you do is appear apologetic or maybe even sympathetic.

As for the Firebolt, I agree. The boys weren't on really good terms with her at the point and she didn't know what to do. For all she knew, Harry could have died.

**** Reading back on the Crookshanks parts in canon, it really strikes me more like Ron doesn't give her much of a chance to apologize on the moment - but that she's clearly apologetic ("in tears" during one incident, timidly asking Ron if Scabbers is fine the next day, etc) - Ron just immediately attacks her cat, and the reactions are natural on both ends for being in the middle of the situation.

It's dumb, but Ron /was/ kicking and attacking her pet (in an effort to get him off of Scabbers), and a lot of people would react that way to their pets being kicked and screamed at - even if in the wrong

Hum, Scabbers didn't just dissapear. Ron found claw marks and blood on his bedsheet, making it /really likely/ that a cat ate him (just like Pettigrew wanted them to think). And Crookshank, as not only the cat that had attacked Scabbers several time in the previous months, but also the only cat who only tried to do so in the 7 years Scabbers was at Hogwarts (7 with Percy, 3 with Ron) is the main, if not the sole, suspect.

And Hermione, who before that has always defended her cat by saying things along the lines of "He is a cat, it's what they do", then decide that since they didn't see Crookshank eat Scabber, they can't prove he did it, completely ignoring all the justifications she had given until know about "Crookshank following its nature".

It doesn't make her "Reasonable", to the contrary it makes her incredibly unreasonable and insincere. And if you add at that all the other things she did this year (the whole thing with Lavender Rabbit, or going to Mc Gonnagal without even trying to talk to Harry about the danger of the broom), Hermione was just terrible in PoA and should have add to apologize and earn Harry and Ron forgiveness, rather than having a crying fit in fron of Harry when /he/ apologize and then everything is forgotten.

**** It's an entirely normal thing to do if your pet is blamed by someone who dislikes him - and, of course, if it's been a point of contention between two people, it makes it tougher. But I read it pretty clearly as Hermione not wanting to admit or believe that she (or her pet) would be to blame for killing Ron's pet, and willful denial. Add in the stress she's under for taking a ton of classes...

For the rabbit, Hermione did immediately say her condolences to Lavender - but yes, one of her faults is that when she's confronted with something she's certain is wrong (like the divinations being so vague), she pushes back on it - even if it's not the right situation to do so.

For the broom, she said a bit to Harry about it first, but... It was deliberately set up by JKR to have her not have enough time to give her concerns, initially - and then in a spat over Crookshanks afterwards, where if she confronted Harry about it, Ron would assuredly berate her - and she presumably didn't want Harry to join that. With that respect, going to an authority figure would make sense - just unfortunate that McGonnagal felt the need to mention Hermione telling her about it

*** Okay, I really didn't like that story. First off, the main plot point was just... /off/.

It made Hermione attacking Ron seem like she used an unforgiveable on him. It was a pretty bad thing to do, but the reactions to it were totally over the top. The entire school body starts demeaning her, and they make it seem like they've hated her for so long and this incident has finally motivated them to speak out against Hermione.

Harry starts comparing Hermione to Petunia Dursley, which was weird. Hermione was one of his best friends and he feels that she has similarities to the person who made him spend the majority of his childhood in a cupboard?

Ginny becomes self-righteous and breaks Hermione's nose. This was just downright baffling to me because the whole story revolved around how bad it was to resort to brawling.

Ginny is hailed for punching Hermione, which contradicts the reaction to Hermione attacking Ron with the birds.

Ron is pretty stoic throughout all this, which is pretty OOC, because he doesn't seem like the type of guy to bottle up his feelings.

Also, the term, "raising a hand' was used often, but Hermione charmed birds into attacking him. She didn't scratch him up.

Coming to another storyline, the whole, Marietta Edgecombe is a good person arc. Her betrayal of the DA is made to seem as if she didn't want to do it, and she was actually a "really nice person".

She bullied Luna, and that was ignored for the most part, except for a single line where she reminisced over the fact that she started the nickname 'Loony'.

There was also this whole plot point on how she and Terry Boot traced Voldemort's history fully. Which I /guess/ was kind of possible, but it just seemed implausible and I had a hard time not laughing when I read those scenes.

I actually find it tough to believe that Voldemort allowed his past as Tom Riddle to exist on records. I feel like he would have erased all records to prevent Death Eaters from finding out his blood status.

Boot and Edgecombe start a school magazine and they proceed to interview Harry and Ron, who tell them about /every single major event/ that they had gone through. They had done a lot of illegal stuff, and they could've been in major trouble if it had been leaked to the public. Luckily for them, Boot and Edgecombe decide to edit out the dodgy parts.

I'm just surprised that Harry and Ron talked about it all. Harry even confessed to killing Quirrel, though it was brushed away by the author as /self defense/. I'm also confused on why Harry confided in Edgecombe, since I'm pretty sure he knew that she bullied Luna.

Lavender was also slowly becoming a Mary Sue. It turns out she was actually better at chess than Ron, stalemating and beating him often. She was also, it seems, really beautiful. So she was smart and beautiful, yet also empathetic towards make-up and and other "girly stuff".

Also, Hermione was punished with detention for a semester, deduction of 200 points, and temporary confiscation of her wand. That seems really severe. Her actions, in comparison to the Marauders' pranks and their constant humiliation of Snape, don't stick out much.

Also this is a castle where hexes seem to be thrown out easily, slurs like Mudblood are used often, and transfiguration is sometimes used as punishment, I'm just saying.

That's kind of it. This has turned into a huge comment lol. Something about this story just riled me up.

****** Yeah Like I said, not a perfect story, but you and I both know that if Ron had cast that spell on her for kissing Krum, the amount of shit thrown his way from the fandom would be insane. No one would be suggesting that it should be swepped under the rug, like in canon.

To me it's a reaction to Ron bashing, and every fic that implies that Ron would be an abusive, cheating drunk, when the only one in that relationship who ever resorted to physical violence was Hermione.

So yeah her comeuppance was more than a bit ridiculous, but not more ridiculous than physically hurting your friend out of jealousy, and having zero actual consequences.

******* I don't have any problems with the idea that Hermione should face the consequences of her actions. Just clearing that up. It's just that the consequences were ridiculous, and the reactions of the other characters had me in splits. The story was poor, but I support the basic plot point.

On the idea of Ron facing more problems if he'd done the same thing to Hermione over Krum, that's just society. Men hitting women isn't condoned, women hitting men isn't taken very seriously (not to say that they always get off scot-free) and that translates into fanfiction.

There's also the fact that Ron would be bashed harder than any other male character if he'd done anything to Hermione, because he's viewed in a poor light in the fandom. It's not just a Hermione > Ron issue, it's more of a literally every single guy > Ron.

I agree with you, Ron doesn't seem like the guy to become an abusive, cheating husband. He was a bit of a fairweather friend at times, he sometimes let jealously get the best of him, but he was a decent guy in the end.

However, I don't think Hermione would be the person to be abusive or a drunkard. She was always logical, and would never become a drunkard, for one. And despite all of her faults, she genuinely cared for Harry and Ron.

If you follow canon until the end of Voldemort's defeat, it's tough to see Ron and Hermione splitting up with bad feelings towards the end. Keep in mind, IF they split. I don't find it hard to believe that they had a happy and stable relationship.

Neither Ron or Hermione show any abusive tendencies (which already put's it up the top of the list of Harry Potter ships that are actually healthy and non-toxic) , and I love both characters, and the ship.

I'm not saying that Ron isn't already bashed (very much unjustly) or that women who abuse men aren't really taken seriously, I just saying that this fic, in all it's wired contrived glory is primarily, areaction to those things, and I understand why it was written.
