I love both of these pairings and I read them quite a lot and I was wondering what some of the best evolving around them are?


** You've probably already read this one - it's an amazing story even if you don't usually like these pairings ( and no doubt even better if you do). The link is for the first in a fantastic series - best fanfic I've ever read. linkao3(The Meaning of Mistletoe by Endrina)

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  MWPP era, sixth year. There's something terrifying in the dungeons, and don't they wish they hadn't disturbed it... After two days of Sirius taking his terrible mood out on everyone, Remus reckons someone should probably go talk to him about the things that lurk in the dark. Warnings inside.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
