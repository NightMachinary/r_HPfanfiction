Ok so I read this amazing adult fan fiction a couple nights back but I never finished it and now I cant remember what it was called or find any trace of it.

Description: I believe it was set at the burrow and Hermione sends Harry to check on Ginny who is upset about breaking up with Dean. Harry brings her food, she is crying, and they kiss. Harry then does the dirty with Hermione and Ginny walks in and gets even more upset, later she spies on Harry and Hermione and later in the night sneaks into Harry's room and they get it on (him thinking she is Hermione) eventually he goes along and it ended with Hermione being in the room and having watched them the whole time.

Hopefully that is enough to go on. Please help me find it.

EDIT: extra bits of info, Ginny and Dean break up cause he thinks she is too much of a tomboy, and Im pretty sure Harry and Hermione don't actually have sex, just everything but.


** If you read it only a couple of nights ago and you don't often delete your internet history, you should be able to find it fairly easily in your history ;)

******** Yeah, probably not. If you remember a specific phrase from the fic, you can search Google for it, that usually helps me find fics.

******** It was a joke, and I can't honestly help you since I've never read something close to what you describe, anyways good luck. Try to use Google Commands or special searches. For example [[http://www.slideshare.net/mhardy/extreme-googling-tips-tricks-for-expert-searching-presentation][this]] or just youtube "googleling like a boss".
