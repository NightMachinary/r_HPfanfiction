the inventor of the animagus transformation just wanted to get high and accidentaly turned into an animal as a party trick

dont mind me im bored


** I think anyone willing to have a leaf from a screaming plant under their tongue for a month is /definitely/ high. Also /CAVEMAN PARTY???/

Is it actually said in canon when the animagus transformation was first accomplished? Just curious, as I don't remember seeing it on Pottermore.
