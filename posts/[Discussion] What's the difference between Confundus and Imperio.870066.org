I know Confundus is supposed to cause confusion. For example, you could make someone think you already paid them. Then Imperio completely controls the mind. It's not just an idea that's implanted; the person will do whatever you want.

I'm asking because it always seemed more like the Imperius Curse than a simple Confunding Charm when Snape made Mundungus suggest the Seven Potters plan.


** I believe Snape's Confundus Charm was simply to make Mundungus believe that the Seven Potters plan was his own idea, rather than Snape's.

*** And given Mundungus' personality, would /you/ waste an Unforgivable on him?

** Imperius Curse is full mind control. It "forces" the victim to act how the user wants the victim to act, while Confunding Charm is more like persuasion, it has limits that can't be passed.

*** Confundus is a Jedi Mind Trick, Imperius is full on mind control.

**** funny comparison. But, we get witnessed about the Confundus 2 times in the Canon (if im not mistaken). Snape and Hermione. And Hermiones using was very Sloppy, as Cormac was fully aware, that his actions were manipulated....well, i guess he didnt think "what the hell? Someone was controlling me?" but he was definetely confused about his action. The Jedi Mind trick never is getting detected by the target, unless its immune or others are aware or the Trick.
