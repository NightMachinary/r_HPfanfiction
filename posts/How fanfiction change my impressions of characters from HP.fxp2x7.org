So I was rereading HP Books after a long time(3years or so) due to the Quarantine, and I noticed that my impression of the characters in the books changed a lot since I first finished the series back in 2011, due to the large amount of fanfics I read over the years.

Ron : Goofy, Lazy, Reliable bestfriend ------> Lazy, Jealous, Obnoxious, Greedy person who wants to be friends with harry for his money and fame

Hermiome: Smartest witch, Loyal bestfriend ------> Insufferable Know it all, who thinks she knows best but actually is quite undereducated about the wizarding world customs

Dumbledore: Reliable Grandfather like character ------> Manipulative Old man who doesn't care about harry and only aims for the Greater Good.

Snape: Asshole who kinda redeemed himself ------> Just an Asshole who was fixated on his students mom.

Malfoy: pretty much the same

Daphne Greengrass: Pretty much a Non-existent character ------> Slytherins Ice Queen/Prettiest Girl in Hogwars/A very good person inside/Harry's true love and soul mate.

Neville: Goofy Side character ------> one of Harry's most trusted and loyal friends (A longbottom always backs a potter)

Luna: pretty much the same (ig all authors just love her, nobody can really hate her tbh)

My perspective of many other characters changed too, but these are the main one's worth mentioning. Let me know if you guys had similar experiences after reading fanfics


** For me, Hermione is opposite from what you describe. In fanfictions she seems almost like a Mary Sue, too perfect and flawless, and Harry is never bothered by her. Canon Hermione is far from flawless, and Harry often gets annoyed with her bossiness.

*** Some of Hermione's flaws in fanfiction do get slightly papered over, sure - but in terms of being a Mary Sue, I've read /far/ more power fantasies involving /Harry/ than Hermione, and those seem to be far more common.

She gets a good number of fics focused on her by default of being the primary female character - but I find the complaints about how perfect/great she is in a lot of fanfiction weird when it's dialed up even further with Harry.

*** Depends on the type of fanfic you read tbh. I think that's the case for most HHr fanfics. I tend to read fanfics with different pairings such as with Daphne, Susan, Fleur, OC character etc

**** No, it's more a matter of identification. People appreciate a character for their flaws, and to have Hermione's smoothed over by author fiat rather than in-story development makes her less relatable.

***** Additionally, this removal of weaknesses and flaws typically takes two routes:

1) perfect arm candy with no agency

2) reversal where she essentially overtakes Harry's role while leaving him the table scraps as the merely nominal hero.

Naturally, a fanfic writer /could/ write romantic or band of heroes style Hermione, but that very much still requires flaws, limits, and striking an increasingly difficult balance.

** With respect to Dumbledore, rereading the Books just reaffirmed my impression that he's either an useless dumbed down plot device in a children's book or a criminally negligent incompetent, but not malicious fool.

*** This is 100% my take. . His flaws and selective incompetence shine through more on each reread. Reliable is the opposite of how I see him.

** This is probably embarrassing to admit, even in a HP subreddit, but I've read some of the books over 100 times.

I have a very firm canon impression of characters and find the way many are portrayed in fan fiction to be absolutely abhorrent. Therefore I really struggle to find fics that I enjoy... I want to read about the characters I love, yet in so many fics they're completely different. It's a struggle.

Anyway hmu with your best canon-character fic recs thanks.

*** Most of the fics I read are where the characters are completely non canon. I could recommend some of favourite HP fanfics though, all the characters are quite different from the books but I can say for sure that they are good reads

*** I'm the same. I'm always reading one of the books, I have no idea how many times I've got through them and anything ooc or bashing is just such a nope for me, I have never been able to stick to a fanfic where any of the characters are like this. It means I do t actually read much fanfic at all but when I do it's usually canon compliant.

**** You're without doubt my favourite recent fic author, so you're doing something right for me!

I've become such a snob. I need the characters to be canon, I need the world building to be canon, I need the writing to be good, I need the language to be appropriate. Not soppy but a bit of romance. Action but not too much. Bloody hell, after living in England for a few years I now can't read anything that doesn't get the British "vibe" right. I'm the worst.

I never thought I'd get into a next gen story, but the last fic I read was Wood for the Trees which I absolutely devoured. And it was The Aurors that pulled me back in after a couple of year hiatus. So cheers for being the benchmark and making my standards even higher.

***** Awww you've made my day, thank you!!

But yeah I'm a snob too, I have such a low tolerance for things that don't feel like they could have happened! I don't think it makes us the worst at all, I think everyone has different tastes and comes to fanfic for different reasons.

I remember when I first joined this sub many years ago, and was a lot more active, multiple people told me I would get bored of canon compliancy and move to AU like they did. Perhaps that could still happen but I've found theres so much within canon to explore that I've not yet run out of interest!

** Hermione: Good student > Bad student.

Her perfect and high grades are a lie. She hands in homework that is feet longer than what was asked for. Hogwarts has a massively high student to teacher ratio. She wasn't doing anyone any favors by handing in encyclopedias for homework. And don't pull a "grading charm" out of your ass

When I went to school, if you went over or under the size of an assignment, you failed. If you can't follow instructions, you obviously didn't do the assignment. Hell, the standardized tests I took? The people who graded it had a cardboard/plastic "frame" they put over the page. Anything inside the frame? They read. Anything outside it? They ignored.

You run into this in college too. If the professor says "I want a 10-12 page double-spaced essay on X", they mean exactly that: they want a 10-12 page double-spaced report on X. One page less? Massive reductions/fail. One page more? Massive reductions/fail. Not double-spaced? Fail, they throw it out. You aren't the only student.

The funny part about this? A Hermione bashing fic pointed this out to me, and now I can't unsee it.

** Harry. When I first read the books I disliked him more and more with each one. He seemed annoying, immature and self-centered. After reading fanfiction, however, I can forgive some teenage angst. Also some of the things that I read as egoistic, now seem more like a ‘dark/pessimistic humor'.

And McGonagall. I first read her like a stern but fair and responsible. Now she seems more biased and negligent.

Everyone else I still view pretty much the same. I can read a lot of different takes, bashing included, and enjoy them, but in the end my own interpretation of the characters stays as it was.

** Kalen Darkmoon on his fanfiction.net bio has a good analysis of the books that helped solidify my thoughts of Dumbledore being an uncaring manipulative git to an actual evil s.o.b.

When I read the books (especially the first 4) I saw nothing but a budding romance between Harry and Hermione. So imagine my surprise my surprise when in the later books Hermione started to prefer Ron a guy who would always fight with her, belittle her, belittle her causes and her desire to learn and wants nothing to do with the muggle/mundane world.

Bacause of those two main items I started to look for fanfiction that supported my thoughts and I found a ton of stuff that reinforced my thoughts that Dumbledore was not the kindly grandfather but was a manipulative old man who really didn't care how his actions harmed Harry. I also found a ton of stories that supported my thoughts that Harry and Hermione should have gotten together.

Of course that led to all the fanfictions that tried to explain how Hermione would fall for Ron and how Harry would fall for Ginny (a character in the books who had very little presence) ie potions and compulsion charms.

Now I can't say that fanfiction changed my thoughts on the characters. Instead I gravitated to fanfiction that supported my belief in where the story and characters should have gone and expanded on the motivations that I thought were present in the books but were not fully developed.
