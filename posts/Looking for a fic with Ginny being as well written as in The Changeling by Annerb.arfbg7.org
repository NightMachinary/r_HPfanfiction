She doesn't have to be the center of the story, but I would like her to be a focal point of it. Preferably Harry pairings, if any.

*** For how few reviews it still has, I was blown away. I haven't read the sequels, because I'm afraid pushing past it will make it less perfect looking back. If that makes sense.

**** i beg of you, read the sequels... i promise you they are worth it and make the original shine even brighter. i had to go back and read the entire series AGAIN last month because i couldn't stand the anguish of waiting to see where she goes next with it all. actually ALL her hp works are just absolutely fantastic.

***** Hmmmmm. I'll give them a go, then. I've just read multiple fics that were fantastic, but with sequels that kind of shadowed my memory of the original when I found them lackluster. Regardless, I will take your word for it. Thanks!

** I'd say you could dive into any of Northumbrians work. It's obviously not Ginny centric. But her character is well written. The universe is well written. And it's a lot of peoples head canon for post DH.

** Hmm I hesitate to rec this because Ginny doesn't come into play until the second book, but binging The Changeling over the past day made me change my mind. I've seen it recommended before, but your post was what made me read it, so thank you!! It was fantastic.

Anyway, linkffn(The Serpentine Subterfuge by murkybluematter) features my favorite Ginny depiction (second now to The Changeling, though mainly due to the fact that Ginny isn't the main character). Ginny in this series is easily one of my favorite characters -- fierce, cynical, still struggling to find her way -- and it becomes more readily apparent as you make your way through the series. BUT, she only comes in for the second book - the first being linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) -- and she's not a main character, so it would be quite a read for just that, plus it's wildly AU.

I really wasn't going to rec this fic for those reasons, but I remember reading TSS and beyond, and wanting more fics with this sharper, more developed Ginny (not the soft spoken fanon version), and The Changeling thoroughly fulfilled this desire. So, thank you, and hopefully this fic might be able to do the same for you!

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
