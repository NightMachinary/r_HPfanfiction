Not Lord Harry Potter Black Slytherin Gryffindor Jesus. Can have things like lordships and hereditary Wizengamot seats. Can be WBWL where Harry is adopted by Sirius. Can be fics about members of the Black Family. Don't rec 'Growing Up Black', I've already read it. Can be fics similar to it though. Well written 60k+ words.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

** linkffn(12745758)

Harry is adopted by Andromeda after the Third year. Family-centric, with Andromeda thrust into the role of "Lady Black" despite not wanting it. She uses that position to help her sisters and her family, not to follow some greater political agenda. And she does not have a ridiculous amount of political clout. She is able to blackmail the Minister and Malfoy, but that is using things Harry overheard at Hogwarts and not 67 Wizengamot seats.

There are some resulting rifts for Harry, most notably with Neville, who is not at all amused that Harry considers anyone who helps Bellatrix family. And while Bellatrix crimes are not changed from canon, Andromeda does not care because she was not close to the victims and Harry is torn between doing his new family a favour and not helping Death Eaters.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.
