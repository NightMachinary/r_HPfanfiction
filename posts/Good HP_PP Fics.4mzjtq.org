I'm looking to sate my guilty pleasure. I've read all the Harry/pansy Fics on fan fiction.net and ao3, and everything else I could find via Google. Any suggestions? I know it's a rare ship so there aren't a whole lot, but I wanna make sure I'm not missing any good ones


** ... My first thought was Peter Pettigrew, and I wasn't sure what I was expecting to find recc'ed, haha.

Harry/Pansy and Ron/Pansy are guilty-pleasure ships for me too, :D.
