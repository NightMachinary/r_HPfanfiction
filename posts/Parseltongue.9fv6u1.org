Hey, Iâ€˜m looking for fanfictions, where Harry utilizes his parseltongue ability more. I think it would be really interesting, if he would slip more into snake language when he's angry, maybe at Umbridge... Thanks


** Er, well, I have a story where /Hermione/ is a Parselmouth and she makes friends with the Basilisk and, er, things happen. You may be interested. linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor)

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.
