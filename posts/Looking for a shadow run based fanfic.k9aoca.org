Hi, I'm looking for a HO fanfic that has Harry as an avid shadow run player and living in a game shop (I think?) He also gets a lot of kids at Hogwarts to play tabletop games, including I think at one point getting Hermione to be a DM. Any ideas? Recommendations welcome as well, as I'm looking for more fanfics of this type.
