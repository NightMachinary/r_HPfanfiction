There's a few good mad scientist stories, i.e. In The Mind of a Scientist. But what I'd like to see is a Potter family where they're /all/ mad scientists in different fields.

So Harry might be making genetically modified monsters while Ginny turns herself into a cyborg. James and Albus are making Improved Inferi Acromantulas (tm) in the basement while Lily manipulates temporal energy to her nefarious purposes.

Of course those are only suggestions. Anything crazy like that will do. Bonus points if Teddy is present as the only sane one. Thanks!
