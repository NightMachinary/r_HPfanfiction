Hi, I'm looking for (as the title says. :p) possessive Severus/Harry and Tom/Harry stories either on A03 or Fanfiction. Has to have a plot of some kind, in other words not just sexual content. (It gets old, seeing only that. Plus, it's not my interest.) Preferred Harry is kind and cunning or just kind but not a necessity. Thank you! :D


** Okay, just give me a second to browse my library...

​

I'll start you off with one that I often re-read: linkffn(Butterfly Heart by The_Fictionist). It takes place in an AU where Harry is an Auror who works cases related to the serial killer known primarily as Voldemort. The story begins with Harry sitting in the office of the Wizarding World's most famous (and only) psychology, Tom Riddle. PoVs alternate between Harry and Riddle. Well-written, and probably one of my top five fics as far as storytelling goes. Horror/Romance. 100k+ words. Complete.

Next that comes to mind if a LV/HP story written by ObsidianPen, if LV/HP is up your alley as well. The series is called Haunted and Hunted, with the main fic going by "Hauntingly". It was taken offline for a bit, but I think they're bringing back---on AO3, at least---as there's two chapters of the first bit up if you log in. The main gist of it is that Voldemort realises that Harry is a Horcrux when he possesses him in OoTP. First part (~6 chapters) can be skipped if kinky dream smut isn't up your alley, but the second (and much longer) part of the series has an extremely possessive Voldemort who will do just about anything to get Harry back. I think I have the epubs saved somewhere, so if this sounds interesting and/or you don't want to wait, feel free to PM me. I'll see if I can find them. The series is complete, though I can't give you a proper word count at the moment

linkao3(Aconitum by VivyPotter) is much shorter than these first recs, only reaching 18k+ words, but it's definitely a good read. In it, Harry and Ginny (married) are fighting when Harry decides, in a stroke of genius, to get his love some flowers. The handsome bloke at the shop is more than willing to lend a ear to his woes, and Harry finds himself going back there every little bit. Unfortunately, things are a little more sinister than they might let on, as Tom is rather set on the other man. Completed.

Recently completed, linkao3(Inevitabilites by EclipseWing) has a Tom and Harry both born in the same generation. I haven't finished it yet, as I do love torturing myself via patience, but that also means I can't vouch for the ending. So, I'm not sure how it is after about chapter 8 or so, but I thought I'd put it out here regardless. 100k+ words.

linkffn(Death of Today by Epic Solemnity) is a classic LV/HP, though I should forewarn that Harry isn't so much Harry as someone who might've shared some lineage. He doesn't even share a name, which actually helps in some ways for me, but if it bothers than there are ways to circumvent that. Regardless, this Harry-character is literally a genius who was sorted into Ravenclaw, so cunning is there, but it's a Dark!Harry where he also hates muggles.... It's very AU in that there's a lot of dead characters who are alive and have been so for a while, as well as characters acting rather differently than used to, but it's got some concepts I haven't seen applied well in other fics. Does have some tropes, though, as it is a bit older and might've even set a few of them maybe. Idk. Complete with an end length of 500k+ words.

linkffn(Wear Me Like A Locket Around Your Throat by VivyPotter) is one of those Tom/Harry timetravel ones, but better. As in, there are characters with actual lives and struggles and growth, Tom is still a bit of an arsehole (which is something a lot of the others of its genre either do too little or too much) and Harry is, as always, a bit of an idiot---if still well-intentioned. Ongoing, with the last update just being in February, so expect another one sometime in the near future. Currently clocks in at a 200k+ word count.

linkkao3(A Dangerous Game by Cybrid) has the Chamber of Secrets stuff occur in Harry's fifth year, with the end result of the actual encounter between Diary!Tom and Harry resulting in one of those soul-bonds that doesn't let them move outside x feet away from each other. The "Enemies with Benefits" tag is probably the most relevant concept here---at least outside of "Stockholm Syndrome", which /should/ be there but isn't. Is currently ongoing---last updated on the tenth, so I need to go and catch up on these last two chapters...

A short and somewhat-sweet-somewhat-creepy fic is linkao3(Beggar to Beggar Cried by Lomonaaeron) Harry has known that he's a Horcrux since he was little, so he's been growing up with the knowledge that he needs to die. He recognises the Diary for what it is, and Tom decides to do what he can. Harry just wants to help. 12k+ words. Complete.

linkao3(Horror of Our Love by Leontina) is a fic where Neville is the BWL. Harry himself is a bit meek and lonely, so when the Diary comes along he clings to Tom even after the bloke tries to bloody-well kill him. Dark!Harry, except Harry really doesn't want to go dark, I don't think, so technically "grey" if you prefer to use terms like that. Tom is pretty possessive for a bit, can I just say. And by possessive, I mean he'd probably bite someone's hand off if they got to close to the poor child. Abandoned at about 175k words.

linkao3(Kings of Flowers and Skulls by Merrinpippy) is a 20k+ short story where Harry and Tom are both what are probably-technically closer to gods than anything else, but they're described as kings over their own personal domains. Tom definitely gets a bit upset when something happens to Harry. Complete.

Old time fav, linkffn(Kisses Cursed by The_Fictionist) is a fairy-tale-esque story with a Beauty-and-the-Beast theme. A forewarning, however is that it was the teensiest bit confusing for me the first read through, though that might've had something to do with the fact that it was finals week and my last two brain cells just kept doing the macarena. Second and third times were fine, though, so I'm not sure which memory I should trust. Anyway, Voldemort was possessive, but so was and Riddle and the Past and the Prophecy and---okay. It might be a little confusing. Still pretty good though. Complete. ~50k words.

linkao3(To Be Set Free by MerrinPippy) is a cinderella-esque thing where Harry is the Dursleys' slave and Tom Riddle is the begrudging prince looking to be married off to one of the more noble citizens in order to display to the other kingdoms that yes, the Crown is Strong and whatnot. Things change 'round for Harry when a strange, magical creature called "Dobby" pops up and offers him a chance to go to the gala. Cheesy premise, but well-told with a lowkey-but-constantly possessive Tom, and a positive portrayal of the rest of Harry's new friends, however brief their appearances might be. Complete. 35k+ words.

​

Aand I think that's all. I might have one or two more floating around somewhere, but I suppose this'll do. Didn't bother to proofread any of these descriptions, however, so my apologies, but I'm feeling a bit under the weather today (hence why I'm online at all). Personal top picks would need to be Butterfly Heart, Aconitum and Hauntingly, as well as To Be Set Free and Beggar to Beggar Cried, if you wish for some place to start. I don't /mean/ to bombard people with a list of fics, but it somehow tends to happen...

If you want to know anything more about one of these particular fics, feel free to ask---I'll probably be able to come up with an answer. Hopefully this has been helpful, though I'm not a particularly big fan of SS/HP, for some strange reason. May you have the best of luck in your searching and reading!

​

(And lastly, if you or anyone else reading this knows of a well-written femslash TMR/HP, please feel free to share with me. Like, honestly---am I just searching in the wrong places? smh)

  Harry Potter, raised and abused by the Dursleys ever since his parents died, lives in the cupboard under the stairs. He has no friends or family who love him and his life is dull until one day a letter arrives arrives for him, written in green ink, that promises freedom. Sounds familiar, right? King Thomas Riddle's illness combined with his political paranoia pushes him to arrange three royal balls, after which his son, Prince Tom Riddle, must choose a guest to marry, thereby securing the kingdom's future and solidifying their strength in the eyes of their allies/enemies. Tom is convinced that he will be able to defy his father and choose no-one, or at least he is until at the first ball he meets an attractive stranger with dark hair and glasses who won't tell anyone his name...

** Hmm... I would like to read something like that too. The only story I can think of at the moment, has a hint of what you're looking for, but is not exclusively about a romantic relationship. Warning, this is pretty strong, so it might not be right for you. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1031138][Unbearable]] is a series that's told through the different lives of Harry, Snape, and Draco. Harry starts off petty and immature as he squabbles with Draco, but gives into his knee-jerk reaction to save others as threats grow more serious. By the time his point of view rolls around, they're two years out of school and he discovers that Snape is still alive and is driven by a strong desire to find him. During Snape's version of the story, Snape encounters Tom Riddle when he's 17, and a pretty possessive relationship is alluded to, but not gone into detail. More will be learned about that in Harry's version as he uncovers Snape's past. But so many other things are involved, I don't want to set you up if this isn't right for you. Mind the warnings. If you use the link, start with Draco's version or you won't understand the signifance of Harry's. :-)
