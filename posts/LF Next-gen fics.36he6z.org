I'm looking for next-fics with a broad scope of characters and an actual plotline, not just a fluffy family/romance one-shot. All pairings or gen are fine.


** No one has mentioned [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]]! It features Teddy Lupin and his new friends as they start Hogwarts, the first generation after the war. The plotline is really interesting and all the characters are so well thought out! It's by the same author who wrote Alexandra Quick. Can't recommend it enough!

** It would help if you give us a list of fics you've already read and liked so we don't recommend them again, or characters/genre you're interested in to narrow down the search.

*** I remember reading [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate]] way back in the day and really liking it. I think that's pretty much all I've read as far as next gen goes, which is why I'd like some recommendations to get started.

I'd like it if people could mention their favourites, I'd love to check those out. I'm pretty fond of Teddy and the Potter kids, but I don't really have any preferences.

Edit: As for genre, I like plot driven stories but with a fair bit of character development/exploration. Also, friendship over romance most of the time.

  Al's dad told him that Slytherin was all right, and that means it isn't fair how people treat them. Al's realized he has to fix this.

I second this. I'm re-reading it now, and the humor is /excellent/.

** I have read and re-read everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] - and there's lots to read. Lots of family dynamics, storylines that focus on different characters.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]. I haven't read all of that, but I'm slowly working my way through.

** I mostly write and rec next gen! All the next gen I read is on HPFF like Delicate, which has a really strong base of authors who write next gen. If you want something humorous with light romance, try the fics in this [[http://oddhour.tumblr.com/post/42049412559/hey-recommend-other-hpff-fics-like-with][post]] on my blog. Lots of smart writing and realistic relationships. My [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=151202][authors page]] also has a few popular stories (/Capers/ is a friendshippy adventure heist fic; /etc/ is a snarky semi-satire of next gen OC fics), and my favorites have a few more stories I haven't rec'd, most likely because they're not finished.

Some others missed here: for something darker and very plotty with excellent morally grey characters, definitely try [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=325749][Clash]]. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290483][Morocco]] is like a Scorose action popcorn flick. And my favorite romance fic is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]] which deals with a love triangle and family in very realistic ways.
