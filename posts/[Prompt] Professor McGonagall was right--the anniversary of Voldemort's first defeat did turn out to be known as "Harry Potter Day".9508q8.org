** I think there would have been a better chance for it, if that hadn't happen on Helloween

*** Hmmm....well, most of the initial celebrations were on November 1st, and it wouldn't be a stretch for people to say "You-Know-Who might have disappeared after midnight, when it was technically not Halloween anymore" but yeah, that was something I hadn't really considered.

**** Actual the whole timeline confused me a great deal.

Everybody knew in the morning of the 1st that Voldemort was gone. Everybody!

But Harry was picked up by Hagrid at some point and then they dropped him off at the Dursleys after dark.

How long did Hagrid at to fly to get there. Especially considering that it is in England as well. Or did they wait really long to pick up the orphaned baby. Or did Hagrid just had a fun day with baby Harry before he had to drop him off in the evening. I right now imagine Hagrid doing everything he can to cheer little Harry up and prevent him from crying for his mummy and daddy

***** As I recall, somebody had a theory that Hagrid and Sirius found Harry relatively early on--Dumbledore found out straight away, in order to plan for everything, and I'm guessing he had some sort of charm that acted as an alert.

So Hagrid takes Baby Harry and Sirius goes to kill Pettigrew. Hagrid stops at a pub for a pint for his nerves, and lets everyone know, and then they all begin to party, and Hagrid doesn't get his drink.

So he takes off on the flying motorbike and stops in the next wizarding community and goes to another pub:

"Hello Hagrid! Usual? What's with the bundle?"

"This is Harry Potter. You-Know-Who tried ter kill 'im but Harry stopped 'im. Cause of that, Dumbledore says You-Know-Who's gone."

And so on and so forth, Hagrid spread the news of Voldemort's defeat all over Britain, and he never got his drink.

****** This is just straight up what I always thought happened, minus Hagrid stopping at a pub.

***** I always have in my headcanon that Hagrid picked him up early, met Sirius there, got Sirius's motorbike, flew to Hogwarts. Met Dumbledore there, Dumbledore had him checked out by Madam Pomfrey, Dumbledore tells him to keep Harry safe and meet him that night at Privet Drive, Dumbledore runs off to do some due diligence on the Dursley's, talk to Arabella Figg about moving to Privet Drive, I'm sure he remains tight lipped but meets with the Minister and some other important folks throughout the day. Meanwhile Hagrid gives Harry a tour of the grounds, then takes the bike into Hogsmeade to join in on the celebrations. Don't think he'd purposely let slip anything about the baby, but who knows- maybe he told Aberforth just to satiate his appetite for telling somebody who he had. Then he's running a few minutes behind because he lost track of time enjoying his day with Harry.

**** True, but November 1st would be Samhain (or Calan Gaeaf for Welsh characters?) if there's a consistent use of Celtic & Germanic rites (like Yule) in the HP wizard world.

***** But... there /isn't/. The Yule Ball is a one-off thing and only exists because they're reviving a tradition from a /medieval tournament/ --- and an international one; could be the Yule Ball idea was started on a year when it was Durmstrang holding, for all we know. Other than that one solitary thing, wizards just use "Hallowe'en", "Christmas" or "Easter", and there's no "pagan rites" thing going on; most everyone is either Christian or vaguely agnostic/atheist.

****** Ah that's right, I've been misled by a fanfiction I read a few weeks ago in which Yule (and a Yule Ball) was held every year. So yeah, they most probably don't celebrate Samhain at Hogwarts since there's only one occurence of a Celtic/Germanic rites in the books
