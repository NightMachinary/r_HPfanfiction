  beautiful banner by aurora borealis@TDAThe last 10 years after the Battle of Hogwarts have been tough for Harry and Hermione, but this past year was especially shit. Friends seek comfort in each other's arms. A vow is made that if they aren't married by the time they're thirty-five that they will marry each other. Chapter 2 of this story was written for MalfoysAngel's "The Dirty Thirty" challenge.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
