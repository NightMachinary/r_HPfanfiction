:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello everyone!, this is my first post on this subreddit, and i love it.

I've been searching for one fic in which there are, among other interesting spells, 4 spells of fire (called the burning words as a group), and an adventure in which harry uses them along the way.

I even remember the 4 types of fire there was (Dragon fire, Lux Aeterna, Gubraithian fire and Fyendfire), but can't for the life of me remember the name.

Does anyone have a clue?


** Just googling "lux aeterna gubraithian" brings up exactly one result, which is probably the fic you want. Kind of.

It gives a link to [[https://fictionhunt.com/stories/3yqy9b8/blood-runes][the FictionHunt page for Blood Runes by Darth Bubbles]]. Unfortunately, the story has been taken down from the site. But it has [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11212555][a link to the original version on fanfiction.net]], but the story has also been taken down there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6060316/Darth-Bubbles-16985214][The author's profile]] says that they are no longer interested in their fics and have taken them down. They gave people permission to download the story and post it elsewhere, but I can't find any evidence that anyone ever did.
