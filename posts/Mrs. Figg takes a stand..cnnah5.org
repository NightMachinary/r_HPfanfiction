I would like to request a fic where Mrs. Figg takes a stand against the Dursleys.

After complaining to Dumbledore about the Dursley's treatment of Harry and getting nowhere, Mrs. Figg decides to do something about it. She asks Dumbledore what the minimum time Harry has to stay at the Dursleys per day is (a max of 8 hours preferably) and makes a deal/blackmails the Dursleys into leaving Harry with her for the remainder of the time.

She proceeds to make sure Harry grows up decently. It still isn't ideal because she isn't wealthy, but Harry has decent clothes and a full stomach and caring touches. And a love of cats.


** "Harry. This is an extremely traumatic time for me. The Polyjuice Potion isn't meant to be mixed with cat hair, and it will take some time before I'm back to normal, so please *stop petting me.*"

"This is a Pavlovian response. I literally don't think I can stop. You remember what happened when McGonnagal showed us her Animagus form that one time."

"Yes, Harry. That's why you still - a year later - have detention cleaning the bedpans in the hospital wing. At least wash you hands."
