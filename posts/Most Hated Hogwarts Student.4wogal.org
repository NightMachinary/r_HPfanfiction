Who are the Hogwarts student characters that you dislike the most in the HP universe?

Can you name one from each house that you disliked?

P.S. By student, I mean that the character must have been a student at Hogwarts while Harry was there.

** Hmm there are actually a decent amount I dont like, but its hard to find ones I really "Hate". In terms of picking 1 from each house, thats tough. I would likely go with:

- Slytherin: Millicent Bulstrode

- Gryffindor: Lavender Brown

- Ravenclaw: Marietta Edgecombe

- Hufflepuff: Zacharias Smith

However there are plenty of others I disliked beyond those. Not a big Cho Chang fan, or Crabbe/Goyle fan, and honestly I always hated reading areas where the Creevey bothers were involved.

And while I am sure I will get some hate for this, I actually REALLY dislike Ron Weasley. Never a fan. I dont know if I "Hate" him, but I never liked him as a character.

**** She was a major player in the inquisitorial squad in 5th year. But I will admit part of choosing her was partially because I did not want to go the obvious "Draco or Pansey" route both because they seem too obvious to chose and also partially because while they were terrible people at times, I felt like they were more interesting character studies. I could of easily gone Crabbe or Goyle here as well but they seemed so attached to Malfoy at the hip that they are almost not even their own characters in a way.

Interesting sidenote, I always thought that Pansey Parkinson was like Dracos Bellatrix in a way. In other words she was a bit "off" and mentally unstable and latched herself onto a "strong" figure and followed fanatically.

I mean, the same narrative that fails to even examine Fred and George's actions expects us to see e.g. the Slytherins as dicks when they play dirty at Quidditch, despite their actions not causing any real harm (unlike costing a student weeks if not months of the school year).

In fact, if [insert random Slytherin here] had been the one doing the exact same things the Weasley twins did the narrative would have treated them far less charitably. The double standard is a large part of why I don't like them (also, they treat Percy like shit for no reason while he's at Hogwarts).

While the twins are on the "cusp" of pranks and joke item creation, much of what they do and make is not new to the wizarding world and you can buy such things at Zonko's on Hogsmeade weekend.

So far from reading all the things you posted, I am not even sure why you read the books in the first place. You seem to hate most of the characters, and large chunks of the Wizarding world, and are applying real world beliefs and ideals to a imaginary wizarding world thats VASTLY different.

** Characters that I hate...

There aren't many. Hate is a bit of a strong word to describe a character, but there are a few I disliked to an extreme degree.

First and foremost, Draco Malfoy. Coward, narcissicst, sycophant and rich boy with the proverbial credit card up his ass. The worst Slytherin in the history of Cunning and Ambition, only bested in his awfulness by his two trolls of friends. I never had strong feelings regarding any of his followers, but it goes without saying that I dislike all of them.

In the other houses,...

Theres probably Cho. I get that she was an emotional mess after Book 4 but dating someone because he was the last one to see my true love alive is just fucked up.

For the other two houses: Whomever bullied Luna and with the Badgers I have no idea. None of them goes over "mild annoyance".

** For Gryffindor, either Ronald Weasley or Cormac McLaggen. McLaggen especially, he's a disgrace to the male gender. For Ravenclaw, whoever started bullying Luna, for Slytherin...idk, for Hufflepuff, Zacharias Smith. Smith is an asshole, a dick, I could go on and on. How he got into Hufflepuff is beyond me.

*** Maybe he's one of "the rest" - I mean that's how it's advertised kind of:

Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Gryffindor get the really good students and Hufflepuff kind of gets the rest (I am not saying that being fair and hard working is bad, but I'd think being intelligent, cunning, ambitious and/or brave is more important)

I mean if Hufflepuff were all that fair etc. they'd not have bullied Harry (so no badges, no heir of Slytherin and no "oh he's mentally unstable because a paper that's known for lies says so and despite the fact that we know this guy because we've been at the same school for years now!" -.-))

** Slytherin: Draco malfoy. He is a bully, all of his strength lies in nepotism and his father, he is a racist, he steals people's Christmas presents, and he becomes a terrorist. No real deadening qualities other than being too much of a coward.

Ravenclaw: Marietta for snitching I guess.

Hufflepuff: Zacharias for being a dick.

Griffindoor: mclaggen.

** Damned you are asking US! If you'd only said:

Who's hated most by Hogwart's student population? Then that would have been easy to answer:

Harry - remember the Heir of Slytherin stuff and those badges during the tournament - not to mention being called a nutcase by the Prophet and by Umbridge which many students believed :(

Well, for me?

In Gryffindor it's probably: RON (I just don't like him, ok? I think he's a bad friend, jealous and a traitor who could have gotten Harry killed twice (at least!))

In Slytherine it's Draco Malfoy hands down...asshole! They should have locked him up for his crimes and they should have taken away the Malfoy fortune (he could have been decent if his teachers didn't constantly enable him - even McGonagall and Dumbledore let him get away with calling people "mudbloods" etc.!)

In Hufflepuff...good question (got to bring up a list...ok, done!): Zacharias Smith (real "charmer" that one (could: have said "what an asshole"), just needed the name - I knew I had a "favourite" in that house (yeah: A favourite to put in detention - Snape Style: "Smith: Detention for breathing!" "Smith: Detention for wasting air and space in my class room!" etc.))

Lastly, Ravenclaw: Either Michael Corner or Anthony Goldstein (can't remember why!)

ps: I dislike almost all of them - then again: There's only one - important! - canon character I don't dislike: Sirius Black (all the others don't even try to work on their flaws or just have too many flaws...that's why I love fanfiction: It corrects many of those flaws and uses this great world better than the original writer does in many cases!)

** Gryffindor, Hermione Granger. We know she is an insufferable know it all. So much so in her first year she was bullied for it. She then became friends with Harry Potter from basically pity and that protected her from all criticism. Fanon has made her even worse as they often think her poor qualities are good things. She also provides an easy cop-out for authors as 'Hermione read in the library' provides a semi-believable answer to almost any problem. Hufflepuff. Justin Finch-Fletchly, sure Zacharias Smith is an arse but we know it and can just zone him out much like Draco Malfoy, they are unlikable as characters by design but Justin always strikes me as a pathetic pompous waste of space. Ravenclaw, while I'm tempted to put Luna simply because I never understand fan fiction's obsession with her I think my most disliked would be Micheal Corner simply because of his reaction to Gryffindor winning the quidditch. Slytherin, Theodore Nott, intelligent enough to know what he is doing and is still an arse.

*** JKR was quoted to say that if Hogwarts had a helpful librarian, half her plots would have been solved easily. So, "Hermione read it in the library" is completely fine as a solution.

**** So the problem in HP isn't that Dumbledore keeps secrets (and loves convoluted - not to mention stupid - plans and hates decisive action like say putting some terrorists down for good?) but that Madame Pince is a bad librarian? Ok...now who's going to right the fanfiction that solves this? ;)

****** Well, if the information still forces you to challenge something like those traps in front of the stone in the first book, then I'd say it's ok ;) (the information alone would not have helped them navigate the traps and/or confront Quirrel!)
