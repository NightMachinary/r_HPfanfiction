** The fandom and this sub are two different things entirely. That being said, I doubt that you'd find any pairing with more than 20% approval. The competition to R/Hr isn't just H/Hr, but also DM/Hr, SS/Hr and so on.

*** Jesus christ. I mean, i think Ron and Hr are a bad couple, but Snape/Hr is actually disgusting. Gross.

And Draco/Hr is like a story about the guy who ran the ovens at Auschwitz dating a Jewish prisoner at the concentration camp. Yikes.

THANK YOU. /Maybe/ Draco Malfoy sticking to his parents' views earlier on could be excused, but later on? When he was basically an adult, assaulting Hermione, calling her racial slurs, mocking her appearance and going onto willingly join a terrorist group that wished to racially cleanse her from society? No thanks.

***** I know! The pairing only works if it is really a hardcore re-write of Draco's whole character. That so many fanfic authors see no issue with pairing the two together is.... disturbing.

Usually Romione have more than 20% of approval when I go to different subreddit like [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] have of 65% of approval on quora it's the same.

**** I doubt that you will find many Bellamione or Dramione shippers there though, nevermind the slash crowd. I mean, just look at the percentage of stories with each character. Even the most popular characters appear only in like 1/8th of all fics (Draco Malfoy was the most popular IIRC).

** Among fanfic readers and writers, who often have an axe to grind with canon, Romione is not popular.

But among the overall HP fandom, Romione is of course popular, albeit less so than Harry/Ginny.

**** I like Hinny, but the other Weasleys are somewhere between "boring" (Ron) and "can't stand them" (Weasley parents) for me, so finding a good fic which has Hinny, no other Weasleys and no Hermione bashing (including shipping her with the people who wanted to murder her whole "kind") is kinda hard.

****** I'd love to read some which still keep a good friendship between Harry and Hermione. Far too often, the authors get preachy and try to make it obvious that they aren't a good match by completely ruining their relationship (including love potion plots and similar stupid arcs).

** while I ship Romione in canon, and would be actually disappointed if she ended up with Harry, I don't like this pairing in fandom as in, I wouldn't read a fic with them. (unless just a side pairing, since a lot of fics have that.) but reading a whole romance Romione fic, nah.

but there's that. if your ship actually happen in canon, you don't actually ship it anymore, since it's canon. I'm sure if Drarry was canon, there would be like 10% of the amount of fics there are currently. it's human nature.

now imagine if neither Harry, nor Ron ended up with her and it would be an open ending (with no romance), or she ended up with Viktor or what not. now I would read Romione fics for sure.
