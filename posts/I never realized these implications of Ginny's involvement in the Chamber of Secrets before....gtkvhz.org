I was reading a fic with a lot of common tropes like helpful goblins and marriage contract signed by Dumbledore and Mrs.Weasley for Harry and Ginny. Harry categorically refuses to marry Ginny due to her actions, or rather inaction during the Chamber of Secrets episode. (It was set in the summer before third year.)

Harry points out that Ginny had been suspicious of the diary due to having black-outs and waking up with feathers and blood coinciding with the attacks. She throws away the diary hoping it would help. However she realizes that Harry has it and panics that Tom would reveal her crush and probably her culpability in the attacks. This leads her to steal it back to cover her tracks. She never approaches an adult under the assumption she would be expelled for her role in the attacks.

But does this absolve her of all blame?

Hagrid is imprisoned in Azkaban for months because she was afraid she would be expelled. Harry is ostracized by the entire school for supposedly being the 'Heir of Slytherin'. Four students, Filch's cat and the Gryffindor ghost were petrified - /i.e. nearly killed/ - and were saved from death by a stroke of luck. Additionally Harry and Ron were nearly killed while trying to find clues in the Forbidden Forest and Harry came extremely close to death in the Chamber - once again saved by miracles at the last moment. She almost kills herself in the process. Even is she does not know that it is Voldemort who is possessing her, she can deduce that it is probably an evil wizard using her to attack others. Is all of this worth not being expelled?

Interestingly, two of the people petrified were extremely close to her brothers - Penelope is Percy's girlfriend and Hermione is Ron's best friend (atleast then). How does this affect them when they understand that their sister could have stopped the attacks by simply speaking up?

P.S.: The fic is linkao3(24155128)... the pairing is Harry/Charlie but it is practically gen fic for now.

*Edit:* Thanks to everyone pointing out that I treat her as too much of an adult - I interact with kids very rarely. I was on the other end of the spectrum as a child - I could never keep to myself what is bothering me for more than a day or week and I could not understand her. Thank you for pointing out that not everyone is the same.


** I find adults here more culpable than Ginny, she's 11, lonely, and in a new place. Maybe her brother should have paid better attention, but they are also teenagers. I do wish that stories dealt with the aftermath more, but that would have definitely changed the tone.

*** Percy does notice that she looks sickly and takes her to Madam Pomfrey for a Pepper-up, but he has no way of identifying why she is sick unless she opens up herself. Maybe it is wishful thinking on my part to hope that even if McGonagall doesn't do much she would confiscate the unknown artifact the way she did in third year when Hermione went to her about the Firebolt.

** The experience Ginny went through could be considered an allegory for grooming and child abuse. It's completely normal that a child wouldn't reach out to an adult and that they may behave in a way that seems to be counterproductive/put themselves in further danger. I feel really uncomfortable at the thought that an eleven year old girl would be blamed for not behaving as a logical adult when scared, victimised and lonely.

** How in the world is she supposed to know that Hagrid is linked to the diary??? She wakes up with a memory loss every time - that's what she said in book 5 when Harry is worried about being possessed. She doesn't remember what she's done and what Tom makes her do, she doesn't know that Tom Riddle is Voldemort and the Heir of Slytherin. She's 11 years old, perhaps lonely, and she found someone writing kindly to her and being supportive (even though it was just acting on Tom's part).

The thing about being possessed is that Tom takes over her body and controlling her actions (yes, because she trusted something she shouldn't), and it wasn't inherently Ginny who was doing all those things. Dumbledore said it too; Voldemort has fooled older and cleverer people.

*** If she no had no idea that the diary was related to the attacks, why did she try to flush it down a toilet?

She doesn't have a memory of killing the roosters, but she knows that she wakes up with blood on her body on the day of the first attack and again when Justin was petrified.

And then she stole the diary back.

Obviously she knows it is somehow related to the attacks. There were no attacks in the months she didn't have the diary. She steals it back and later two more people are petrified.

And do you think rumors of Hagrid being arrested would not have spread? I'm pretty sure I remember Lockhart bragging that he knew it all along it was Hagrid and would caught him if he had the chance. Also Draco Malfoy wouldn't have shut his mouth about his father's perceived achievements.

**** The books are from Harry's POV. We know things that happened to/by other characters but we don't know the reasons WHY, unless Harry also has that information. Especially in the earlier books, Harry didn't care to know Ginny beyond her being Ron's little sister and as such he has no idea the reasoning behind her actions. You, yourself, are just speculating at her reasons for her actions based on what you think is normal for an 11 year old.

Why did she try to flush it down the toilet? We don't know. Only Ginny knows. You say it's because she had to know it was somehow related to the attacks... well, I could say that maybe Tom said something mean to her completely unrelated to the attacks, but that an 11 year old couldn't handle and she tried to get rid of the "friend" she thought she had and didn't associate the diary in any way with the attacks.

When it comes to waking up with blood on her... I mean it's so easy for anyone, including adults, to disassociate from the reality of a situation... an 11 year old waking up with some blood on her could easily just not process it and pretend it didn't happen or was more like a dream than reality, and since we dont know how much blood exactly she also could have just pretended to herself that she just cut herself somehow..

Her stealing the diary back could also be explained away as her simply not wanting Harry to accidentally learn that she had a ridiculous crush on him from the Diary, and in no way related to her thinking the Diary had anything to do with a monster attacking people at all. What 11 year old do you know would want their diary in the hands of the person they have been talking about in it, whether the diary talks back or not?

Again you are coming at this with all of the information Harry has and are assuming that the rest of the characters all have that same information, which is just not correct. And you are making assumptions and adding things from your own personal POV which, idk I don't know you and it could be right, but when you have all of the information it's easy for people to assume they would have connected the dots/done things differently...but for the most part we are all dumb 11 year olds who never would have thought "I've got some blood on me. I must be responsible for turning people into stone over the course of a school year."

** That's stupid:

- she was under influence of strong magic: six years older Ron got completely screwed up by the same thing in just few weeks, she had the diary for ten months or so!
- she was eleven ... who of you, when eleven, was not mortified by fear of something, which you now can see as absolutely silly?

** - Ginny had the Diary for a good while, before going to Hogwarts, she had already been writing in it, and it was already slowly draining her life away

- Ginny is eleven, in a new school, surrounded by new people, why would she trust the adults? It's pretty appropriate to a child to think that they might get in trouble, Percy briefly saw something was going on with Ginny, but nothing else was pushed through.

- While kids definitely aren't stupid, it's rather normal to let your fear and uncertainty get you down, and not talk to anyone about it, so it makes sense why she didn't tell anyone

- The Horcrux was controlling her, she was a victim, just as much as the ones who had gotten petrified, she shouldn't be punished for it. Definitely warned, if anything like that ever happens again, but not punished.

- Dumbledore put on the ring, despite knowing that there were risks involved. Harry, Hermione and Ron were all influenced by the locket, during their hunt. If Dumbledore, Harry, Hermione and Ron can be influenced into doing things/acting certain way they normally would, a at the time 11 year old Ginny Weasley definitely could have been as well.

In canon? Nothing. By common sense? Well, there is a reason why there is an age of criminal responsibility and I have no idea where Ginny falls there because canon shows nothing in that regard.

That being said, she is to blame for this mess no matter if there are legal consequences or not. At the same time, she is far from the only one at blame. Basically any named adult in the series other than Sirius and Lupin, the other Weasleys for not noticing that something was up and her dorm mates.

** Merlin, Ginny was eleven when she was possessed by the diary and the diary systematically erased her memory every time it possessed her. Furthermore, Ginny flushed the diary because she thought that it was responsible for gaps in her memory, she didn't know anything about the Chamber back then. If grownups cannot resist the Imperius or a horcrux's damaging allure, why should an eleven year old be expected to resist it?

Furthermore, it is the Wizarding world where we have biting books ( the Monster's Book of Monsters), homework planners that remind you of homework and moving photographs and therefore, in spite of Arthur Weasley's warning of not trusting something if they can't see the brain, Ginny wasn't in the wrong to have trusted the diary.

  Harry learns some disturbing news during the summer before his third year. Thankfully he has some oddly helpful goblins and some friendly red heads to help him through the worst of it.
