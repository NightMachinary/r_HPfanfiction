** In the nicest possible way, this reads like a run of the mill Marauders self-insert. I'm sure plenty of people would like it/are looking for it but a lot of people are likely to be tired of it if it doesn't do anything new/interesting.

If you write it, maybe consider how Charlotte changes the narrative beyond the Marauders Era. Does she survive? Is she killed? Does canon change for Harry or does Charlotte have no effect on anything? And what kind of person is she? Is she a female James? Come up with a fun/interesting take on the "James's sister trope" and I'm sure people will love it.

** If you have this OC, change the plot, and I mean significantly including the Halloween Event.

I will not read it if it follows the same canon stations like James and Lily getting bumped off by Voldemort, Sirius getting stuffed in Azkaban, and Harry getting thrown to the Dursleys.

** I agree with the other comments. It is pointless to add an original character if they do absolutely nothing and everything turns out the same. Make sure your character has a strong personality that deeply effects the plot. Is she a political genius that's going to change the world by ruling the House of Black as Sirius' wife. Is she a duelist that takes out death eaters amd competes with Voldemort. Most importantly, give her a kick ass animagus form with a name to match.

** I would read it. It sounds interesting in how she would change things or be prevented from changing things.

** I'd read it. I honestly enjoy well written plots like this... especially ones with a good twist in it. Granted I'm a total sucker for Sirius gets to live and falls in love fics.
