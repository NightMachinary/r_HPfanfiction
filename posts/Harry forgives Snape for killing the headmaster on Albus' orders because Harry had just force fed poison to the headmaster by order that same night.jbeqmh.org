Although I did find Snape lived fics an interesting place to discuss the concept of a dead hero vs. a surviving spy. I think it would be cool to read a good spy autobiography.


** If you took it a bit further, this could make an excellent crack fic. Dumbledore has so many backup plans for his backup plans that nearly three-quarters of the inhabitants of the castle and Hogsmeade did something to kill him. None of them know any of the others have instructions to kill Dumbledore.

Chaos ensues. :D

*** And so during his funeral, a phrase told by everyone (except Draco) is 'Its my fault, I killed Dumbledore'.

**** I LOVE the idea of a fic where everyone except Draco accidentally contributed to the headmaster's demise.

***** I think with hindsight, as an adult, Harry would be less charitable to an Albus who lived too. That guy was a mind fuck.

** Semi-relevant thought: Voldemort added time sands to the poison, which causes the drinker to start being resigned to their death in the events leading up to drinking the poison. The two known victims of the poison were competent enough to think of trying something other than drinking death juice, yet both shrugged and did it anyways. Destroying the basin is a possibility.

We don't know exactly what Regulus Black was up to in the months leading up to his death, but his actions of telling absolutely nobody about the horcruxes to the point of ordering Kreacher not to disclose anything is markedly similar to Dumbledore's elaborate assisted suicide plan.

This also might explain why the potion is the only thing that permanently replenishes: it's looping itself in time.
