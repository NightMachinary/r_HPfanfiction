Hey guys, just wondering if anyone has any decently written stories involving dark Harry. Preferably no H/G or H/Hr stories, but I won't say no if it's well written. Any pairings for slash is fine.

Any length if it's completed, but if it's WIP or abandoned at least 60 000 words, unless it's fantastic.

Any AU setups are cool - time travel, bonds, wrong BWL etc. I don't care too much about spelling or grammar, as long as it's readable and makes sense. However the story must have good structure eg not have chapters where nothing is happening and then all the action is crammed in the last chapter of the story.

I think that's it really, any help would be great cus I've spent ages trying to find something decent that I haven't read yet and I've got nada.

Edit -

Thanks for all the recommendation guys. Really appreciate it.

Also I figured I might as well chuck any recs of mine up here as well in case anyone is browsing and wants to find something to read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5675879/1/The-Art-of-Hidden-Personas][The Act of Hidden Personas]] which is quite well written, even though the story is a bit odd and hasn't been updated in a bit.

Pretty much all of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey][Athey's stories]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5426500/1/Langsyne][Langsyne]] which is a vampire Harry/Voldemort stroy. I have it marked down as great, but with a lame ending. If I'm remembering correctly, I really loved it and was pretty annoyed at the ending. You never know though, you might like the ending.

And I'm gonna agree with the recs for Death of Today and Rise of a Dark Lord which [[/u/MimiDark]] recommended below.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3750393/1/Harry-Potter-s-Life-Lessons][Life'S Lessons]] Short, but absolutely delicious. Amorally logical throughout. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes' I am Harry's Brother.]] Ok, I don't think Harry is the evil one here, but it's quite unique. Don't get scared by the premise, the writing and progression is good.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] has a sort of morally ambiguous Harry who [[/spoiler][helps Voldemort regain his sanity, and it's eventual LV/HP slash]]. It is abandoned, as far as I know, but at 226,768 words it's still quite worth it. It's a time travel fic of a sorts [[/spoiler][(Harry is reborn into baby Harry, July 31 1980, every time he dies)]] but very well done.

*** Thanks for the recommendations. I have read A Different Life and thought it was pretty good. Haven't read the rest though, Paraselenic and Princess of the Blacks in particular look interesting so I'll give them a go. Thank you.

** Two I usually recommend are;

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/1/Out-of-the-Night][Out of the Night]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]]

Descent into Darkness is finished with an abandoned sequel but has been picked up by another author on AFF which is updated regularly. It's a gradual HP/LV with some smut later on.

Out of the Night is a personal favourite of mine. Harry learns what it really means to be a dark wizard and decides that the dark is for him. I don't want to say too much but the paths that Harry takes and the personal reflection that he goes through when becoming a dark wizard are wonderfully written and makes the story seem so believable.

*** Yeah Decent into Darkness is one of my favourite Harry/Voldemort stories. I wasn't really a fan of the other writer who took over it though. Gave up after a few chapter. Haven't read Out of the Night, so I might give that one a go. Thanks for the help.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of a Dark Kingdom]] by Mizuni-sama is hella awesome. It's long as hell, ongoing and the best Harry/Voldie non-slash I have seen in a while. 1,000,000+ words!

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1176279/chapters/2397109][The Black Bunny]] is more neutral!Harry but he's married to Voldemort so he occasionally get's his hands dirty. It get's very slice-of-life like after the first arc or so. 400k plus and complete...sorta.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/451855/chapters/774989][Counting Bodies Like Sheep]] is a pretty dark Zombie AU. It's Tom/Harry with a smaller age gap but very good.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/517540/chapters/913785][The Rise of A Dark Lord]] is also pretty damn good though the writing style isn't completely to my tastes but it's regularly updated so that's alright. A very dark slytherin!Harry and slow burn Harrymort but updated often. About 100k words.

I hesitate to rec [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/The%20Black%20Heir][The Black Heir]] since it's Harry by another name and backstory [he's Sirius Black's son named Orion] but going past it, it's a pretty damn good story. 600k in the first story and over 100k in the sequel that is ongoing. Multiple pairings but Harrymort is the big one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] is a big Harrymort one with a Voldemort wins!AU though it's not smut heavy. It's also another one with Harry being someone else's son, Regulus in this version and he was raised in an orphanage. 71 chapters, over 500,000 words.

[[http://www.intertexius.com/_index-harry-potter-fanfiction-and-art.html][A Bittersweet Potion]] series is a story that starts out with a cute premise [Harry changes into a cat and Snape adopts him] and grows really dark really damn quickly. It get's hellishly depraved towards the end and hasn't got updated in a hell of a long time but it's pretty long and solid.

Those are the bigs ones I can garner that fit...though there is this one Lucius/Harry one but it's not that long and I haven't read it in a while. Whatever, message me if you need more!

*** Thank you for all the recs. I've read a few of them and loved them, haven't read The Black or Bittersweet Potion yet though, so that should keep me occupied for a while. Thanks.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]]. Completed. I read this recently and although there are some problems with it (especially the writing of the first chapter or two), I strongly recommend it. Thanks to [[/u/BobVosh]] for recommending it. Its a Twin!BWL story, and shows negative affects of using Dark magic.

And, as for dark ... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3548714/1/Screams][Screams]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3568551/1/The-Smiling-Man][The Smiling Man]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3662838/1/Reunion][Reunion]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3789046/1/Cause-and-Effect][Cause and Effect]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3792581/1/The-Downside-of-Immortality][The Downside of Immortality]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3887744/1/Flowers-in-the-Wind][Flowers in the Wind]] by cloneserpents. A series of dark one-shots.
