So I've finally got to the fifth book of this epic fanfic and, well, wow. The last chapters of the fourth one were HARD to read. When Bellatrix cut off Harry's hand I almost stopped reading. I know it's not going to get much better in terms of darkness and gore, but I HAVE to know if Harry gets his hand back??


** I'm not going to comment on what may or may not happen but I will tell you this series is 100% worth reading even over a decade later. It has some dark moments (hell it had them by Book 3) but it stands the test of the time as a true classic. One of my favourite works. Stick with it, I promise it won't disappoint.

*** I'm definitely going to! The gore got a little much for me but I don't want to give up. Please tell me Harry gets his hand back though!?

**** he does, but it takes a while because he has to start thinking of himself as a person who deserves the time and resources it take to do so first

edited to cover spoilers

***** Thank you so much for telling me this, I don't know why this particular gory detail got to me so much, but thinking of Harry being SO young and deprived of his hand in such a barbaric way but not being able to get it back upset me a lot
