Preferably romance focused but I don't really mind


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] by DianeCastle. Muggle AU where Hogwarts is a school for James Bond style spies. Covers all seven years and is complete (and part of a series). The romance between Hermione and Ron is nicely foreshadowed. Follows canon loosely, with several departures.

  The Dursleys have had it out for him ever since he was dropped on their doorstep. But Harry has Hermione, and it isn't so bad. Until she suddenly leaves him and enrolls at Hawthorne Academy. Then, it suddenly is. AKA the non-magical high school AU that nobody asked for
