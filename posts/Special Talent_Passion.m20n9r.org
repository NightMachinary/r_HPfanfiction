Any fics with Harry being a prodigy in a subject as an integral part of the story? Like Harry with Runes in C'est La Vie or with Potions in the Rigel Black Chronicles

Harry is a Transfiguration prodigy (theres also a bonus of Drarry but I guess that's your opinion).

Harry has a talent in Dark Magic he does not join Voldie and it starts in fifth year, there is also a sequel to it but the sequels not completed yet.
