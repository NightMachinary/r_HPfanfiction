Basically title. Currently reading linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13143726?view_adult=true]]) and I've also read the self insert one with the Japanese girl, Mayumi I think her name is.

  Bellona de Poitiers begins her time at Hogwarts as an interloper for her French accent, for her Veela's blood, for the absence of her father.Hogwarts is not the haven she expected, though, and she quickly discovers that Slytherin is no true home to any interloper. With fewer friends than enemies, she does her best to keep her head down and muddle through safely.Then, just as she's about to return for third year, her father escapes from prison, and everything goes to hell.

** This one is a naruto/harry potter crossover so it doesn't start at Hogwarts right away, but the OC is not a native English speaker so there's some language barriers when she shows up.
