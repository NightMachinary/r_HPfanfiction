** I'm currently reading Forging The Sword by Myst Shadow. Wonderful WIP! If you want a fic in which Ron, Harry and Hermione have a good friendship and a genuine bond, this is the one you're looking for.

** I just finished reading linkffn(Exile by bennybear) and I quite enjoyed it. The premise is that after the war Draco finds that the wizarding world isn't as welcoming as it used to be. He goes into a sort of self exile for his own sanity and safety, and experiences muggle life with a lot of assumptions and zero preparation.

I expected it to be a sort of funny little jaunt into the silly Pureblood's mishaps in the muggle world, but I was instead treated to a well written introspective story about Draco's mentality, struggle, and just in general learning to be disconnected from the wizarding world.

I love the direction it goes in, the way it handles Pureblood bigotry, and I also appreciated the way that it made Narcissa a lot more culpable where Draco's shitty upbringing and attitude are concerned. Draco isn't the way he is because of only his father, his mother has a large hand in the sort of adult he grows into leading up to the war.

** I read a brand new fic that I think really deserves some major traction in the community called Subtle Acts of Sororicide by Frickles. There's currently only one chapter so I'm not going to get into the plot so much, but Gabrielle is the POV, and I can honestly say I've never read a fic like this before.

Usually in fan fiction people tend to idealize characters, present them as kind, intelligent, skilled, diligent, and so on and so forth, but this Gabrielle is bitter, depressed, unremarkable, jealous, and petty, and that's just in the first 3000 words! I know I'm maybe not doing the best job of selling it, but if you read as much fan fiction as I do you must also enjoy the occasional curve ball, so even if my description put you off, please consider reading the single extant chapter, and for the love of god if you like it leave a review! I need more of this in my life and I don't know any other way to get the author's attention off of their other work and onto this one.

linkffn(13821469)

Edit: I should mention that this single chapter was posted February 17th, and since then the author has published a few chapters in other works, so they are very much active. It seems like the perfect time to strike while the iron is hot in terms of author motivation. For what it's worth I sampled the first chapters of the authors other stories, and they all seem pretty good. Definitely seems like someone to watch.

** title: Making Their Own Heroes\\
rating: unrated\\
lonk: linkao3(Making Their Own Heroes)

This starts as the canon timeline without harry potter an interesting premise and well written to boot. The first and second years are complete but a third year has not yet been started which is a shame given the story is finally diverging from canon in a big way by that stage.

Of particular interest to me were some of the rewrites and expansions of canonical scenes that provide more plausible motivations for often nonsensical behavior.

Features a shifting 1st person perspective which is novel and used to good effect, avoids the common problem of interminable and largely irrelevant descriptions of characters thoughts.

A bit slow on occasion but never completely bereft of plot and conflict, the story tends to move on when things start to feel like a training montage.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23795218/chapters/57165265][aim and ignite]] (it's also on fanfiction.net) It's a Fem!Harry severitus, with the premise being that Lily didn't accept right away when James asked her to marry him, believing them both too young. Due to circumstances, she has a one night stand with Snape, who obliviates himself. This ends up getting her pregnant. Everything proceeds according to canon after that. Both Snape and Ariel (the kids name) find out in first year. Snape is not a happy camper. Everyone is in character, Snape is his typical asshole self, Dumbledore is hilarious and on point, Ron and Hermione are perfect. Ariel is enough like Harry that she doesn't feel brand new, but there are realistic difference due to the gender switch. It follows the stations of canon, but is trying to switch things up so that the story stays somewhat unpredictable. Prose is really good too. I recommend it to any Harry Potter fan.

** currently re-reading ‚Äúdon't you know you've got the best of me‚Äù by raquians on ao3

its one of my favourite fics of ALL TIME

it follows hermione in a universe in which she met and befriended fred and george on her very first day in hogwarts, with one chapter dedicated to each year of her life, from the first book to the seventh

it makes hermione an even more ingrained feature of the burrow, as well as exploring her relationship with ginny and krum, and even more minor characters like angelina and the rest of the quidditch team

i never had a young love but something about raquians' writing makes it so??? relatable??

great fic 10/10 if you like best friends to lovers with some healthy rivalry

** I just finished The Descent by SilverShroud. I had the luck of finding it when the author mentioned it in the other weekly post. I loved it! The story takes the line from Cursed Child about Cedric becoming a Death Eater and runs with it. In Cursed Child (believe me . . . I hated the book, too), you read that part and it makes absolutely no sense. Why would Cedric go Death Eater? Well, this story covers that and does it in this gradual, almost eerie way. It starts out in tone very similar to the books (i.e., more lighthearted) and goes dark. Cedric gets involved in bad situations - and often embraces them. Also, it's just around 62k so it's a nice, complete read. I still want more though.

** *Pandemic* I read the new chapters.

*Why I like it* I have no words at this point. It's quickly going up into my best fanfics ever list. Beautifully constructed, with a great balance of psychology and modern life loneliness in the backdrop of the pandemic. Characterizations, plots top notch. Writing is unusual and brilliant. Don't let the pairings put you off. This fic is definitely one of its kind. I almost want it to end incomplete because I am afraid what if the ending doesn't hit the high note this fic has so kept so far.

****** Valid worry when it comes to slash fanfics with those pairings! Hermione is a fanfic writer in Pandemic. Harry keeps telling her that her ideas about gay men are totally wrong. The fic has this running joke poking at how these pairings are usually written in fanfics when Harry reads them.

** Just read what is written of linkao3(Harry Potter And The Bucket List). An ongoing SI as Harry's-twin with some original ideas. Greyback and his wolves are given a sensible and sympathetic perspective. SI has an interesting backstory and the author has a record of completing SI fics. To summarize: Very original + Nice artwork.

Another interesting SI is linkao3(Cisme). Focus on Dursleys pre Hogwarts. Very introspective and philosophy heavy. Si not aware of magic. So far it is an interesting adult take on the Dursleys' neglect.

Yet another ao3 SI linkao3(Sincerely, The Stranger You Call Sister). Ongoing SI as Riddle Twin. Realistic and humorous OC. Extensive backstory for the SI is detailed. Almost immediate divergence once Hogwarts is reached. Focus on slice-of-life and dialogue

** I've been reading Vulnera Sanentur by Maria_de_Salinas on ao3. Rating: M.

It's a relatively new, complete, gen fic covering the first few years of Severus Snape's tenure as the Hogwarts Potions professor and the Head of Slytherin House. The story has two POVs: Snape's and Graihagh Corlett - a young Slytherin from a non-pureblood background. The characterisation of both main characters is excellent, the plot engaging and the quality of writing is top-notch. The mirroring between Snape's past and Graihagh's present is particularly well done. I don't typically like OCs, but Graihagh really fits into the Potterverse.

There's also a sequel which is currently posting. I plan to check it out once I've finished with Part One.

  At the age of twenty-one, Severus Snape is about to become one of the youngest professors ever taken on at Hogwarts, a position he takes with some reluctance. When the Wizarding War ends with the death of the Potters, he must somehow manage to teach moronic teenagers all day while dealing with his grief. A troublemaker and lacklustre student at her primary school in the Isle of Man, Graihagh Corlett starts Hogwarts just as the war ends, determined to make a new start. When she discovers a passion for making potions, she'll use them to help her quiet, troubled friend-and make the acquaintance of a budding Death Eater.All Snape wanted was to hole up in his office for the next ten years. Now he'll be faced with challenges he never could have expected.Alternating POV. Fits with canon, but tweaks it. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13832899/1/HPG-Book-1/]]

One of few OC Mc stories I could find. Please suggest more if you have.

What I really liked was author is spending time to build the character relationships, and also he isn't simply making MC too OP immediately. It seems a bit natural, and it is one of the best big-brother fics I have read. Also important to note is that Dumbledore is good, so it has none of the extreme and cheesy bashing yet.

** I'm in the middle of linkffn(The Twisted Path by Xetarma). A complete 7-year Harry and Hermione in Slytherin story, it's kinda weird in that it combines the Harry/Hermione meet and are inseparable immediately with being in Slytherin, but I'm enjoying it for the most part. There are people pulling strings and at this point I'm not sure who they are, which is a nice change from the extreme bashing that I see in a lot of these fics.

A SI-fic that features an MC who only wants to study Magic and a a very well thought out magic system.

** I'm not a hero by JustBored21 (Rated M)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13251826/0]]

This is definitely the best fanfiction I have read. I guarantee that you will love this story even if you don't like Harry/Daphne or wbwl. I'm not good at explaining things so I copy and pasted some dialogue from the first chapter.

"How dare you?!" Malfoy exclaimed "I am the heir to the Malfoy family"

"Well, I congratulate you for being born" Harry said dryly "though I must say I pity your father, he must have it bad when his son's only form of accomplishment is existing" A few of the Slytherin's laughed at this. "If I met him then I would probably also extend how sorry I am regarding his inability to have more kids"

"My father can have more children if he wanted!"

"And he stopped at you?" Harry raised an eyebrow "hmm, in that case I can assume he decided to stop at one disappointment" Malfoy turned red as many of the Slytherin's began laughing.

"You'll pay for this Potter!" Malfoy growled

"I was unaware that Malfoys had financial problems, such a shame when money is the only reason your family is important. Never mind, if you ask nicely then I will give you a galleon. If you're on your knees when you ask then I will give you two" Daphne was using all of her control to not laugh at Harry's comments, Tracy found them so funny that she placed a hand over her mouth to stop herself from laughing.

*** As much as I like that portion of the first chapter, it is just not for me. The witty putdowns get tiring if there's at least three of them in just two chapters.

It has edgy Harry (Hadrian but call me Harry) in the first two chapters. Signs of Ron and Hermione bashing, and unreasonably manipulative Dumbledore.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3577793/1/You-Know-Who]]) Hermione x Voldemort. One of the few fictions I've read that makes this relationship plausible (if you ignore the opening) and Voldemort slightly sympathetic but still a monster.

  What would you do if you woke up with no memory of who you were, looking like a monster, stuck in a room with a giant snake? Lord Voldemort is in exactly that situation when a spell delivers him into the hands of Hermione Granger. LV/HG set during DH.

** im currently reading Accidentally Dating Cedric by dedricdigory.

its an ongoing fic but its honestly worth the waiting! in most fics cedric is usually portrayed as this shy and overly perfect boy but that is definitely not the case in this story. it really breaks away from the hufflepuff stereotype and gives an edge to his character. another reason why i adore the fic is because i deeply relate w the mc and the author, purely coincidentally, includes little characteristics or details that represent me irl.

it has 61 parts so far and each part is quite lengthy. its a slow burn but trust me its worth it. highly recommend ü§ç
