:END:
Hi! So, all I remember is this:

1. It may or may not have been slash.
2. Harry traveled to the marauders' era and, I believe, became a teacher for DADA?
3. There was a scene where he sorted his class by color categories based on their skills/magic and then put them into groups.
4. Then another where the class was being taught outside and I think they had gone into the Forbidden Forest and each group were competing to see who reached the middle of the forest first and then Lily Evans split from her group, thinking she knew better than they did, and her group lost. Lily had a lot of attitude in the story.

I would be so grateful if someone could help me find this fic. I had it downloaded on a fanfiction app earlier this year, but then I deleted the app by mistake. It was one of my favorite fics and since it has been a while since I've read it, I can't remember the name or the author. Please help!


** I think it was [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/938091/chapters/1827485]] ? In it Harry is a Peverell and ends up with Orion black if i remember
