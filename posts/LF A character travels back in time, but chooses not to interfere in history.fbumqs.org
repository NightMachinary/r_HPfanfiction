We have countless fix-it stories where someone travels back in time and then uses knowledge of the future to prevent deaths, fall from grace, whatever.

Any story where someone accidentally is thrown back in time, but realises the inherent danger of meddling with time. And instead chooses to sideline and simply ride it out. Perhaps attend a different school, not go to school at all, memory wipe?

Please no bashing/huge age difference/mpreg


** linkffn(Eternal Return) is based around this, oneshot though.

*** I don't think this concept lends itself well to anything more than a one shot tbh. You're retelling canon with no changes but for the internal monologue of the time traveler? Not really my cup of tea.

** This is giving the plot away but in linkffn(Pride of Time) Hermione the time traveler takes care not to mess with canon events that she was specifically part of. However, that doesn't mean she isn't working behind the scenes...

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

** In linkffn(time to spare by emysabath) Harry doesn't change history - he becomes a part of it. He's actually so afraid of unconsciously changing it that, even being sorted into Gryffindor and sharing a dorm with the Marauders, he does everything to not befriend them.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said as he stalked closer. “is you.” He backed Harry up until the cool wall of the common room was brushing against him. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely amused. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro is a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer. “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.
