This is a very small part in this fic that I remember because someone posted an excerpt about this long ago. I mostly want the excerpt myself.

Basically Snape is bitching about the Marauders, how they were favored, how they had everything and Dumbledore counters by saying that James died young protecting his family, Sirius spent more than a decade in Azkaban for crimes he didn't commit, Peter betrayed his own friends and spent over a decade as a rat and Remus lost all his friends and is reviled by all society for something that happened to him as a kid. Meanwhile Snape has a cushy job in Hogwarts while thinking the Marauders had a better life.


** I think that's from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6654621/1/Beside-Me-Always][Beside Me... Always]] linkffn(6654621), in chapter 33.

  Harry proudly accepted the title of 'Dumbledore's man through and through' but how little does he, do we realize that Dumbledore was 'Harry's man through and through? Their years together, now through Albus's eyes, see the bond that these two share.
