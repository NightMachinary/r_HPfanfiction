Would appreciate any responses and if you select 'other' could you please say what you mean in the comments here!

Thank you all in advance :)


** I prefer posting regularly after a fic is completed.

I tend to rush large fics in order to 'get to the best parts' or because I have a limited amount of time and want to read as much as possible.

Having a reliable schedule makes me slow down and think about what the author has posted.

I also feel like more people will see your fic. If you post it all at once, it will disappear into the abyss of stories. Having a constant update rate will bring it to the front page, allowing more people a chance to read it.

** I really prefer reading completed stories, so having to come back to a story each time it updates really takes me out of the action and lessens my enjoyment. Of course, do what feels natural to you!

*** That was already the one I was thinking about doing because it's what I would prefer, I was just going to check with the community too.

** I would say complete the story and then post a couple chapters for review or even get a beta and then post the whole thing if your into doing that, however I prefer a story regular updated keeps me excited for the next chapter!

*** Honestly, I'm just building a massive story that I want to tell. I understand I may not be the best writer but I'm going to put a lot of effort in and take all constructive criticism I get and try to learn as I go.

***** Absolutely will! Still making sure I have the long term plot plan sorted first. I have written my prologue for some concept testing and for writing quality checks. Once I have the plotline for all 7 stories sorted out I'll begin properly writing it up.

** You get more readers by uploading new chapters on a schedule. If that doesn't matter to you, as a reader I prefer to read it all at once of course.

*** Thanks and duly noted. I think I will be uploading on a schedule after I'm finished with each iteration.
