I've noticed that a lot of fics that have like Snape taking Harry in or having others save him feature spanking in a "this isn't abuse like the Dursleys this is discipline" kind of way, which makes me super uncomfortable. Do ppl have any fics to recommend that have that kind of family-building and adoption theme without the spanking? Thanks so much!

  A story of how Harry growing up as Tony's brother might have changed things in both worlds. Told non-chronologicaly. But don't worry: the order makes sense. At least in my head. Now with the option of reading chronologicaly.

** This. No spanking, and preferably no fics where teenage Harry is being tucked in every night, read to, and helped dressed. Fics like that super give me the creeps, because 15 year olds generally should be more independent than my 7 yr old niece, not less.

*** I think for me some of that can be nice to read at least for the first part of him recovering away from the Dursleys? just because a lot of abuse, esp the kind harry went through where he was expected to grow up really fast, can lead to people later longing for those things in childhood they never got to properly experience or reparenting themselves through those comforts.

** I like the fact that in most of today's world, you can't hit *anyone* without facing consequences. In school you'll probably get in a shitload of trouble. If you're an adult you will almost certainly be hit back, can be sued for damages and in more serious cases, thrown in jail and convicted of battery.

** Linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7) has Sirius escaping early and liberating an 8 year old Harry from the dursleys. It's a solid fic, but very long. The sequels cover Harry's time at Hogwarts. We're currently at the beginning of the GOF arc.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** That sort of happens in Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). Ironically Snape does take him away, but he is essentially taken to WYRA, a magical orphanage for muggleborns to be placed in until adopted or otherwise. Now, later in the fic Snape does actually cane Harry several times, though its more of a teacher punishing someone at Hogwarts than anything else. To be completely fair to Snape, Harry literally never learns to think before he acts in this fic, and that continually makes his life horrible. Harry's such a nice guy here, but this conversation sort of points out what he is like:

Voldemort: "You have no sense of self-preservation at all, do you?"

Harry: "No. It ran away with your guilty conscience and we haven't seen either of them since."

Edit: I was not supporting the punishment of Harry, I was just making a point that its not really a guardian abusing a child so much as the old style of Hogwarts punishment (hang them by their thumbs in the dungeon esque). On several occasions crucios are handed out, but mostly by Voldemort and you kind of expect that from him (it would be weird if he didn't...).

**** It happens several times, but the only two I can remember are after the Chamber of Secrets incident and the 1st task of the triwizard tournament. I do remember that not long after Snape more or less stops because he admits there is no point as Harry will literally never learn to stop recklessly risking his life (which is actually an accurate statement too).

I honestly only remember it because the Snape/harry interaction and story is almost unique in the whole fandom.
