#+TITLE: When the Statute of Secrecy was irrevocably broken, the common thought among the Wizarding World was that world-ending conflict with the Muggles was inevitable. Turns out they were completely wrong.

Apart from the very rare instance of a religious fanatic calling for the death of all the 'devil-worshippers' and then being promptly arrested on charges of domestic terrorism, the overwhelming attitude among the non-magical people is "Hey, wizards are real. Neat.".


** I can imagine a wizard and muggle semi-arguing over how useful magic is.

“If you want Chinese food we can portkey or floo over to a restaurant in the actual country, within the hour!”

“But I can order it off my phone and it'll be here in half an hour. And I don't even have to put on pants.”

** The biggest surprise for the magical community was the general apathy about not having magic most muggles possessed.\\
Once the average muggle is told that having magic means giving up access to advanced technology, they tend to decide that magic is best left to the mages while they will happily stick with their smart phones

** They might be surprised by all of the crackpot conspiracy theorists trying to either use magic to prove various theories or accuse the wizarding world of being behind them. You think the world is round? Wizards made you think that.

Not to mention all the deniers who will stand there, watch a witch turn a pebble into a needle or something, and insist that magic is fake.

Personally, I think a lot of people would see the wizarding world as a little backwards and quaint. I mean, all that magic and the closest thing they have to the internet seems to be the wizarding wireless? Forget the fact that they send each other letters by owl, they still send each other /letters/? That's adorable.

*** I'm rather certain that the British/American Civilian Governments (Which are already aware of Wizards) would be rather upset if their militaries went rogue and kidnapped and enslaved large numbers of their own populace in such a public manner right after the Statute fell and everyone was scrutinizing what was happening to the Wizards.

Would they make use of Wizards? Most definitely. Instantly gulag all of them? Probably not in Britain, at least not without a delay.
