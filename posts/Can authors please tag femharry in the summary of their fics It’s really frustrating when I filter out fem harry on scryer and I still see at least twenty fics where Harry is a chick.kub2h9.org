** Ao3 should have an option of reader added tags that you can choose to sort by as well, for writers who don't properly tag or even include something that other people really like and want to draw attention to.

** Can authors just properly tag in general? You know marking a fic as slash if it has it, marking it as het if it is? I don't think that's asking much honestly.

*** Man I feel that one. Ao3 has a very robust tagging system, but the way people use it... If you want any specific category of fic, you have to untag a dozen others and then scroll past all the compilation fics that use every tag under the sun.

On Ao3 some fics have more tags than summary, that's always the point where I say nop iam out her.
