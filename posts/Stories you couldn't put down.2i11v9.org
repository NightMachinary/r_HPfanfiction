What are the stories so completely awesome you couldn't make yourself stop reading? For me it was Emperor, The Prince That Was Promised, and A Butterfly Effect.


** The Dangerverse Series. Thank god I started it at the beginning of the summer because I was literally reading it in all of my free time through the first week or two of school

***** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger][This]] seems to be the first part of the dangerverse series.

I'll have to give it a try myself, so thanks for the rec!

** Can you link any of these stories? or at least provide where you found them. Personally I loved [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/30/Stages-of-Hope]] to the point that I was almost to tears.

*** I believe OP was referring to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince that was Promised]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A-Butterfly-Effect][A Butterfly Effect]]. Out of the three I've only read Butterfly Effect but it was pretty good from what I recall.

**** A Butterfly Effect was an enjoyable fic, not a good one. There's no way you can call a fic with 11 and 12 year olds doing you know what and Malfoy + you know who (no, not Voldemort) do what and all that nonsense be a "good" story. I understand that it's all personal preference, but there has to be a threshold, you know?

I only enjoyed it because of its semi-plausible larger than life portrayal of characters. The actual story and fillers lead to a questionable path, although the actual main plot seems promising if executed right.

Too bad we'll never know.

*** Are his stories To Fight the Coming Darkness, Bungle in the Jungle, and its sequel worth reading? I tried Bungle once but it looked so disgustingly bashy I didn't get far in.

**** I haven't read To Fight the Coming Darkness, but I have read Bungle in the Jungle and its sequel, Turn me Loose.

Bungle starts off incredibly bashy, so much so that I can't tell if it's a parody of bashing, or if he just didn't know better at the time of writing the earliest chapters. Bungle is his second story to be published on fanfiction.net. But after Harry gets away and starts doing his own thing, the bashing takes a back seat and the story really takes off. I think the hardest thing about reading it for me wasn't the bashing, because it's pretty much only in the first 2-3 chapters, but the fact that it's written in second person. But after reading it for a while, you get used to the weird perspective and can just enjoy the epic story.

But jben's best fic, hands down, is The Lie I've Lived. Everyone is still waiting for its sequel all these years later, but that doesn't make the story itself any worse. You defiantly don't want to pass this one up.

Now completely off the topic of jbern, because this is a recommendation thread and no one has mentioned it yet, I have to give the obligatory Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality rec. There's a reason this is the number one reviewed Harry Potter fanfic. It's defiantly one of the best stories I've ever read, fanfic or otherwise. It's not completed yet, but the author gives updates the first of every month, so there's actually a status report [[http://hpmor.com/notes/progress-14-10-01/][today]]. He anticipates publishing the final arc of the story soon after 2014's end, so if you want to wait until it's a complete story that's fine.

***** Opinions are mixed on /MoR/, to be honest. In my case, I find I just can't enjoy the story because I find the author to be a self-aggrandizing twat (much like I can't enjoy anything by Perfect Lionheart or Joe Hundredaire). Perhaps it's unfair, but this decreases any enjoyment I might get from his fiction.

jbern's /To Fight the Coming Darkness/ and /Bungle in the Jungle/ are very creative stories--this is Jim's forte as a writer--though he was just starting out as a writer at the time he penned them and some of his execution is pretty weak (particularly the opening chapters of both stories, started around the same time), and he employs many of the Indy!Harry tropes from that period (love potions, Weasley/Dumbledore bashing, etc.).

** The first fic I really got attached to was Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, which really dragged me into the HP fanfic world. Then I started [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3963147/1/Once-in-a-Blue-Moon-COMPLETE][Once in a Blue Moon]](Siruis/Remus), leading into the *massive* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]](Slytherin!Harry & Powerful!Harry & Harry/Draco).

Those are just some of the larger fics that I've read, but inbetween there's always been some smaller (<100k) fics that held my attention for a few hours. I would seriously recommend flicking through this subreddit and maybe searching for whatever it is that you're interested in.

*** I'm surprised you managed to finish Once in a Blue Moon. That fic is pretty subpar, with the forced drama, heavy OOC and poor characterization.

DAYD though. Looking back, it was pretty average and had issues, but damn that fic is as hard to put down as the original series

**** Oh, for sure.. it wasn't very good. But I got hooked and that was that, couldn't stop even if I wanted to. Same for DAYD but if you look past the minor issues it could very easily be from the original series itself.

***** It started ok-ish, and the concept was pretty original as far as fanfic goes. But by the time the gay denial started, it was really hard to force down. Slash+fiction or not, that kind of relationship is incredibly unrealistic. If I wasn't so obsessive compulsive about finishing a story I started, I'd have dropped it ages ago. And that Deus ex machina ending.

DAYD's biggest problem is the author's blatant ignorance of canon, and the forced violence/body count. Snape got vilified pretty hard though with the random torturer OC

** Long ago (over ten years ago now), when I first got into HP fanfiction, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/176562/Cygnus-Crux][Cygnus Crux]]'s /Existence After Life/ series was one of the first great epics I read. About 700k words and penned shortly after GoF came out, it was incredibly creative for the time. Because the heyday of HP fanfiction came in the long delay between OOtP and HBP, this series isn't read or recommended much anymore, but it was one of the most influential stories of its time. In my mind, no story has quite measured up to the sort of wonder that I felt reading that series. (I think I read all four stories in one sitting while babysitting a sick infant back in the day.)

Outside the Harry Potter fandom, I'd suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1584073/blank101][blank101]]'s /Son of Sons/ trilogy, arguably the best fanfiction epic ever penned. It's a Star Wars AU that picks up after the events of /The Empire Strikes Back/ with Luke and company captured and Luck brought before the Emperor, who proceeds to break his mind, turning him against his father and into a Sith. It's brilliantly written and was impossible for me to put down.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1767419/3/A-Love-for-All-Time][A Love for all time]] was one of my fav stories back in the day. It's about 30 or so chapters but a quick read.

Its been a while since reading anything in the HP universe, but that's one of the only fics I've read that I still remember the author/story name!
