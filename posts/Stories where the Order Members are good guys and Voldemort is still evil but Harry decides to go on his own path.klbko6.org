So many stories have it be where Dumbledore, the Order, and Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune (Which is poor writing).

I also don't get Order Members who don't kill. It was Remus Lupin that told Harry stunning bad guys were a thing of the past.

Maybe he doesn't like how Dumbledore does things, and definitely hates Voldemort for what he's done, so decides to make his own way.

Maybe other students decide to join him or other order members, or whatever.

Not looking for super OP Harry. Harry smarter or more powerful than in canon is fine, but I don't want him to be the next Dumbledore.

Not looking for pairings, but if there is: Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine
