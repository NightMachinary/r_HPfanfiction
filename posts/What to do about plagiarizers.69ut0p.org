I've found a plagiarizing author, is there anywhere to report them to? I've PMed them telling them to stop and also PMed the original authors.


** Sadly there is no legal recourse regarding plagiarising fanfiction as a court has ruled the right to remedy remains with the rights holder - the author of the original work, their estate, or publisher usually.

Therefore your only recourse is that (perhaps) plagiarism is against ToS or site policy and the site admins/moderators may be persuaded to act. I would think however the author being plagiarised would need to be the complainant, and obviously be able to prove the work was their own.

** FFN is really slow about removing stolen stories, since they seem to be extremely understaffed. And even when they do deal with it, the offender usually just reuploads them with a different account a few days later.

** Depends on where they're posting: most sites have rules about this, though the nature of the rules and enforcement thereof varies.

** As others said, not much to do besides report them to the site administrators... One cool thing you could do is promote the original author's story on here, throw the OG some love.
