It's been a while since I read this, but it definitely has a more human, less unhinged Voldemort who was quite interesting. I don't think he precisely fits the “distinguished older man” role though. The story is labeled Harry/Tom Riddle, but I've read most of it (it's still being updated and is at 400k words) and it doesn't have a romantic relationship yet. If it will at all, I'm not sure.

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** Linkffn (Dreams and Darkness Collide) and Linkffn (Death of Today) both have Tom Riddle as a main character and in both fics he looks human and is Charismatic. The fics are slash but both are pretty entertaining. With dreams and darkness including a serial killer (Almost dexter like) Harry who's traumatized and a very powerful empath and a Tom Riddle who's the minister of magic. Death of today consists of a Harry's who's in Ravenclaw and working (interning would be a better word) for the Unspeakables and Tom Riddle is senior undersecretary.

This is my first time using the link bot so I hope I got it right.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous Boy-Who-Lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
