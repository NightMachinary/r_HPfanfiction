Any good fics that fall into the horror genre? I'm looking for anything creepy/haunting/scary.

Thanks in advance!

** I guess that That Which Holds The Image sorta counts in this category. It's a Doctor Who crossover but you don't need to know anything about the universe to understand it other than a couple of references you might miss.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

*** That was exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for. The Angels themselves are pretty damn unnerving. Despite not knowing anything about Doctor Who, I still found it pretty enjoyable.

I might be keeping a close eye on any statues I see for a while.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
