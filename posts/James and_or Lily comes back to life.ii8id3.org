** Not really "come back to life," but unable to be around, certainly.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The_Substitute][The Substitute]] by BajaB. The Potters had plans. Dumbledore's actions interfered with them. Complete, and I liked it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10427729/1/Blank-Slate][Blank Slate]] by tresmaraudeurs. James and Lily were obliviated and sent to live as muggles. Slow starting, but seems to be getting good.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1350670/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dream-Come-True][Harry Potter and the Dream Come True]] by grand admiral chelli. Voldemort sent James into Hell. He's accidentally released. I didn't care for this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12824074/1/Away-and-Back][Away and Back]] by Teddylonglong. Harry leaves with Sirius on Buckbeak. They "pull" James and Lily forward in time. I didn't care for it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10382653/1/][Blood Binding]] by SphinxScribe. The blood magic in the graveyard brings James and Lily back. I haven't read this one yet, so I can't say anything about it.

**** No problem. Everyone has different tastes. I just stopped 3 chapters into a 39-chapter story with 4k+ faves and 4k+ follows because I can't stand it. Sometimes, I don't make it past half the first chapter.
