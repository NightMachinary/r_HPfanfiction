Recently read The Second String by Eider_Down in a day, LOVED the characterization of everyone and the writing was, imho, fantastic. Can't wait for the final chapters.

In addition, Face Death in the Hope by LullabyKnell is incredible and carries a similar premise. Writing is great, fleshed out characters, hits all the trope sweet spots and does it well.

Would love to find more Fics like these two, as I wait for them to update! Preferably on AO3, preferably still active if not completed.

Thanks!!

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** I've only read Face Death in the Hope (and you can be sure I'll start reading the other one right about now, if it's as good as the first). I'm not sure exactly what the fics have in common, but if you want well-written time travel with a good characterization then I can think of\\
linkao3(In the Bleak Midwinter by TheLoud)

And although the style might be different, I wrote a story about unusual time travel that maybe would fall into what you're looking for? (self-rec) linkao3(Unfogging the Future by Naidhe)

Then maybe you'd enjoy linkao3(If Them's the Rules by MayMarlow) and other stories by the same author

*** Hopefully, The Second String lives up to your taste!

Thank you so much for the recommendations! I finished Unfogging the Future and LOVED it. Lavender Fics that are well written are hard to come by but you nailed it. Any chances on that sequel from Tom's view?!?

I'll check out the others, thank you!!!

**** I'm really enjoying it so far! It's very original!

I'm glad you liked Unfogging the Future too. Thanks a lot! I'm working on plotting the sequel right now :)

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.
