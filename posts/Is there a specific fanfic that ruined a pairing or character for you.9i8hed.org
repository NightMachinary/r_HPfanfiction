I'm not asking about bashing or anything. More like, a fanfic that portrays a character or pairing in such a horrible light that you're wary of reading another fic with them in it. Like, did you love them beforehand, but maybe the author puts in something that changes how you thought of the character. My case is pretty different, honestly. The first and only Bellatrix/Hermione fic I read had a seriously dysfunctional relationship. I know this is essentially the only way to get them together without time travel, but it still annoys me. It's very well written, but the whole relationship just put me off.

Bellatrix keeps Hermione locked in a cell and tortures her pretty much every day. Then Rodolphus nearly rapes Hermione, but Bellatrix saves her. Apparently, there was some soul bond thing going on that effectively made the two increasingly care for each other. Hermione gets Stockholm Syndrome like a good torture victim and Bellatrix lets her leave, and later turns on Voldemort for Hermione. Bear in mind, this was years ago so I'm probably forgetting some major plot points. A lot of other stuff happens, but this is how the relationship starts out. The one part I like was the fact that Bellatrix didn't become this paragon of virtue after turning on Voldemort. She still thinks muggle burns are dirt, and that Hermione is the one exception.

From my perspective, the magic essentially forced them into loving each other, despite them hating the other person. I might have missed something, but I finished it and never touched a Bellatrix/Hermione fic again. It just didn't make any sense to me. A torture victim falling in love with her torturer because magic is just... weird. I know there are good fics out there with this pairing, and this is nowhere the worst one but that one fic just put me off. I just can't handle torture or rape in fics, and Hermione falling in love with Bellatrix after all that crap just pissed me off.

Anyways, is there anything like this for you guys, or am I just being a baby? You don't have to go into the same amount of detail I did, because I just rambled and went on a rant.


** I have seen a number of 'forced marriage / soul bond' fics and they're all a little gross, except for that one where Hermione , as soon as she learns there is such a thing as forced marriage, leads a huge campaign against legalized rape. Having SAID that, I actually don't mind the "a little gross" in fantasy. I am all for weird smut and experimental pairings. BUT, I can't see a Bellatrix and Hermione romance without torture. Or any Bellatrix fic without some degree of non-consentual and / or sadism. You'd have to go pretty far AU to mix that one up.

Hermione and Harry do the sensible thing and leave the country as soon as the (clearly Death Eater-sponsored) law is announced and work to bring down the law and Voldemort from the outside.

BDSM is hot. Usually though in these situations the stories almost always devolve into abuse and informed consent is difficult to obtain. I don't know if a BDSM relationship is very viable for two people who have a real-life relationship revolving around the power dynamic of master&slave. The dom would first have to set the sub free (and not just pretend-free), I think that's rarely achieved. Can you enter a consensual BDSM relationship with a dangerous sadist that doesn't allow you to refuse or who might get violently angry and threaten your life and that of your friends? One might decide that it's better to keep him/her calm...?

I think framing it as BDSM is often just a trick to make it more agreeable... there's a certain subset of tumblr feminists who scoff at anything dubious consent, but as soon as you spray some magic BDSM pixie dust on it, it's okay, no matter whether it is horribly abusive and/or (borderline) non-consensual. Semantics. As long as someone is dominating and someone else is submitting it's BDSM, or isn't it? Maybe not.

***** To be honest BDSM fics where the power dynamics outside of sex mirror those during sex have a tendency to make me pretty uncomfortable, even if they do establish clear consent.

There are a couple of BDSM fics which I really enjoy, but pretty much all of them revolve around snarky power couples or even a dynamic where the usually dominant partner ends up being the sub during sex.

I've never understood the appeal of that aspect of Bellatrix. Attractive older women kicking arse? Sign me up. But the appeal of Bellamione, for me, [[http://i.imgur.com/h5LYA8T.jpg][can be summerised in this picture]], not in sadism and Stockholm syndrome. Her psychopathic tendencies are an issue, not a selling point.

**** I think the people who write and read Bellamione are interested because of the problematic nature of the relationship, just like how people who write Voldemort/Harry do the same. If you wanted an arse-kicking attractive older woman, you could get that from more than a few characters in the series. You could use Amelia Bones, or use either of Bellatrix's sisters. They would require some amount of OOCness for a pairing to work with Hermione, but that's a given, and it wouldn't require nearly as much as Bellatrix/Hermione, since Bellatrix is pretty much the magic gestapo. The major reason IMO that people write Bellatrix/Hermione is because it's a taboo sadomasochistic sexual fantasy about an evil temptress corrupting the girl next door.

You'd be surprised how well adjusted SS members could be after the war. My father told me of working with a few in the 70s, who proudly displayed their tattoos but were otherwise normal coworkers with no sadistic tendencies.

Yeah, that's how it should be. I have no idea, why OP complains about "Impossible" so much, because that's exactly how those things play out in that fic and how they would probably happen. The fact that Bellatrix is a sadist and tortured Hermione isn't portrayed as something hot and kinky, it's messed up... and Hermione isn't at all excited about being soul bonded to a sadistic, unrepentant, non-misunderstood Death Eater. Bellatrix only turns on Voldemort, because Hermione gives her an ultimatum in that fic, not because Bella got cleansed by the power of tru luv.

If you want Hermione and Bellatrix to work out, the torture scene must not happen. After that, Hermione couldn't even stand thinking about her, much less want to ravage her.

That being said, I definitely see Bellatrix as the bottom in their relationship.

****** Yeah, there are characters we don't really know a lot about, like Daphne Greengrass, who is literally just a name and a house (disregarding the outside writings, which I think are super interesting), or Sally-Anne Perks, who disappeared into oblivion after being sorted. But Padma though... we can still determine what Padma is probably like, even though she only has a few lines.

1. She accepted going to the Yule ball with Ron at the suggestion of her sister, even though they had never spoken before. This suggests that she is either a chill person, desperate, or really trusts her sister.

2. When they meet, she looks at Ron's dress robes in distaste. She is possibly thinking some combination of, "Why do I get the date with frayed robes?" and "Parvati, what did you get me into?" Possibly has high standards. Or normal ones- it /is/ reasonable to expect a date with normal looking robes that would dance with you.

3. She is most likely not an overly private person. She talked about how Ron ignored her at the Yule ball in front of her Ravenclaw housemates, enough so that even Luna Lovegood, the social outcast, knew about it.

4. She is a prefect, so she is probably studious, well-behaved, and is well-liked amongst most, if not all, the teachers.

5. She is a member of Dumbledore's Army, so probably not a Voldemort supporter.

6. Her parents pulled her and Parvati out of school when Dumbledore died. They may have been helicopter parents, though to be fair Dumbledore getting killed is kind of a big deal. They are at least somewhat involved in their daughters' lives and aware of the danger of Voldemort and his followers.

7. Yet Parvati and Padma both attend Hogwarts during their 7th year, so either the parents decided Hogwarts was safer than their home, or their daughters had to argue to return.

Anyway, there is plenty to go off of here that would make some characterizations seem off. A rebellious, snarky, Death Eater sympathizer Padma wouldn't ring true.

Especially Ron/Hermione suffers from the last issue if included as background pairing. Ron would have needed to grow up a lot for their relationship to work, but that is never shown.

Hell, I would go as far as to say that Ron/Hermione is an impossibility after their Hogwarts experience. If they meet as adults? Sure. But after five years of belittling and fights?

Also, your vision of Harry's character is incredibly one-dimensional. Do you really think he'd even WANT to kick ass after Voldemort? This is a kid who wanted a family more than anything, and he finally gets to have one. Yes, he does enjoy dragging a random Death Eater into the light --- but only as long as he gets to go back home at the end of the day. Working for the Ministry --- that is run either by his mentor or his second best friend --- is a perfect solution.

Sweet merciful Buddha, that's a lot to unpack... Maybe instead of blaming her for something she "should have done", Harry'd appreciate her something she did?

She gave him a home, gave him a family and made sure he didn't feel forgotten. At this point already, she did far more than any other adult in his life. As for being concerned --- she probably went to Albus and we all know how that one ends.

And Sirius WAS deranged. Any psychiatrist will tell you that a person that spent a decade in those conditions is not fit to take care of anyone. Or even interact with anyone, most of all children. Molly is not right to push him around, but she does have a point.

Also, most decent H/G stories I know do not focus on Molly at all. She has less that a page of screentime in Strangers in Drakeshaugh and is barely even mentioned in Aurors. Other Weasleys do appear in both stories.

At Malfoy Manor, actively refused to identify what was obviously Harry. Accessory to torture, as he stood and watched Hermione's torture.

Battle of Hogwarts: if you go by the books, Crabbe and Goyle do all the active chasing thru the RoR. Draco keeps telling them not to kill them. Afterwards, we just see him trying to get back to his family by telling a DE ‚ÄúI'm on your side!‚Äù After that, he literally disappears.

** I forget the name of it, but basically No Voldemort, Harry is raised by his parents who have a couple of other kids, mostly girls. Harry is sort of like James, popular, smart, joker and he is rather kind and helpful to others. And like James he has a crush on the smartest girl in class aka Hermione who is friends with his slightly younger sister.

Harry basically is a good person but Hermione won't give him the time of day because 'James and Lily repeat' also because Harry's horrible sister for a unexplained reason doesn't want them together, or her brother happy at all. Eventually they get together and married and Hermione ends up pregnant only for her to yell and boss Harry around who was being rather attentive and caring just for the laugh and her 'whipping him into shape'

In the end it just soured Harry and Hermione for a very long time, and while I am still a fan of Hermione, it also soured me on Lily as she is depicted in Fanon, the perfect goddess who has to control her Demon of a husband.

** I think cleoteo is a good writer- I will always admire the ones who are able to write long fics, updating them as frequent as possible, with reasonable sized chapters- but the whole approach - Death Eaters as simply a political party; Hermione as a pure blood; Malfoys portrayed as reasonable people- is a bit too much.

I understand A.U, but this is not an alternate universe, as a completly different universe; the characters only share their names with their book counterparts.

So, yes, I have never been much conviced about Dramione, but those fics are not believable at all. I do understand pairing Hermione with Draco, if we are talking about him regretting his actions, owning his guilt and redeeming himself...therefore. IMO, it is a bit frustrating that most authors of this ship prefer to simply make a complete inversion of heroes and villains in order to sell Dramione.

  Sequel to Goddess of Vengeance. With her vengeance achieved and her enemies brought to their knees, Hermione is looking forward to her future with Draco. But between a surprising figure from the past returning and her old friends unable to leave recent events alone, it's going to be quite a while before Hermione can get her desired peaceful future. Dark Hermione!

  Hermione thanks Malfoy for the stories that weren't. An angsty little canon-compliant fic that came to me while I was musing over particle physics.

** Not a pairing, but I am currently reading "The Birthday Present" by excessivelyperky and while it is an amazing work of art, I will not be able to read something with Molly Weasley in it for a very long time. Holy shit, she is SO annoying in this. The fic tries to picture her as good and nice and just, but she comes off as stupid as a fuckin rock and nothing annoys me more. She is the reason I am putting off the last chapters of this otherwise awesone fic.

** As I tried to keep an open mind while reading fanfiction, I've stumbled upon a Harry/Lucius fic once. It made me run away from this pairing forever. I don't remember the title and I've read only the first two chapters, but it was a twisted BDSM fic where Lucius wanted to be called Zeus or Adonis or something and Harry was kind of a prisoner/bride/whore to the Malfoys. It was truly disturbing. I cannot read a fic with Lucius and Harry as main characters now (because yes, it wasn't explicitly told in summary and description that they were a pairing. Just main characters).
