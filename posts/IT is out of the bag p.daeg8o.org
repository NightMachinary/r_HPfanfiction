I have seen oh many a fanfic where Harry is sent back in time, most specifically to his first year and the old hat apparently is bound somehow to not speak of a students secrets...

â€‹

Yeah, I don't want any of that. Please recommend me stories where Dimensional/Time travel Harry Potter has his/her secret 'out of the bag' during the sorting. Or at the very least partially.

The Trouble With Sorting Hats. [[/u/Shadowclonier][u/Shadowclonier]] recommended it when I did my silly skit on Harry not wanting to do yet another time travel fic, [[https://redd.it/d7ans1][earlier this week]].

  A mild send-up on a popular genre of Harry Potter fanfiction. As much as I enjoy them, some practical considerations come to mind. Inevitably, Harry has one specific ally in all those fics ... but what if that entity took a different view on things?
