I really adore Neville's character and would love to see him in a fic. Oneshots, full-length fics, and anything in between are fine by me!

  The sun rises over Hogwarts' broken walls. They've won, but the work has only just begun. After spending most of his teen years fighting a war, Neville Longbottom is suddenly thrust into the world of work, responsibility and love. This story is set in the Raindrops on Roses Universe (prereading optional!) and fills in the gaps of how Neville grew into the man who appears in that story.
