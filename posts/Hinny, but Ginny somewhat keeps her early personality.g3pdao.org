I didn't like Ginny in the later books. I don't know, but she kind of seemed bitchy to me. She also seemed like someone who just couldn't stay single. Honestly, it felt like she agreed to date Harry because she had recently broken up and was going to date pretty much anyone who would've asked her out.

I liked her early personality. The one who had a hard time speaking to Harry, but "secretly" admired him so much. She doesn't need to be a total fangirl. But I'd like to see her feelings for Harry be consistent.


** Lmao what is this take?
