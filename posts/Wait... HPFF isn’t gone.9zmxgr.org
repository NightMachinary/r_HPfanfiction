Apparently I'm late to the game. I wanted to see if I could find an archive so I could get the stories I posted [yes, I am a huge procrastinator] only to find the site was still operational... and better?


** It was taken over by different people who I happen to really like.

** Hi OP, this is Ronnie from Fanfiction Recommendations, the new operators of [[https://HarryPotterFanfiction.com][HarryPotterFanfiction.com]] - we were very fortunate to be able to relaunch the site in June, just about 1 month after its shut down and have been slowly but surely relaunching and rebuilding old and new features alike.

You'd be surprised how hard it is to modernize a 17 year old site!

Since the site isn't back up to 100% functionality, we've been holding off on emailing all 90,000+ user accounts until we could make sure their first experience back [after our invite] was truly phenomenal! But we have been trying to make our existence known through twitter and Tumblr :].

Glad to have you back in any form and thank you for many years of supporting the community :]
