They have a close relationship, that is never romantic. It's been awhile, but I remember Fleur being rather possessive.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** I'm gonna take this as a prompt and write it out because why not.

#+begin_quote
  ‘I know someone who's worse than Umbridge,' said a voice from the doorway. Ron's younger sister slouched into the room, looking irritable. ‘Hi, Harry.' ‘What's up with you?' Ron asked. ‘It's her,' said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry's bed. ‘She's driving me ‘What's she done now?' asked Hermione sympathetically. ‘It's the way she talks to me -- you'd think I was about three!' ‘I know,' said Hermione, dropping her voice. ‘She's so full of herself.' Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily, ‘Can't you two lay off her for five seconds?' ‘Oh, that's right, defend her,' snapped Ginny. ‘We all know you can't get enough of her.'
#+end_quote

"Who are you talking about?" Harry interrupted.

"Who else? Dear Ms. Perfect Phlegm" Ginny said

"Phlegm?" Harry asked, confused. What the hell was going on here?

"Fleur, Harry. She thinks she's a queen just because she looks beautiful." Hermione said and glanced st Ron for a second. Harry noticed a hint of bitterness and... Jealousy in her tone.

"She thinks she can just waltz in, sway her hips and have her way" Ginny sneered

"Wait, which Fleur are you talking about?" Harry asked

"The same Fleur who participated in the triwizard tournament, Harry" Hermione offered. " She's getting married to Bill, and ron can't seem to take his eyes off of her"

Harry didn't have the time to process the information as Ginny piped in:

"That cow" she said

Harry felt an insane amount of anger well up inside him as he connected the dots. He had been on edge the entire summer as he had once again been shipped off to Durzkaban. Sirius's death had left a gaping hole in his chest. Scars littered his thighs and arms - not that anyone could see it as he was wearing a sweatshirt and trousers. Ron and Hermione had written very less letters yet again with no useful information. All of them had contained mundane things like the weather or the latest quidditch news. It seemed both ron and Hermione had been unwilling to accept what had happened at the ministry and less willing to talk about it.

Self harming had been the only thing that had kept him alive.

But that was not what angered him. He had spent weeks at the Dursley's, sinking deeper and deeper jnto an endless void by the minute. The prophecy which weighed down on his shoulder had further pushed him into the void. All the while Hermione and Ginny had been bitching about Fleur in the burrow like two hags.

Then there was the matter of Fleur. Harry prided himself on being a good judge of character, and he knew Fleur. Having her as his opponent in the tournament had made him observe her throughout 4th year.

While she may have been an arrogant brat at the beginning, her ego had deflated when Harry had outperformed her in the first task and saved Gabrielle's life in the second task. Harry knew that she was very kind hearted. She didn't deserve the bad mouthing that Ginny and Hermione were giving her. And their reasons? ridiculous

"SHUT THE FUCK UP!" Harry screamed, as Ginny and Hermione had yet again begun insulting Fleur behind her back

The entire room fell into a deadly silence and all the other three occupants looked at Harry in healthy doses of shock and surprise.

"You, Ginny, can't handle the fact that you aren't the centre of attention anymore. And you blame Fleur. Hermione, just because you're jealous that Ron here doesn't notice you gives you no right to insult Fleur, especially behind her back. You two are pathetic. We are at war right now, and all you can think of is your own FUCKING INSECURITIES? Fleur doesn't deserve this. I know her better than any of you in this room, and she is one of the most compassionate people I've ever met. Who else visited me in the hospital after I returned from the graveyard? None of you. But Fleur did, and she wasn't even my friend at that point of time. I will not have you badmouthing her in my presence. M I'll tell it again. We are at WAR. Act like it." He said and stormed out of the room, not noticing a shocked Fleur who stood in the corridor. She couldn't believe what she had just Heard. Harry was defending her? He had no reason to, but he had done so. That spoke volumes about his character.

That's all I could type rn at 12:04 am. I see Fleur and Harry having a very great *platonic* relationship following this one shot, so feel free to continue this. How Hermione and Ginny treated Fleur always bothered me, making me hate those characters more.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.
