This is technically a 'request' thread (as I would hope to receive counter-examples), but I'd like to pose the question of why jealousy so rarely appears in HP fanfics.

We see it in canon - HR over Ron/Lav, Harry over Dean/Ginny. But in many Harry-centered/non-slash fics I read (not to mention 99.9% of H/multi), it's like the author has never once experienced the emotion. How is this posssible?

Jealousy is one of the most universal feelings. Every one of my friends, family, and romantic partners has admitted to experiencing it at one time or another. It is closely tied in with feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. It is ESPECIALLY rampant during teenage years - i.e., when most HP fanfics are set.

This fic - linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3735685/1/Ace-of-Hearts]]) - always stood out to me as a pretty realistic example of how people should react in the HP universe. It would be nice if more authors, when writing their romantic plots/subplots, would remember that almost no one reacts to seeing the boy/girl they like dating someone else with a 'ho-hum' attitude.

Everyone can write what they like, but it always bums me out when I'm reading a fun story and suddenly all of the female characters decide they're A-okay with sharing the MC, and oh-by-the-way they just now realized they're bisexual, but only for each other. /So/. /Damn/. Lazy.


** Depends on the genre. Fluff fics purposely exclude it because "good feelings only". Action/adventure will often not bother with a complicated romance. PWP fics only (sometimes) use it to build sexual tension. And multi/harem fics exclude it for convenience, I'd assume. If I had to guess, I'd say you might find more jealousy in the enemies-to-lovers category.

I think the issue for you might be that jealousy usually comes in the form of "misunderstandings that get the main pairing together". Fanfiction authors don't often know how to write their faves dating /someone else/ in a realistic way, because fanfiction is escapism and of course you want to get to the good part where your faves are progressing toward each other. So if you're looking for a more realistic dating scene in general, where everyone in a fic is dating around & breaking up & trying things out, and not just... Matched up with the author's opinion of their most compatible partner almost immediately... Then that's a harder ask.

That said, I wouldn't say instances of jealousy are /uncommon/ in fanfiction. In general, I can't say I share your experience (and I don't read much like I used to) so perhaps it's a newer phenomenon.

*** Oh no, that is definitely there, but you are confusing envy and jealousy. Ron is /envious/ of Harry's fame and wealth in canon. Many fanfic writers will sometimes make him /jealous/ of H/HR.

Envy is resenting someone for what /they/ have.

Jealousy is resentfully guarding what /you/ have.

****** Jealosy, in my opinion, is wanting something/someone, usually someone, that someone else has, and getting angry about it, and defensive of the thing/person. A common example is seeing your crush with someone else. You resent the person they're with bc it's not you.

Envy is being upset because someone has something you don't. It's similar, but it's more "oh, I wish I had that" than "why do you get it and not ME". In my opinion.

Edit: seeing another comment you made I'm sure you're confusing it with possessiveness, and the reason that people dont write about it is that they want the protagonist to be either likeable or hated, not creepy lol

***** OP is using a somewhat archaic meaning for the word "jealousy". It's not used in that way very often, currently, but it crops up in the Bible at points. When the Bible says that Yahweh is a "jealous" God, that is what it means. He is constantly vigilant about his worshipers being poached by other gods. He guards what he has /jealously/. Envy is, classically, a different thing. To envy is to covet. To be jealous is to be protective/possessive. It's a useful distinction to make, but if you use the two words as synonyms, I don't blame you. Almost everyone does. That's language for you.

****** First definition of jealously that pops up when googling it

"feeling or showing envy of someone or their achievements and advantages."

Jealously is a feeling of envy, the article you linked asserts that jealousy is when you feel like something you owned has been taken but that's simply incorrect.

The feeling of being threatened that something you feel you owned is being taken can be caused BY jealousy but it is not jealousy itself on a definitive level

Edit: For an example ron could be jealous because of h/hr by thinking that harry had a better life than him because he was dating a girl that ron wanted to date (because then he would be envious of Harry's achievements) but if it was because he thought that that harry was stealing what was his then that's specifically not jealousy, that's possessiveness. It's a very important distinction to make

TLDR what you and the psychologist described as jealousy was not jealousy, it was possessiveness. They can be similar in some cases but if you feel you were "stolen from" then you're not being jelly, you're being possessive and creepy.

** Considering lots of fanfics are either wish fulfillments or power fantasies, it can often be hard to find emotions such as jealousy in them. Writers often forget that the MC is actually capable of feeling negative emotions except anger and often don't give them any flaws. Also given that jealous is one of those emotions that are really common but also almost universally disliked, jealous characters also make very bashable characters (eg: Ron). Writers usually prefer to vilify jealousy instead of actually just accepting it as something that is common for everyone and thus dealing with it in a realistic and believable manner

There is also the fact that most harems and Harry/Multi fics won't work or would be really difficult if you add jealousy to the equation. For most inexperienced and ameteur writers it is often just easier to pretend such stuff don't exist in the first place and go with whatever the plot demands. I have yet to see a harem fic that deals with all the issues that come from being in a harem in a believable manner.

*** Yeah, this. I have spent more time frustrated with myself for doing poorly in video games than I have on feeling jealous over a girl.

Of course, I only ever had a crush on one girl in the 9th grade, but I was so shy about it that she and her friends all thought I was gay. And when I, rather confusedly said "no? I thought you were pretty and had a cute laugh, but I wanted to be friends before asking you out," she declined going to homecoming with me, and then by the next week everyone was avoiding me because there were rumors going around that I'd "pretended" to be part of her friend group so I could... well, perform a certain 4 letter R word that rhymes with cape.

Needless to say, after being a social pariah for the entirety of 10th grade, I was relieved to be changing school districts for 11th, and I haven't tried dating since.

Damn, that was almost a decade ago...

That is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to issues with harems. And the reason why they pretty much all suck (it works in crack-ish premises like "It could only happen to Harry").

But in regular fics, well what's the point? The one canon example of romantic jealously we see in widely regarded as one of the worst bits of canon (the "chest monster").

If Harry (seriously) wants to be with his mate's girl, he is a dick since they are considered off-limits. If Harry is in a relationship and some girl wants his ass, well, that won't cause much conflict either since either she will be told to fuck off or there's some kind of showdown which amounts to little more than bashing.

And perhaps most importantly, jealously is kinda irrelevant with magical Hitler out for Harry and all Muggleborns. There are bigger issues to focus on.
