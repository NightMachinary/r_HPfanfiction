Harry vs Hermione is a guilty pleasure of mine.

Any fics where Hermione is the Antagonist?


** Hallows and Pathos, where Hermione take the deathly hallows and is corrupted by them.

** Cadmean victory maybe? The whole premise of the story is that Harry starts disliking Hermione and Ron in fourth year over breaking his wand and it starts getting really hot in later years, though not really the main antagonist, just a side character that's disliked.
