:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic where Harry is abused at home and treated like crap by the Order. His final thing that made him give up was when Remus told him that everything was his fault and people wouldn't dead if he hadn't been born.

He went to Diagon, saw Draco, and demanded to be taken to his home knowing that Voldemort was there. Harry then asked him to kill him saying better him than them because with him it would be quick.

I also read one where he discovered that the Order, Hermione, and the Weasley family were waiting for him to die so they could have his estate split between them. He drug Draco to the bank making him Harry's only heir, leaving his estate and transferring the titles of Lord Black and Lord Potter. There was a squabble where Harry something to the effect of Do you want it or not. When he got back to Grimaldi, he told them he was at the bank making his will leaving everyone what they deserve. He committed suicide in a public space


** Never read any but would love to. Been trying to find some Harry kills himself or goes off to die fics for a while now

  Harry is at the end of his rope; he's no saviour, he's just a frightened and hurting adolescent who has been asked to do too much. The prophecy was the last straw. Can McGonagall do something now? Or is it too late? Trigger Warnings on individual chapters although suicide is a strong theme.

  A sister piece to Giving Up; the Boy-Who-Lived broke and the shards of glass of everyone else's life still need to be picked up. Because what is there to be said when so many people failed one boy so very, very badly. Triggers; suicide. T for safety and triggers
