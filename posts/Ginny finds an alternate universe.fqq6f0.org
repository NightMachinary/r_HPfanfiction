:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I once read a fanfic in which Bill, on Ginny's birthday, told her to cross a forest near their house. Once she did, she discovered an alternate universe in which she's a princess, Harry is a knight, and basically everyone has a place in this fairytale land. It was so long ago, and I've never been able to find it. Does anyone know the name? Thanks!


** I think I know this fic. Was Harry raised by elfs in the story?

*** In the alternate universe? I don't remember anything like that, but it's possible that I've forgotten that part.
