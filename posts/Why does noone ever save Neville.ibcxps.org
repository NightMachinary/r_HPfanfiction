This is something perplexing I've noticed - in almost every story that has the first flying lesson, even those who try and succeed at being original, Neville still falls out of the sky and breaks his hand.

Why, in almost no story, does anyone save him?


** I think people always want Harry on a flying team and Neville breaking his hand works as a set-up for Harry to save his remembrall whether it be taken by canon-compliant Draco, bashed Ron, or another character.

*** But why does he need to be on the team? This is usually a problem with stories that follow the stations of canon to the letter and are therefore incredibly boring. A story should follow narrative logic - if you do this, then Harry doesn't get on the team until second year. Not much changes, but some authors are so insanely uncreative that they seemingly can't deviate even a little.

But then Harry couldn't set a record by winning seven Quidditch cups in a row (I've seen a few ways to squeeze one in between the TWT tasks).

Let's face it, time travel is the set-up for a crubstomp. So you might as well go all out with vanity quests such as that.

Oh God, I find that most authors struggle with writing a decent Quidditch (I didn't really care even for the canon ones where nothing plot-relevant happened) scene and generally find them the most boring, uninteresting and difficult to keep up with. Having to read twenty one of those scenes would be atrocious for me.

****** I like Quidditch scenes and probably read PoA 20 times since it's the only book with all three matches of the season.

For writing them, I prefer to heavily rely on the commentator to tell what's going on, leaning heavily on the style of football commentators and forgoing most "magical" plays in favour of using terminology anyone familiar with football (soccer) would understand.

Although I've just noticed that I have never written a Hogwarts Quidditch scene. I've done a few bits on the 94 World Cup group stage (with Lithuania, Holstein, Venice and Japan as teams) and an impromptu broom race at Hogwarts, but never school Quidditch.

******** I've used Top Gear commentary from their test track as inspiration for the bit I wrote since that made for a better narrative (since I don't remember any motorsport commentary as being outstanding or entertaining and most I saw was in German anyway). And I might or might not have actually mapped out a racecourse.

** Because they're eleven-year-olds who don't know enough magic to stop someone from falling from a broom or cushioning a fall. Remember that this is the second week of their first term. I also find that every story who does this have Mary Sue characters and are incredibly badly written.

Or you remember all the times you had worse and still ended up being fine. As Taure points out, it isn't lasting damage, it does not even last 20 minutes (time to get to the infirmary, broken bones can be healed almost instantly). Most scraps children get IRL while playing football or riding a bike are worse than that.

So why would you tip off others that you can do Dumbledore level spells after a week at Hogwarts?

***** Why would covertly casting a cushioning spell or a subtle fall-breaking spell be "tipping your hand"? All it would look like would be Neville being miraculously unharmed, and not having his FUCKING WRIST BROKEN. I don't think you realize how much breaking your hand actually hurts.

Who the hell are all you people that you think letting a child be injured is preferrable to /not/ having it be injured? We can reattach severed fingers, that doesn't mean you don't take away a knife if some kid runs around with one.

Using silent casting with a wand and not overtly pointing said wand would be enough to stop Neville from being injured and not tip his hand.

  “Dumbledore was really angry,” Hermione said in a quaking voice. “I've never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away. . . . He was furious they'd come onto the grounds. We heard him ---”

Agree with you on the possibility of subtle casting but Dumbledore did not cast wandlessly in that instance, no matter what the movies portray. The books came first and were written by JKR.

** I hadn't thought about that before, but I think you're right that this is a great opportunity. For example, Draco, who has been bragging about how good he is at flying, could jump into action, save Neville, and then have a new opportunity to be friends with Gryffindors! Now I am curious to read this!

** I agree with you. I would save Neville. the "Harry won't be on the team" excuse is stupid. it was stupid in canon too, since they bend the rules for the chosen one. at least it was kinda needed for the story, even though only for the murder attempt. I always like it when they save Neville instead. though I don't think it happened in any time travel. looks like writers don't like his character. there's this magical Dudley fic where Dudley saves him, that was nice.
