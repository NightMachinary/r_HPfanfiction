I remember a post that got a bit of traction, but never got anywhere, so here it is again.

What completely ruins a fic and makes you never want to read it again, or the exact opposite. What makes a fic so good, that you want to read it to the end?

For me, it's the use of the word OK, it puts me off so violently I just end up closing the tab. Other than that, GinGin freaks me out, why would you want to date someone who supposedly looks like your mum?


** Did ginny look like lily in canon or is just because they are both have red hair? I mean dating a blond when your mother is blond doesn't make you a weirde with a mother fetish right?

For me it is bashing, giving the mc things he doesn't use or need for the story, like lordship and stuff like that.

*** There is zero evidence in canon that Ginny looks like Lily. Even the shade of their red hairs is different.

** The bad:

If your first paragraph is one giant run-on sentence. (If you manage to construct an understandable seven-line sentence using proper grammar, I'll probably keep reading.)

Tom Riddle as a romantic interest

Unneeded abbreviations/acronyms ("DE" instead of Death Eaters, a character saying "DADA" out loud)

Every character speaks the exact same way, to the point you can't tell who it is giving a monologue without the dialogue tags

Badly writing out an accent, to the point of reading it being an effort (most commonly with Krum, Fleur, and Hagrid)

Author's notes inserted into the middle of the story

A complete lack of logic - like, Harry deciding to go into the third-floor corridor his first night at Hogwarts - and it working out perfectly

Romance is the main focus

Harry is a poor pathetic sniveling coward OR the bravest most wonderful man that ever lived

The good:

Something interesting/rarely done well - like a character being thrown backwards through time, but the author did a lot of research into cultural norms, available technology, etc. (Of a Linear Circle on AO3 does this really well.)

Consistent internal logic

Found families

Characters that act like people - everyone's both good and bad

*** found families + characters with good and bad is totally the reason why I loved the MCU and was less interested in the actual plots than the characters themselves

totally same with HP for me

** Normally, I would put bad writing, horrible bashing, dumb plots, or any other number of structural parts to fics that I think ruin them for me. But there's one that's much worse than that in making me want to violently throw my phone away - and that's when it's /gross/, particularly in relation to characters bodies.

For instance, Hail Odysseus has the following line that made me nope out ASAP:

#+begin_quote
  Harry ran a hand over his face, while surreptitiously breathing in deeply. At once, his keen sense of smell detected various feminine odours: delicate soaps, fragrant shampoos and even a few dabs of a flowery perfume from the dark-haired girl. He also smelt hints of a more earthy, irony smell.

  Concentrating on that scent, he realised that the dark-haired girl and the one with short light-brown hair had both started their menstrual cycles, while the nervous-looking girl with long, straight brown-hair was right on the verge of it. The small, giggly blond child who sat nearest to the door had yet to have her first period, however.
#+end_quote

So I think that's where I draw the line at immediately giving up.

** For me, the thing that makes a long-fic is the first three chapters. If they introduce the plot properly and make me wonder about stuff, then I generally read more regardless of anything else - writing quality, trope usage, OOC behaviours, etc.

Stuff that switches me off a fic is lack of internal logic or explanation. If Snape is a good guy, great, just explain why he suddenly isn't a bullying twat like in canon. Same with Draco not being a devout Magic-Nazi Youth. Also sudden tonal shifts, like fics suddenly becoming incredibly Dark or Heart and Soul by Sillimaure's sudden Christianity. If something happens that makes me think "Where the hell did THAT come from?", I more often than not stop reading there.

** Dogfather, pup, prongslet and magic with a "k". It's magic and magical - there is no goddamn k in the word.

I can deal with a bit of bad grammar and such if the story is engaging. I can even deal with bashing. But prongslet's magick? Nope, can't do it.

** The thing that breaks a fic for me is that instead of trying to rationalize his decisions they make Dumbledore unintelligent.

The thing that makes a fic for me is great worldbuilding and magical theory but above all an ability to not disclose unneeded information that could preserve the tension

** â€¢ Weasley bashing (especially Ron). Almost every popular fic puts the bloke down in one way or another and it's irritating. Harmony/Hermione centric fics are especially notorious for this.

â€¢ Grammar/spelling/capitalization/punctuation mistakes. Grammarly is free and so is spellcheck!

*** I tried Grammarly a few months ago. It's good if you're looking a for a third-grader who doesn't understand commas to proofread your work. For anything more complicated, find a human to help, or pick up a style guide at the library.

** I love when someone takes a detail from the OG books and makes you think about it in a new way (good, bad, funny, sad, whatever)

I love platonic friendship fics especially male-female friendship bc it's hard to find in the fictional media I consume in general

I only like cleverly done retcons/fix-its but when they're good, I'm so there

I love when characters react to big events in ways that feel real but go against common expectations. For instance, not everyone cries buckets at funerals, I've seen a range of expressions IRL. People might feel one way in 2010 and then very different about the situation in 2020. That kind of thing.

** When Harry changes his appearance outlandishly for no apparent reason. I started reading Runic Animagi and stopped when Harry got fifty tattoos, a bunch of piercings and started smoking weed with house eoves at least once a day. The only thing mussing was the blue spiky hair because why not.

** In general, regardless of what I'm reading, I can't stand poor spelling or grammar, especially when people misuse the various forms of past tense. I know there are a number of them, but they aren't the same. They have different uses. I also dislike when people use the present tense when they mean to use the past.

I know, call me a grammar freak ðŸ¤·
