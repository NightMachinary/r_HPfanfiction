I mean it should go without saying, but I'm constantly frustrated with how many writers seem to struggle with putting the Marauders in their historical context. Not even just writers actually, artists have a lot to apologise for too. I mean, I get it, many fan work creators weren't around then and it can be difficult to recognise historical inaccuracies, not to mention it's hard to describe Sirius as sexy if you recognise that he was likely to have hair in the style of the Bee-Gees and James probably had glasses now commonly associated with paedophilia.

And I understand that it's even harder for American writers, or any writer from outside the UK really. The UK had a very distinct culture in the 70s and 80s (nice photo collection [[http://londonist.com/london/art-and-photography/in-photos-london-in-1977?utm_source=Today%27s+posts+from+Londonist&utm_campaign=30defdf425-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_06_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_acfd22879f-30defdf425-219100641][here]] and while I don't expect people to turn James into a punk, I'm kind of bewildered by some of the modern clothes, phrases and beliefs people assume were around then. James and Sirius having a "bromance" and specifically calling it that just wouldn't be a thing.

** Oh, god. I read a fic where Sirius time-travels back to 1981 after falling through the veil. He heads for his old apartment and is appalled by the contents of the wardrobe. I believe the quote was "he didn't remember his taste being quite this /lurid/" (you don't see lurid used often). I can just /imagine/ what was in there. I'm thinking heavy Robert Plant and Jimi Hendrix influences.

*** Halo isn't /too/ far off the mark, funnily enough: Halo: Combat Evolved was released in 2001, while the series takes place between 1991 and 1998. And Taylor Swift is about 9 years younger than Harry, so he could conceivably /meet/ her I guess, though he wouldn't be listening to her music as her first album was published in 2006.

I've seen fics in which Dudley plays Quake or Doom, both of which make sense (Doom more so than Quake, as it was published three years earlier). But widely used mobile phones should be a no-go: while 1G phones existed since the early 80s and 2G phones were introduced in the 90s, they weren't nearly as common as they are now.

** Thank you! I made a request for 70's fics a couple of days ago but ended up deleting it. I wanted a Punk!Petunia. I'd love a fic with a punk squat in it anyway.

Back in the good old days (2005) Lily used to listen to Good Charlotte on her iPod! At least we don't get a lot of that now.

There are also some attitudes that people just don't think about. The 70's were the post-birth control, pre-AIDS era, so very sexually liberal, but at the same time more sexist and definitely more homophobic, so no Sirius and Remus holding hands out in the open. (Although it is a British boarding school so it would be a kind of open secret, I guess). People were also more racist and there was major class warfare. And no computers for most of us mortals!

I think A Difference in the Family linkffn(7937889) at least got the era right.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

I must disagree. The wizarding world seems to have radically different prejudices than the muggle one. Things like racism, sexism and homophobia are nonexistent, even amongst the death eaters and blood purists.

Their bigotry focusses more on blood purity and lycanthropy etc.

I mean, Dumbledore was openly gay when he was a teenager in the early 1900s.

** This. I'm not the biggest fan of Marauders fics in general, as they tend to take... liberties with characterization. It would be cool to see some period-specific realism though. I think the the fight against Voldemort would have interesting parallels to all the social strife of 1970's England -- you had deep economic troubles, anti-establishment movements like punk, and the whole IRA situation.

I've never seen a fic touch on any of those more serious issues, but Debt of Time linkffn(10772496) does at least respect the 70's setting, and I will plug it any chance I get. More than one mention of flared pants

** A Difference in the Family is not kind to Sirius at all. He's depicted as a loose cannon who constantly harasses Snape for being interested into the Dark Arts - the only Marauder who comes good is (ironically) James who struggles to keep Sirius under control

** I just realized I'd love to see a fic where Snape embraces the punk style as a way to get back at his father, but finds the acceptance and things he craves in that group before heading off to Hogwarts.

** Personally, the biggest anachronism is that almost all fics dealing with time travel to that time period seem to brush off just how pants-shittingly terrifying the 60's, 70's and 80's really were.

Remember that this is a time period where serious shit went down in the UK-as in the IRA were bombing the joint, the Russians were on the verge of all-out nuclear war on a constant basis, the British Empire was imploding in a series of small but traumatic conflicts that tended to involve scores of 18-year-olds being sent off to fight communist guerillas in asian jungles ( what, you thought it was just vietnam out there? You had brush wars flaring up left & right in that region back then).

Oh, and then you have the insane super-powerful Dark Lord out to murder, well, everyone that wasn't him. Non-stop. For almost thirty years.

Seriously, that side of things is never given its due. The sheer fear of hearing the siren that'd herald the start of WW3 and provide you with a five minute warning to seek shelter from the fallout would have been very real.

I can imagine a scene where a young girl is waved off to Hogwarts only to hear the warning siren going off as the train leaves London. Ten minutes later, they see a flash in the sky. She and the other muggleborn then spend the entirety of the train ride wondering whether London still exists as something other than a radioactive ash cloud or if it was jus an ill-timed test that happened to coincide with a nearby lightning strike.

** I read a fic where Sirius and James are in a punk band and Remus is an aspiring music journalist. It's a Muggle AU and very music-focused, you might enjoy it if you like that. I'm not british and I am not 100% familiar with the 70, 80s eras but it seems to me that the fic did a good job of recreating the culture and the atmosphere.
