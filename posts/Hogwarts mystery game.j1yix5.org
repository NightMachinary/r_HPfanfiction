Where do people stand on fanfiction written about the Hogwarts Mystery game? Is it a yay or nay?


** Like with any idea in the fandom, it could be awesome if it's done well. I get the impression that a lot are self-inserts (which makes sense given that it's a video game designed to let you imagine yourself as a student at Hogwarts), with all of the associated problems and stigma that come along with that. Even if you're writing the PC as a well-rounded, flawed OC, people - especially people on this subreddit - will probably assume it's a Mary Sue/wish fulfillment type thing and not have an interest.

*** To be fair, the "Student" you play as in Hogwart's Mystery is completely OP, especially if you do all the events (spoiler of the game beyond):

- Fought a Werewolf in 2nd year
- Friend with the Bizarr' Sisters
- Became an animagus in 3rd year
- Master the Patronus in 4th year
- Became a Prefect and Head Boy/ Girl
- Is a Master Prankster
- Joined his House Quidditch Team and was undefeated while playing at different positions
- Never lost the House Cup

If someone just wrote the plot of the game without mentioning where it is from, people would (and should) yell at the wish fulfillment.

*** Merula's an interesting character; the child of two Death Eaters, and while she might hold similar (though possibly to a lesser degree) anti-muggleborn attitudes, there seems to be a fair amount of evidence that she hates Voldemort because she sees him as the reason her parents are in Azkaban. Or at least, that's my interpretation of her.

** If it is good enough it will get some attention, with enough recommendations I might read it. I would not click on it while browsing however.
