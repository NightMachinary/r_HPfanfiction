Like the title says, everyone's least favorite whiny bigot gets the punishment and treatment his actions should have warranted and deserved. TIA!


** He gets his just deserts in Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them, but it's a very minor plot point

Same with The Sniper, I'm pretty sure.

The problem is I find his just deserts is that he does quickly and with little notice because he has such an overblown sense of importance in the scheme of things

** Great and loving parents. Loyal and true friends, the love of a gentle and beautiful woman, becoming the heir to the Malfoys, a great family with a charitable and helpful reputation.

Yes this Draco is amazing.

*** I'm confused by this comment. What point are you attempting to convey? Not attacking you, I genuinely don't understand it

**** I think they are implying Draco isn't responsible for his actions in canon. Basically, everything he did was his parents' fault and he's a victim. So, yeah...

**** What does he deserve? Are you saying it has to be a bad thing?

Why cant he deserve a good life away from all the hate his parent brought him up with?

Maybe next time specify perhaps that you want something bad to happen in his just deserts.

***** Well, I thought me calling him everyone's least favorite baby bigot signified I didn't like the poster boy for the magical Hitler Youth.

He was never a good person for his first 18 years, so I don't see why I can't think that he deserves to be fed to a group of Hippogriffs.

You can have your views, and I'll have mine
