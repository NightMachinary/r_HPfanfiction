So I read this Daphne/Harry fic a while ago and it was like Daphne liked Harry but he looked poor or whatever so she manipulated him or something so he would get richer and he like challenged Malfoy to a race to some obscure flower in the mountains and the winner would get to kick the loser once for every step they won by and when it started Harry just turned around and bought it in an Apothecary and sold the kicks to other students and later he offered all his family money to Malfoy in return for using one spell on him and used an explosive castration spell made by Lily and conned him out of his family fortune and I think he had a harem at the end but idk?

Anyway I can't find it and I read it like 3 years ago or smth so I can't remember the title even tho I remember all those details.

If anyone knows about the fic please give me a link, thanks!
