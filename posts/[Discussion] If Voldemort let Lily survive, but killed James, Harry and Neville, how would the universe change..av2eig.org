With both potential Chosen Ones dead, what would be different.

Would Voldemort now have won and taken over the Wizarding World?

With Lily alive she could testify that Wormtail was the traitor, allowing Sirius to remain innocent.

Snape may remain a loyal Death Eater, without the loss of Lily to change him.

What else would change?


** Pretty sure that would've been game over. If the prophecy is to be believed, the only two people who had the power to defeat him are now dead. At the time of the attack on the Potters, Voldemort was winning, and had been eliminating Order members semi frequently. He also had his spies in the Ministry, that ended up getting off after he was gone. It's likely Voldemort would've all but won once he killed Harry and Neville, Dumbledore didn't even know about the horcruxes for sure until Harry's second year. Lily Potter's sacrifice is basically what saved the Wizarding world.

Snape would've remained a Death Eater, because Voldemort did the one thing he asked for, spare Lily. Wormtail would've probably have gotten away with it, and remained in hiding until they overthrew the ministry.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8641047/1/Rewarded][Rewarded]], linkffn(8641047), is pretty much that.

An SI has replaced him in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I am Lord Voldemort?]], linkffn(12980210), and is doing rather well.

  Severus got his wish when Voldemort decided to stun Lily instead of killing her. With her husband and son dead, what is there for her in this world? And without Lily's sacrifice, will there be any hope for the wizarding world? AU

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power. Translated from Russian.)

** Even if Snape /didn't/ remain a Death Eater, Lily wouldn't ever forgive him, nor would she /ever/ start a relationship with him. She had a backbone and she knew when to leave behind a toxic friendship.

As for everything else, the limit is your imagination.

** I think you underestimate how much the loss of James and Harry would affect Lily. Seeing her devastated by his boss would probably not be negligible, for Severus Snape.
