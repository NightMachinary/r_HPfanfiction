** Hey, virtually no one on the Reddit uses Wattpad, as the site has no search function at all, and 90% of what's posted there is absolute trash. I would recommend asking in a HPFF Facebook group or something similar.

*** To be fair 90% of what's posted to fanfiction.net is trash too

**** True, but FFnet has a search function where you can sort for stuff and narrow your algorithm: Wattpad doesn't. To search the damn site you effectively need to use Google.

***** Usually you don't even have to go as far as reading it to see how bad the quality is. The description is very telling.

****** I've read a fanfic about a girl paired with Draco. The plot was good but the character is so energetic, bubbly and happy, even after losing her loved ones. She's probably a mary sue. She aso made Draco nice by being Harry's friend.

I don't know what the title is but I figured I wouldn't need to since I wouldn't want to read it again.
