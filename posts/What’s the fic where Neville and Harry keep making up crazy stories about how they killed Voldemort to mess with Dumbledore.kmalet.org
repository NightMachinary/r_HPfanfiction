I can't remember any more details, but want to reread it.


** Thanks! Update: it is NOT as good as I remembered - got a few chapters in and remembered that it falls prey to every overused trope in the book.

*** It's ten years old; odds are good it's responsible for popularizing some of those tropes in the first place.

***** Fair enough, there were certainly things that rubbed me the wrong way about it (the premise that Hermione was so busy getting dick she just completely bailed on her best friend being perhaps the most egregious).
