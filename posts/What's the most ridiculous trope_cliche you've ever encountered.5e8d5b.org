** SexGod!Snape.

HaremXHarry, Superpower/God!Harry. Now I've read too many of them; Elemental!Harry, Heir to many Lordships!Harry.

CompletelyBeautifulOC!Hermione.

Evil!Ron/Evil!Ginny, Evil!Weasleys

Any kind of character bashing (like whole paragraphs or chapters dedicated to bashing a character).

So common it's a little funny considering the first fic which started it was not meant to be taken seriously, LeatherPants!Draco (I'll admit I do read fics which have this version of Draco -- it's hard to avoid it, it's just OOC and not based in canon).

*** I'd argue elemental!Harry could work, alone though, giving harry a super magical core, control over three elements, mastery over death, and a bunch of other powers wouldn't.

The author would just need to focus on the elemental part and not make it make the character a god, so no elementals killing armies of death eaters easily with their powers, rather they just use a hell lot more of their element as it would be easier to use. I'd say just give some interesting abilities to Harry that relate to the element somehow.

**** Yeah, my problem with it isn't with the concept, but that it almost always comes in conjunction with a super/over powered Harry who has no trouble defeating his enemies. The annoying thing about those kind of fics is that there is no conflict or tension because we know he is going to win.

Well, it would, if Harry needing enough power for whatever never was a plot device of any kind.

There is a story (a series of three, actually), where the amount of powers Harry has is just ridiculous. But, because him having or not having enough power never actually matters and the story plays it all for the comedy factor, it's amusing rather than cringe-inducing.

** Postwar Hermione submitting to a marriage law - ABSOLUTELY disgusting.

It's the worst form of tyranny, something even Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Maoist China didn't dare to implement. It's most likely something cooked up by immature teenagers who have no clue about what kind of human rights violation a marriage law is.

When it comes to fics dealing with it, I like the following 5 levels of responses:

1. The protagonists were too weak to fight, so they run away as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]]

2. The protagonists organized a mass exodus, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]]

3. The protagonists asked a third party to eliminate certain individuals responsible for the marriage law, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]]

4. The protagonists took out those responsible individuals by themselves, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]]

5. The protagonists staged a revolution, took over the government, and executed anyone who supported the marriage law, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]]

** Goblins.

In canon they provide secured vaults. They are not investment managers, healers, political allies, master blacksmiths, lawyers, warders, or cutthroat mercenaries. Yet whenever they show up in fics they tend to offer at least half of the above to the protagonist for no real reason.

If they were actually so superior they would be the winners of the goblin wars and students would never know about Professor Binns because they would be slaving away in what I'm sure are poorly lit tunnels.

*** I always think this is hilarious. So many authors treat Gringotts like a mall or something. Of course with convenient Horcrux removal, time dilution rooms for extra training (only for 'Goblin Friends') and of course they sell unbreakable ward schemes for the ancestral manor that you just have to rediscover by picking up your Lordship ring that is also conveniently stored for you at Gringotts(TM).

While I agree with you on this, it is canon that goblins made the Sword of Gryffindor and Muriel's tiara. Fantastic Beasts gives them a bit more personality, too. I think the superiority could work with artisanry and trade, but they'd be secretive and subtly subversive with wizards who are more skilled in dueling magic.

*** Well goblin made items are considered to be incredibly valuable... I suspect that given their love of money they might offer investment services and hire mercenaries but the terms might be a little steep.
