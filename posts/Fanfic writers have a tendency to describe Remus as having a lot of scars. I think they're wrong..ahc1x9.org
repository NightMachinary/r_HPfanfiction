A lot of fanfics that I've read seem to have Remus Lupin having a crap ton of scars from his werewolf transformations.

Evidence for a lot of scars:

- He claims he bit and scratched himself often when not taking the wolfsbane potion

- Bill had lasting scars after being attacked by greyback while in his human state

Evidence for not having a lot of scars:

- When Harry initially meets Remus on the Hogwarts train he describes him as wearing "an extremely shabby set of wizard's robes" and "he looked ill and exhausted" and "his light brown hair was flecked with gray". If Remus had significant facial scarring, it would have been remarked upon. The book describes Moody, when we initially meet him as "every inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the nose was missing"

- Harry meets up with lupin the next day after the shrieking shack ordeal and doesn't remark anything about his appearance. Lupin says that when he's unable to eat humans he bites and scratches himself and he hadn't taken his potion that night. Although he could have eaten animals in the forest while running around.

And honestly the biggest evidence is just that he was never described as having scars. I'm pretty sure if you saw someone with a big ass scar on their face it would be noticeable.

My headcannon is that Remus might have significant scratches and definitely a bite scar from his initial werewolf attack by fenrir greyback possibly on his chest but other than that I don't think he gets scars from his monthly transformations. At the very least I think he is able to heal from the scars he gives to himself and might be immune to those from scarring. Possibly while being in werewolf form or being a werewolf would allow him to heal more efficiently. Or he's good at charms/healing and can heal his own scars.

Thoughts?

edit: just googled "remus lupin fanart" and like 90% of the top results have him having big ass scars on his face


** Scars outside of the face are easy to overlook. As a professor, all that would be visible to a student would be he face, neck and hands. In my opinion, hands are easy to overlook, especially at a distance, but then, I've been known to be oblivious.

Any scarring elsewhere would be pretty easily hidden.

That said, it's entirely possible that the curse continually heals any damage he takes, or at least, heals any damage up to a point. It's almost traditional in some versions of the Werewolf myth for the human to wake the next day, wondering why he's outside and naked, but with no distinguishing marks on their body.

Be internally consistent in what you write, explain any major deviations from canon, and anything else is gravy.

*** Can confirm that *nobody* pays attention to another person's hands. I'm missing somewhere between a fourth and a third of my left pinkie (like the top knuckle is gone, nail and all) and no one ever notices until I mention it. I imagine normal scars on someone's hand would get even less attention.

** Also, it's never mentioned in Snape's werewolf assignment (from what I just skimmed).

And I think you're right- IF scars were routine (especially those as result of a dark creature, like Bill, though self inflicted) then it would be FAR more evident than a cold or other excused absence /hang on, the professor keeps sporting new dark scars at odd times of the month, hmmm/

edit- not strictly related, but funny how these thing happen. Rereading PS and look what I find

#+begin_quote
  in Defence Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating *werewolf bites*, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Philosopher's Stone if they had one.
#+end_quote

which is interesting, given in they hadn't covered werewolves yet in third year, but I suppose werewolf bites must be deemed need to know information.

*** Given that each professor set their own text, I'd say it's a coincidence. Remus based his third year curriculum to deal with dark magical creatures, but Quirrell's first years seemed to be more how to identify a dark threat so you know to run away. And basic first aid for dark wounds, it would seem.

** Must be dependent on the fanfics you read. I read a lot of fanfiction but have not noticed what you are describing. In fact, usually scaring isn't even discussed, much less how many there are.

As for the reality, it's not discussed in canon as far as I remember, and likely shows up primarily due to the movies attempt to make Remus look "rough" or have a subtle "dangerousness" to him. So perhaps some authors are following that cue? But you also need to remember that Remus is clothed in the scenes he is described in canon, so there could be scaring that Harry or the audience would not see.

*** i think it's because in my youth i read a lot of really terrible marauder era stuff. I was super into fanfic around middle school through early high school and would read exclusively remus lupin fanfic. Like literally i would get home from school everyday and scroll through anything recently updated with remus.

it's actually only very recently that i've gotten back into it and i've been reading a much wider variety of stuff and also I'm way more pickier about how well something is written.

** I agree that there is unlikely to be any facial scarring, since that's something Harry does notice - I think he describes Moody's face as looking like it's carved from wood because of all its scars(?). But

#+begin_quote
  He claims he bit and scratched himself often when not taking the wolfsbane potion
#+end_quote

Makes me assume that everything easily reachable by his fangs would have been turned into a mangled mess by now, at least in his wolf form.

The questions that would remain is in what way (if at all) scars are transferred between forms and are werewolf-inflicted wounds cursed even when they are applied to a werewolf?

** I've never realized this, but you've just unearthed a memory from when PoA came out. I remember seeing Lupin in the film and thinking that they'd added a bunch of scars to Lupin's face. I don't think I'd have had this thought if they had been mentioned in the books.

** Yeah I imagine that while he does have scarring (I'd imagine it'd be hard not to given what he's forced to go through once a month), the overall effect of his werewolf transformation is premature aging, as he is described numerous times in the books, and that the scars are not so obvious and/or plentiful that they'd be worth making a fuss over.

** "Although he could have eaten animals in the forest while running around."

Werewolves don't really attack animals unprovoked. It was the whole point of learning how to become an animagus for the Marauders.

Other than this, I don't really disagree with what you are saying.

Also, Werewolves are considered dark creatures and stuff involving dark magic or wounds by dark creatures are supposed to be harder to heal, hence Bill's scar. So even being a werewolf might not necessarily help with that.

I am sure that if you tweet J. K. Rowling about it she will retcon the entire universe while drunk and high on pills, so that might be worth a shot if you want a definite conclusion to your theory.

**** Yeah, but werewolves aren't wolves. It is not a natural animal. They are an unnatural creature born out of a disease that basically exists solely as a vector for the disease.

The werewolf attacks any human on sight and when there are no humans nearby it tries to hurt itself to get the human inside it. The Marauders turn into animagus to keep Lupin's Werewolf form distracted by dicking around with it.

** I assume fan creators picked it up from the movie, where Lupin is depicted with a pair of huge and visible scars across his face: [[https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/harry-potter-remus-lupin.jpg]]

I agree that it's unlikely that book!Remus had any major scars, though - Harry can be kind of oblivious at time, but I don't think he'd fail to notice scars that prominent, especially on a Defense Against Dark Arts teacher.

This is my impression. I also don't see why going from werewolf back to human would cause any scarring. Werewolves are bigger than humans, so the hide wouldn't need to be torn apart, it'd need to shrink or fall off.

** He definitely wouldn't scratch his face, that's a dumb movie design idea. It's a billboard saying "LOOK AT ME, I'M A DANGEROUS WEREWOLF!" And we know that even the unobservant Harry points out obvious facial oddities, like bulging or lazy eyes, new injuries, and Moody's missing bits, not to mention all the gross imagery of Umbridge and her toad face. I'm sure Lupin has scars somewhere, but they're not on his face. They're somewhere he can cover with ankle- and wrist- length robes.

It's the same problem I have with the people who insist on Lord Whatever in their fanfics. Come on, people! If Lucius Malfoy were a Lord, do you really think that in seven years of book canon, we would never have heard of it? He was interviewed for the /Daily Prophet/, he was arrested, he was a school governor, and this never came up? And Draco Malfoy never bragged that his daddy was a lord and one day he would be, too? It's probably because he's not a lord, then!

*** I mean I don't have an issue with lupin scratching his face. But at the very least it shouldn't be scarring or he must have a decent healing potion/charm that would be healable and as a werewolf he has some kind of immunity unlike Bill.

** Remus's facial scars are a pet peeve of mine. However, I don't think he's imune to his own bites, so I thinke he has scars elsewhere, but they can be hidden. Werewolf bites are like dark magic, so I don't think they heal properly. But I might be influenced by against the moon, so i'll blame stoplight for this.
