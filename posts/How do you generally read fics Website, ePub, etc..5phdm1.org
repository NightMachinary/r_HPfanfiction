** For my "real" books (not fanfiction), I use my Kindle (and iOS app) so I have access to the store, but I use iBooks for fanfics so I can download them directly from bot comments.

*** Calibre is amazing, especially with the FanFicFare Plugin. It can automatically download the eBooks from a plethora of sites if you feed it the url, and also check and downloads updates.

** Generally, I do it from my browser, because one more tab won't kill me when I already have a bajilion and four open. I do tend to make a .pdf copy for offline reading, which I sometimes use for rereading because why not.

Mind you, my phone is a StupidPhone (as opposed to a SmartPhone), which does limit my ability to read stuff on it and as such I don't have the need to make my reading compatible with it; when that changes, I'll probably start making a copy that works with the stuff too.

** I do most of my reading on my phone. I use iBooks for actual books, the FanFiction app for things on ffn, and Chrome for everything else.

** Custom ebook maker script and a kindle. For short things, or when I'm lazy, I often read them in the browser.

** Typically I read on my phone in a browser. If a fic is particularly amazing, and finished, I'll download it through ficsave.

*** For actual books, I prefer physical ones that I can hold. But I use my Kindle often enough for books that are ebook only or that I don't really care about having in hardback. Sometimes books are cheaper on Kindle so if I'm shaky on whether or not I'm going to like it, I'll get on there.

** I have a bookmark folder that I use as to-read list. I convert to epub and add them to my kindle every week or so.

Updates I read in my desktop.

** Download ePub and then upload it to Play Books - so I can read it on just about any device I've got (which is a plenty). It's installed on almost every Android device, try it out!

** I use the fanfiction.net app (it's quite good actually!) or the website.

For the website I have a few user-scripts and some CSS changes to make it more readable (different font, text isn't the full width, justified text)

** For short fics (<50k) I just use the website or more commonly the app, for anything over that I use ficsave to download it, then the sendtokindle pc program. I never read incomplete fics so updates aren't an issue.
