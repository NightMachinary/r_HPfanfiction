Over the years, I have written quite a few silly short stories, and this one is just the latest one. After

- "Hermione wingmans for Harry"

- "Harry accidentally marries Pansy Parkinson"

- "Harry's new pet snake is definitely not Sirius Black"

- "Tonks buys Hermione a Kebab"

- and "Friends with Benefits to lovers, 100% free of drama and gluten"

I now present:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13382035]["Harry has disappeared and Tonks gets the worst search assignment, at least according to Dumbledore."]]

Do not expect much in regards to character development or nailbiting action. The fic is just there to humour you. A silly premise and a narrative tone which is not any more serious. But the idea wouldn't leave me alone, so here you go.

  Harry Potter has disappeared and the Order of the Phoenix is just one of many groups desperately searching for him. Being its newest member, Nymphadora Tonks got the worst assignment, or at least that's what Dumbledore told her in a sad tone. However, the place might have changed a little since his last visit in 1897.
