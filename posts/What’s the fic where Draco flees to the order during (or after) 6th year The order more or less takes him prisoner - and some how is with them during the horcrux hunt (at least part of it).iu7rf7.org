:END:
It's been a while since I read this tbh, so I might be getting some info mixed up.

I don't remember it being drarry, but there is a possibility of it. Harry definitely is not thrilled to have him along - and he is treated more like a prisoner then anything else. I think towards the end (not sure i finished it) they started to become friends. He does try to run away at some point though - to help his mom, but the order doesn't allow it. I remember scenes with moody, in the forbidden forest, and in Grimwald Place's kitchen. I think at one point they are walking through the forest, for miles and miles, trying to get to Hogwarts. And that's all folks! Spotty at best, I know! Thank you for any help!!!
