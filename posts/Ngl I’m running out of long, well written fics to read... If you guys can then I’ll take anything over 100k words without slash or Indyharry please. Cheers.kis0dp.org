** Long fics...well, linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) certainly isn't an independent Harry, it's one where he actually has a parental figure. Who, admittedly, spent years in Azkaban and was a bit of a man-child even before that, but is honestly trying his best for James' son. Books 1-4 are done, book 5 is actively updating, with over 1 million words total.

#+begin_quote
  "I'm really not cut out for this whole parenting thing, am I?" Before Harry had a chance to answer that, he shrugged and let out a bark-like laugh. "Tell you what: you eat your vegetables tonight with dinner and we'll call it even. Deal?"
#+end_quote

There's certainly no slash nor independent Harry (no Harry at all, in fact) in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised), which is about Severus being given a second chance at life - but being sent back to a point where his friendship with Lily had already been broken up. It really gets inside his and Lily's heads and examines what makes them tick. It's updating approximately monthly, and is close to the end (over 800k words).

#+begin_quote
  "What if I were to tell you, that not all of that needs to be? If the loss of her friendship was the only regret you needed to relive. Everything else would be up to you."
#+end_quote

And an update recently landed, after six months, for linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series. Excellent reinvention of the whole story in an alternate universe where Tom Riddle went into politics instead of a war. Harriett Potter grew up with both her parents, and is passionate about potion brewing - but non-purebloods are barred from attending Hogwarts. She's determined not to let that stop her, though.

#+begin_quote
  Draco thought Rigel had a rather strange interpretation of rules in general. Half the time he followed them as though he couldn't imagine why anyone would want to do differently, and the other half he seemed to ignore the rules completely, as though he couldn't fathom why anyone would do something just because someone told them to.

  It was a strange sort of person who could go wandering around after curfew without a care in the world and then insist that you had to check your cauldron for cracks before brewing in it even though you just checked it yesterday, because /that's what you're supposed to do/.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
