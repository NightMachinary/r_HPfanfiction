There's so much potential for horror in the Harry Potter setting, particularly during the war, the tournament, the horcrux hunt, and in the event of Voldemort's triumph. The mere existence of horcruxes is such a fantastic catalyst for body horror and the like!

Anyways, I'm left quite a bit unsatisfied with how criminally underutilized the scariest elements of Harry Potter ended up being, so I'm looking for fanfics to amend that.

Also, don't worry about a fic being too dark or disgusting. No Archive warning can stop me!

(P.S., I prefer Harry/trio PoV, and I'm not fond of character bashing/OOCness, but these are definitely not dealbreakers and I'm prolly not the only one who'll check out these recs anyway!)


** linkffn(Concentric Wavelengths) - I never understood how the DoM keeping real brains that were also seemingly sentient was nearly completely overlooked.

** I'm not sure these all qualify as horror and psychological terror but I'd definitely call them dark.

linkffn(True Form by TheLoud; Wandmaking by Right What Is Wrong; Dark Marauder; For Lack of a Bezoar)

Then for actual horror there's linkffn(Whelped)

Edit: I just read linkffn(We Are Many) and it gave me chills, definitely have to add it.

I read the first two chapters of the lost horcrux and I'm really surprised I like it as much as I do because I usually don't like Harmony, but I'm so into the atmosphere and allegories for like naziasm, even if I wish there wasn't so much Ron bashing.

** twenty-nine by endrina on ao3 [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523]] is very gritty + haunting, it's percy centric and focuses on the political aspects of the war as well as the aftermath. it's a murder mystery and has pretty heavy themes so consider the triggers in the tags before reading

i also reccomend twenty-six also by endrina, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1547518]] its set in the same universe but it is draco/harry. regulus and fred turn up back from the dead but something is very very wrong with them. it is about old old deep magic and how it manifests. i'm not usually a drarry person but holy shit i'm so glad i read this because the plot is so creative and really creepy but also emotional and intense

blackpool by the divinecomedian is a regulus centric psychological horror and focuses on memories regulus has of something in the water it's super intense and sooooo gripping i highly reccomend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413]]

also not exactly horror but if you're looking for gritty realism during a war, james potters delivery service for runaway blood traitors by cantbelieveimdoingthis [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30126615?view_full_work=true]] is an excellent example- it's a very intense apocalyptic war story focused on james sirius and remus after a canon divergence where sirius goes missing in their 5th year. the author is a literal genius and if ur interested in the political/world building side of the wizarding war as well as seeing realistic trauma in child soldiers then this is for you. there's also a lot of like... interesting horror/gore imagery in the way that magic is depicted, it goes so much deeper into that than canon ever did. it's a wip, but there's generally a new update every few days
