I just read On punching god's and absentee dads so... I want more!


** Linkao3(Say a Prayer by mad_fairy) not Harry's dad, but Loki does take on a parental role. Goes off the rails from what I can remember, but I was having enough fun that I was happy to roll with it.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

  "I was there every step of the way, I held her hand as she suffered through labor, he has my name, he is my son now...not yours." James said harshly trying as hard as he could to keep his voice low. "We both know that he isn't yours," Loki hissed back at him as he took a step forward. Warning possible Slash

  Years ago a mistake was made. Now years later the consequences of that mistake are being brought into to light. A mistake that has the potential to destroy Harry's life as he knows it. His parents aren't who they thought they were, and he's left facing a truth about himself that leaves him uncertain about his future.

  Newly emancipated 15 year old Harry Potter decides to get out of Britain for the summer and head to Vegas for his vacation, bringing along Tonks and Remus to keep him out of trouble and things he shouldn't be doing. Two days later Harry wakes up in a hotel room in bed with Tonks and a mystery woman, another mystery woman in the bathroom, Remus is missing, and next to no memory about what happened during the last two days. Want to know the whole story? Join Harry on this crazy ride to learn just what happened to Harry during those two days and what happens as a result of it all.
