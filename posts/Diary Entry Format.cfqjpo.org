Another attempt at using a different format for presenting certain functional information inside a narrative without sounding like a text book. Diary entry.

Used Dorea Black and Charlus Potter, as they are effectively built in OCs for the fandom and they fit the time period.

Dates TBD, as story and canon dictate.

Any feedback is appreciated on the format or the content!

DD-Month-YYYY

I almost lost Charlus today. He was hit with a dark cutting curse just below his ribs, and there was nothing any of the other medi-witches could do to close it. They had all written him off and left him for me to make comfortable until the end. 

Its important to know, before he was carried in on death's door, I had been treating an enemy, a prisoner of war, that none of the others would help. He was one of Grindlewald's top men, and i knew i was putting myself at risk by helping him, but i took an oath as a doctor to do no harm, and to neglect a man who i could save would be harmful, even if only in my heart.

And so, knowing this, it may make more sense why the enemy soldier, seeing me cry over my fiance, snatched my wand and cast a spell before I could blink, and when I took my wand back from his unresisting hands and turned, Charlus was no longer bleeding, nor hardly hurt at all.

I asked this man, Lieutenant of the enemy, what spell it was that could heal such a wound when even our best healers could do nothing, and he taught me the spell. The incantation and motion are quite simple, and the intent is nearly to "return to a state when you were not injured". I was able to heal six of the wounded in the tent who likely would not have made it till morning with his spell.

Tomorrow I will tell the head healer, and perhaps we can start gaining ground against the enemy. Our fighters are better than theirs, it is only the untreatable nature of dark curses that keep our ranks shrinking while theirs only expand.

What is most peculiar about this spell was the feeling I had while I was casting it and for some time after. Like stretching a long ignored and cramped muscle, or like scratching an inconvenient itch after many hours of discomfort. It made me tingle from my head to my toes, and I also felt a warmth of togetherness with each of my patients.

Truly, of Grindlewald's men have magic like this at their disposal, what else can they do? Do we stand a chance?

DD-Month-YYYY

The head healer was FURIOUS with me. Apparently the spell is classified as dangerous dark magic. She threatened to report me to the ministry and have me thrown in Azkaban if she ever finds out I used it again. I guess I will have to keep it as a last resort. Dark magic or not, I can't allow my patients to die if I have the power to save them.

DD-Month-YYYY

I used the spell again today, the healing spell they say is dark magic. A young wizard, barely out of Hogwarts, would have died without it. I managed to pass it off as normal healing. It wasn't so hard, as many DO come in with treatable injuries.

What I noticed most was that after I cast it, I was aware of how tired i had been and how much better i felt. The warmth of connectedness is an amazing thing, and i can't imagine why such a spell would be considered dark. It is as if when I use it, I give a little of myself to my patient, and once they are healed, they return a bit of themselves to me.

I am going to talk to Charlus about requesting to be moved closer to the front line. If i can get to the wounded before triage, i can heal more freely without worrying about getting caught.

DD-Month-YYYY

I am not sure what is going on. I have been on the front lines for six days now. By the second day, i had minor tremors in my hands at the end of the day. I thought it was just shock, but it hasn't stopped. But after casting the dark healing spell a few times, it goes away until well after dinner. I wonder if maybe I am getting sick, and in the process of exchange and healing, they are healing me a little in return, staving off full illness. Tomorrow is my day off, we'll see if I get sick without the healing.

DD-Month-YYYY

I think something is really wrong with me. The tremors got worse and worse throughout the day, and at dinner I dropped my spoon twice. I had to ask to be excused, claiming to not feel well. My bones and muscles ache, and I am a little dizzy. I can barely hold my pen to write. I don't think I will be able to work tomorrow.

DD-Month-YYYY

I realized what is wrong with me. It's the same as the patients who have been on certain potions for too long, and they become dependant. Have I become dependant on using this spell to feel normal? I am going to write to Charlus. I know he will be mad, but maybe he will know what to do. He is exceptional at Defence Against the Dark Arts, after all.

DD-Month-YYYY

Charlus was so furious with me... As soon as he got my letter, he rushed here to see me. I explained what had happened, from healing him till my sickness, and I think he is more mad at himself for not noticing before.

He made me promise to stop using the spell. He says it's a known side effect of certain dark magic, an addictive quality that comes from reaching into the non-physical realm. He says it is extremely dangerous, but I should be able to recover if I stop now. He wouldn't tell me what happens if you can't recover.

DD-Month-YYYY

It is getting easier every day to push aside the desire to use the spell. Charlus was right. I will have to be more careful in the future. I'm resolved to treat it the same as a potion dependancy. I will not cast it for anything other than life or death emergencies. Anyone with a chance of recovery, I treat with mundane methods.

I can't afford to lose myself to an addiction, but I also can't allow people to die for my own benefit. Charlus, at least, is writing to me again. He's asked me to get away from the front line soon, apparently Grindlewald has been coming to the field personally lately.

DD-Month-YYYY

I'm home. Finally. It feels like years, although I have only been a captive for three months. There is so much to write, I scarcely know where to begin.

I was captured, days before I was scheduled to return to the main camp in France. I had gone too far out trying to bring in our fallen soldiers, and an enemy saw me cast the spell to save a child from bleeding out.

He snatched me by the arm and then pressed what must have been a portkey into my hand. I appeared in a jail cell, alone and underground.

I learned later that I was in Numengard itself. 

I met Grindlewald face to face. His soldier had told him of the spell I used, and he said that there was an experiment that I would be part of. I refused, but he only smiled at me and said I would participate, willingly. 

I was taken to a large room with more than a dozen men and women chained to a wall. Grindlewald brought his chief of research and explained the experiment. I was to use the healing spell one after the other on each of those bound to the wall, in order from one end to the other. He told me half were his own men, and half were my own countrymen. Then he drew his wand and slashed their stomachs open with dark magic. He told me if I deviated from his instructions at all, he would disarm me and force me to watch them all die.

I had no choice. I did as I was told. The first man was easy. I thought that because of the situation, I was too stressed to notice the warmth. The second man... it brought me to my knees. It reminded me of the last night I spent with Charlus before we went to volunteer for the war, only it wasn't exactly sexual. It was an overwhelming warmth and pleasure that traveled the full length of my spine. I struggled to my feet and continued on. Every other soldier, the response was the same, until I could carry on no more. I felt such overwhelming shame and self hatred, curled on the floor, overcome with pleasure, while the last five men bled.

Grindlewald had his researcher heal the remaining men. I noticed, through my tears, that the researcher seemed to feel something as well, on half of those she healed. Was it just about healing evil men? No... it was about healing those of a more opposite nature. What I felt happened when I healed evil men. What Grindlewald's researcher felt must have been from healing those of a pure heart.

I was left to wait in my cell for a week, the withdrawal from the spell becoming more and more unbearable each day, until Grindlewald returned and offered me relief. He taught me a dark curse, a minor cutting curse used to remove fingers from thieves in the middle east. He brought one of his men, a man he said he had no more use for, and bound him in my cell. The man could not speak, his tongue so long removed that it could not be healed. His hands and head were bound, and his eyes covered. Grindlewald left him for me to feed, torture, and heal to keep myself from going through withdrawal again.

I did. I am so ashamed. I cut the man with dark magic, and healed it with dark magic, and writhed on the floor of my cell in ecstasy, until slowly, it dulled to the same warm flush as I had once felt on my own allies. 

But it was still enough to keep the tremors and aches at bay.

Finally, Albus Dumbledore defeated Grindlewald in what is being called the most incredible duel of the last century. I was released. Charlus came for me. We returned home. Now... I have to tell my fiance about what I have done, before the tremors start again.

DD-Month-YYYY

Charlus forgave me. I could see in his eyes, he was shocked and disappointed, but he wasn't disgusted or horrified by me. He will still marry me. But I fear it may be a long road to recovery for us. I can tell when he holds me, he remains just a little detached. He admits that there are long term consequences to dark magic use, and we will get through then together. He won't tell me what they are. He says dreading then won't help and inviting hypochondria would only make things worse. Better that I be surprised than to treat every hiccup with suspicion. 

DD-Month-YYYY

I am glad Charlus didn't tell me what was coming. I would have probably ran away. I hurt him, today. Badly. He was on the roof, his back to me, using his magic to repair a leaking joint. I wasn't even aware I had my wand on me when i heard my own voice. My cutting curse was not strong, but it was enough to cause him to fall.

Once I had healed him, I panicked. I tried to hide, but he held me and told me it was alright. It's normal. Those who try to stop using dark magic, especially suddenly, can have lapses of self control that aren't unlike sleep walking. The animal side of the brain takes over, and all it cares about it relief, and it is part of why dark magic use is such a serious offense. Even those who truly mean well are still a danger.

DD-Month-YYYY

Charlus is furious with himself for taking me to the party tonight. My niece Walburga got married, and invited us to a party at her townhouse in London. I had no idea what to expect, I hadn't seen Pollux for decades. I had never even met my niece. 

As soon as we arrived, I could feel it. Like a warm breeze all around me. Like the most enticing smell in the world. Dark magic practically radiated from every pore of the building. Charlus immediately tried to turn us around, but Walburga found us at that moment and invited us in to the kitchen.

We only stayed an hour, but by the time we left, I could clearly feel the effects. Leaving the house was like walking out of a warm hearth into bitter cold. The tremors lasted for days.

DD-Month-YYYY

Our son just turned five. James is a handful, but it's worth it. He's keeping us young. Well, as young as we can be kept. Apparently once you use dark magic, and then stop, your magic will slowly drain on your body, causing faster aging. I probably won't live as long as the average witch. Charlus... Charlus doesn't look much better. I asked him about it, and he told me there was a reason he knew how to help me and what to expect. What if I had not used that spell the first time? Would i have had to outlive my husband by decades?

DD-Month-YYYY

Charlus and I aren't long for this world. Our son is grown, about to be married. Hopefully Sirius will find someone too. It's a shame we won't be there to meet them. Most of our friends forget how young we are. We've been pretty isolated since the war, so no one will be suspicious. We will look like we died of old age. 

I'm proud to say, I haven't cast a dark spell in more than twenty years. Charlus had given me the option, when James was born, for us to find a safe way to use dark magic to ensure we lived long enough to see him grow up. I am not sure I made the right choice to refuse, but Charlus supported me.


** I haven't seen many of this! Why don't you try to make a full story though?

Also check [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12085137][Seven Normal years of Harry the Hufflepuff]] By TheLemonsWillSeeYou, the story is narrated by Harry reading his own diary on his last day at Hogwarts and I think it does this very well.

*** I will check it out!

I am working on outlining a full story (actually two), but it is slow going. There is a lot I want one to include, but I don't want the pacing to be a disaster.

I found a really good app for story development, and I am trying to write a little each day. Not sure where or if I will include this section, but I had the idea and wanted to write it down before I forgot.
