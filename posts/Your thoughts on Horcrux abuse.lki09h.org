So you are a particularly genre-savvy dark lord. What in your opinion is the most unfair thing you could make into a horcrux? No points for the obvious, horcruxing a random rock and throwing it into the ocean. You still want to have historically significant, magically powerful, and or terrifying magical creatures to house your soul. My idea is picking a random, old prophecy. Since if it's old enough for the people pertaining to them to be dead, not a person in the world could touch it without going crazy. Doesn't stop people to setting the whole room on fire though.


** A historically significant document, like the original draft of the Constitution on display in Philadelphia, or a copy of the Magna Carta, Etc. Historians go to a great deal of effort to preserve documents like that. Culturally significant items like the Constitution have very significant security procedures in place to keep it from people who would wish it ill; no need for complicated environments like the cavern that protect it the locket, or leaving it out in the open like the diadem. You have a large number of people dedicated to preserving your horcrux, a great deal many of whom would probably put their lives on the line if it was required to protect it. I love Nicholas Cage, but in this day and age, it would be extremely difficult to break in and steal something from the National Archives building without being shot at by security on your way out. I'm not sure if Great Britain has something that is equivalent to that, but almost any historical document of national cultural significance would do.

** Assuming you could do it without the enemy noticing, what about the hero's wand? They'd be the one protecting it over all else, and if it's linked to you it'd probably be less effective against you anyway. You'd have to be sneaky about it though, because those dastardly self sacrificing types would probably break their own wand if they found out. If the wand doesn't work, likewise something the hero themselves wants to protect.

** Well, important thing is - pick an object that, while signifcant, is not something people you're up against would think of. Most dark lords are rather localised.

So, let's say you're Voldemort, trying to get UK under control - what are you going to horcrux? Well, why bother with stuff like Hogwarts Founders' artifacts - go for something from another country to conceal it better, even if you limit yourself to magical artifacts - get one for every continent or something - i'm sure Americans (both North and South), Chineese/Japaneese, Africans and Europeans have a choice of artifacts to pick from

** In order to make a prophecy sphere into your horcrux, it would have to be about you, anyway.

I'm a fan of the idea that sending a horcrux somewhere inaccessible is a bad idea, on the notion that a person with one and no body would be stuck near the horcrux. Nearby creatures to possess for mobility would be rare or of limited use.

A Goblin-made weapon like the sword of Gryffindor might be the best bet; it would absorb anything potent enough to destroy it if unsuccessful. First expose it to a bit of fiendfyre, some Basilisk venom, Nundu breath, and if it survives then make it a horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  Though, if you're working on the Fanon idea that each Crux splits the soul evenly in half, than I will be re-absorbing my first Crux after making a living thing my 2nd, and the one I'm keeping on me my 3rd. That'll put me at 5/8 of a soul in my body, 3/4 on my person, and should hopefully prevent insanity. The living Crux will then create the last two. Two 1/16's and two 1/8's being the end result.

  If you go with the Canon idea of just a sliver each time being lost, though, then I'll simply have to ban myself from insighting rebellion through Unbreakble Vows first. I'll spend a few years working out the vows before doing that.

** If we look at all of Voldemort's Horcruxes, seemingly, the Horcruxes have to be significant to you, or have to be of importance. The Founder's Artefacts, personal diary, close companion (Nagini), Marvolo's Ring, and sworn/prophesized enemy (Harry).

If I were Voldemort, and these rules of either historical or personal importance applied, while also A) finding the most convoluted/durable Horcruxes possible, B) making them something I can reasonably protect and/or keep track of, C) rational cause for my choice, without prophetic knowledge...

- Tom Riddle's Diary: The unprofessional Horcrux, and without knowing what I was doing, this would've likely ended up where it is today - the first Horcrux, created on the death of Myrtle. (Likely have been destroyed as canon, Chamber of Secrets stabbery in 1993.)
- His own personal wand: Ideally, if I were immortal, losing my wand would be borderline impossible - they would need to steal my wand and then kill me after destroying it irrevocably. I am currently unaware of how Horcrux-Immortality works, unaware that I would be fully disarmed and reduced to Shade. (Likely would've been destroyed by Auror investigators, Severus, Sirius, Hagrid, or any of the people who went to the Godric Hallow's wreckage in 1981.)
- My Seventh Year Defense Against The Dark Arts Textbook: Because that old fool Dumbledore wouldn't give me the job, I'd curse his name, I'd curse the job, and I'd leave a Cursed object in the Room of Requirement - my secret. I made the Horcrux while on the way here, Borgin and Burkes has one less frequent customer. (Somehow, someone found the Room of Requirement, and of course it was Potter. He later managed to find the book with an Accio, burning it in 1998.)
- A timepiece for Severus Snape: My spy into Dumbledore, my perfect smokescreen. He's loyal, and I would trust him, even with the knowledge of what this object is. A gift for him, a simple elegant watch. He has served me rather well. (Only for him to betray me, explain my revival to Dumbledore, and to completely demolish it in 1982.)
- Slytherin Locket: My ancestor's locket. It would be important, yes, but it'd be the only Founder Artefact made into a Horcrux - the rest are too obvious. Ideally would hide the Locket somewhere on my person. (Due to historical significance, it wouldn't be destroyed upon Godric's Hallow, instead recovered by Albus Dumbledore and destroyed in Summer 1996 in place of Marvolo's ring).
- Harry Potter: (Exactly as in canon, unintended and the whole shebang. Upon killing him in the Forbidden Forest, my final Horcrux would vanish.)
- Wormtail's Silver Hand: My first action upon rebirth was to create this hand, and so an anchor it becomes. The death of Harry Potter would've sufficed, but instead I would have to deal with some random Death Eater. Pure silver wouldn't be able to be ground up easily or anything, so short of someone killing and burning Wormtail's hand - and no one would suspect I'd give something so important to him - it's safe. (It'd be a shame if someone Fiendfyre'd Malfoy Manor during Spring 1998 with Wormtail inside.)
- My immortal: I am Tom Marvolo Ridd-nope not making that reference. (Killed, once in 1981, and for good in 1998.)

** Wouldn't a rock Horcrux in the ocean be pointless? Who would ever activate it? A part of a soul without a chance or coming back to life.

*** Horcruxes do not need to be activated, and the part of a soul in a horcrux doesn't come back to life either.

*** I'm given to understand that a Horcrux would work like an anchor for a person's soul in the world, keeping the main spirit from moving on as long as they exist. It might even be more advantageous to keep them away from people so your small soul fragments don't posses random people and start trying to take over the world.

*** The Horcrux doesn't actually need to be 'activated' for anything. It just has to /exist/ to fulfill its function of "prevent anything from actually killing the person who made the Horcrux".

*** Unless you're reading HPMOR, in most stories a horcrux replaces your death with turning you into a spirit that can possess people, and has the inconvenient side effect that if the horcrux object itself is activated, it'll try to possess the surrounding people with an old version of your soul.
