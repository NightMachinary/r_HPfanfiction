Heavily AU Harry is the demigod son of surt the Norse giant who will destroy creation.

The Norse gods have not reformed yet only the giants and monsters. Who have existed for centuries

Ragnarok in this instance means the death of Greek and Roman culture.

The Greek and Roman gods and deities know about ragnarok but think it's a myth.

However no one has ever seen norse giants or monsters so are shocked

Harry will be grey /dark grey as in he is just doing his duty what he knows will happen.

Yet he will go dark on a few key figures

He is fighting against both Olympus and the titans and Greek giants and giea Will go through both Percy Jackson and hero's of Olympus

The wizarding world is where harry will get really dark Runes will be a big thing in the wizarding world It will go through the entire harry potter series and beyond Harry will still have his demigod power's

I may have the demigod s show up at Hogwarts 4th year

I don't whether to have a time travel element so that harry will be in the pjo verse first then travel back in time to fist year maybe have something with kronos power's being involved

Or have it be the end of 7th year harry talks to surt who recovered kronos scythe so can send harry back to save everyone and get revenge And Harry being in the pjo now verse causes ragnarok

Or just have it go Hogwarts camp Hogwarts camp ect Suggestions What do you think of the idea?


** If your fic has the same problem with punctuation as this post, I can guarantee you I won't even touch it.

Also, I haven't really seen an idea here. What is the story, whats the plot? This is all just one pile of random stuff and tropes.

** Look, torak9344, no matter [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4onzk8/a_challenge_i_thought_of_id_like_to_see_someone/][how many times you suggest it,]] no one will accept challengers here. This sub is not that kind of place.
