I've been out of the loop for a while, always been a fan but not been active online with it for years and I want to write a Romione fanfic that I've thought about but don't know where I should post it!

Where are HP fanfics posted these days? Is it still fanfiction.net? Where else?

Thanks for any help! I'll definitely also post here and in the fanfic subreddits as well!

(Also posted in other related subreddits)

EDIT: posted on both FF.net and Ao3! Username is ArrayofColours


** Most people I know post exclusively to Ao3, but a few still post to both Ao3 and ffnet. If you have an account on ffnet and are used to it then I'd definitely say go for both if you want.

** I prefer Ao3 simply because it allows you to moderate your comments better and easier than FFN.

** Fanlore has a big list of Harry Potter fanfiction communities across the internet. If you find a site you like there, you could post to it as well.

** Since the comments here seem to be full of AO3 stans so far, I'd like to point out that yes, people do still use fanfiction.net too. Both have advantages and disadvantages, and both can get plenty of reader engagement, though which one you get more engagement on can depend on the fandom, genre, etc. that you're writing.

There's really no reason not to post on both. Unless you're writing something that fanfiction.net technically doesn't allow, like explicit sexual content.

** AO3 because you can have comment threads (replies to reviews and so forth).
