So as the title says, looking for a specific fic. I think it was on Fanfiction.net but I could be wrong. It was an original twist on the alternate reality trope, in which the potters survive the Voldemort attack then later on travel to the canon (or close to it) universe. The alternate Potters are mostly the glory hound assholes mostly seen in wrong-boy-who-lived stories. It was really well done and i think it was completed but not sure. Any help finding stories like that would be appreciated.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

** This story was decent but I just couldn't finish it. The alternate Potters just annoyed me too much. So I guess props to good character design

*** I recommend you give it another go. Everyone gets what they deserve and there are some great looks into a more realistic ending to the war than ‚Äùand everyone lived happily ever after"
