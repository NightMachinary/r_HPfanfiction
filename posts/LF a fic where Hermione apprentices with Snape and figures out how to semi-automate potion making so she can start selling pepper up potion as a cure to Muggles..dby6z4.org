:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was looking through my 'saved' tab and found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9xp3l0/looking_for_fics_in_which_people_use_magic_to/e9vhcn8/?context=3][this comment]]. It seems like an interesting fic but no one found it on that thread, so I was wondering if anyone has heard of it/has a link.


** I'm actually torn about this idea.

On one hand I like magical innovation in fics; on the other it feels like a cop-out to just mass-produce magic.

Does that make sense? Unfortunately I can't help.

RemindMe! 3 days.

** Kind of reminds me of the Arithmancer Series by white squirrel on a03, idk about the snape apprentice part, but she patents a potion making set that don't require magic to make so families of muggleborns can use them. Not main to the story tho, but a great read
