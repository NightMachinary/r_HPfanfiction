I am looking for fictions where HP either has a do-over (Ã  la time travel) or is somehow wiser than the cannon HP. Also, if possible, I would like one where Harry makes allies outside of Gryffindor.

Examples would be Harry Potter: Nightmares of Future Past or Harry Potter: Dark Memories. I am not looking for something like HPMOR.

Thanks in advance.

** So I just recommended this one in another thread but it's so good i'll mention it again. Try Lightning on the Wave's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]], you will not regret it.

Also, a good time travel fic would be May Marlow's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]], which focuses on Harry going back in time to raise a more humane Tom Riddle and avoid all the atrocities that he commits. May Marlow is slow on updates but always worth the read. Her other fic [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/294722/chapters/471501][The Train to Nowhere]], an AU take on where Harry would be if he had been raised by his parents and grown up in a Voldemort-led wizarding Britain, is also really good.

** I see someone has already recommended sacrifices arc to you and I would have to agree with pescadito86, they are the greatest fan fic stories I have ever read.

** Have you read The-Caitliff's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]]? It's a bit crackish, though it does feature a wiser, time-traveling Harry and Luna who manage to save everyone (and annoy them).

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

*** Partly that HP is just too smart. But mostly that I already read up to the latest chapter.
