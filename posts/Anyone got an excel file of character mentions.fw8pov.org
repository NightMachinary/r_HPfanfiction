Hi there! Just looking for a list of how many mentions each character has in the series, ideally separated up by book (or even chapter?).

I know this sort of resource exists, but I haven't been able to find anything through google (the best lists I can find just have the top 200 characters, not all of them, and not separated by book). Thought I would ask around here to see if anybody could point me in the right direction!

Thanks in advance! :)


** If you can't end up finding it, but have the ebook version, you can make it yourself. A bit of a boring process, but really easy to do.

Download and install [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] and add the ebooks to the Calibre library.

Right click the book, and click *Edit*. This will open a new window with a bunch of icons along the top. Find the one for *Reports* - it'll have a magnifying glass and graph-like columns. Wait for it to load.

The *Words* tab is likely auto-selected, if not choose that. Then click *Save* - this will create a CSV file of every single word in the book and its frequency. Then you'll just need to delete the rows that aren't a name: you can open a CSV in Excel.

... Repeat for the next book.

*** Only own the physical copies, unfortunately, but thank you! Good to know. Might end up springing for them just for this purpose...

**** Don't be ridiculous, it took about 5 minutes to get the CSVs and upload them. I'll leave the grunt work to you though =P

Edit - Actually skimmed through one. Be aware that it counts Harry and Harry's as two separate entries, etc.

** There's those quizzes [[https://www.sporcle.com/playlists/SporcleEXP/harry-potter-characters]] There's one for each book. They have all characters in each book, sorted by a number of mentions. Seems accurate.
