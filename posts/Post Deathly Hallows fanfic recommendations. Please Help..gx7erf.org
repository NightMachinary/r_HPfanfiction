Does anyone know of any fanfics where Harry and Co work to put things back together after the war? I want no stuff about the characters staring off into the distance, getting all weepy, mourning everyone that died on and on and on and suddenly finding out that ploughing each other is the best way to get over the sadness. I tried to read something like that. That shit bummed me out. I'm looking for fanfics which focus more on how Magical Britain is rebuilt after the death of Voldemort and how the surviving Death Eaters are dealt with. Recommendations are appreciated. TYiA.

** The Sum of Their Parts linkffn(11858167) is a fanfiction post-war where Britain has been reconstruct but it may need some restructuring by Harry & co... It's a great one, to be honest.

Novocaine linkffn(13022013) is also about rebuilding the world post-war. Much more Slytherin politics than the first one, but nice read also.

I would say maybe that The Sum of Their Parts is the Gryffindor way of rebuilding and Novocaine is the Slytherin one.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
