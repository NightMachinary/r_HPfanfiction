Is there any fanfic that includes more exciting relationship development between Harry and Hermione? I never really liked this pairing but it was always something super proper or some kind of soul bond or just generally boring. So I was wondering if it is possible for me to like this pairing. I gave up reading A Marauder Plan just because it was too boring to reed Harry/Hermione

  Hermione is the Dark Lords' most prized death eater. But when he sends her on a mission to befriend Harry Potter, her sworn enemy, things don't go quite as planned. When she took the mission she never anticipated falling in love with her target. HHR

  Did you ever wonder what happened in the 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue of Deathly Hallows? Or what happens afterward? Totally, completely, and eventually H/Hr, but we have a long road to get there! Rated T for language & sexuality.

  It all started out innocent enough. I signed up for a penpal through the new system that Hogwarts was offering in order to "bring us all together in this new era". But can you really fall in love with someone through letters?

*** Well, when the characters are more complex and not all perfect, noble and "always right", when there is no stupid Ron or Dumbledore bashings with conspiracies of love potion given to Harry and Hermione to fall in love with Ginny and Ron, etc. When there is some interesting development in the relationship and when you read it you feel more excited as when you read good romance novel, you know?:) Soul bond is just not interesting at all. Hermione/Draco have some really good stories with romance development, although I'm not a huge fan of this pairing. So. Any ideas?:)

**** Basically - good HHr romance, and no bashing. Keeping those parameters in mind, here are my suggestions (I'll be putting in links, since the ffn bot seems to be down) - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5533787/1/Your-Love-Means-Everything]] , [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8954326/1/Beautiful-Boy]] , and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4703843/1/That-Old-House]] are all HHr fics that are really good. Beautiful Boy is my all time favourite HHr. Anything by Lorien829, as Karinta said above, is well done - especially [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]] , [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8693743/1/Senses]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks]] . [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister]] is post-epilogue and shows Harry's feelings start to change towards Hermione. Well written and very complex. And I know you don't like soul-bond but here's a fic that might change your feelings about that - it's one of the few soul bond fics written that has a great plot, and is interesting (and no bashing either like the rest of the fics I've recommended) - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062528/1/The-Needs-of-the-One]] .

***** So, I am halfway through Resistance by Lorien829, and I admit it's quite good, although it is not exactly what I had in mind, because it is again the story when they just admit that they have been in love for a while and just now realise they must be together. I mean, we can't see how they actually fell in love, but thank you anyway, because the story is very interesting. I'm going to check other fics you suggested, of course:)

** I'd like to second this request - even though I unlike the OP have always liked this pairing (at least as long as it doesn't turn Harry into a total simp who's being bossed around by Super!Hermione (!) or Hermione into a bimbo (she's got brains, you know? I disagree about her being the next coming of Merlin like some fanfiction writers portrait her, but she's certainly not stupid - as long as her brain isn't clogged up by authority worship or because she's following the beaten path and can't think outside the box...as long as she's free of those constraints she's pretty smart!))...still, something off the beaten path would be great (secret affair, Hermione wanting to practice snogging (in order not to be bad at it when trying it with the one she has set her eyes on) and realising that Harry would make a better boyfriend, them leaving the country because of bad/oppressive Dumbledore etc. etc. - whatever makes for a great story!)

*** I also really hate Super!Hermione and I just feel like every time there is Harry/Hermione pairing it starts with Harry suddenly realising that she's always been the one true love for him. I'd like something that explores their friendship outside of the trio, and then slowly leads to romance. For example, it would be believable if on Horcrux hunt when Ron left, Hermione and Harry started talking about more personal things, discovering some common beliefs and ideals, they both grew up in muggle world after all so it also could be common ground for them. Then it would be nice to introduce some physical attraction which would lead to maybe some kissing/snogging. It doesn't have to be explicit or anything but I would like to see some passion. It would be more interesting if the story was a bit more dark, in comparison to stories that show Harry/Hermione as paragons of goodness and propriety.
