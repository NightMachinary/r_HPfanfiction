I'm looking for fics which have interesting battles/duels that are exciting and use more spells than just stupefy and avada kedavra. Preferably the avada kedavra would have a weakness, like it needed an immense amount of magic to use or was cripplingly slow because otherwise why would anyone use any other curse?

*** I can't stress enough how wonderful this fic is. It also has probably the most disappointing sequel of any fic i've ever read though.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza][Shezza]]'s Denarian series is the first that comes to mind. He wrote a tutorial on DLP for how to write a good action scene.

Most of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern][jbern]]'s stories feature interesting fight scenes with a variety of spells.

**** Yeah. Back when he was a more active member, he'd give WBA pointers to starting writers. Those are also worth reading.

*** Shezza's battle/fight scenes are good until you notice that they do not respect the self-consistency of the story in general.

It doesn't matter how powerful the battling sides are, their spells will either be missing or inflicting “minor” amounts of damage as long as the author wants to continue the battle scene. After that, when he decides that there is enough “awesomeness” poured into the current battle, the plot armours will be removed and only then will the battle be allowed to end.

Because of this the battles were unrealistic in their own universe, which effectively made them irrelevant/boring to me as the reader.

*** Aye I've read all of jbern's complete stories more than once. I've not read Shezza's Denarian series as its abandoned and I didn't like the first few chapters.

**** Shezza's series is effectively complete. After the first handful of chapters, it gets quite a bit better (if you wanted impetus to stick to it).

** Darklordmike has a decently-written story, but it is incomplete. Features a powerful Harry, manipulative (evil? pragmatic?) Dumbledore.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Temporal Beacon]] has a couple during the Tournament. The Firebird Trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]] also has quite a few.

** I always thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/9/Delenda-Est][the duel]] in Delenda Est was quite good. I can't remember others though, whether due to absence or the fact they didn't imprint themselves on my memory I'm not sure. So it may be less the fight itself than the circumstances and details surrounding it. Just reread it and it is still decent but probably not as amazing as I remembered.

*** Yeah, but it's way too epic a fight scene to be mentioned here. Plus, it's pretty much a speed run of the second wizarding war... Wait, that sounds glorious. Idea!
