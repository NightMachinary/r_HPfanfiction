So there's three big schools in Europe: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. Hogwarts takes students from the UK and Ireland. Beauxbatons takes students from France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium. And then Durmstrang takes... everyone else? And it's somehow smaller than Hogwarts? There's obviously at least one other school in Europe. Where do you think it is? And from what countries do you think it takes its students?


** There are four, not three: there's also a school in Russia called "Koldovstoretz". This may or may not exist depending on your definition of canon, but it is from materials created by JKR, so it's likely that when she reveals further schools, Koldovstoretz will be there.

Also, Durmstrang is larger than Hogwarts in terms of student numbers, as is Beauxbatons:

#+begin_quote
  Beauxbatons Academy has a preponderance of French students, though Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Luxembourgians and Belgians also attend in large numbers (both Beauxbatons and Durmstrang have a larger studentship than Hogwarts).
#+end_quote

In any case, not every country is "covered" by a school. The international norm is not to attend one of the large, prestigious schools, but rather either:

A) Attendance at smaller, more itinerant schools.

B) Home schooling.

#+begin_quote
  The number of countries that have their own magical school is minuscule compared to those that do not*. This is because the wizarding populations of most countries choose the option of home schooling*. Occasionally, too, the magical community in a given country is tiny or far-flung and correspondence courses have been found a more cost-effective means of educating the young.

  There are eleven long-established and prestigious wizarding schools worldwide, all of which are registered with the International Confederation of Wizards. *Smaller and less well-regulated institutions have come and gone*, are difficult to keep track of, and are rarely registered with the appropriate Ministry (in which case, I cannot vouch for the standard of education they might offer). Anyone wishing to know whether there is an approved magical school in their region should address an owl enquiry to the International Confederation of Wizards, Educational Office.

** To my understanding, (and like other commenters have said) there's Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, and Koldovstoretz that cover all of Wizarding Europe. Personally, I think this doesn't make much sense, even if you account for homeschooled students. In my AU, I add three more schools. The Irish Academy of Magic is very small, and takes only students from Ireland. (Students from Northern Ireland still attend Hogwarts). Olympus is located in Greece, and takes students from Greece, Macedonia, Albania, Turkey, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ferviditious is located in Italy, and takes students from Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Hungary, and Croatia.

I've also tweaked the catchment areas for some of the canon and semi-canon schools. Durmstrang is located in Northern Scandinavia, and serves Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland. Koldovstoretz serves all of Russia plus the majority of former Soviet satellite nations not already named under other schools.

This is just my two-cents -- the more I think about Rowling's education system, the less it seems to make sense. If I think about the issue more, there should probably be a school located somewhere close to Bulgaria, but then that messes with what we know about Durmstrang from canon.

*** Why would Durmstrang serve Germany and Ferviditious take Austria? Wouldn't it make more sense to have a school for the German-speaking part of Europe? Plus, with the development of modern languages, what language would these schools teach in? Would students be forced to learn a new language immediately? I'd like to see Chessmaster take this on because it would be something to explore.

**** Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived had Harry have to learn German to attend Durmstrang. (Durmstrang also uses a lot of misdirection, like encouraging the rumor that it's in Siberia.)

** There's 1 mage per every 1000 people by jkr's statement at some event. That means a worldwide population of 7 million mages. In the US, there's approximately 24 million children age 12-17 or 1 kid of hogwart's age per thirteen people in the US(that means 12,400 kids at ilvermorny!). With the US pop being approximately 5% of the world population, we can somewhat unsafely assume world hogwarts age children to be 480 million or approximately 8%. That means If you break that down by national populAtions, you can then have a good working number for how many kids should be at hogwarts(2600 I believe?) or comparable schools by their population.

It is two am here and my math could be fucked.

** I assumed that there would be smaller, less significant schools scattered around Europe, while Beauxb√¢tons and Durmstrang are basically the Russell Group, Ivy League and so on of European magical education.

Where do the Scandinavian and Eastern European Muggleborns go? (Possibly even before Karkaroff; if their leanings weren't towards blood purism, why would they ever let a war criminal take over as headmaster?)

I also compeletely disregard anything about the uninspired Google Translated Academies of Magic, such as Castelobruxo and Mahoutokoro.

*** Rowling said that Hogwarts is the only school for Britain and that there are only 4 in Europe (some weird Russian one is number 4), but the problem goes far deeper.

How is the magical world administrated? Or more specifically, how are the borders. The whole statue of secrecy went into effect in the 1700s. At that time, there was no Bulgaria for example, but you had Prussia or a multitude of states in Italy as well as the mess called HRE. Since I don't see Wizards bowing to Muggles and suddenly considering themselves members of a different country just because the Muggles say so, where does that leave administration? Are Muggleborns forced to accept the Ministry from a country which muggle counterpart is actively killing their family (the whole Balkan in the 90s for example)? How and why do magical borders change? Are muggleborns forced into a school where they don't understand a single word? Are they forced to pay taxes, and if so to whom? How do they pay for their education and who covers the expenses if the parents cannot?

It doesn't really impact Britain after the Act of Union, but the rest of Europe underwent massive, frequent changes. I have hoped that Rowling would touch onto these issues at some point, but instead we got more next gen stuff.

**** Hermione did say that most wizards and witches were half-bloods (i.e. have muggle relatives), so I'm pretty sure that the events in the muggle world do affect the wizarding societies as well.

After Mahoutokoro, I'm not sure if I'd want to hear her going on about non-British stuff...
