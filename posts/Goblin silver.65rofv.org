Is there any story that say's that goblin silver is just platinum that's been enchanted?


** I'm ~98% certain it is goblin steel, not silver.

And not that I know of.

** Why would yoy call a RARE metal by a common(by comparison) metal's name?

*** It's not completely impossible, to be honest. If you had people who did not as of yet know about something and in the situation they saw it looked close enough to something else, it could be given a name based on that.

Now, while I doubt there are any stories where you'd have that happen to platinum as with metals it generally tends to be applied to alloys that are either not yet known or no longer popular and thus somewhat obscure, and I have no idea why would the kind of request that this post has be necessary for something, I will note that I did see people, maybe not in-universe but certainly in a discussion about it, refer to mithril from Tolkien's stories as “dwarven silver”. Sure, it may just be an outlier, but it's similar enough and there are people doing that.

*** I was trying to say that a few centuries before humans discovered platinum that it may have been called goblin Silver, but after its finding that humans would call it platinum if the animosity between goblins and human beings are so high.

**** A random note: I do not think that people who did not have enough contact with platinum to recognise it as something not created by the goblins would be able to actually distinguish it from silver to the point where they'd give it a name rather than just think “well, it's silver”. Neither platinum nor silver generally get much ... hmm, let's say “utility-related use”, unless you are going into more modern technology, which means that it is unlikely people would actually feel the difference in any way, and appearance-wise platinum can look close enough to silver to consider it just that.
