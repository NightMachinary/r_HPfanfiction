  Parallel universe time travel? Natasha Romanoff has done it. Killed lots and lots of people? Done it. Been killed herself? Done it. But meeting Death himself and being introduced to a universe where it isn't alien invasions but baby's who stop dark lords? Now that's a new one. And who is she to refuse when Death hands her an orphan whose being hunted by terrorists? Simply put, she might need little Harry as much as he needs her.

** this one is not so much he has an agenda but is an interesting idea.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2207152/1/Dark-Angel]] Dark Angel Â» PreHBP Harry saves the lives of Snape and Malfoy, finds out he's Salazar Slytherin, and Dumbledore makes him spend the summer with the the two Slytherins. Not long after that, he's thrown back in time to the Marauder's era. Semidarkish with some laughs.

  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.
