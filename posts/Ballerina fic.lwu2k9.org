:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey,

I read a fic years ago about a muggleborn oc that I think was two years below the marauders but really good friends with them. I think it was sirius/oc. the oc was a muggleborn girl who was also a really good ballerina i think it was on ffn.

I have tried looking for it but haven't been able to find it again.


** I remember one fanfic that had Sally Anne Perks eventually leave Hogwarts to take up ballet, but I don't remember which one that is, or if that is even the one you're looking for.

*** I think this one is The Best Revenge (and/or its sequel, The Best Revenge: Time of the Basilisk), by the late Arsinoe de Blassenville. Wonderful stories. Sally-Anne Perks (who is barely mentioned in canon?) is a Muggleborn who comes to Hogwarts despite desperately wanting to continue her ballet training. She's not a primary focus of the story, but she allows exploration in the story of the interesting possibility of there being valuable and desirable pursuits other than magic, and ones that some children might actually love more.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  AU: The continuation of Book I. Not all of Tom Riddle is gone. A mysterious journal and a new Defense teacher pose challenges for Harry and his guardian. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva.
