THIS STORY IS OLD AND NOT AT ALL CANON. Harry and Hermione are in a relationship that has become unsatisfactory to Hermione before their seventh year because Harry is increasingly more interested in sex and less concerned with being good partner. She tries to maintain her course load and Head Girl duties while attempting to keep up with Harry's physical needs but struggles, especially after Draco uses her nightly indiscretions to blackmail her into doing all of his work as well. She eventually finds Harry and Ginny together. Even though she is betrayed, she is vilified by Harry, who accuses her to be the one who cheated, blames their problems on her, etc. Her only friend Ginny won't speak to her, and she discovers (through a magical tea for women) that her increasing fatigue and illness is due to an unplanned pregnancy. The last chapter I ever found was where a softening Draco discovers her secret and is attempting to care for her after a fainting spell.

A few more specific details: Ginny is the person who unwittingly causes the pregnancy; when sewing something at the Burrow, she sticks one of her needles into the fabric of Harry's pants and accidentally punctures a condom, what she thought sounded like a crinkly candy wrapper. Hermione and Draco have neighboring private living quarters that can be redecorated at the start of term- Hermione elects to keep the blue/bronze colors of her predecessor Cho Chang, but not the password she had chosen, 'Harry Potter.' Harry asked her to use the password 'Snitch' as it reminds him of another dirtier word that he likes. Draco's password is 'Mudblood', I think. One chapter is titled Pickled Gherkins, as it is what Draco brings Hermione when attempting to mend fences between them. Draco drink's Hermione's pregnancy test tea by mistake and worries it will make his chest hair fall out. Hermione is internally surprised he even has chest hair.

The details are random, I know. My own searching is getting me nowhere... Please help!
