Any recent, or old stories where Harry can steamroll everyone. Dumbledore, easy win. Voldemort, in his sleep. I want to have this list here(that i'll repost every 6 months) so that 1, I can always induldge in OP Harry stories. 2, everyone else can also find one, and 3, so that there aren't so many posts asking for ones with conditions. That means any story(slash, or straight. Creature, or MOD, anything) is accepted, as long as Harry is able to make Albus, and Voldemort look like first years in comparison to him.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

** Harry is A literal God in /Dark and Light/

He fights Voldemort to a standstill while smiling smugly the entire time in /What's a Little Death Between Friends/

He's Death incarnate in /On a Pale Horse/

/Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is/, has a Harry who has been reborn so many times that nothing really phases him.

Also, if you don't mind crossovers set in a different universe, both /I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For/ and /Chrysochlorous/ have him derive some serious power from his status of Master of Death.

Harry burns an entire army of Inferi using Fiendfyre, kills several Death Eaters and rips the souls of Voldemort and Crouch Jr to shreds. All within a couple of minutes. He is skilled and powerful enough to transfigure entire ward structures to water without effort.

He eventually ends up becoming the master of the Hallows and of Death.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
