I'm looking for post-war/post-hogwarts fic recs that feature the trio. Romione is a must but there's no other ships in particular I'm looking for (unless you know of some good h/h/r fic) I mostly just want something with the trio hanging out a lot and being buds.

Harry/Ginny makes me squeamish and I have a hard time w straight!Harry but I'll take it if it's what you've got. I'm into drarry and Ginny/Luna but neither are must for me. I more am just looking for something with the trio that has like gay or gay friendly vibes if you know what I mean. Ideally not too cracky.

Some fics that come to mind as examples of what I love are [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/234550][and yes i said yes i will yes (or: four weddings and a funeral)]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278][hghcfdotr]],. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9794657][what we pretend we can't see]]


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916][there will come a time, you'll see]] by aloneintherain) has the trio maintain a very close friendship, Hermione and Ron are married, Harry is bi, and in general it's a very LGBT friendly fic.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315][tell me whether he is dead]] by LullabyKnell) has them move in together post-war and there's some mystery but it's pretty lighthearted and overall it's a very sweet fic! Also they love each other a lot.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630][The Sum of Their Parts]] by holdmybeer) is darker than the rest of these, but the trio sure would die for each other and get a whole new level of close.

  They have Shepard's pie for dinner. Ron and Hermione watch Harry fill up his plate and only start serving themselves when he picks up his fork and starts eating. Neville laughs into his wine glass.“How are you dealing with their mothering, Harry?” he asks.Ron opens and closes his mouth for a minute, groping for an excuse. Eventually, Ron says, “He's just so small, Nev.”“Hey,” Harry says. “I'm seventeen. I'm an adult.”Ron shakes his head at Neville. “My best friend is an infant.” A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione. Based off this tumblr post.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Post-DH AU: Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying. “Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me." “What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?”
