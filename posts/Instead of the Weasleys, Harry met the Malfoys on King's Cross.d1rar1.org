There, he met his best friend Draco Malfoy who apologized for his behaviour in Madam Malkin's. They both shared a compartment in Hogwarts Express, and Draco convinced Harry that Slytherin is the best house in Hogwarts. They have a grand adventure in their first year. From saving a Slytherin muggleborn girl Hermione Granger from a troll to keeping Voldemort from getting the Philosopher's Stone.

On the following years, Harry always go to Malfoy Manor on the summer holiday and he always having a good time there. He loved his best friend and his family, and in his sixth year he begin to fall in love with Draco's little sister, Lyra.

But he doesn't realize that he's playing into the hand of Manipulative!Lucius. The Malfoys only befriend Harry to gain control of his finance, they poisoned him with love potion every summer. Their ultimate goal is a control of his title, Lord Potter-Preverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin. They plan for Harry to have an 'accident' a few years after his wedding with Lyra.

.

Basically the usual Indy!Harry with character bashing but with character that are more likely to do it.


** I'd read it , if it was well written of course , would be a bit tropey but atleast its a change of pace and makes more sense than the usual Indy!Harry
