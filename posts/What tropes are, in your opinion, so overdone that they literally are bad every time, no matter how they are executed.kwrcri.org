** I don't think there's any such thing as a trope being bad just because a lot of people have done it. The writing and execution is everything.

** Bashing, regardless of who it's directed at. It comes across to me as petty.

Dumbledore and/or Harry as evil. It comes across to me as contrarian just for the sake of being contrarian.

** Any response to the Don't Fear the Reaper challenge.

This may be due to the fact that the challenge itself is so detailed in its requirements that the opening scenes are universally so horrible that the story is unreadable.

The only good one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12332402][a subversion]].

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Dont-fear-the-Reaper-reptilia28-s-Challenge/70135/]]

And some of them are not completely horrible:

- “Reboot by Kallanit” linkffn(9552519)
- “A Fair Life by Rtnwriter” linkffn(13285012) ... although, I am not so sure about this one ... it started rather nice, but now it turns into femslash lemon and not much more.

***** That is ridiculously specific. Also appears to time travel paedophilia so hard pass even if it wasn't Harmony.

** When I first started reading fanfic I used to run into this alot, and I haven't recently. I'm not sure I adjusted my searches or have been subconciously ignoring them. But, fics where Harry walks into Gringotts, gets an inheritance test and the entire chapter is a printout of how many billions of galleons are in the vault, how many powers have been blocked, how many marriage contracts he has, etc

Hell, I don't even mind that stuff for the most part. But anytime entire chapter is devoted to this list, it's going to suck. No exceptions.
