** The Fallout by everythursday is WONDERFUL. For fluff The Politicians Wife (sorry, forgot author!) is also fantastic.

EDIT:

I just thought of this, but if you want Draco/Hermione and Snape/Hermione, [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=14][The Fool, The Emperor, and the Hanged Man by ianthe_waiting]] has both, and I found it an enjoyable read. It might not be everyone's cup of tea though.

And its equally superb sequel called [[https://web.archive.org/web/30151115140856/http://www.witchfics.org/abby/survival.html][Survivals and Remembrances]] where Lucius seeks revenge on Snape by blackmailing him against Hermione.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9993319/1/The-Young-Adventurer-s-Club][The Young Adventurer's Club]] is a good HG/SS story for people who don't normally like the ship. There's time travel and adventure and it's very AU while also kind of being canon compliant.

** Here's a Snape/Hermione oneshot to get you started, to see if you like the pair. Not pedophilic, non-abusive. I go back to it now and then because it's a good, quick read, maybe half an hour... linkffn(Resolute by PositiveVortex)

  Hermione and Severus share some after work drinks, and learn more about each other's private lives than they could have predicted. And what effect is the wine having?
