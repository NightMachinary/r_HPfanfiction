I'm looking for some good, post-DH fanfic that is compliant with the epilogue. I've already read all of Northumbrian and little0bird. Can anyone point me to something new? I prefer novel length stories, but I've learned the value of shorts thanks to Northumbrian. Help a guy out, please.

  Starts the morning after the Final Battle. Follow along as Harry and Ginny live through the next few years and learn how to deal with the after-effects of the war, and try to live the life they deserve. Main focus is H/G but lots of other characters

And its sequel:

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to 'Learning to Live Again'. Read itt first so the original characters/scenes in this story make sense. Set on January 4, 2002. On their first year of marriage Harry and Ginny receive the customary wizarding gift from friends and family.

*** The first is over 240k words and the second is just shy of 90k. I myself am not a fan of post Hogwarts stories for some reason but I did like these.

**** I started Learning to Live Again, but I'm having some problems with it. The first one came in the second or third chapter when Arthur told Harry he couldn't stay at the Burrow. It just wasn't at all the Weasley way. It didn't fit. Then a few chapters later Harry and Ron are practicing to try out for the Cannons? I'm going to keep going, but I'm approaching these with reservations for right now.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=127805][Shut and Be a Bud Again]] keeps canon pairings and runs from the aftermath of the battle through the next year. Sadly looks like it was abandoned in-progress but the first major story arc (chapters 1-19 or so) pretty much could stand alone. I think it has some really good character development and plausibly shows how Harry in particular could be feeling, though the writing and plotting gets a bit weaker in the later chapters IMHO.

** I'm still working on mine, but you should check it out. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10162339/1/One-Summer][One Summer]] was a project I started for NaNoWriMo last November, but I couldn't finish it. I try to update fairly quickly, and I'm not doing much right now, so I got plenty of time.

** Thanks for this post. I'm looking for some new fics as well, and like you, I've already read both Little0Bird and Northumbrian's stories. Great, but I'm looking for other ones. Actually, most of the stories people recommend, I've already read... It's just been a while since DH was released and so most of the older fics have been floating around for a while.

Good suggestions by posters, though. There's also a story called /Starting Over/ by serendipity_50 over at Livejournal. She's got a sequal to it called /Inner Demons/. I thought both stories were pretty good. Ginny's a little bit... dramatic, but it's a decent story, I think. Give it a shot.

Here's the link to her stories:

**** here's the exact comment I put on another post like this

"'After the War' is exceptionally long and has a LOT of detailed info on them training, catching people after bk7, their lives. and 'Harry's Future' follows in the same vein, but Harry quickly becomes head of the MLD and turns it around, its clever and knowledgeable, and involves a year at the start where he returns to Hogwarts for his education. I honestly would reccomend Harry's Future, as it has more plot in it and different arcs, like a proper book, as does it's sequel 'Professor Potter', and the sequel to that. Currently 3 books in the saga and they are incredibly long, they'll do you for awhile. But don't discount After The War either! [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4335716/1/Harry-s-Future]] [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6350739/1/Harry-Potter-After-the-War]] I'd personally recommend both. Read After The War first, as there is some brilliant quidditch stuff in there, auror training, ect. Then move onto Harry's Future as the worldbuilding is much better and its a longer and more fleshed out series with multiple books. I can reccomend more once you're done"
