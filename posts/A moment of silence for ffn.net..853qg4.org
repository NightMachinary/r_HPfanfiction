** It's just DOWN, not GONE. The "moment of silence" thing is only for when someone has died, not for when they've just taken a day off because they were sick.

** Regardless of the OP being correct, this has become more and more frequent lately. FFN used to go down once or twice a year, now it is twice a month or more often. If I were an author, I would make sure I had my stories mirrored off site.

Plus, given how largely uninvolved/uncaring the mods are there, it is not a bad idea.

*** I'm not an author on FFN, but honestly the logical thing to me seems to post on FFN & AO3 (at least for backup reasons if you only like one of the 2), and to keep your writings on your computer too (+ cloud).

*** Why? I've always wondered why it's banned in some countries. Can't imagine my, probably because I'm in a country that's big on not censoring stuff.

***** never ask for logical concistency or even people to not be hypocrites. Banning porn is hard since everyone watches it, banning FF.net is easy, it is after all only for "geeks and degenerates".
