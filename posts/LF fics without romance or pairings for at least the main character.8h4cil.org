Most of the fics I've read handle romance as well as trucks do the 11 foot 8, what are some good ones that either sideline it or ignore it completely.


** Alright then, you've probably read them but here are a few:

Realignment Linkffn(12331839) It's a story about (sort of grey) Tom Riddle in 1943, a time-travelling Harry seems to have come to try and hunt him down. Dumbledore and Grindelwald's conflict is going on throughout and the fight scenes are fantastic.

Harry Potter and the Mysterious Curse of the Girl-Who-Lived Linkffn (6343543) It is possible that there will be romance in the future, but it seems unlikely at present: Harry Potter appears to be under a curse which makes everyone /think/ that he's a girl. People are actually unable to call him Harry or say that he is a boy. Hard to say where it is going, but I'd argue it's pretty good at present. Harry is definitely not interested in any romance and I think he's only 12 at this point.

The Evil Overlord List Linkffn(10972919) It's another young Voldemort story. In this case he's been taken under the wing of a voice in his head who calls himself Jerry. Their objective seems pretty simple and deducible from the title: conquer the world whilst avoiding stupid mistakes.

Elizium for Sleepless Souls Linkffn(7713063) I think it's best to just let the author's summary speak for this one: 'The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems.'

That Which Holds the Image Linkffn(7156582) A Doctor Who/Harry Potter crossover. A boggart becomes a weeping angel and Harry and the Doctor have to stop it. Romance need not apply.

Practically anything from The Wayland Smith ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4263138/]]). Even the one story they have centred on James and Lily is mainly a comedy about James committing murder. Most recently The Lord in the Mist Linkffn(12717563) A story which seems to be about a (sort of grey/sort of good) dimension jumping Lord Voldemort.

**** It's a bit different, I think he decided to go off down the odder parts of his imagination. Still thoroughly enjoyable for my money. /The Lord in the Mist/ appears to be the third story though, the /Traveller/ is the immediate sequel.

***** Don't know, I haven't read any of them. Have an upvote though. I'll try something: linkffn(12331839; 6343543; 10972919; 7713063; 7156582; 12717563)

Edit: Yep, you want a lower case L on 'linkffn'.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  The year is 1996. The Second Wizarding War is in mid-swing. A mysterious traveller from another dimension is searching for a forbidden text, whilst someone (or something) pursues him. With an overworked Dumbledore by his side it's time for a retired dark lord to save the world.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
