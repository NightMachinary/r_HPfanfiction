I was looking through my old folders when I found printed copies of Cauterize and Anything but Slytherin (from about 2011) - they were my favorite fics, and I used to read them all the time when I couldn't use my phone eg. in class. Sometimes I just enjoyed having them around as a physical reminder of a world I could escape into anytime.

I know that you can buy a copy of Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, but I don't actually know anyone who bought one, so I got curious.

***** Oh god, it's not that at all!

I just think we're bloody lucky JK Rowling allows us to write fanfic. Plenty of authors don't allow fanfic and threaten sites with legal action if they host it. We're borrowing her universe and her characters and it's really shitty to profit off her good faith in that way.

********* I'm afraid I disagree. I think fanfic is a wonderful thing and I think authors who accept, and even encourage it, are brilliant people. But at the end of the day, the worlds, characters and plots they created are theirs, and they don't owe us anything. For some arsehole to use it to profit is a huge slap in the face.

Creative skills are constantly devalued. Creatives are expected to work for free, whether for "experience" or as a "favour", they face an industry overwhelmingly propped up by nepotism, and they face constant assumptions that their skills are merely hobbies. You wouldn't be able to use any other professional's work in this way, so we should be grateful that we can for fanfic.

I'm not saying we shouldn't be able to write fanfic, at all. I'm saying that whoever is selling DAYD, and whoever has bought it... They're immoral. They make the community look bad. They discourage authors from allowing fanfic sites to host fics based from their work. And we should overwhelmingly criticise them.

*********** You're still talking about creatives though. This is what I mean, people are able to use their work a lot, and that's great and something that should be protected, but it leads to a culture that devalues things like art, music and literature. It makes it so much harder to protect that right (that we should be insanely grateful for and respectful of) when people stop using fanfic as a hobby and start trying to change it into something that personally profits them.

Oh god, there's loads of /terrible/ fanfic out there. My Immortal is the go-to, but it's basically a big joke. At least DAYD had a plot, even if it was poorly written, overly-angsty, ridiculous and had racist and sexist undertones.

** In school I did occasionally print off some chapters of whatever fic I was reading so I could read at any time without hogging the school computers. (I got kicked off them more than once because I was reading fics while other people needed to do actual work; and it was a boarding school so we're not just talking during school hours.) I didn't have to worry about paying for paper/ink then, plus they had laser printers so a lot quicker than my inkjet.

But these days printing costs me paper and ink, and it's way easier just to download for my ereader.
