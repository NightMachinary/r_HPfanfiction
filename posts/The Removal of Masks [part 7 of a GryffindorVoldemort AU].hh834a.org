James Potter is facing the worst. There is nothing to fear.


** Nice new chapter, you addressed most of my questions about the last one.

Two more questions though:

- In one of your previous chapters, Bellatrix seems already be with the Lestrange brothers, so shouldn't she be Bellatrix Lestrange instead of Black?
- Can Riddle track James through the dark mark?

Good to hear!

Oh, geeze, thanks for catching that. My only excuse is that I wrote "I Have Killed a Man for Wounding Me" almost two years ago, and Bellatrix's marital status was one of the things I didn't think to take notes on or double-check.

No. Even the lethal application of the Dark Mark is more of a "once it's set off, it keeps running on its own" sort of thing.

Maybe you want to explain that in your story, because lots of readers /expect/ Riddle to track his Death Eaters via the Dark Mark.

***** I added it to the story notes on all three sites. Thanks for the suggestion. That /is/ something which might trip some people up (on SV, someone was asking about the "Point Me" spell, too).

(As far as I can tell, though, the Dark Mark tracking thing is fanon, which is why I wrote things as I did.)
