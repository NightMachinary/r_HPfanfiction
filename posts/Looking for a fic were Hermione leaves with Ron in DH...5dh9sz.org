  Hermione and Ron both leave Harry behind in the tent. Neither return, and were among the few to escape Britain when Voldemort took over. Years later, their daughter Rose has joined an ICW operation that tries to stop Voldemort's power from spreading beyond Europe. However things take an unexpected turn when she discovers what became of Harry Potter. Ron Bashing and Deaths.

*** Unintended Consequences is H&G is a good fic. There is a fair bit of Ron & Hermione bashing, which I quite like, but that's because Hermione is my least favourite character.

**** In the first book, Hermione isn't very likeable, but she's not that bad. Ron bashing I can understand, to a point, as he's not the brightest, and sometimes, like in Book 4, even JKR did some.

  SPOILERS! When Ron runs out on Harry in the Horcrux hunt, Hermione decides to go with him, leaving an irrational and angry Harry all by himself in the forest. On HIATUS until September of 2016. It will be finished, I promise! Remember, good things come to those who wait.
