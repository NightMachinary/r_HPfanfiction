** There was a story, where Grangers visited Dursleys instead of Masons, as representatives of some kind of UK dentist association. Anybody knows what I am talking about?

*** I do kind of remember it. Dentists do use drills, after all.

Gut feeling says it's one of the ones where they end up adopting Harry.

**** There was one where the Dursleys weren't abusive and Petunia had an account on Gringotts (she had a pseudonym) that she couldn't access because Dumbledore blocked her from finding magical places and stuff and she was the "magical guardian" of Harry /and/ Hermione. ^{But I dropped this one.}
