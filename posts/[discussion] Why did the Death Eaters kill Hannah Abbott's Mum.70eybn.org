Or why do you think they did?

edit: It's been a while since I've properly posted on this page so soz for the awkward repeat in the title.


** Well Hannah is a half-blood and the Abbot family is pure-blood. This necessarily means fraternization with non-magicals.

Them death eaters done put down a muggle loving blood traitor.

*** God the Death Eaters were simple.

I suppose I was hoping for something more, which was why I fact checking in case the wiki hadn't been updated.

Just makes my fanfiction a little less canon now.

**** Well if you want to spice it up Hannah's mom could have been in an illicit relationship with a death eater.

Planning to elope to America at the end of Hannah's year, get found out, forced to kill the woman he's dating because she's a blood traitor.

Make it so the dad was killed in an auto-accident when Hannah was 5 years old to remove him from the picture.

***** I was more going down the line of Hannah's mum being a sort of magic researcher, doing studies on habits of wizards and sometimes how they compare to muggles. She starts examining kids environments based on surveys of first years, and how their genes may factor in their ability of magic alongside their own personal regimes, only to come across some strange findings that may debunk the theories spread from the Pureblood purist movement and upon publishing it with her academic partner Charity Burbage.

It's a side plot in a bigger fanfic, but I feel it could be threatening enough to make the Death Eaters actually want to quash something.

****** Sure, go for it. Nothing canon specifically contradicts that.

** Hannah Abbott was a half-blood, the rest of her family was pure-blood. That could be a canon-compliant explanation.

I like [[/u/ForumWarrior]]'s theory though. I have no doubt that Voldemort wouldn't tolerate such relationships.

** The Abbots were more than simply pureblood, weren't they part of the so called Sacred Twenty-eight? So they probably thought them worse than the Weasleys, because they were at least still pure, despite being blood traitors. That's why even though Bill and Fleur had to hide, Mr, Mrs, Percy, and Ginny were fine. Even Ron was, as long as he stayed put 'ill in bed'. They targeted open dissidents, and crossbreeding. And muggleborns, of course. Half bloods were ok, muggleborns and creatures not.
