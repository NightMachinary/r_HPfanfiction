"Harry Potter" said dumbledore. Everyone was frozen like after seeing a basilisk.

Some people started crying while other couldn't believe what they heard.

I mean everyone could be sad after hearing that the name of the person who died two years ago in the chamber of secrets after saving Ginny Weasley came out of the goblet.

** As Harry's name was read aloud in the Great Hall, the magic of the Goblet of Fire rushed to seek out Harry Potter and bind him to the contract.

+----+

2 years ago, Harry battled Slytherin's Basilisk and upon defeating it, the great beast fell to the floor, crushing his legs and pinning him to the ground. A tiny golden bird impaled on a long tooth and a lot of ash lay inside the mouth of the basilisk as it had snatched him out of the air following the loss of its eyes.

Ginny managed to awake and seeing Harry, presumed dead, laying there fled the chamber with she and Ron climbed up the pipe, leaving Lockhart to wander the chamber with no memory. Once out, no one was able to enter the chamber to recover either of them.

Waking up later on to the cries of a child, Harry discovered his predicament. Trapped and without the use of his legs, all hope was lost. But then there was the cry again 'mother, wake up, wake up' Harry looked around but couldn't see anyone, so he called out, 'who's there? I can't see you?' He heard slithering and immediately closed his eyes. A voice called 'did you do this to my mother?' the voice sounded scared and angry, but mostly scared.

Harry felt sick, just as his mother had been taken from him, he had taken the mother of this young snake. 'I'm sorry, your mother was attacking students in the school, she had brought my friend's sister down here to die, I had to save her.'

The voice of the hatchling replied with the same anger and sadness, 'It was not her, it was me. My mother could no longer fit in the pipe to the school, or the one to the lake. I do all her hunting for her. And just like when the boy came years ago, the girl came this time to tell me to assist him in purging the school.'

Harry became even more sad,' So your mother was just defending you? I am so sorry, I didn't know. But now I am dying too. I won't be able to leave here.'

The young snake replied. 'I can put you to sleep instead, just like I did to the other children.'

'You mean you intentionally petrified the children. In the school?' Harry asked with surprise

'My eyes are too young to kill like my mother's' responded the snake, if you look into my eyes, you will stay the same, until someone revives you.'

'It bears dying I guess,' Harry said.

As he opened his eyes, he saw the young snake, nearly 10 meters long coming closer. The young snake said, right before looking in his eyes, 'I now perform for you the same service that my mother did for Lord Slytherin back when she was a hatchling.'

And everything froze for Harry, he did not perceive the passing of time, but he knew he was frozen and left with the last words from the young snake.

+-----+

The magic from the Goblet sunk deep into the foundations of Hogwarts, into the Chamber of Secrets where it found Harry. No longer pinned beneath the Basilisk as the body had decomposed and left just a skeleton remaining, the magic rushed through him healing him to be ready for the challenges awaiting him, waking him so that he could face them.

As if no time had passed at all, he blurted out, 'Salazar Slytherin is still alive?'

After Harry defeats the Basilisk, he meets Sirius and he convinces Harry to get the hell out of Britain and hang out in the Carribian or somewhere like that, relaxing in the sun, as Britain panics.

Then we can have GOF where his name comes out, and either have him forced to compete, with a mental state that is far healthier due to actually having a good parental figure in his life.

Post GoF, he gets hell out of there, when he sees Fudge going full conspiracy lunatic, probably hides under a Fidelius where Remus is the secret keeper or something like that, where Sirius is Remus secret keeper.

***** I think the Sirius "abduction" could work well after the Aunt Marge scene. Harry genuinely thinks he will be expelled + Sirius probably is not 100% right in the head at that point and would jump on the opportunity to have his godson on the run with him. The only thing that has to happen for this to work is Sirius realizing that Harry should be his No1 priority instead of revenge on Pettigrew.

*** Perhaps he was petrified by the Basilisk and thought dead and Voldemort, believing Dumbledore to have faked his death, has his name put in the Goblet anyways. This leads to Harry's survival being discovered and now a second year Harry needs to somehow survive the Triwizard Tournament.

Couple of notable differences:

- No/reduced jealousy from Hufflepuff. Harry obviously didn't put his name in.
- Sympathy from his fellow champions. A second year (third, I suppose) has no realistic chance of winning and only a minimal chance of surviving.
- New methods of surviving the tasks, probably.
- Difficulty making new friends. Ron and Hermione might have missed him dearly but they'll be in different classes, Harry will have to prepare for the tournament, and the age gap may come into play in terms of personality.
- No more protection at the Dursley's. His absence caused the collapse of the blood wards.
- No Sirius? Depends on how third year played out without him.

*** My dude, it's fanfic. You can explain it with any number of reasons or ways;

it could be a way of verifying that the boy who lived has really died. It could be a political move in an attempt to make dumbledore look weak/manipulative, as Voldemort can probably afford to move straight to war footing without a prophecy. Or maybe Voldemort really can't bring himself to believe that something other than him destroyed his arch-nemesis (well assuming he doesn't know it was the diary), and dumbledore's using that to convince Voldemort that there really is a chosen one still in hiding, being trained by the greatest minds in the magical world, in order to slow him down.

** Ok, so rather than Harry being petrified by the basilisk, I have an idea.

Harry deals with the basilisk and Tom Riddle and helps Ginny get to Ron. He remembers how everyone treated him and either becomes bitter or panics. He refuses to go back to the school and instead abandons it. Ron sends him his stuff under the guise of bringing it to the Dursleys, with the help of Dumbledore, who knows. Harry ends up being trained by some teacher or tutor or whatever in private, and everyone presumes he's dead because that's what Dumbledore tells them.

Fourth year is around the time Harry is convinced to stay at Hogwarts, even if he remains hidden. Because of this, Dumbledore tells who he thinks is Moody that Harry's still alive, and fake Moody tells Voldemort.

Harry's name comes out of the goblet, there are cries of outrage, and Dumbledore sends Snape to retrieve Harry (This is under the assumption that either Harry and Snape have some sort of bond {Perhaps mentor-student or a parental bond} or Snape is able to fight Harry properly) Harry ends up being dragged back to the school, and is revealed to be alive.

There's public outrage, naturally, but when Harry tells them why he didn't want to return, some people are better about it.

that's all Ive got, though, sorry

**** Idk. Maybe Harry hid in the chamber until it was agreed? Or even that Dumbledore thought he was dead then is told he is, in fact, not? Maybe when Harry was sent his letter for the school year, he declined to return to classes, and by the time anyone found out, he was disenrolled from Hogwarts. Maybe he never even got his letter to continue Hogwarts, considering how he was supposed to be dead.

I don't know. It was kinda a write and go.

*** why would Snape and Harry have a bond/relationship, they hate eachother.

A better alternative is Remus goes to get him if this is the case, since Remus is like a uncle to him, had a better and closer to relationship with his parents than Snape did.

** There's a fic like this, it's a crossover fic. Harry's name comes out of the GoF, but since he's dead, it pulls a Harry from an alternate dimension. Ron comes too, because.

Maybe someone knows this fic? I think the author's name had a Kathryn in it.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

** I just cannot find it now, but there was a story with a plot similar to “Chamber Girl by LegendDairy“ linkffn(13561400), but that one was much simpler (or even primitive) and lemony, basically “Blue lagoon” in the Room of Requirements (or Chamber of Secrets?). And I cannot find it now.
