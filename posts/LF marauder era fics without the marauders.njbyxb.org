Fics centred on minor characters, maybe former Order members like Benjy Fenwick or Dorcas Meadows. Would prefer fics where the MC survived


** Linkffn(The Second String) spends a lot of time on the minor characters: Fenwick, Meadows, The Prewett Twins, Aberforth and so on.

*** This fic is the reason why I wanted to read a fanfic with the minor characters being the mc.

**** Have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366][face death in the hope?]]. I remember it having characterization for the McKinnons and Meadows at the least.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.
