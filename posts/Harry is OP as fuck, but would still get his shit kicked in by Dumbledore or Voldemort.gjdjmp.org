Basically just want a main character who's OP but not as OP as Dumbledore or Voldemort.

No bashing please.


** The narrative problem here is if every major character is more powerful, then no-one actually is - so there's very little point to simply making everyone more powerful for the sake of it.

That means there's not a lot of fanfics I can think of where all 3 major parties more powerful - and the few I can think of all have Dumbledore-Bashing to the max in order to force Harry to fight a war on multiple fronts.

The only non-bashing example I can think of is Accidental Animagus: linkao3(14078862)

*** The appeal of having the characters be more powerful is that more cool shit happens.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** The only one I can think of where that's the case - at least for a while - is in linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and its sequels. It's a Dresden Files crossover, though I had no problem understanding it without having read that series at all.

In it, Harry is powered up severely, but is also presented as a good bit weaker than Dumbledore for most of the series. The fic also includes some pretty interesting magical additions for Dumbledore, which I really enjoy.
