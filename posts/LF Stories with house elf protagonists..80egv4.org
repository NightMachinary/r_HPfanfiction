** Linkffn(The Last Hero's Heir by A Step into the Unknown)

It's a HP/GOT crossover that features house elves prominently. House elves (children of the forest) were given to wizards in return for Godric Gryffindors service, who built the wall and vanquished the others the first time around. Kreacher and Harry are called to Westeros to defend against the Others yet again and house elves aka children of the forest have a large role. They aren't quite protagonists, but they are important.

Kreacher causes quite a bit of mayhem messing with the lives of nobles in Westeros. A solid read, even if it doesn't fully fit your criteria.

  AU. After being hounded by the press and pestered by his fans, Harry decides that he needs to get away. When he learns of the house elves plight and Kreacher offers him an escape, who's he to refuse. In true Gryffindor fashion, he charges into this new world without even considering the consequences. Little does he know the true effect his presence will have on his new home.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.
