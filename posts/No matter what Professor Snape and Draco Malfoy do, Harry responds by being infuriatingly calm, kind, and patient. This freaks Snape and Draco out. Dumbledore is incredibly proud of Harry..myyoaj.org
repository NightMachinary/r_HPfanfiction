**** Turns out it was so good that Harry just had to get his own stash. Looks like Dudley is good for something after all! Who knew?

He even starts growing cannabis himself in Professor Sprout's greenhouse. Can't rely on Dudley forever, can he? Fortunately, since cannabis is a /muggle/ thing, no one even knows what it is, or what the hell Harry keeps rambling on about, including the teachers. What is this magical grass he speaks so fondly of? And who is this ‘Mary Jane?'

“/Love is in the air! Has the Boy-Who-Lived finally found ‘The One?' Sources say that love is in the air for our Chosen One!/,” The Daily Prophet reports. Rita Skeeter is having a field day, and the Daily Prophet sells out. Business is booming!

Naturally, every semi-responsible adult in Harry's life (and Hermione) is concerned, and more than a little disturbed, with the amount of old women and men invested in this child's love life.

Now everyone thinks Harry's ditching classes to have a snog in a broom cupboard with this mysterious ‘Mary Jane' (“/is it a pseudonym?/”), but in reality he's just popping in for a quick smoke in the greenhouses. When Harry says he's going to “/pop in for a little quickie with Mary Jane/” everyone takes this as confirmation, and the teachers grow concerned. Minerva tries to give him a stern talking to, and Poppy starts talking to him about some kind of ‘protection?'

When Harry begins zoning out during class and his grades begin to drop, they all just assume he's daydreaming of his lady love and it's distracting him. Clearly she's a bad influence! Ginny is furious. Hermione is exasperated (/and naive/). Malfoy is all mopey and depressed (/how very curious/). Ron is both jealous and smug on his best friend's behalf (“/does she have a sister, mate?/”).

Snape thinks he's going to be sick.

On the bright side, he's doing well in Divination now. Perhaps this new, mysterious lady love of his has given him a new perspective on life and made him a little more introspective? Trelawney approves.

Luna is just happy to finally have someone to talk about Nargles with.

Fred, in a moment of guilt, finally confesses what he's done to George. After a thorough investigation, the Weasley twins figure out what's up with Harry and promptly swear all the muggleborns into a vow of silence. If Dumbledore or Molly figure out what they've done this time, this might very well be the final nail in the coffin that gets them expelled, or maybe even killed... and yet another Howler from mum. /They're not sure which is worse/.

Harry, /in typical Harry Potter fashion/, remains oblivious and has no idea what is going on.

Summary (How do I make this blue quote thing?) :

Murtlap essence gets expensive, so the DA seeks out other forms of pain relief to help those who suffer through detentions with Umbridge. While searching through the Forbidden Forest, they stumble upon a patch of an odd, non-magical plant called “cannabis.”

Elsewhere in the British Isles, Voldemort prepares for an important meeting.

Or: Harry doesn't know what weed is, and Voldemort suffers the consequences.

***** I had an idea (like a paragraph's worth of text) like this like a while back -- it's on here in my posting history somewhere? IIRC it involved stoner-Harry, who was in Ravenclaw, unintentionally entering himself into the Triwizard Tournament and bypassing the protections Dumbledore set up... because he tried to use the Goblet as a bong.

Highlight included Katie Bell shouting at him "For fuck's sake, Harry!" indicating that it was a common thing for her to see.

I think I wrote it and a few other blurbs when I was on painkillers? Or half-asleep or sleep-deprived? I dunno.

But I'd read the shit out a stoner-Harry -- especially if there's a rare pairing like Harry/Katie.

...Huh, I think there was another one where Hermione cracked under the pressures of daily Hogwarts life, and she ended up smoking pages from textbooks with Sally Anne for reefer-papers?

...Yeah, I think of some truly weird shit at times.

  Harry had never really properly planned anything before. The fact that his first ever plan was risky and filled with assorted dangers was not actually deterring him as much as it should. (This story explores how Harry's third year at Hogwarts might have played out differently if a little project management and an ambitious plan had been thrown into the mix.)
