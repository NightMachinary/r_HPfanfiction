I just read a great incomplete fanfic where the boy who lived wasn't a concept. The war ended when another power tried to take over and harry's wealth was sealed by the crown for his parents being in the wrong side. Voldemort didn't win as well.

Any fanfics where the BWL isn't a concept?

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

** Muggle or extreme AUs then:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13618513/1/][half awake and almost there]] and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13618174/1/mind-the-gap][mind the gap]]: written by the same author of the popular "The Changeling" series, they are a nice Harry/Ginny romance. Harry does have an interesting background though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/][Murder Most Horrid]]: Bellatrix and Hermione get together in this no Voldemort universe. There are still lots of bad guys though, some familiar, some new.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088160/1/][Potter, That was very gallant of you]]: This one shot exploits the fact that Crucio is faster to cast than Avada Kedavra.

The excellent [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is nothing to fear series]] features a Gryffindor Tom Riddle and does not have a BWL.

Finally, the dark war epic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]] has James and Lily winning that night with a nasty trap and some luck.

*** Not muggle, full blown wizarding world. Just the BWL concept isn't in place. Perferably harry as the MC still. I've already read emperor but I'll give the rest a shot.
