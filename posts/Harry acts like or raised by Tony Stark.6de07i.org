I'm looking for fics where Harry has Tony Stark like intelligence(magic or muggle) where he can make things like armor or magic devices that no one has thought of. He can be raised by Tony to think like him or just a Tony like character. I just read Harry Potter and the Iron knowledge. Where Harry gets Tony's knowledge copied into his head and becomes Stark like. Unfortunately it's not finished and probably never will be but it showed me I need fics like this in my life. As always thanks ahead of time and sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense. Ask any question you like and hopefully I can help clear things up if needed.


** The best ever "Harry raised by Tony Stark" is "Harry Potter and the invincible Technomage" by Clell linkffn(3933832)

It last updated last year, but Clell has been posting snippets to CaerAzkaban, so it's still WIP

*** I have heard of CearAzcaban. Where is it and is it hard to find stories there? Do you have to be a member or anything?

**** CaerAzkaban is a yahoo group founded and headed by Rorschach's Blot, which means it's mostly chatter and discussions with occasional snippets and story posts. Some stories are in the files section, but most are buried in tens of thousands of posts.

On the up side, most posts end up on ffnet or other archives after a while.

It's not worth it joining if you're in it only for the story posts. OTOH YMMV
