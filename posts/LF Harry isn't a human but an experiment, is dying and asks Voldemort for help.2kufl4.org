First: Yes, I did google everything etc but had no luck. I'm also pretty certain it was on fanfiction.net, which makes it even stranger.

So.. Harry is sick and dying, nobody can help him really, he gets potions from Dumbledore but they get less and less helpful and in the end he puts his life in Voldemorts (Or Tom Riddle - I'm not even sure what he was called during the story) hands and asks him for help because without help he'll die. Harry is an experiment of Dumbledore to produce the ultimate weapon, and I think he was part Veela and part Vampire and those two races can't mix normally and now the different parts inside him battle each other. They don't find a solution and in the end he only survives by chance because Remus bites Harry and being a Werewolf overrides the Veela and Vampire parts in him.

If someone knows that story and has a link or nows it, can't find it online anymore and has a copy of it, I would be really grateful.

Edit: Found it. Funny. I was certain it was english (turns out it was german), and a lot shorter than it was in the end - that certainly explains why I couldn't find it. And it was a long one shot first but appearently updated again just recently. Really confusing.

*** Sadly not the one I meant, probably going to read it anyway, cause "close enough".

I can't shake off the feeling that it was deleted, like another story I've been looking for and can't find anymore. Hate it when that happens.

***** I really should start doing that. But so often I think "ah, I liked to read it but it's not really worth the time it takes to download it" (when it's on a site where you have to copy and paste it manually because there is no download option), but then, for some reason, like reading something similar, I want to get back to it.

*** It was crazy, don't know where some people get their ideas. Sometimes I just want to read something unusual and it wasn't a novel-length story, so it worked.
