This fic linkffn(9071757) is a great Dark!Harry fic. It starts a bit weak but the author writing has grown tremendously throughout writing it. It shows a pretty realistic progression of Harry and the plot is very interesting. Please give it a chance, it deserves way more reviews, favorites and follows than it currently has.


** Will read when complete

*** Honestly it is worth reading in its current form b/c it shows an absolute amazing progression from light to dark (imo). But you do you my friend and hopefully the damn author actually updates soon and doesn't take another 2 year hiatus.

**** That is why I only read complete five. Left hanging too often. Also I read super fast and hate having to start over again.

This. I can plow through 1,000,000 words a week, and there is nothing more obnoxious than reading 100k and it's not complete (especially when they mark 'em complete) and it's on "hiatus."

** I'll give it a try, but my first impression is a bad one.

I know 'don't judge a book by its cover' but does anyone else feel like they can tell when a fic will absolutely suck just by profile picture?

  After Dumbledore's death, Harry is left powerless; and alone. Or so he thinks. A squib turns around his life and he suddenly finds himself behind the mask of a guardian. Fate had other plans, however. Harry becomes the very thing he despises and begins a cruel game which blurs the line between good and evil. Post HBP, no Hocruxes, Dark!Harry, Anti-Hero!Harry, AU [85% Complete]

Ugh. This already makes the fic sound dubious. Harry is almost 17 when Dumbledore dies. He doesn't need a guardian, and I doubt a squib is the kind of help he needs. Won't be surprised if this has muggle wank and wizard bashing.
