** Something has to light a fire in his gut. Something has to get the point across that /he has a responsibility now./ Any number of the close encounters he's had, from Quirrel to Sirius's death, can work just fine for that. The other thing is learning that Independent does not mean Alone. You can still be independent and follow directions when you're out of your depth, which Harry very much is. Third, mistakes and epiphanies can and will be made. Assuming he is at all self aware, then most of them will be in the "Fuck I'm not as smart as I thought I was/Oh shit there are actual reasons for this" category. The wisest man knows nothing, and all that.

**** I'm a twenty four year old hedonist who's addicted to the internet, has no applicable skills or hobbies, is extremely and unjustifiably lucky to have a job that covers basic necessities, and is fat enough that bending over is a chore.

Proof enough?

EDIT: this is a fucking bot, isn't it.

** Have him be strong and independent as a result of growing up and learning from experience. Don't portray the adults as useless. Don't make him a loner.

** Don't start fully-fledged at 11, for one thing. Even if Harry was a strong independent +wo+man who don't need no man, he knows /absolutely nothing/ about the wizarding world. Hell, even 16 year old Harry in the books knew very little about the wizarding world. In Prisoner of Azkaban, he was confused as fuck about a basic, universal staple of the wizarding world... the Knight Bus. He had no idea that portkeys were a thing that existed before the Weasleys took him on one to the Quiddich World Cup. He was surprised about the whole "traveling through fire" thing.

No matter how independent a younger Harry is, he is simply not capable of functioning on his own in the Wizarding World. He doesn't know how to get to the hospital if he's injured, he doesn't know how to get pretty much anywhere, through any means. He doesn't know there's anywhere to get /to./

So don't start with a an independent child. It just doesn't work with the series's "fish out of water" premise.

But that also tells you where you need to start. Harry needs to stop being passive. He needs to take his fate into his own hands and reach out to people, to learn. Ron /probably/ knows about the Knight Bus. He ought to know about the Floo! He might not have experienced it, but he should know Apparation is a thing. Portkeys are the only wildcard here, it's probably not something that came up for him.

So, really, Harry learning about those things could be as simple as "Hey Ron, who is my best friend, I want to try and come over and visit over the summer, as best friends tend to do. How would I accomplish such a thing?"

And then Ron would be like "just Floo over, it's 'the burrow.'"

Which would logically trigger a whole discussion on how to get around the magical world. The fact that Canon Harry /never did this/ is quite telling.

So you need a Harry who is unwilling to just wallow in misery about his lot in life and actually get off his ass and /do/ something, even if that's just talking to people about things that he really ought to be talking to them about.
