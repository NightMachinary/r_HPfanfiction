I know it's a guilty pleasure for some people here. I'm thinking about writing one, one that's not smut but has a storyline and realistic characterizations, and I wanna analyse the what sort of twisted psyche would cause feelings like that to manifest. Anyways, what are your thoughts on the appeal of Harry/Lily and squicky pairings like that?


** Okay some of my interest in things like this comes from it being inherently different. Like Blandge said I wouldn't like a fic where Harry starts screwing the woman who raised him. However a fic where Harry time-travels to the 70s and falls for Lily Evens, that is fine with me. Same thing with Harry/Fem!Harry. It's sorta fucked but doesn't bother me.

** I like Harry Potter. I like Lily Evans. They would make a cute couple. The End.

It only starts getting weird if you don't stop thinking about it after that point. I have no interest in mother/son romance, but Harry doesn't know Lily and has never met her after the age of reason. As far as he's concerned she is a stranger. I don't care to read about a version of Harry Potter who dates the woman who raised him.

There is the issue of having genetic problems if they have kids, but any characters I write about will never be having children anyway; otherwise, there is adoption, so that's nothing to worry about.

If you are talking about incest in the traditional sense, I don't consider it immoral as long as both parties are consenting adults and they don't have children. That said, I don't find it appealing. Some people ARE into that sort of thing just like any other taboo.

People are kinky, and most people are aroused by breaking various societal norms. It's just human nature, and nothing to be ashamed of as long as you aren't hurting anyone. Fanfiction is just about the safest place to explore these types or desires, because it's fantasy.

I don't consider it a guilty pleasure. It's just a fun pairing, and if you feel uncomfortable with it, that's your issue, not mine. Stop making a big deal out of something that's not a big deal.

** what the others forgot to say, or perhaps dont think about, is that when reading there is an effect in which you sort of pretend to be the main character. So what it really is is me thinking Lily is hot and wanting to date her not Harry.

Sorry i'm not very good at describing things, but I think I got my point across.

** The appeal? In reading it? Or writing it? Because while I can't specifically answer to the Harry/Lily pairing, I can admit to reading some really weird pairings ... and that I have a few weird pairings in various fics sitting on my hard drive. (Like a Harry/fem!Harry.)

What's the appeal in writing the weird? Ah, well, my answer is pretty close to your reasoning, OP. It's fun to write something that shocks. It's interesting, exploring that mindset, that turn of events that leads to something disturbing, something forbidden, something strange. I'd never do that, but what would it be like to be someone who /would/?

It's a writer's greatest indulgence to push boundaries instead of just paint within them.

As for reading the weird ... well, I suppose it's because one ought not to. It's a fairy tale quality, a push the red button moment. Don't unlock the room I've barred to you; don't open that little box you have in your hands; don't eat of that forbidden fruit. And I think, "what could be the harm?" and click a link.

I suppose there's also a deeper psychological component to certain pairings. In the case of, say, Harry/fem!Harry, the appeal is a shared background, an understanding that no one else but those two could have. Realistically, it's repulsive, but intellectually, in fictionland where it's safe, such a thing is a puzzle, one that fits together rather neatly.

But mostly, for me, it's the taboo, the curiosity, and the shock of it that is the appeal. That, and the challenge of it, both against boundaries and an author's skill.

** For writers: 'cause the inherent conflict drives itself, it takes all the work away from the writer. You have the moment where she or he finds out that they are related which can easily be used as a big part of the story and then you have the coming out to the public. Which by itself already makes quite a big and long story which is quite easy to write.

For the reader, well its interesting and something else and the above works for the reader as well.

Iits the obvious of the taboo which makes it interesting.

There is a reason the incest/taboo section of the most popular internet erotica site (literotica) is by far the most used one and gets the most traffic. Afaik its actually quite easy to explain why they are attracted to one another: to quote from:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westermarck_effect]]

"When proximity during this critical period does not occur---for example, where a brother and sister are brought up separately, never meeting one another---they may find one another highly sexually attractive when they meet as adults or adolescents, according to the hypothesis of genetic sexual attraction. This supports the theory that the populations exhibiting the Westermarck effect became predominant because of the deleterious effects of inbreeding on those that didn't."

this most likely would also attract a similar aged lily to harry and vice versa

The key is that we are not actually Harry. When we read an incest fic, it doesn't trigger the "ew" of actual incest because the people in the fic aren't /our/ family. If I read a fic where Harry was screwing my mum, that would be squick. But he isn't.

So it comes down to this: Lily is hot.

** Hmmm. This is very interesting.

I personally have never read any Harry/Lily fics before, and have never really felt the desire to. However, I definitely ship some crazy and out-there pairings - some that might be considered 'forbidden' or 'taboo', as it were, so I will draw for my rational for reading/writing (more like dabbling) in this particular idea.

A lot of it is me finding it interesting to see how different authors explore different relationships and how they might be different in certain scenarios. I.E: Draco and Harry have so much history that could be delved into. There's rejection at a young age, bullying, one-upmanship, and the stalking fiasco in the 6th year. So taking all of this into account, I might have the desire to explore this relationship further, simply because it hardly was in canon, and due to the fact that over 300k fanfics have been written about HP, I can easily go and find something that scratches that itch. (note: Drarry isn't quite what I'd call 'forbidden', but I thought it would serve a good example).

You can definitely extrapolate from that; I know that for me personally, the exploration of relationships and of power dynamics is one of the main things that interests me about out-there pairings. I mean yes, obviously the smut adds to it, but I don't go out of my way to look for smutty fanfics of a certain pairing (for the most part). It's more about understanding how characters might work together, or react to one another. (I think I'm getting a bit repetitive now, so I shall continue onward!)

I can't speak overly from the perspective of a writer of this kind of material, simply due to the fact that I've only dabbled a little, but maybe someone can verify that the following might be the case? I don't know. But from a writer's perspective:\\
I want to put character A and character B in this scenario. I want to see how they would react if they started developing an attraction for someone that they shouldn't. Would this change their thought-process? Would this make them not do things they would have otherwise done? Does the fact that this is so incredibly wrong add more to the sexual attraction aspect for them? How would this all play out?\\
-At least, that's what was going through my head when I was inspired to write a little oneshot about a pairing I was crazily shipping at one point. And by the looks of it, you probably can definitely understand that thought-process.

I'm not saying that my point of view is the only one on here; that's obviously not the case. Ex: some people read things like this purely for smut, and they just happen to come across this type of story - and if the writing is good, if the smut is good, who cares? Some people read it purely because it's a taboo genre, and that just adds to the mystery/weirdness of it all. However, this is how I think of things like this. :)

P.S: I love discussing things like this. If you ever need someone to bounce ideas off of for your upcoming project, let me know! I'd probably enjoy it. :)

Edit: forgot a letter. It felt rejected.
