Primarily a request but I went off rambling a bit there, so sorry.

In many fics, some good and some not good, Harry and Co go and slap down the death eaters together. Everyone is amazing at fighting, everyone is exactly the same, it's bleach for my eyes. I just want to see some fics where everyone has their own skills.

In my mind Hermione legitimately CANNOT fight. She spends every waking hour sitting in the library, never, not even once in the entirety of canon does she do anything remotely active. She probably couldn't even run 2km. HOW does she spend like 5 hours non stop fighting and killing death eaters? I have no doubt she has amazing amounts of knowledge but I siriusly doubt she has any skill actually using said knowledge.

Why is Neville always Harry Lite? Why can't Neville use his excellent and extensive herbology knowledge to help the gang out? Why does he just gotta be slightly less cool Harry?

I can reasonably see Ron having some use in a fight. He's somewhat active, isn't necessarily bad at magic, and he's a ride or die friend. But why can't Ron be like a strategy man? He can plan raids or missions for the order using his chess mind? He doesn't also need to be amazing at fighting.

As for Harry himself, he is literally the prophesized child. He's always been the GOAT at Defense and has played quidditch since he was a first year. He got mucho exercise running from Dudley and he was always working. He's done quidditch practice thrice weekly since he was 11. He's supposed to be in shape. It makes sense why he is good at fighting. He has the fitness level for it, he has indomitable spirit, and AGAIN he is prophesized to defeat the dark lord.

So thank you for reading this far, but in case I didn't actually make my request known by this point, I would like to see a fic where everyone has their own unique use, but specifically harry and the dark lord have their final duel as a 1v1 grudge match. I don't want some corny ass ending where after a long time fighting and it's a stalemate, Hermione and daphne come out of nowhere and get a cheap shot in.

Thank you again.


** Can't remember the fic but I read one recently where neville leads a death eater to the greenhouse and uses the plants to kill them
