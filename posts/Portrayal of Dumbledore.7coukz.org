Greetings denizens of the deep.

One of the things that's often rather conflicting in fanfiction, I've found, is how Dumbledore himself is viewed. Some authors go to great lengths to make him out as a villain on par with voldemort or some kind of clockwork headmaster moving the pieces around the board while many others take the more realistic approach of him simply beong human. Very clever and powerful but just as capable of mistakes. Generally keeping secrets because, well, he did a lot of that. I don't really care what you think of him as a character. However, the thought that struck me(and perhaps more long term members of the fanfic community could shed some light on this) is do you think the movies...rather unorthodox portrayal of the character influenced many authors. I know lots of writers state flat out that they mostly go off the movies and Dumbledore in the film's is much more aggressive and manipulative seeming than the books. There's a similar debate regarding Hermione as the movies made her a much more flawless character than the books did. Not that I'm hating on the movies I get that they condense and change things for the medium. So the crux of this debate is do you think many author and reader perception of the mighty APWBD has been changed to a more unflattering light due to Michael Gambons performance? Or is it just because he does do some shady negligent shit all around? (Incidentally the reverse argument could be out forth for snape. Heel face turn aside, I'm pretty sure hed still be pretty hated were it not for Alan Rickman RIP)

Discuss, debate, or just deride me for posting.


** I think it's mostly HPB and DH that give Dumbledore his bad rep.

And the films don't help with that.

** Dumbledore's main problem is not the movies, but the fact that as an adult character in a kids book, he wasn't allowed to be competent or there wouldn't have been much to do for the kids - at least nothing important.

If you have a competent Dumbledore actually being allowed to act, you have to deal with the fact that most of the canon troubles aren't any problems at all because he easily deals with them.

That's not a problem for fanfiction, of course, since following the paths of canon is a bad thing any way.

*** I think the source of the problem was actually Voldemort. IMO, Voldemort hardly expressed much competence beyond raw destructive combat power. He was compulsive obsessive, refused good advice, and only relied on fear and terror. His leadership style was so unsustainable that he was betrayed by multiple inner circle members. He mutilated his own soul to the point that he was permanently suffering from extremely poor decision making skills. Such an enemy, if faced with an opponent of equal combat power (Dumbledore), would actually be easy to defeat.

Therefore, Dumbledore had to be severely dumbed down so the plot stays exciting.

JKR even said herself that a more helpful librarian would have shot her plot.

*** Agreed, and I like how you portrayed Dumbledore in your fics. (Just finished reading 2 or 3 of them (the long ones), they're great !). We only really see bits of Dumbledore's potential all along the series, culminating with the Atrium Battle in OOTP, but that particular battle only made me wish for more. Which is why I love fics where Dumbledore is unleashed - in battle, but not only.

Edit : fics, not pics

** Well, since I've only watched the first three movies, and only after reading the books, I can definitely say that Gambon didn't play a role.

My opinion of Dumbledore /plummeted/ when I read this line:

#+begin_quote
  I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years
#+end_quote

This is essentially an admission of willful participation in child abuse. The fact that Dumbledore proceeded to reveal the prophecy, therefore distracting Harry from the previous revelation screams "manipulative asshole" to me.

The useless "preparation" during HBP and the ultimate reveal that Dumbledore was essentially rearing Harry for the slaughter, just cemented my negative opinion.

*** Dumbledore is a polarizing agent in fanfiction with some people bashing him to an extreme and others exalting him on a pedestal. Sometime I feel like the people pushing back against the bashing just don't want to think about his actual actions. That line alone shows that Dumbledore should not be in a position of authority with children. Regardless of his wealth of good attributes, he willingly and knowingly placed a child in an abusive situation. Dumbledore avoids explaining the blood protection around Number Four for no reason at all. He wants Harry to have a happy childhood so he doesn't tell him about the prophecy, but he already knew about the Dursleys and didn't make plans for Harry to spend minimal time there to maintain safety and then get him somewhere he could be happy. It doesn't take any exaggeration to show Dumbledore's failings with Harry and to be upset by them. Especially for those who have been exposed to abuse in their lifetimes.

*** Was he "rearing Harry for the slaughter" though? Yes, Snape accuses him of it, and Dumbledore doesn't contradict him... but Harry was really marked for death the moment Voldemort gave him his scar.

What Dumbledore really was doing, such as I read it, was trying for a desperate gamble to exploit a loophole so that Harry would, against everything, survive his final confrontation with Voldemort anyway. This did mean Harry had to, at least temporarily, THINK that he had to die, because it was that willingness to sacrifice himself that saved him. If he'd thought he could survive, he wouldn't have. That was the entire "master of Death" thing.

Was it? Are you sure it wasn't because he was the actual master of the Elder wand? Or because he was Voldemort's horcrux? Or because Voldemort used his blood in the graveyard? Not clear-cut, is it?

Did he, though? The scene is pretty ambiguous. From how I read it, Harry had a near-death experience but did not actually die. The entire "King's Cross" scene proves to not have taken any time at all, so if he "died" it was for like a fraction of a second.

It was all of them. There wasn't just one factor in Harry's survival; there were several. That's why the entire plan was so convoluted; it HAD to be because there were so many hugely unlikely circumstances that had to be fulfilled.

Never said it wasn't. But there was no way that situation WASN'T going to be fucked up; the question was just to what degree. What's worse: having a seventeen-year-old kid thinking he's going to die and be wrong, or having a seventeen-year-old kid thinking he's going to SURVIVE and be wrong?

****** Based on the end of Book 4, Dumbledore seems to think that Voldemort using Harry's blood--or that plus the horcrux--is what did it. Book 7 contradicts this when he says Harry sacrificing himself "made all the difference". The Elder Wand wasn't part of his plan, even though that seems to be what saved Harry in the final duel. (Not to mention the weird "Harry's wand attacks Voldemort on its own" thing that served no narrative purpose except to make him pursue the Elder Wand in the first place.)

Basically, the end of /Deathly Hallows/ was JKR pulling a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup][Gambit Pileup]] on herself.

******* I don't really see the contradiction. The blood and the Horcrux was what made Harry's survival possible; the self-sacrifice and the Hallows were what ensured it. Several contributing factors.

We know that Dumbledore had planned for Snape to become the master of the Elder Wand, though what he'd hoped would happen after that is anyone's guess. From HBP on, when hr actually knew that all three Hallows existed and were available, it does seem like he did mean for Harry to unite them. The real plan was just cut short when his death happened a little sooner than he'd thought it would.

Why couldn't all these things have been deciding factors?

** Interesting thought. Snape and Hermione's 'reverse-bashing' are often attributed to the movies, but never the opposite. If what you say is true, then I would assume there would be a lot less Manipulative!Dumbledore stories had Richard Harris played him in all the movies --- his Dumbledore was a lot less threatening.

** Well... I think the movies did botch Dumbledore to a huge degree. Michael Gambon's Dumbledore gets the most flack, but I really didn't think Richard Harris was that great in the role either; he plain didn't have the energy... and I don't think it could ALL be blamed on his failing health either.

But even if I didn't much care for Harris's Dumbledore, I still think Michael Gambon was a huge step down. Harris may have lacked energy, but Gambon had a worse problem; he lacked the CHARM. Gambon's Dumbledore in particular is such a cold and unlikeable grouch that the essence of the character is lost. While Dumbledore isn't a saint, he's supposed to be witty, polite and charming, and Gambon just has zero charisma in the role.

Now, neither gentlemen had actually read the books. Which was a detriment to them both; it meant they never really understood the character such as he was supposed to be.

(I still say Stephen Fry would have made a good Dumbledore! Just age him up a little with makeup and a fake white beard, and you have an actor who would not only look the part, and manage to capture the charisma, but who actually read the books, and even "played" Dumbledore in a sense, since he read the audiobooks!)

I don't think all the character-bashing can be blamed on the movies, though. I think a lot of it, if not most of it, comes from the revelations in later books. Dumbledore is introduced as this near-perfect authority figure; he's jovial and friendly, he doesn't punish you for minor misbehaving and is always willing to give you a chance and listen to what you have to say... and he lets you go off and be the hero, and he's a veritable powerhouse that can be counted on saving the day if you yourself can't manage.

The revelation that Dumbledore was in fact a deeply flawed individual, not the perfect grandfatherly authority figure he seemed at first, that he had a dark history, and that he had been working behind the scenes and kept secrets from Harry and in fact directly deceived him on several occasions... yeah, fans take it as a betrayal. And since Harry is the reader stand-in, the reader doesn't only go "he betrayed Harry" but "he betrayed ME!"

And so, the angry fan sets out to write a fic where Dumbledore's characterisation is coloured by this thought "he's a manipulative old bastard who betrayed me," which leads to a different characterisation, an exaggeration of his negative traits, and of course outright bashing. And Writer's Mouthpiece Harry can stand up to him and tell him exactly what an awful person he is, and Dumbledore isn't capable of making any good counterarguments because the writer is convinced there aren't any.

*** The crazy thing, to me at least, is that for all the reasons you pointed out in your 2nd paragraph, it's very easy to imagine Gambon's Dumbledore as a heartless monster who willingly lets Harry be abused at every turn for the eventual "greater good". The older I get the less respect I have for Dumbledore as a character. Aside from ANYTHING else, the lack of competent teachers at Hogwarts raises serious questions about what sort of games he's playing.

** I've done my fair share of good-natured Gambon-bashing, so I shan't go there today. Honestly, Dumbledore's ultimate depiction has just as much to do with lazy screenwriting towards the end of the film series, and DH Part 2 is the principal offender here. That conversation at King's Cross was rushed and flat. Weaksauce, really, despite how crucial it was in providing closure within the book canon.

** To me the /scariest/ dumbledore is in Sympathetic Properties. linkffn(10914042).

He sees himself pretty much as [[/spoiler][some sort of Agent of "The Greater Good", in the same way that someone would be considered as the acting hand of God itself. He's somewhat delusional though. He's the Greater good!Dumbledore taken to an extreme.]]. It's a subtle kind of scary.

The pacing of the fic is the main reason I don't recommend it much. 3 years, 38 chapters, and it has only moved from the end of 1st year to the welcoming feast of the 2nd one. A lot of stuff happens, but I feel it's a bit too slow.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon. (Now at Hogwarts)
