I've read one from Ginny's (not from the other? HBP -DH) And am currently reading Between the lines (DH from a R/Hr POV). What else is out there? Ideally complete or updating regularly, the longer the better!


** Iv spent the last couple of days gathering fics that meet this category. Fair warning - I have barely read any of them yet. So bear that in mind if some don't meet canon, or are just down right bad etc ... Non the less:

The Ginny Chronicles linkffn(12312469) - relatively new story that is WIP, I have read it all and really enjoyed it so far. The author also plans on writing the books from Ginnys POV up to book 6 I believe, so definitely one to keep an eye on.

Secrets linkffn(1536120) - have not read this but again is CoS from Ginnys POV this is also complete.

Cedric Diggory and the Goblet of Fire linkffn(3447073) - As the title says - im only in 4 chapters so far and it is a Cedric/OC, so im not sure if it follows canon, so far I like it though.

Minds Eye, Soul Reflection - Book 5 from Luna's POV, Again have not read, but iv heard it has a great characterization of Luna. ([[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1]])

Just a Random Tuesday linkffn(3124159) - A day in the life of Professor McGonagall during book 5 and the Umbridge reign of terror.

Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince linkffn(5677867) - This to me it is what I will measure all these other fics against, this is perfect and seamless companion piece to HBP, and is so well written JK Rowling may as well have written it herself - cannot recommend this enough.

Not From Others linkffn(11419408) - I know you said you read this, but any excuse to recommend this gem, FloreatCastellum's other stores are equally as good.

Call to Arms linkffn(8078750) - Another Hogwarts during DH story.

Untold Weasley Tales linkffn(3848378) - Bill Weasley's life story, so not really what you are searching for, again have not read this, but it does cover the book years.

Snape Chronicles linkffn(7937889) - Again the life story of Snape, but does cover the book years, I did not read all of this, and i really want to revisit it, but said id add it to the list.

This is all I have atm, I know it's a bit stupid of me to recommend so many stories that I have not read, but I know how hard it can be to find stories like this.

Will be watching this thread with interest, hopefully i can add some more to my read list!

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** The Diggory Papers is GoF from Cedric's PoV.

It's nicely done and pretty funny. But be aware the portrayal of Cedric may not be to everybody's taste. He's a Blackadder-type cynical scoundrel.
