I'll give an example. In almost every Harry Potter fanfiction, whenever they go to Gringotts, they usually come away with a Gringotts Card, or some similar item that allows them to use money without going to the bank every time they need money.

Things like marriage contracts/soul bonds are arguable, but they're more up to personal taste. What I'm looking for is general things/tropes that pretty much just build and improve upon cannon.

So what's your bit? What piece of fannon, however big or small, has contributed more substance and/or depth to the cannon universe?


** Wards in general, even when its just giving a name to the protective spells and enchantments of canon.

Actual uses for runes (usually wards), beyond being a useless foreign language. Wizards would easily be able to move from country to country with apparition and portkeys, as well as being able to fly centuries before muggles. It's stated in canon that Barty Crouch Sr. could speak well over 100 languages. Clearly there must be a magical technique to learn languages quickly and efficiently, and there would likely be translation charms. If this is the case a foreign language class spanning 3/5 years would be utterly pointless.

That a full Veela is born from a Veela and a muggle male, while part Veela would be born from a Veela and a wizard. I've had this idea in my head since I began reading fanficion, I know it came from one of the first fanfics I read, but cannot think about which story that was.

That's what I can think of off the top of my head.

You're thinking of /The Lie I've Lived/.

** What I greatly enjoyed was the way in which Firebird handled a few things. This particular fanfiction covered a lot of aspects I love to see in other ff.

First, the warfare aspect of the story. No, you don't fire stunners at the enemy, no matter how far on the light side you are. You may not fire the Killing Curse, but you will blow their heads of with blasting curses. Its war. Nobody stands on a battlefield to not harm the enemy.

Also, the use of wards and runes in Firebird made sense. Even though it became such a core part of basically everything, by the time I reached book 3 I rolled my eyes every time the author described how they work and whats so special about this specific one.

Also, the way in which the Muggles interact with the magical world. It makes more sense, for me at least, that Muggle governments would know about wizards and witches. However, as they did in Firebird, just clean up after them since confronting them would not end well, at all.

But, to add a bit of negative feedback, I did not enjoy how Firebird handled other sentient magicals. "Every sentient magical lifeform was created by wizards and witches" is not a great explanaition as to how they came about (With the exception of Goblins. I kinda liked their origin story).

*** VERY much agree on the Firebird Trilogy. Loved the whole series up to when I stopped halfway through the third as it was unfinished. Excited to pick it back up again, as I was caught up in Heart and Soul by Sillmaure. I recommend it highly, if interested.

**** The only thing that put me a bit off, next to the constant meantion of the specific types of wards, was the harem aspect of it that, while it did paint a nice dark picture of forced polygamy, came across as a bit of a author fantasy itself. Maybe I'm just imagening it, but I always had the feeling.

Whats Heart and Soul about? I mean, what kind of fanfiction is it?

***** hmmm.... I would say that there are elements of a lot of different types. There is a definite Super!Harry theme, although understated. He's no match for Voldemort in knowledge or experience, and its very obvious through the story, but he IS very powerful. There is a lot of angst, but not in a way that makes the story very dark.... It's honestly such a broad story, that it is incredibly hard to simplify it into a few things. Romance, however, is VERY important throughout the series. You won't find any Veela love bonds or soul bonds granting telepathy or increased magical ability, but at the same time, you definitely feel the abundance of love that Harry eventually feels toward both girls.

***** Perhaps the harem aspect is a bit of an author fantasy, but since its a subverted trope, I didn't come across that way to me at all.

****** Don't get me wrong. Especially at the start of the series he used it very well as a method to paint the world even darker. There were just some scene were the meantion of it was totally unnecessary and sometimes even disturbed the flow of the scene. But I'm complaining on a high level here.

** It's kind of embarrassing, but the first thing to come to mind is this one story that had a small description of a magical bakery and their pastries. I love sweets so it was nice to see someone explore an aspect I hadn't thought of. Too bad I don't remember anything about it! I guess I like it when the author explores wizarding stores and daily life.

** Greater explanation of Occlumency and Legilemency.

Well, some would argue that certain fics go overboard with it (castles and spaceships) but some authors really capture the imagination of what it's like to be in someones mind and visa versa.

Also, more spells than where described in the books, magic fights in the books and movies where kind of bland, just people shooting bolts of light at each other, but I want to read about awesome transfiguration and other non-straightforward methods of fighting with magic, the duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore at the end of OoTF is the only canon example of this.

And finally, exploring magical places that aren't Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, St. Mungo's or the MoM.

** I honestly think that Heart and Soul by Sillmaure had an INCREDIBLE innovation of the Horcrux mechanic. I really wish she had written more. It really was one of the better fics, and even though its pseudo-harem(Harry-Fleur-Hermione), it is still one of the better written fics in my opinion. I was honestly amazed that it isn't recommended more... I've been here for well over a year and I saw it for the first time about a week ago. I won't go into much greater detail with the Hocrux aspect, as it is very central to the plot (as you might guess), but if anyone wants I'll make another comment with a little more information.

** For me it's more about what the author takes out instead of what they add. For example, there are an awful lot of methods of communication and transportation in canon. When an author purposefully makes their job harder by taking out JKR's helpful plot devices that really gets my attention.

***** Well then I guess my actual answer to the question is: nearly everything

Rowling's universe has possibly the most potential of any fantasy setting in the history of literature, but in the books themselves she fleshed out essentially nothing. It's an ideal climate for well-written fanfiction about anything from dark magic to runes to founder's era. Easily the thing that has been most improved is the characterization of the young marauders, which is a cop out because Rowling did so little there
