Hey guys, Im looking for some criticism/feedback for a new story I'm writing, here's the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11083975/1/Evelyn-Potter-and-Fates-Hand]]

Be as harsh as you want, what dosent kill me will make me stronger :)


** Technically there are a lot of errors: comma placement, sentence fragments, etc. I'd look for a beta who's good with that kind of thing. There are some other red flags for me.. the whole Light/Dark divide is really cliche and generally unrealistic. The interaction with the goblins was awkward too. The "may your gold flow strongly" bit is cringe-worthy.

*** Ohh thank you! Yeah I can freely admit that my grammar is not the best. I do have a beta and she has caught quite a bit for me, I'll try to improve on that.

In regards to the Light/Dark divide, could you elaborate on how it is unrealistic? I mean in the original books that divide was there. I felt that I had to create some kind of divide otherwise there would not be any antagonists in this story seeing as technically, there is currently no Dark Lord around to cause mayhem.

I'll definitely re-examine the 1st chapter of the story. Its one of the most important parts of a story so I need to make sure its tip top.

Thanks for your feedback!

**** In canon there is an idea of Dark Arts, but it's basically a label for magic intended to cause harm or that causes harm for personal gain. The divide in canon was not Light vs. Dark. It was racist fanatics vs. everyone they viewed as not pure enough. It was one megalomaniacal madman vs. those who weren't willing to submit to him. It was a government that wanted to stick its head in the sand vs. the people who were trying to deal with the problems facing society.

Light and Dark as a political divide or a fundamental part of a person's magic is a fanon invention. It doesn't necessarily have to be bad, but in many cases it's lazy writing. A lot of authors use it as an indicator that this one group of people is /good/ and this other group of people is /bad/.

***** Ah, I see what you mean. Well I can say that I have no intention of making it a good vs bad. Just two different ways of magic that don't work exactly as each other. For example: Someone who might have a Dark Orientation might be good at subjects like Legilimency, Potions, DADA, Dark Magic, Blood Magic, Runes and Transfiguration. Basically subjects that are nessesary for some of the more dangerous lines of work (E.g. Auror, Interigator, Potion Master, Curse Breaker, Ritualist etc.) where as Light magic would be more like Healing, Charms, Arithmancy, Herbology, conjuration etc. Being Dark just means that you have a easier time with these subjects, it dose not mean that you cant learn the others, just that it might not be where your gifts lye. Sirius Black was born was a Dark orientation but denied it, and he managed to become quite proficient in light magic. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that it does not decide who you are.

That's how I was going to have it anyway, however now I wonder whether I should just stick with canon magic? I don't want to confuse people and if this might put people of the story I would rather re-work it now.

Not if that's not the story you want to tell. I'd say just know that this is going to color peoples initial impressions of the fic, and through the narrative you'll need to clear up any fanon preconceptions they might have.

******* Alright. I'll stick to my guns and just make sure that I explain the system clearly so there is no confusion. Thanks :)
