I was reading "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches..." by LeadVonE linkffn(11574569) and I noticed they used the fidelius charm a lot in that story protecting objects. In the main book series it's used to protect property. I am looking for a story where it is either used to make people not realize that Harry Potter is the Boy-Who-Lived, or It is placed on a person so everyone forgets that person existed.

I know it is a long shot, but any help would be appreciated.


** In Harry Potter and the power of Paranoia is exactly what you're looking for. He puts a fidelius on himself to get away from the British wizarding world. There's also an element of this in Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin where Tom Riddles uses the fidelius to hide the fact that he is in fact dark lord voldemort. He uses the Diary horcrux for this.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.

** It's not the exact way you want it, but linkffn(Potter's Protector) has Harry use the Fidelius Charm to hide people's bits. It's a very humorous, and unique take on it. Plus, my inner twelve year old finds them saying "My Vagina/Penis is between my legs" /hilarious/

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** It's not the Fidelius itself, but linkffn(Saving Connor by Lightning-on-the-Wave) has a similar effect at work. It's much less potent, granted.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
