There's a chapter on Lightning Dragon's Roar where Albus, Voldy, and Harry had to work together to fight a demon. The collaboration of water and fire and lightning was so cool to imagine and i need more!

I really liked the idea of them teaming up against great enemies or to help magical britain, are there any that you could recommend?


** Honestly, I do not have one, but she would also like to read something like that, would you name this fic?
