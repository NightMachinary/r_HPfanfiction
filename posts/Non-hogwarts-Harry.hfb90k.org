:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay, two things:

First, I search a fic in which Harry never went to Hogwarts. The story starts with Harry riding Sirius' motorcyle while being hunted by Voldemort and a bunch of death eaters. If anyone knows what fic I'm talking about, please link it!

Sencondly, I wanted to ask whether anyone of you knows other fics with a similar premise? I really like the idea of Harry not going to Hogwarts, maybe even never learning magic (or if he does he teaches it to himself), and maybe even wanting to get out of the wizarding world altogether. If possible no slash-fics pls.


** Rides it to Hogwarts and Neville is the BWL? Lily alive and H/G?

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
