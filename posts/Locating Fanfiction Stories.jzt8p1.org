Hello, I'm looking for a couple Harry Potter fanfiction stories. If you know them please let me know. I am dying to read them again.

The first one is a Ron/Hermione fanfiction story but they both start out dating other people in this story. Ron works with magical creatures and Hermione works as a researcher at St Mungo's. Her co-worker asks her out and she accepts. They go to dancing lessons for his sisters wedding then go out to eat where they run into Harry and Ron. Harry tells Hermione that he seems nice and that a lot of guys notice her but she misses it because she is preoccupied with Ron. Her and her co-worker date for awhile and she loses her virginity to him. I think his name was Gus. Ron has to deal with a creature that can only be resisted by being truly in love with someone and Hermione goes with him while he deals with the creatures. She assumes he is in love with his girlfriend. Harry and Ginny are getting married in this story as well and they are all at the wedding together. Hermione's boyfriend jokes with Harry and Ron about them seeing her as a sister and that he glad that is the one who gets to take her home and Ron says Careful, that's my sister you are talking about. Ron eventually kisses Hermione and tells her how he feels but her boyfriend overhears and leaves the wedding. Eventually Ron and Hermione do end up together.

The second one is also a Ron/Hermione story. They are together in this story and they are off looking for the Horcruxes with Harry. The story is told from Harry's POV. He catches them sleeping together and saying I love you to each other. He can tell that it was not their first time. He remembers a conversation that he had with Ron a few weeks prior where Ron confides in Harry that Hermione wants to take their relationship to the next level but he is afraid. He is afraid of going through with it then something happening to Hermione. If he never has it then he can't miss it. Harry tells him that by not living his life he is letting Voldemort win. That their act of love fights against the darkness. So when he catches them he is happy and believes that that is their act of rebellion against the hate.

The last one is a Harry/Hermione fanfiction story. They are not dating when this story starts off. Harry is an auror and Hermione works on inventions. Harry has to go away on a mission to a couples resort and asks Hermione to join him as his fake girlfriend or wife. They go and Hermione goes on a shopping spree (as part of their cover of hanging out with essentially the mob boss) and Harry really notices her then. She has some invention that records things and she uses this to record all the conversations. They have to play cards with one night and the mob boss insists that they kiss before each bet for good luck. They finally get together for real and Ron as it is about time.
