- Antioch turned his wand into a Horcrux, so he'd always have it on him.\\
  As its curse, he made it so that any who use the wand without the intent to return him to life would eventually find the wand malfunctioning at a crucial moment.\\
  For example, Albus Dumbledore never noticed that the wand had refused to cast the Anti-Compulsion charm he intended to use in the Gaunt Shack, and this led to him putting on a ring with a Withering Curse.
- Cadmus never intended to /use/ the stone. It is both his Horcrux and the way to bring him back - if you use it to call back anyone else, they will be mere hallucinations, tempting you to join them in death.\\
  It could /genuinely/ be used to call back Cadmus Peverell, in a similar way to the Diary Horcrux Tom Riddle would make years later.
- Ignotus, having lived a long life with a family, felt remorse for the deed and re-absorbed the Horcrux - but not before ensuring that as long as his bloodline continued to pass it on, the Cloak would remain in perfect working order.

Just wanted to share a theory slash plotbunny (more the latter than the former) I've been having, but have had no idea what to /do/ with. Feel free to critique or use it.


** It is quite interesting. Unique for sure. I never thought of Hallows lore much, but after I read Blindess I was hard pressed to find fics that genuinely develop the hallow's lore like that. If you've not read it yet I'd suggest you do. It is a very good read which develops hallows in a very unique and non-cliche way.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I always liked the interpretation that the Elder Wand grants knowledge down from previous users as in canon wands are known to be able to communicate with their users.

And I think that that is the only Hallow that really has potential for that purpose, a secondary utility.

The resurrection stone brings back shades of the dead, maybe even their full souls for a short time. The only other use for it I could think of is maybe using it to take souls as well? Like a dementor.

And the invisibility cloak? Meh, it's sort of the worst of all of them just because Moody's eye can see through it and Dumbledore can sense people through it (probably through detection spells). It would be interesting if as well as being invisible, you are also intangible with it on (spells pass through you, wards don't notice you etc...)

** I think this has no canonical basis, may even contravene canon, and as such, as a theory about cabon, it holds little weight. That said, this would be a great twist in a story. It would definitely be an interesting take on the Hallows. Better than gifts from death at any rate.

*** How would this contravene canon? Not saying it doesn't, but from what I remember we never actually /learn/ much about the Hallows beyond what the Tale of the Three Brothers says (which is never confirmed to be /factual/), and that they were probably made by the Peverell Brothers.

And yeah, that's partially why I wrote this up. I think it'd be great if more fanfics tried to do something unique and interesting with the Hallows and their backstory.

Kinda pointless to make a horcrux that screws someone over if they use it without the intent to return you to life, and then tell no one that they can (and should) use it to resurrect them.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Why,' said Snape, without preamble, ‘why did you put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely you realised that. Why even touch it?' Marvolo Gaunt's ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it. Dumbledore grimaced. ‘I ... was a fool. Sorely tempted ...'

  /It's not because Dumbledore was compelled by a spell. It's because he was tempted. Why?/

  When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts, the Hallow I had craved most of all -- though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons -- I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and mymother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry I was ... ‘I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years, I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.'

  /He wanted to see his family. He had learned nothing and proved he was unworthy. If there had been a compulsion, this would have been proof of nothing./
#+end_quote

The compulsion on the ring is complete fanon. Even more notably, I don't ever recall seeing an anti-compulsion charm in fics either. Even more notably, the wand works fine. Sure, the bearers tend to end up dead, but that's cause it's a wand that works. It works so well that people kill for it. It's not because the wand tries to get its bearer killed. The first person to die because the wand worked too well was Antioch.

#+begin_quote
  ‘The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,' said Ollivander, ‘but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit ... formidable.'
#+end_quote

The wandmaker agrees. Harry also uses it just fine to kill Voldemort. The wand turns on Voldemort in favor of its true master, Harry, despite the fact that Harry was not using the wand (and Harry was - he knew full well what mastery of the hallow meant).

#+end_quote

Not /quite/ what I meant here. Horcruxes canonically are just anchors - barring the Diary, none of the ones we see in canon has a built in way to get an actual /body/ back.

I meant that part more loosely - being an ally, willing to research rituals a la "bone of the father etc", or find suitable hosts for his spirit.

Also, I see Antioch as a very short-term and not very strategic thinker. He was probably banking on garnering a following which would do that for him, by boasting of what he did - respect for power and all that rot.

He wasn't banking on getting his throat slit by a random stranger who ran off to parts unknown.

#+begin_quote
  Even more notably, the wand works fine.
#+end_quote

Except that it's so /hilariously/ easy to lose its allegiance, which just raises a question.

If Dumbledore lost the Deathstick's allegiance to a Disarming Charm and Draco then lost it to Harry via a non-magical struggle in which the Wand was never even on Draco's person, how in the heck did Harry keep its allegiance despite:

1. Never actually holding it,
2. Getting hit with a Killing Curse and paraded around?

I find it just as likely that there was something else at play here.

#+begin_quote
  Even more notably, I don't ever recall seeing an anti-compulsion charm in fics either.
#+end_quote

Occlumency is often used as such, and it's common enough to see "amulet that protects against mind magic" in fics - and that, in turn, would mean mind-protecting magic in a general capacity exists. I know at least 2 where Harry gives Ginny such an amulet after the Chamber incident.

#+begin_quote
  The compulsion on the ring is complete fanon.
#+end_quote

This, however, is fair - but then again, the exact nature of the curse being somewhat different doesn't necessarily preclude it being a Horcrux.

1. Powerful enough to disarm the current owner of the Elder Wand without even using magic? Yeah, the deathstick wants that guy for his master. Because power. If I was the Elder Wand i'd be sick of Draco Malfoy as my master as well. He's a coward.

2. He willingly allowed himself to be hit with the killing curse. To get the Elder Wand, you have to defeat its current owner. But if someone lets you win, you haven't truly defeated them.

******* Isn't that because of the enchantments Voldemort put on them?

In every "What fanon did you think was true?" post you always see it.

I don't think Horcruxes are inherently durable /at all./ Like, if you used it on glass, you could just step on the glass and the horcrux would be gone. Broken.

Enchanting it for durability is a separate thing I think.

excerpts from the book

#+begin_quote
  "No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?”

  “Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, “*because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them.* From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”
#+end_quote

[...]

#+begin_quote
  “It doesn't have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can't repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it's incredibly rare---”
#+end_quote

[...]

#+begin_quote
  That's a problem we're going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won't do the trick. You've got to put it beyond magical repair.”
