I just started to read Partially kissed hero and I like the premise of Harry absorbing voldermorts skills and knowledge. So I m looking for any fics like that. Thanks


** Let's see:

The Merging linkffn(The Merging)

There are some interesting parts, and there are some really tropey parts. Not bad action, but Harry is pretty different.

Abraxas linkffn(Abraxas)

An OP Harry fic, but its an interesting idea. Short version, the horcrux responds to Harry hearing the prophecy, and decides to make a deal with Harry to fuse their souls to give them a better chance to survive (it is Voldemort after all, survival by any means). Its H/G, but really their so different its more whether you like a power duo couple. Be warned, the last 1/3 of the fic takes a DARK turn, even for this fandom.

Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge)

This might be the best example of this, but Tom confronts Harry as sort of sixty year old version of Tom Riddle (not snake face Voldemort) and decides to help him become strong enough to deal with Voldemort. Good fights, plenty of action, lots of magic. Probably the best, or at least my favorite.

There are more, but I would say these were my top picks.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.

**** Abraxas definitely is, though its only about 1/3rd of the way through that its really noticeable. By the end, you will barely recognize it. The Merging and HP and the Unlocked Knowledge sort of keep to canon, but the Horcrux presence begins to change things almost immediately, so things spiral from there.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.
