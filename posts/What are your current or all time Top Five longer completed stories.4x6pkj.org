Fluff, smut, peggy sue, crackfic, whatever. Just as long as they're good reads because I'm looking for new stuff to read. By longer I mean I don't want quickie one shots. I'd prefer at least 25,000ish words, but if they're really good but short, you could give them as bonus reads or something.


** If we're only talking about HP fanfic, and complete fics at that... then:

I'm going to count [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][the]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Quick]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][series]] as one work, because they would take up 4 of the 5 slots, and I want to leave room for other authors' work. Nevertheless, I think they are the best fanfiction in the entire fandom.

The other four are, in no particular order, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8134710/1/A-Dream-Carved-in-Stone][A Dream Carved In Stone]].

--------------

Now, if you're not just talking about HP fanfic, that list would be different (apart from Alexandra Quick). However, this is the wrong sub.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

**** Sadly not really. It's something I'd like to find more about.

The closes I have is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]]. It's still in-progress but it updates slowly :(

The premise is that as punishment for his crimes, after the series Draco is forced to live for a few years without magic. Draco runs away from home and tries to survive in the Muggle world.

It's well written because a lot of Draco's prejudices are turned on their head, but it's done slowly (which is more realistic since a lifetime of racism doesn't disappear overnight). There are a few funny scenes where Draco doesn't understand basic things (like to not cross roads when the light is red), but it's mostly pretty touching.

** Midnight guardian is a good one. It's 75'000 words long. After Harrys second year, a phone call pushes uncle Vernon too far and hel starts abusing Harry. Until a certain shaggy dog finds him. I should mention that there are five more books in this series as we follow Harry as find out what could have been.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2052919/1/Midnight-Guardian[midnight]] guardian ]([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2052919/1/Midnight-Guardian]]) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2052919/1/Midnight-Guardian][midnight guardian]]

If you're looking for Drarry slash, then Turn (by saras_girl) is what you want, it's amazing and wonderful and everything you could want. 300'000 words, it's brilliant. One good turn deserves another, apparently.

Sorry I don't have the link, but if you google it you'll find it (it's on Ao3)

I should also mention that there isn't a bad fic on saras_girl page. She mainly writes Drarry, but all her fics are wonderfully long, so check her out.

Also check out coming of age in the house of black, it follows the five young blacks (Bellatrix, Narcissa, Andromeda, Regulus and Serius) and how they grow into the people they are.

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, whilst politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming. AU. Complete.

**** Serious question: did you like the romantic parts?

I thought the concept was cool, and the way he changed Hogwarts and the Rookwood part was nice (and dumbledore was hilarious), but the soul bond part made it unreadable for me. Like towards the end I was skipping anything involving Harry+Hermione or Neville+Padma (including whole chapters).

***** i was 100% joking lol

e: not a huge fan of HPMOR (read 15 or so chapters) and not a fan of anything robst (though i haven't really read more than a quarter of any of his stuff) but the general consensus of the subreddit is that both are terrible if that helps to answer your question in any way

****** Oh ok. Yeah, they're pretty poorly written imo, but there's some diamonds hidden among all the nonsense.

Still, lots of people like his work for a reason and I was wondering if someone could explain that.

And tbh HPMOR is the same for me. Some parts are so interesting, but then others are impossible to read. They're both "cherry picking" fics imo.

******* robst is really wish-fulfilly for any diehard H/Hr shippers. the issue is if you don't like the pairing, the rest of the story leaves much to be desired.

it doesn't help that all his stories are all pretty similar

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.
