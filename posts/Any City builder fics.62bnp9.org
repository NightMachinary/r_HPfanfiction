In the last few chapters the Harry in Core Threads By: theaceoffire has been making a city/island and I really enjoyed readying as harry made his Island/city are there any other story's were harry makes of his own city?

linkffn(10136172)

A reason they might be making a magic city is because of the rise of the Internet so they have to move the magical population out of Muggle areas because of cctv and the rise of smart phones


** Esama's Island of Fire series is pretty good. The bot doesn't work well with ao3 series so here's the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]]

** I request of some of my favorite things! There are a few civilization building fics out there and it might be worth looking through these threads: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xe42j/request_looking_for_fics_with_a_magical_exodus/][exodus fics]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4r5eee/lf_harry_potter_survivor/][survivor fics]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4t7lac/lf_fics_where_harry_has_a_space_ship_cause_why_not/][space ship fics]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xi9uz/any_civilizationbuilding_fics/][civilization building]]

In [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2849816][Space Haven]], the residents of an besieged Hogwarts travel via hidden gate to Atlantis and must get everything working again. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2320601/1/Under-Siege][Under Siege]] Hogwarts is locked down, but again, they have everything they need and it's more about building a community. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3450026][The Wizard Beyond The Walls]] fits a little bit? It is abandoned before the heavy duty community building though. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3999286][FeS2]] was inspired by Xerosis and has a similar storyline but they take over a hidden world rather then the moon. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] has been moving to 'create an island for magicals' as well.

A group of students uses a defective portray in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4014733][The ever-changing tide]] (a Naruto crossover) just like Islands of Fire. It isn't as good as IoF, but still worth a read.

For slightly off topic stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7398966/1/The-Ark-and-the-Desert][The Ark and the Desert]] most of Hogwarts ends ups on a distant world and has to terraform it to survive, but gets a bit bogged down in strange science. In Esama's Tumbling HP Crossovers [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3492878][Chapter 2: Because Why Not]] Harry ends up on a asteroid and has to terraform it. Likewise, in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1647644/chapters/3493007][Chapter 5: Forest Spirit]] Harry ends up with a seemingly sentient forest. [[/u/viol8er]] aka Cole Pascal's story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10622535/1/][A Trek to the Stars: The Potter Files]] also has Harry interacting with an established magical society on a distant planet, and causing some major changes. He comes in later, but it goes into detail, so may be worth a go.
