** I quite like this one so far linkffn(11862560). I've not read many fics where the protagonist actually struggles accepting a sex change instead of just accepting it without a thought.

*** Genderbender fics generally fall into one of two categories: either they give Harry a complete character transplant with his sex change, basically making him act as if he had been born a straight female, or they are an angst-fest which has Harry constantly having emotional breakdowns about his body (and often a load of other issues besides). See Effects and After Effects for an example of the latter.

Unfortunately, and somewhat bizarrely, both types tend to avoid an actual exploration of what adapting to such a change would be like. The "character transplant" ones involve no adaptation because Harry's character comes pre-adapted. The angst ones involve no adaptation because Harry rejects the change in favour of crying for 100k words.

So I went into this fic hopeful. And the fic is probably the best genderbender fic I've seen. But it is also intensely frustrating, because still, the fic falls largely into the second category above: angst-fests which don't involve much in the way of Harry exploring adapting to pass as a natural female in wizarding society, because he's too busy with his emotional issues.

In this case, most of those issues aren't even really related to the sex change, which becomes somewhat incidental to the fic: the primary character is really about the uncanonical psychological impact of Harry's childhood at the Dursleys, featuring our old favourite basketcase Harry who shows none of the strength and resilience of character that he displayed repeatedly through the Harry Potter books.

Thus the sex change - supposedly the plot of the story - takes the backstage to the same angsty, hurt/comfort, overwrought armchair psychology drama that we've seen in a thousand fics before. It's disappointing because with the quality of the technical writing and the commitment to realism, the fic could have been the defining genderbend fic, one that actually fully explored, in a realistic /but still fun/ way, what such a surprise change would involve.

For me the ideal genderbender fic is one that embraces realism but still touches on the tropes that makes the genre interesting in the first place. Harry shouldn't be becoming immediately feminine, nor should he immediately accept the change (after realising it could be permanent) but at the same time, there's not much point doing a genderbender fic if you're going to have the character completely ignore the actual gender change. Genderbender fics are interesting because it puts a character with a male viewpoint into not only a female body but also female societal expectations. So if you have the character avoid those situations, or have them be so much of an emotional wreck that those situations are just used to showcase the character's emotional problems, you lose the fun.

Further, this fic goes so far in the angst direction that it ends up actually sacrificing some realism in the name of drama. For instance, this Harry is written as apparently asexual, completely afraid of his new body, not interested in exploring it. Not only does that rob the reader of a lot of the fun of the genre, it's also not very realistic. Any teenage boy who found themselves in the body of a pretty girl is going to explore it sooner or later (and probably sooner).

Here's a case study to illustrate all the above: female Harry trying a dress for the first time. In some fics, Harry just immediately starts wearing dresses as if dresses came part and parcel with a female body. That's boring as it doesn't explore the process of the change. In other fics, Harry will refuse to even consider trying them. That's boring too because it just ignores the entire point of a genderbender fic.

The "realistic but still fun" option would be Harry being reluctant to try wearing dresses, being talked into it by someone like Hermione, then exploring his feelings about it, whatever those might be, and perhaps in the long term coming to wear them of his own accord. If the author goes the route of having Hermione help out then there's also scope there for a fun scene involving Hermione joining in, which then confronts the issue of Harry being attracted to women but now being expected to dorm with them, change with them, etc. Which Harry should find both exciting and uncomfortable.

The reason why this fic is so much of a "so close yet so far" situation is because it has many of those elements which would make the ideal fic, but always puts an angsty twist on it that removes all the fun. So Harry is reluctant to try a dress, but is persuaded to try it. His reaction? Instead of an interesting mix of curiosity, shame, embarrassment, secret enjoyment, etc, we get a complete emotional breakdown. Similarly, as above, the first time he's trying on a dress, he's doing it with other girls his age present, also changing into dresses. Instead of being excited about seeing naked girls, awkwardness and worries over if it's morally right for him to see them when they don't know he's "really" male, etc, what happens? An emotional breakdown, combined with a piece of worldbuilding (no wizarding nudity taboo) which completely removes one of the more interesting aspects of the fic (the aforementioned moral dilemma).

Essentially, the fic lays down all the groundwork to make it the perfect genderbender fic, then sabotages itself with angst.

**** You make some good points, but one thing I would say is to give this story some more time. It's only been, what, a month and a half in-story, and most of that in some degree of isolation? You're right about the two extremes these stories tend to fall into, but I'd say it's early days to peg this one as solely angst.

** Harry awoke and stretched, wondering why he felt tight across the shoulders.

Then he saw it as he slid out of bed. His boxers slid right off his much too trim hips and his pride and joys were gone and his pectoralless chest now had breasts that rivaled Hermione's, pressing out his Gryffindor tee. He noticed long red hair swinging out in front of his eyes.

He screamed then grabbed his jeans from the night before, absentmindedly comparing 'his' to what he had seen of Tonks's: 'he' had more hair down there than she had had.

His door flew open and Sirius stared in shock, his "HAR---" cut off as he was hit and slammed backward to the ground by Harry who immediately began shaking him, straddling 'her' godfather, giving him mild head trauma as he screamed at him to change 'him' back.

~â¢~

"Wow, you're gorgeous," Tonks said to an angry Harry who was sitting on his bed, hiding under blankets.

"I'll give you you a concussion too," 'she' snarled.

"Remus told me about the new metamorph test. You're about my level. This should be interesting. Strip down, let's see what we're working with."

Harry scowled but did as told. Madam Pomfrey had already made a house call, filling him in on what Tonks was likely to have to do to help him get back to his real body.

She Resisted the urge to comment on 'his' new, and strangely alluring, fast hourglass figure. Then she couldn't help it. "Your bum is actually less cute than when you were a boy."

"I'm still a boy!" 'He' hissed.

** Can someone explain the appeal of these kinds of stories to me? I'm not trying to be condescending, I'm literally confused and don't understand the appeal.

*** Hmnnn as someone who loves these I'm not sure how to explain the appeal for anybody else. Personally I'm a translady and I'll admit I do find it entertaining to see people thrown into random situations like this.

Honestly I think it's interesting to see how a character might cope. I mean all the ever day things people take for granted suddenly become an adventure. It can add a layer of AU while trying to keep things the same. That and if makes a character try and delve ivy who they are as a person regardless of their outward appearance. This is also why I love creature inheritance stories
