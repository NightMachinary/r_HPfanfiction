I'd like to read some good fics in which the main character has permanent "magic sight" that allows them to 'see' the presence of magic around them and inside of people. I'd prefer that this ability actually have a major impact on the plot beyond just being a generic power-up.

Some example fics which I've read already: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7502151/][No Glory]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12457005/1/Parselbrat][Parselbrat]]

  Saving the Philosopher's Stone opened Harry's eyes to a greater spectrum. Sometimes, all it takes for someone to grow is a dash of trust and a dollop of inspiration. Harry returns for his fourth year amidst the threat of the Dark Lord and a veil long parted---and his eyes are full of stars.

** Linkffn(Barefoot by Zaraxasmas)

Harry can see the history of stuff he touches, and it also starts to morph into magic sight as well. Has some odd parts, but a worthwhile read.

** linkffn(We, Harry Potter) has Harry being able to smell and taste magic (of which he can /eat/). This is a minor plot point in the published chapters (aside from him accidentally eating Ravenclaw's diadem), but will be important in the chapter I'm currently working on.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood that began changing him, body, mind, and soul. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process in the metaphorical balls. Now, what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon? (some fluff, no bashing, not power wank.)

** There is linkao3(Rose Petal Red). In it a self-insert is reborn in the HP world as Ginny's sister. She has certain abilities like Magic Sight and Clairvoyance but those are IMO handled quite well since they are the center of the story and the main character, not only power-ups, and are very balanced with weaknesses that come with them. The writing and story become less organized and strucutered around the end of year 3 but up until that point it's one of the best SI fics I've read. I think you'll like the story if you enjoy the first chapters (premise, writing, perspective).

  I'm a little upset with the creativity of my and my twin's names. I get that it's because our father's name is Arthur, and I was an unexpected --- though pleasant --- surprise. But Guinevere is just the English version of Ginevra! That's so- Wait. What do I even care about that?I'm the eighth Weasley. In the Harry Potter universe. Ginny is my twin sister.Oh god.(Well, at least magic is super cool. Right?)
