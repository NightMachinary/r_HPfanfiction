I've been reading a lot Fanfics in the last 3 years, both good ones and bad ones. Id just like to know which Fanfictions you like best and why.


** I have many favorites, but a lot are not high quality (often having okay characterization or ideas but bad pacing, plot, writing style, or bad spelling/grammar). Here's some of the better ones:

linkffn(The Serpent and the Mirror by Paimpont) The only fic where Harry is hallucinating everything that I like. Far from perfect but it entertains me every re-read. Love the symbolism analysis and the connections between reality and Harry's hallucinatory world.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpont) A nice mystery in the style of the early books. Love the ghosts in this. Just wish Ron had had as big of a role as the other two.

linkffn(Weasley Girl by Hyaroo) and linkffn(Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past) A solid genderswap that has a fun twist on the storylines of first and second year, great characterization, and whimsical tone.

linkffn(Let Perpetual Light by teh tarik) Dumbledore's back story, especially the time with Grindelwald, is my favorite and this is my favorite story about it. Beautifully written with an interesting take on the Hallows myth and phenomenal characterization, especially the inspired take on Ariana.

linkffn(Proving Them Wrong by GriffinSky) Percy is my favorite character and I love stories that chronicle his experiences during Deathly Hallows. This is one of my favorites. Has a nice, though sadly unfinished sequel.

linkffn(Ignite by Slide) I love next gen stories, and this is one of the best. Very solid writing style, good and well paced plot, and three dimensional characters. Especially love how the post-freedom Hogwarts house elves are portrayed.

  Sequel to "Weasley Girl"! Potter's Gang are back for their second year at Hogwarts, and face a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light.

** Because I have some time and I was able to copy some recs I made recently of some longer fics I bookmarked (Mostly slash) you get a list of some of my favorites.

These are the longer ones about 40k and longer

First of all, my favorite Crossover fics.

Linkao3(4148136) A Marvel x Harry Potter crossover. Brilliantly written, great relationships and characterizations and the plot was great. Pairing Loki/Harry

Linkao3(1134255) A Sherlock x Harry Potter Crossover. Also really good. Pairing is Mycroft/Harry

Linkao3(3205676) It's shorter, I think about 15 k but there I would recommend you to take a look at the whole series, I think it's only two works at the moment therefore you get to read a little bit more, it's also really good and funny. Basically Harry and Hermione examine the veil of Death and everytime you walk through you land in a different Universe. This one is a Supernatural x Harry Potter crossover, the next work in the series is a HP x Marvel Crossover. Here is no real pairing but I think Ginny/Harry is mentioned in one of the works but there is no focus on that.

Some other long fics (40k and longer)

Linkao3(9372596) I remember that fic to be very well written, excellent writing style. The pairing is Voldemort/Harry so some people aren't very into that. But I think the author has some other good works too.

Linkao3(11244426) Pairing Tom Riddle/Harry Potter. If you like that pairing I would definetly rec you to check it out. The ending always gets me, and I remember it to be quite good also

Linkao3(4340120) One of my favorites. Harry and Hermione travel to the marauders era. Pairing Hermione/Remus and Sirius/Harry

And here are some shorter ones (under 40k) and oneshots

Linkao3(9809804) This is the first work of a series. Holy fuck what a read. Pairing is Sirius/Remus and Remus/Tonks for some time. If you like Wolfstar I would highly recommend it. Very emotional, great characterization. It's a Sirius!lives/rerurns from the veil fic. It has some graphic sex scenes just as a warning for the people who want to check it out but I adore this series. The series is about 20k I think.

Linkao3(5025334) This whole soulmate series. The work I linked is a Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint fic the pairings in the other works are Drarry and Dean/Seamus. Very sweet and funny fics, highly rec.

Linkao3(19946671) A short oneshot about an essay Harry writes when he is in his first year and Quirrel/Voldemort reads it. Very interesting, just a chatacter study of how similar Tom Riddle and Harry are. Worth a read I would say.

Linkao3(6006037) A dark Harry fic. Voldemort/Harry. Don't let the summary fool you it's very unique. If you like the pairing it's really good in my opinion and it has an open ending. I wish there was more.

Linkao3(14010333) One of my favorite Drarry fics. Very funny and kinda fluffy.

These were all and I actuall reigned myself in with my recs. If you believe it or not.

#+begin_quote
  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  In limbo, Harry doesn't choose to go back to the Forbidden Forest to face Voldemort. He makes another decision and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them?This is Tom Riddle's entire life, as close to canon as possible, if he shared his body with Harry Potter (and fell in love with him).

He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

** Hmm... Well, there's a lot of options there, and it has historically depended on my mood :P

Some of my favorites include:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) - a Harry Potter/Dungeons and Dragons crossover that was one of my introductions to fanfiction, and is /wonderful/

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) - a very strange, different Harry that's been caught in a time loop, but the strangeness of the fic and its new introductions of magic are quite interesting. It's got a unique writing style - definitely not for everyone.

linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) - a fairly dark 'Harry is raised by a Muggle' story, which introduces interesting ancient rituals/runic magic to create a powerful Harry in a way that actually feels reasonable. The author's (actually completed) other work Blindness is quite good too.

linkffn(Blood Crest) is another somewhat dark one, this time about Harry stumbling across a necromancer and being apprenticed to him. Still feels quite early, but I really enjoyed reading it.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) - a crossover with the Dresden Files, which I've never read, but manages to get a powerful-but-not-OP Harry right, and strikes a lot of interest in me.

Somewhat shorter fics (completed) that I've also enjoyed a good bit include linkffn(Timely Errors) - one where Harry gets whisked back in time to his parent's era for a few weeks, which I found to be quite fun, linkffn(Stages of Hope) - where a darker universe version of Harry & co get transported to a much happier universe where things went much better, get into some (not particularly light) interactions with characters who are very, very different from the regular timeline and who'd died earlier. And linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) is a fun one that actually manages to use the 'Marriage Contract' trope in a good way, by not playing it straight.

Those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head as particularly /good/ - I'd also add in the Firebird Trilogy as one that I enjoyed, but isn't for everyone (and has some, ah, weird scenes).

*** Firebird is actually a really well written trilogy, and it would stand on its own as an original story if it had a different setting and a different set of characters. It took me a while to get into it, but once I got immersed in the world, I really enjoyed reading it. There are some dark topics, and the world is not a nice place, but it's definitely been done pretty well.

If anyone's interested, the first is linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy)
