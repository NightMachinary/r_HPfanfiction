There can be pairings, but I'd like for it to be a background or relatively minor thing.

No Weasley bashing, anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can have any warnings.

No OP Harry, no Harem Harry, no Lord Potter. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Can be Canon or AU.

Would like for it to be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

If there are pairings I'm fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13011075/1/The-MARVELous-Harry-Potter]]

One of the few crossovers I can read.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13521865/1/Kicking-Gotham]]

Recently completed. A tightly paced story that actually finishes.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip]]

Well written and fun to read. Not much else you can ask from a fanfic.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387]]

A super long Remus character study, and one of my all time favorite fics of any fandom. The author's dedication to fleshing out the marauders era characters whilst being unafraid to stick almost entirely faithful to canon is one of the reasons this is considered one of the best.

Wolfstar is the main paring but it's a super slow burn, and doesn't fully develop until far later in the story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]]

Incomplete but the author updates fairly frequently.

A time travel Regulus and Harry centric fic. They're also the main paring but the romance is almost non existent, and the author is adamant that this is a story more about the platonic relationships between the main characters than anything else.

This story is also fairly slow moving and features a lot of character introspection, if you're into that.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting) updated in January, so, it's hard to say if it's in progress. The Sorting Hat decides to mix things up and sort the students differently, sending Crabbe and Goyle to Hufflepuff for their simplicity and loyalty, Draco to Gryffindor for his unthinking devotion to his principles, Pansy to Gryffindor for being brave enough to follow him, Hermione to Slytherin for being so dedicated to her goal of going to Gryffindor...

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

weasley family feels and a really interesting plot. percy weasley centric. a wip but semi-regular updates.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380/chapters/39160087]]

quite dark but it's one of the few time travel fics that i like. an interesting take on tom riddle's character too. finished.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7523798/1/Stay-Standing]]

again, weasley family feels! ron centric and also one of the best out there imo. also finished.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1637290]] this is a dark!harry but not evil harry. He gets resorted into slytherin in his 5th year and has started to look into the dark arts to help stop voldemort. Really well written one of my favourite fics of all time, hp/dm but not the main focus in anyway - done well in every way. . . .

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022]] another of my favourites, if not my favourite, harry didn't go to hogwarts so Hermione and the squad track him down to teach him magic. It's just perfect, hp/dm but again lowkey and there relationship makes me laugh so much, awkward teens sharing a tent to pretty sweet . . . neither of these recommendations are graphic when it comes to sex, they're very soft and both are so well written i cant recommend them more, i hope you enjoy

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia SoteloHer door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)
