I'm looking for a fic where the quidditch team is protective of Harry because he is the youngest/smallest or where they think of him as their little brother.


** "I quit," Katie Bell said, directing all of the vitriol at the players walking away from her as she flipped her ponytail over her shoulder. Her team captain, Oliver Wood, froze in his tracks.

"Excuse me?" Oliver asked as he turned to face her. His expression was deadly serious and made Katie feel tiny. Of course, Wood, who was well over six foot, probably had a good eighteen inches on her anyway.

"I can't do this anymore. It isn't worth it," Katie said, digging her heels into the ground.

"What are you talking about?" Wood spat, annoyance evident on his face.

"You have the entire house following Harry!" Katie exclaimed "Because he's bloody Harry Potter!"

"Yes, he's the youngest, he needs protection," Oliver said matter-of-factly.

"Bollocks," Katie spat right back. "He's Harry Potter! No one does anything serious to him. But me? I'm on a first name basis with the nurse! I get cursed every time I enter a hallway. Someone managed to get Sprout's entire supply of Bicorn fertilizer into my bed last night! My BED Oliver! I can still smell it! It's like it's in my skin!"

"Thank God that didn't happen to Harry," Oliver said. "He needs his rest so he doesn't stay so small!"

"Small?! He's got six inches and fifty pounds on me!" Katie shrieked. She took a deep breath as her throat started to throb in response to her yelling. "I'm done, Oliver. I can't do this. I never wanted to Chase anyway. And now I'm miserable. I'm done."
