Someone (maybe Hermione herself) writes stories about Snape to get people more sympathetic to him. She publishes them and they become very popular. Snape is obviously furious. I remember one scene has a bunch of the students receiving their copies of the story.

Hermione pairs him with (I want to say a character named Charity?) in the story and later gets jealous when Snape has a flirty student just like Hermione described Charity looking. (Blonde and pretty)

I remember it was amusing and sweet but I can't recall who wrote it and I'd love to read it again.
