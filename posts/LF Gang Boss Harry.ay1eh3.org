I'm looking for stories where Harry is the leader of a gang or mafia. Preferably where he is suitably ruthless and blood thirsty. Where he's not just some starry eyed kid who happens to stumble upon his role as a leader of a gang.

Dark!Harry, bashing and slash is fine. Please no mpreg, pottercest, genderbending, romance/smut-centric plots or harems. Thank you!


** I wish I had any recs, because I always wanted to read a good fic like that, but all those I've actually seen are pretty ridiculous, with Harry ordering around bloodthirsty werewolves and centuries-old vampires by eleven. Or Muggle mafia described in such a baffling way that makes me question if the autor ever saw even one mafia movie, let alone did any research. I guess a wizarding version of The Godfather is too much to ask. ^{At least give me Harry Potter: Men in} +^{Tights}+ ^{Robes.}

So I'll wait here with you in hope for some good recs

  Jasmine Potter came out of her abusive childhood somewhat changed, showing a few sociopathic tendencies. When she lays eyes upon the wizarding world she sees oppurtunity, and decides to take up the mantle of her favourite villain. The balance of power shifts as the chessboard is shaken up by a new player. But what of her foil, Miss Granger? AU,OOC, F/F, Fem!HarryxHermione pairing
