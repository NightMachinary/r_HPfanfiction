Now, I'm not talking about those angst y romance or slash fics out there, but I'm talking more of a normal story where Harry up to a certain point gets his thoughts warped by repeated intakes of a love potion.

The story just follows canon to a certain point when subtly Harry is becoming more and more interested in the girl that keeps poisoning his thought with a special "family recipe" love potion that's hard to detect.

Of course the girl has to be quite a possessive and I suppose a bit crazy and smart to pull this off.

But then after a certain while she just keeps upping the dose cause you know natural immunity and stuff, and it gets then to a certain point where the story shifts from a normal/romance-ish/ tone to a darker and more sinister tone.

Cause Harry's mind is being warped thanks to the "special" love potion so he gets more and more possessive as times goes on. And the reader see's this through his actions and thoughts making him not necessarily evil but just goal focused that makes him just destroy everything that is around him that gets in his way.

At some point he just makes people disappear that get in his way of being with that girl. And he just keeps getting more and more crazy and vicious cause of what she's done to him. Just killing everything that stands between him and this girl, death eaters, Dumbledore, Voldemort, maybe even his friends?

Of course even the girl gets to a point where she finds Harry a touch too crazy.

There are similar stories out there with the concept that Voldemort is changing Harry's mind with the connection, and so he becomes crazy/evil etc.

But instead of Voldemort why not one of those crazy girls that dig the Boy-Who-Lived legend, I mean you've got plenty of weird and interesting potions in the Harry Potter universe, and it has been shown that even idiots can get away with a lot of shit.

I mean is there anything at all similar to this concept out there, but that isn't a complete angst, romance, slash wank fest?


** Linkffn(Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor) has lots of people including Harry getting sinisterly potioned but by Dumbledore rather than a girl.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

**** Mate, you asked for sinister mind altering potion use. I've read hundreds if not thousands of fanfics in the last few years and this is the only one I can recall that had sinister mind altering potion use. If you want to be picky be my guest.

Voldemort's aversion to love comes from his bad experience with love potions, which makes him sick every time he experiences love.

** The closest I know of features a 2-part potion, basically master/slave, and when the dosing goes past the maximum time, the masters (Ginny and Ron) go very insane in just the way you're saying. But it does have Dumbledore and Weasley bashing, unsurprisingly. Linkffn(3807777)

  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny
