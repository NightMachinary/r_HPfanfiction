#+end_quote

I think so.

#+end_quote

Rowling says that there is 1000 kids there, but she also said that the population of the magical UK is 3000, and those don't go together at all.

#+begin_quote
  Are there drinking fountains at Hogwarts?
#+end_quote

Is a topic for debate. Drinking fountains are really an american invention, while there are some decorative fountains in europe that have clean water going through them, the whole drinking fountains everywhere thing was invented by the temperance movement. You can't trust other peoples plumbing in europe, so drinking from their water? Not something that existed.

However wizards might not have that hold up, they might have had magicly pure water all through the medieval period, so might have drinking fountains.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes. See sleekeazy's.

It includes a hat.

**** Huh. Well, it's hard to argue with someone who lives there, I don't know personally what the streets of the UK look like drinking fountain wise, but everything I have read tells me that they are very uncommon there.

For example, here's an excerpt from a Guardian article.

#+begin_quote
  The results were startling. Across Greater Manchester, with a population of almost 2.8 million, there are no council-maintained drinking fountains -- with those that had been installed, decommissioned. The same situation was found across Merseyside, with all five councils replying that they have no working fountains, and in South Yorkshire, where a spokesperson for Sheffield council revealed that all fountains “were taken out a few years ago due to health risks and damage”.

  Tyne and Wear fares a little better, with one outdoor fountain in South Tyneside and two in Sunderland, while there are four across the West Midlands and one in West Yorkshire.

  In London the disparities were even greater: while Lambeth has 25, Newham nine and Southwark 13, a dozen councils -- including Sutton, Kingston, Brent and Haringey -- reported having no fountains whatsoever.

  Whether councils will share the enthusiasm of Gove and Khan for new fountains remains to be seen. Of the 32 London borough councils, only a handful said they were planning to install more, including Lambeth and Bexley, which is set to put one at Lesnes Abbey Woods.

In the US, almost every public bathroom of any description has drinking fountains outside it. Is that true there too? Or could you just be thinking that the amount of fountains there is normal while it really is just a few here and there?

***** Oh we don't have many at all in the streets, only in buildings. Most places where a lot of people are likely to be, for example a school or a gym, will have quite a few. It is true that they are a lot more common in the US. I think that's probably just because we have much cooler weather so it's less necessary for people to have water available whenever they are outside. It rarely gets above 30°C here (86°F if I've done the maths correctly), and we usually don't have long periods without rain.

****** I mean, fair enough. Every source I saw said that there were no water fountains, so I assumed that meant that there were no water fountains.

#+end_quote

[[https://time.com/3963231/j-k-rowling-hogwarts-harry-potter/][There is no tuition.]] The majority in England would go to Hogwarts, some may get sent to other schools as Draco Malfoy talked about possibly being sent to Durmstrang.

#+begin_quote
  Do potions work on muggles?
#+end_quote

Merope Gaunt used a Love Potion on Tom Riddle Sr, so we can assume most if not all of them will work on Muggles. [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/potions-that-muggles-should-absolutely-never-get-their-hands-on][Wizarding World]] also implies this, though I'm not sure how canon this is.

#+begin_quote
  Are there classes other than those shown in the books?
#+end_quote

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Alchemy_(class][Alchemy]]) is mentioned in the books.

#+begin_quote
  Are There Clubs At Hogwarts?
#+end_quote

There are a few mentioned, [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Charms_Club][Charms Club]], [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Gobstone_Club][Gobstone Club]], as well as a [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Clubs][few others]] mentioned in other media that may or may not be canon.

One is never mentioned.

#+begin_quote

  Is it possible to use the repair spell forever? Are the coins made of pure gold, silver and bronze? Was the conversion rate designed to not break the economy of the magical world or was it designed to help the muggle born?
#+end_quote

Should be. I would imagine so. JKR is bad at math? I just go with the flow

#+begin_quote
  How much does a wizard make per month on average? Do students pay to go to Hogwarts? Does everyone go to Hogwarts? Are there people who learn only at home or in the community? How big is Hogwarts? How many students do you have at Hogwarts?
#+end_quote

There a lot of jobs. I imagine they all have varying salaries. No and no. Yes. Hogwarts Castle is huge. We don't know the number of students because at various in the books numbers are given and nothing makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  How do students cut their nails? Do wizards use soap and shampoo? Do potions work on muggles? Are there any other focus besides the wand?
#+end_quote

With magic. Yes. Yes. I cannot remember if Moody's walking stick was a staff or not in the books.

Plain, black work robes. Yes, we know Alchemy is offered in the 6th year. Yes, Charms, Gobstones, and Dueling Clubs are mentioned in universe

** - Where do wizards get food?

They grow it.

The Weaselys have an orchard and raise chickens, and even pigs in the films. Presumably, they have a garden for root vegetables as well, as Harry and Ron have had to peel sprouts as a chore.

- Where do they get furniture from?

Presumably, their furniture is hand-carved, so there are artisans who provide it.

- Are there hairdressers?

There is at the very least lines of hair-care products. Sleekeazy's potion, which Hermione used in /Goblet of Fire,/ would imply a market for this.

- Do families have a monopoly?

Given the strong emphasis on family in the books, if generally only in the context of bloodlines, this does appear to be the case.

- Do they steal things from muggles to sell? (Knight Bus and Hogwarts Express were stolen)

Presumably, but this is likely situational. If the Wizards literally can't do it themselves, then they may use the Muggle artifacts as a base.

- Is it possible to use the repair spell forever?

Possibly, but it does appear that certain items are inherently resistant to it. Ron had to borrow Spellotape to "repair" his damaged wand, and /Reparo/ failed to repair Harry's wand.

- Are the coins made of pure gold, silver and bronze?

Goblin enchantments nonwithstanding, but yes.

- Was the conversion rate designed to not break the economy of the magical world or was it designed to help the muggle born?

Rowling can't do math.

- Is the first wand has a ministry subsidy?

If this were the case, Ron would not have needed a hand-me-down.

- Do all wands cost the same?

Er, possibly. Though I suspect there may be outliers--I have a hard time imagining Hagrid's wand, which was sixteen inches long, costing only seven Galleons.

- What was the main function of Room of Requirement and when was it created?

To provide a situational need. It is the Room of /Requirement./ If you don't need it, it won't show up.

As for how old it is, presumably it is as old as Hogwarts itself.
