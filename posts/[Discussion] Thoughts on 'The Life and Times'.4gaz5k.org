I, personally, adored this fanfic (Jewels5 on fanfic.net for those who haven't read it), but the ending... UGHH the ending!! Is it actually over? Because I've low-key invested my life into it.

*** I find it's really well written and explores a side of Hogwarts that Jo Ro never did- as the golden trio were fairly rule abiding and innocent. The Life and Times focusses on their later life at Hogwarts and the themes are far more mature, something that I found to be really appealing.

***** Hahaha that's badly worded. But this fic looks at sex and alcohol, whereas even in their final years the golden trio did little more than snog. They also only snuck out when they felt as if they needed to. Compared to the Marauders in this fic, they're pretty damn innocent.

Had to make sure it was the fic I thought it was. I have it on my follow list because the author claims it isn't abandoned on her Tumblr, but it's been 2.5 years since an update. Last update about updates was this past November.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

*** Apparently she's been on hiatus? The ending's fairly incomplete- many couples are left together despite other events occurring and it just doesn't seem finished. What was the last update about updates? I didn't follow her then.

** I don't think that's the official ending (because we don't know who the guy in prologue is - although I have a guess), but she hasn't posted in forever. I follow her on Tumblr, but she hasn't been active lately. I've been a fan for almost three years (god, has it really been that long), and I've only seen one chapter update.

*** Ooh yeah, the prologue is another one of the loose ends that I'm dying to see tied up. However her final author's note is 'Aaand we're out', which sound awfully final.

**** Jules said on Tumblr that she wanted the entire fic to be 50 chapters, and that she's got some of Chapter 37 written. So it's not over yet- just on a very long hiatus!

** It's not over. The author claims she hasn't abandoned it and says that the next chapter is in the works, but it's been over two years since the last update so... I think it's abandoned.

Which is a shame because it's one of the few fics that is really really good despite being tropey. Although I've heard it's also the one that started a lot of the tropes.

*** The following is from her tumblr. Yes, she says it's not abandoned and I know it's been years since her last update, but I am so very very dependent on this book and clutching at straws is my final hope :)

I've been.... around.

I am alive and well, super busy with the whole working fifty hours a week thing, but still around. And sort of hiding from my inbox because I am a coward.

TLAT is on hiatus--not abandoned because I still plan on working on it in the future, but I've been working on some other writing projects and those sort of have my attention at the moment. I'm sorry I haven't been more communicative!

*** Yeah, it's one of those fics that doesn't age as well because other fics adopt the ideas and characterization. So if a new reader picks it up, it just seems like a well-written soup of Lily/James tropes and cliches. But they weren't cliche when it was written.

**** Clich√©s essentially, especially those that aren't supported by canon. For example, James asking Lily out for years before OWLs/liking her since first year; Lily hating James; Frank and Alice Longbottom attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Potters; Marlene McKinnon being Lily's best friend; the 'fifth boy in the Marauders dorm;' etc.
