And can't really fit in anymore. It can be Harry, Draco, Severus, some other character that goes back in time, multiple characters, I don't care. As long as it has that idea. (It can be a minor thing in the story or a major).

And by "own age" I mean whatever age they end up being when they time travel.

Anyone can be the main character, can be any length, can be on any site, can be old or new, would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing).

I'd rather NOT have Weasley bashing, as I love that family.


** linkffn(Circular Reasoning)

Warning, very dark. This is a Harry that has been through hell and back again. He tries to go to hogwarts and barely manages a week before fleeing. Very original, quite old, and recently updated on dark lord potter (meaning it will be updated sooner or later to ffn).

** linkao3(1733899)

I feel like a truly good time travel story should derail the timeline as soon as possible. I didn't get that with this fanfic, it's not a complete canon rehash and the author makes somewhat of an effort to change things, but the story still follows the basic setup as the books.

I am however still followed to this story, mostly because of the charachter interactions. Harry feels something like and older brother to the rest of the kids. He feels like an adult stuck in a kids body.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** I had a plot idea somewhat like this that I wasn't sure what to do with, after reading countless Peggy Sue Snape fics a while back. Basically as a prologue; at first Snape returns back to his school years (perhaps after wishing to do so in death, with some entity omniously saying that he might regret the wish later on), and because his maturity was essentially frozen in time emotionally due to his DE days and years as a Hogwarts professor and never being able to truly live for himself, he has no trouble integrating. He makes a successful life of himself, making a name for himself in the Potions world, gets the girl, and a happy family. After living a long content life, he ultimately dies peacefully being with the rest of his family.

...Only to return back to his school years. Again. Except, since he was able to mature properly this time, and actually lost people very close to him this time in the last life, he can't integrate with his schoolmates this time around at all. He grieves for his lost family but can't do so openly since he doesn't want to reveal his time travel... And he really doesn't want to deal with Voldemort a 3rd time. This is where the fic would properly begin.

BWP is a great time travel fic where Harry, Ginny, and Ron send their minds back to the past, and the trio's inability to act like their past selves ends up causing a lot of problems. The Weasley's get a bit of petty bashing from Harry (though why is a somewhat major spoiler), but suffice to say that all of them feel decidedly uncomfortable, and things certainly don't go their way.
