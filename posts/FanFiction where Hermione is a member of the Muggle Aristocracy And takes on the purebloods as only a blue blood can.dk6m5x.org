I can find any fics like this. I find the concept hilarious because their is nothing like a posh part getting put in their place by some hiring on the Totem pole. Does anyone know of any fic like this?


** This role is much better played by Justin Finch-Fletchley. “Malfoy, Malfoy ... I haven't seen you in Ascott lately. Oh you came just with the William the Bastard? /Nouveau riche/” I have seen it in some story, but I cannot remember where.

*** Prince of a Slytherin, possibly. There's something like it, at least. Draco flaunts his wealth and condescendingly offers to pay Justin to do something and he responds with something of an explanation of how rich his family is.

** Closest I know of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/][Reboot]], Where Hermione is actually Hermione Graynge, a member of some noble muggle house, she hides it at Dumbledore's suggestion the first time through, this being a timetravel story, she doesn't hide it the second time. However this plot thread doesn't really go anywhere unfortunately.

Now for two that only are related to your request because they have Hermione as royalty in them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13228631/1/][A Whole New World]] Hadn't gone far, Hermione is a princess for some mystical kingdom.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13130897/1/][Incomplete]] an okay angsty H/Hr fic, Hermione is actually royalty for some foreign country.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

  HHR. Harry Potter screwed up big time which caused his best friend to leave. Five years after Hermione left, Harry has never lost hope of finding her again. When he does find her, it's of the most complicated circumstances. He was to be the bodyguard of the Queen of Karthegenia. With their unresolved past, could he convince her to forgive him?

** This is a thread in Care of Magical Creatures by mia madwyn. linkffn(3814832). It's an SS/HG marriage law fic (with 18yo Hermione), which I know is not to everyone's taste.
