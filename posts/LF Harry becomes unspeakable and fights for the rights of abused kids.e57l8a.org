Hi all. I recently re-listened to the 7th book. There was some seriously complex magic that saved him, and I can only imagine that he'd want to know more, that he'd have questions. I also imagine that he'd develop a passion for the well-being of abandoned or abused children. I'd love to find a story where Harry becomes an unspeakable and/or fights for the rights of children. Perhaps he starts a type of magical DFACS or just works with kids.


** With his saving people thing, or protecting them at least, I like this idea more then him becoming an Auror, though I could see why he'd become an Auror as well as that fits him as well.

If anyone has any ideas where he tries protecting abused kids let me know!

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
