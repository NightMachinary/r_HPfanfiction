I read a couple of fics quite a while back, and I'd like to re-locate them if possible. Unfortunately, I've forgotten the titles.

One:

- was a Harry/Morag pairing (I'm pretty sure, I do remember that the girl's being Scottish was a major part of the story, I think Harry ended up using the gaelic version of her name as an endearment maybe?)
- pretty sure it was bashing Dumbledore
- I think they kept the relationship a secret for quite a while
- They may have been married by the time they got back to Hogwarts

Two:

- The only thing I really remember about this one is that Harry & Co. ran into Dumbledore at the Quidditch World Cup camping in the time before the game, and Mr. Headmaster was dressed up all in green supporting Ireland. He was friendly (so probably not a bash fic) and ended up spending time with them.

*** Thanks. I thought I had flipped through every fic that mentioned the two of them, but I somehow missed this one.
