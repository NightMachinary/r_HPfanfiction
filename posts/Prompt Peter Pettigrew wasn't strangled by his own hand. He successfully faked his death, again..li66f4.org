After figuring out that being a Death Eater isn't that great as expected, he uses the opportunity to get out.


** Bonus: this is his reaction to everything, and he's been doing it all his life. Bad grade? Dead. Late to class? Dead. Awkward conversation? Expect him to keel over from a sudden case of death in the middle. By the end of Hogwarts he's gotten so good at this that he can make up a cauldron of temporary draught of living death in 30 seconds flat.

*** "Peter, what the fuck is your animagus form?"

"I don't know, I've never seen it before."

"It's an opossum."

"A what, Moony?"

"An opossum. A North American marsupial known for--"

"What's a marsupial?"

"They're animals that have a pouch. Like a kangaroo."

"So I'm a kangaroo? This is gonna be fun!"

"No, opossums don't jump. They're known for playing dead."

"Well that fits, I guess."

**** Now I realize that his animagus form was never a rat, it was an opossum, which Brits didn't recognize so they figured he was just a big rat.

** I'd like to see it where he grows very powerful like into a new Dark Lord as well. It would be interesting to see how someone would do that though, as he is a coward. Or he crazily tries to resurrect the Dark Lord once again. Or go to the past to help him.

*** Wormtail is too much of a follower kind of guy to take lead. But I could see him become a Dark Lord who doesn't plan to conquer the world or something but use his powers for petty reasons such as kidnapping smurfs or sending dark creatures to terrorize a town because the townfolks laughed at him once.

** I find this kind of an interesting idea but it seems that he does actually die. What I want to know is did he have a funeral and what happened to his dead body?
