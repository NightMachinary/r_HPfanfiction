So I am trying to find a fic about Harry being a healer. If I am rememberimg the story right, Harry took the Healer's oath in the fourth year which meant he gave up using offensive magic or something.

And I am pretty sure the story got up to the point Harry was like a super healer healing everyone during the final battle or something. But that could be a different story.


** Sounds a bit like linkffn(10709411).

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
