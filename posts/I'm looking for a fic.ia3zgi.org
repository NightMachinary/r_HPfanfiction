:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Its where Harry goes to another dimension where Neville is bwl, Harry's alternate self is a bully and I think Remus and Sirius had a kid. Its also a slash and Harry changed his last name into Skywalker (its not a crossover).


** This has everything you asked for, except I don't remember anything about him using the name Skywalker. linkao3(3390668)

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

*** That's the one I remember. Too bad it's not complete. Some of the best fanfics are incomplete. While some of the worst are done and polluting the world. Smh

** Is this the one where Remus and Sirius' kid is called Orion and he is a werewolf too. And the bully Harry Potter is selfish and a prick who tells Orion what to do?
