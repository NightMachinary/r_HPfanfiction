There are a LOT of fics where Harry's friendship with Ron and/or Hermione ends due to events in the other books. I don't know if this trope has a name but from what fanfics I've read, these sort of things happen: Harry either finds new friends or becomes a misunderstood loner, and he studies magic and becomes the next Merlin (or not). Sometimes he defeats Voldemort, other times he leaves the Wizarding world to its fate.

So I'm sort of looking for something along that vein but with Hermione instead and the events of 3rd year as the trigger.


** I mean the problem is she doesn't have any other friends besides them so I don't really think she would go back to being friendless.

*** I'm looking forward to what people on this subreddit can come up with. After all, there have been stranger fics where Harry becomes a loner and trains himself to be proficient with magic or fics where Harry becomes friends with other people so I don't think it's weird for me to wonder what would happen if it was Hermione.

** Harry lay in the abandoned classroom, dust in his nostrils, bound and silenced, reduced to scowling at Hermione's back.

It had been an awful two years.

First Sirius, kissed by a Dementor at the instigation of that traitor Snape.

Then the Triwizard tournament when his only friend and helper had been Professor Moody, a death eater in disguise. What a joke!

Voldemort returned to life and the stupid ministry persecuted him and Dumbledore; their DADA professor didn't even try to teach defence. He and Ron had resorted to practising spells in the Shrieking Shack.

Now a vision of Remus being tortured in the Department of Mysteries. His quick plan to sneak out to Hogsmeade with Ron and Floo to London must have been overheard; a flash of red light and he had awakened here incarcerated and helpless.

Hermione suddenly appeared in his field of vision, infuriatingly calm.

"It's a trap. You-Know-Who isn't even being subtle. I was right about the Firebolt and I'm right about this."

Harry tried to force a scream though the silencing spell. Didn't she understand a friend, his last link to his parents, was in danger.

"Just to be sure I've asked Professor Snape to check. We'll wait here until he does."

She paused and frowned.

"Honestly Harry, what were two 15 year olds going to do against V- Voldemort anyway? Disarm him to death?"

It was a good question. Then Harry remembered the something; something always intervened when he ran into danger: his mother's protection against Quirrell; the Sorting Hat in the Chamber of Secrets; the brother wands effect in the graveyard.

He would rescue Remus and confront Voldemort then let the something save him. Just as soon as he escaped from Hermione.

Harry tried screaming again but she had already turned away.

*** Steve Kloves is that you?

It was Dobby who told Harry about the RoR. Harry also had access to the CoS. Nevermind that he has a map to tell him who's coming and Dobby if he's not paying attention to it.

The most important thing here is that if Sirius isn't functional in OotP, Kreacher isn't running off to Narcissa and Bellatrix. As such Harry isn't running off to the DoM.

**** I was assuming Harry and Dobby only meet because Hermione goes to the kitchens for S.P.E.W. in GoF.

Arguably it's more plausible that Voldemort could have kidnapped Remus since he's out and about on Order missions.

** I don't have any where she leaves that early, but try these:

linkffn(A Very Alternate Yule Ball by pstibbons). Victor Krum remembers the night Hermione became a Dark Lady.

linkffn(You Only Live Thrice - The Tale of Elsa Jones by pstibbons). Hermione is framed and betrayed, gets broken out of Azkaban by a multi-national.

  Years later, Viktor Krum recounts the events of the 1994 Yule Ball that got his old friend Hermione expelled from Hogwarts. No ships, though there's Krum/Cedric. Harry bashing, major, MAJOR Ron bashing. Moral : Incompetent fighters should never duel.
