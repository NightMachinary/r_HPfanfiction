It started with Hermione becoming a slave and was being auctioned (she also became powerful and experienced some intense training) . Voldemort and the party of harry potter was both there. Voldemort having lots of money, bought hermione.

It was also in hermione's mechanism to warn their master whenever they think they're doing the wrong thing and i think hermione tried to warn voldemort about certain aspects but voldemort would have none of it.

And i also remember, in the end bellatrix became the new owner of hermione (not sure tho)

Then i think i kinda remember bella being pregnant(?)
