Oddly enough, The Crow and Dreadnought from Star-Trek: Voyager actually inspired this brain diarrhea.

Harry dies/is murdered.

He gives one last "fuck you" and act of defiance, however, and uses his life-force/magic to create an autonomous smart weapon, like a terminator-like drone, out of his magic/life's energy that looks exactly like him.

Thus, he pops off to the afterlife to be reunited with his parents, Sirius, et cetera, but what's left behind is goddamn terrible and terrifying.

The construct has his memories and personality, but is hell-bent on his programming/objective and wouldn't let anyone or anything impede his mission. It's a simulacrum of a human mind running on an orange and blue mentality.

The sad thing is that his friends keep thinking he's Harry and treat him as such, despite the fact he repeatedly states he's not, and they give shockedpikachu faces when he does something completely alien/cruel in his goals.

Oh, he talks, walks, and acts like Harry, but it's part of blending in to achieve his objectives: Otherwise, he'd discard it.

Dumbledore immediately recognizes what this thing is, and is horrified beyond belief. He also decides to treat it with kid gloves, since he knows he could use it to bring down Voldemort.

The tragedy? If Ron or Hermione impeded his mission, for example, he wouldn't hesitate to slit their throats as easily as one would draw a breath. Although he has memories of camaraderie and friendship with them, they literally mean nothing to him.

Ginny keeps trying to genuinely keep the relationship she had going with Harry with 'Harry', but he's using her as cover. Yeah.

And "he's" quite fine on fulfilling his mission and vanishing afterwards into oblivion after, much to their horror. He literally sees nothing wrong with it.

He'd complete his objective and fulfill his purpose. End of story. Why are they so upset?
