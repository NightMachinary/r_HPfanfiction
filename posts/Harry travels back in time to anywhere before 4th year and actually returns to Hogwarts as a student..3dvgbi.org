  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** Witch Queen is a great story that begins with time travel and diverges without abandoning Hogwarts.

One of the main contributions of time travel in this one, besides just passing back useful information, is to broaden the protagonist's vision of what the future could be, with the right changes.

One of my favorite fics; highly recommended.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

**** [SPOILERS FOR THE ABOVE FIC]

I started out with reading this series you recommended, so I figured I'd come back and let you know what I thought about it. First off, it was a fantastic recommendation! An excellent fic, and certainly within my parameters. I loved the surprise of Harry being sorted into Slytherin, and /loved/ the Slytherin politics, as well as how adept Harry was. The steady Snape influence throughout the fic was also quite fun - I enjoyed seeing their relationship develop over time, and I thought it was quite well written.

Now a few things threw me off: the first, is that Harry is /wildly/ OOC, so much so that the "a lot of years have passed" explanation falls through.

The second was a bit of the bashing. It was /far/ better than usual, but Dumbledore was doing things that didn't make a lot of sense if he wanted to control Harry (supposedly what he was trying to do) and then suddenly decided he had no need for the Chosen One (even though he had heard the full prophecy and knew Harry was the only one that could help him). I found no reason for the author to include a lot of snide comments about Ginny being a cheating, good for nothing wench other than furthering their personal HarryxLuna ship, which had no place in this particular fic. Speaking of which...

The third was the HarryxLuna. I've never had anything against that shipping, but the way it was written was... not fun. I realized I've opened and then closed this fic many times because of the following quote in Ch. 1 of Book 1:

#+begin_quote
  'I love you beyond the moon and back.'

  'That's not very much, I'm not that far away.' Luna replied with her usual taunt.

  'I would give you anything.'

  'Even a crumple-horned snorkack?'

  'Especially a crumple-horned snorkack'

  'Well okay then.'

  Luna stepped onto tip-toes and pressed her lips against his forehead as her hand pressed a small purse into his hand. 'Don't forget me.'

  'Impossible!'

  'I love you.'

  It was small and quiet, and the first time she had admitted it out loud, even after six years, and Harry had hoped she wouldn't have tears in her voice at the time, but it still meant the world.

  'I love you with all my heart and being my sweetest moonchild.' Harry too was crying, but with resolution turned and strode out towards the stone circle at the edge of the Rookery's fields. He didn't have the heart to turn back and watch Luna crying on the doorstep, but he knew she was there.
#+end_quote

The rest of the books' HarryxLuna consisted of: A) Harry talking about how gross and pedophilic being around 12 year old girls was making 30 y/o HP feel, while lusting after an eleven year old or B) Luna saying nonsensical and annoying things while Harry thought about how much better these odd phrases made him feel for no apparent reason.

Finally, Harry was a bit OP as I lost track of the "extremely difficult and obscure forms of magic 2 people knew" that Harry was adept at. A good amount of which simply felt like deus ex machina to be completely honest.

--------------

All in all, however, it was a /very/ enjoyable read and thank you very much for recommending it!

  Harry's now going into his 3rd year again & it's getting complicated. Sirius still escaped & Harry has to deal with Slytherin politics & some extra timetravel on top of old drama. Rescuing Sirius is the number one mission, but things keep reverting & Harry is worried he can't change a Thing. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 3rd in series. Rated M coz I'm paranoid.

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

*** For the first - I see it's a parody, and so I'm a bit wary. What's it like? I don't really want to read a fic making fun of the absurdity of some time travel fics (through exaggeration of the selfsame or whatever else).
