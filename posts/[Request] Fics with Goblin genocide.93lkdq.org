I hate goblins.


** I imagine that Goblin genocide is attempted during every rebellion. There's a reason that peace treaties end up signed rather than one side obtaining total victory.

** Linkffn(Broken Chains by Darth Marrs) has pretty much exactly what you're looking for. It's a bit later in the fic though.

** Hogwarts Houses Divided had the goblins being evil enough that I remember people were talking about it, but I think they just occupied them instead.

** Linkffn(An Unwise Conspiracy by Nia River)

It is a humorous fic.

**** Why? Because I think the idea of genocide is horrible and goblins are cute, and a story about that would be sad to read? How does that make me a bot? That doesn't even make freaking SENSE! And why and HOW would a bot even CARE about goblin genocide, or respond to a story request with an actual opinion? Do you think I'm some hyper advanced sci-fi AI or something stupid like that? People who possibly would even think that are just trying to find a nonsense reason to be jerks. Because that's even plausible or realistic or sensible at all. Jeez people.
