** Ooh, time to raid my favorites list! I generally don't keep things that are less than 100k words, so... here's a library. I tried to keep it varied.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11210022/1/An-Unexpected-Predicament][An Unexpected Predicament]] - The very first Neville/Harry I've read, and I really liked it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry begins Auror training the September after the war ends. His partner is Neville Longbottom, his old friend, but feelings arise that cause Harry to question not only his relationship with Ginny, but every other aspect of his life. As he tries to deal with confusing feelings for one of his best friends, he's also struggling with PTSD... Harry/Neville.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2529586/1/Broken-Mind-Fractured-Soul][Broken Mind Fractured Soul]] - really interesting series, does include some questionable psychology but entertaining nonetheless

#+begin_quote
  What if there was a darker truth hidden in Harry's story? Summer before third year, Harry begins to question his memory blanks. What happens when he finds himself before Snape for help? includes mentor Severus, MPD, child abuse, protective Remus
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11059561/1/Charms-Can-t-Fix-Us][Charms Can't Fix Us]] - First not-one-shot fic I've read that addresses the characters right after the end of the war. I thought it was well done.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over and Hogwarts still stands. A few "eighth years" choose to come back to finish their schooling in peace, to mentor war-weary children, and to patch together the ends of their teenage years. Hermione learns what she was missing while out with Harry and Ron, Neville flexes his newfound confidence, Parvati brews a perfect Amortentia, and Draco lets go. "M" to be safe.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][The Debt of Time]] - Really long (I mean that) like basically saga that will make you get attached to people and places and rip your heart out and stitch your chest back together. It does say 4pt series, but that's because there's like 4 "Acts" in the story. It's all one piece.

#+begin_quote
  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10725232/1/Key-Limes][Key Limes]] - Really cute Muggle AU Jily. Short by my standards.

#+begin_quote
  In which Academy Award winner Lily Evans discovers the periphery of internet fandom and the existence of Prince James's gold star system.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233539/1/The-Last-Marauder][The Last Marauder]] - I cried first time I read it. There's so much to it. I love it. Hermione/Remus eventually.

#+begin_quote
  In the wake of the war, Dumbledore's portrait gives Hermione a task that could change the course of history if she succeeds, but unravel time itself if she fails.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When a Lioness Fights]] - Spy fic, has an out of character Hermione, but I think that's redeemed simply by how the story plays out.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger, master spy, and Severus Snape, spymaster to the Order. An unlikely partnership, forged to defeat the Dark Lord on his own ground. But to do so, they must confront their own darkness within. Spying, torture, angst and love. AU after fifth
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] - I loved this series, unfortunately the last 'book' in it was not completed, though it did wind down for some closure if you check the author's blog linked on her bio. Has some extreme AU things, but I liked how it was done.

#+begin_quote
  Year six and Harry needs rescuing by Dumbledore and Snape. The resulting understanding between Harry and Snape is critical to destroying Voldemort and leads to an offer of adoption. Covers year seven and Auror training.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/811088/1/Not-Myself][Not Myself]] - Forgive some of the cliches in this story, since it was started back in 2002. I think it's allowed for a story that old. Very long, has a handful of short sequels, complete series. You'll get attached to some of the original characters, and there's a decent bit of character development all around!

#+begin_quote
  AU fic. Harry Potter is left as an orphan on the streets of London. Yet when he finds himself in the home of a family of wizards, he finds that he's a wizard. And not just any wizard...

*** Stories that are both long and marked as Friendship/Adventure/Romance often have a tendency of containing large chunks of inane writing (pointless dialogues, pointless subplots, repetition of the original storyline with almost no original development, etc), which I just can't stand. Can you advise if I should/shouldn't read these ones?

**** Predicament- seemed fine, short enough to not really have that issue

BMFS - I don't remember too many serious tangents, at least not in the first story (the one linked). It does follow canon timeline to an extent (let's call that the plot) so the recurring subplot dealing with the 'broken mind' does get slightly repetitive, and there's some annoying arguments that probably could have been done without.

Charms - it's short enough to not have that issue I think, but there is quite a bit of dialogue. It's a group of those who return to the school helping each other heal in the short term.

Debt - while it's insanely long, I don't think it got -too- rambly. the first part does follow canon events /somewhat/ but only through the last battle. Lots of mods there. The bulk of the story is during the first war/Marauder years, I thought it kept moving, but it might be stretched out too much for your liking.

Limes- only like 20k words, not a problem. Cute though.

Last Marauder- gets a little rambly, but not overboard I think.

Lioness- I just finished rereading this like yesterday lol. There was some repetition in regards to Death Eater activities, most of this was original development though. The few pointless subplots that I'd prod at helped the romance and angst along, and ended the overdone 'ignore feelings do job' thing that happens sometimes.

Resonance- definitely repetitive (within itself) and tangent-y, frankly I think you'd be fine just reading the original story (the one linked) and not the sequels. The sequels I think were what brought on my mental fatigue because it was a lot of the same. Because I read the whole series end to end, I can't recall if this first one itself was particularly bad with this or not.

Not Myself- lots of dialogue, I don't recall too many 'pointless' subplots, but you might be annoyed with one part of the bloodline thing that happens (I can spoil that for you via PM if you'd like, it seemed unnecessary, and I can't remember the spoiler code off-hand at the moment). There was plenty of original development though, which I attribute to the fact that it was started so early, so it only had to many of the books to parallel at the time. You might hate the way the author wrote the way Harry speaks (accent), but it was done for a reason (I was annoyed with it).

Of what I listed, I think you might like Charms and Lioness, and I think you should give Not Myself a try up through the 7th chapter (Halloween of 1st year) before deciding you hate it. Edit: Also Predicament if you're cool with Slash, I don't think it got graphic though. I also read it at like 3am the other day, though, so my judgment on that one might be impaired.

** First of all, -/shudders/- what a mental image.

And now on to my recs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]] The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]] If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3759007/1/Turn-Me-Loose-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]] he sequel to Bungle in the Jungle. Told in 2nd person. Harry Potter has returned to England. In the jungles of South America, he became his own man, a hero of his own choice and not unfortunate circumstance. Is it enough to save him?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy]] COMPLETE. Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]] Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]] Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

Hopefully you haven't already read these.
