what's everyone enjoying? let me know.

i recently read Away Childish Things by lettered on Ao3 and it's been stuck in my head. (Especially the first half.)

what about you guys?


** Right now its Revolution by GreenGecko - linkffn(2569561), someone on here recommended the first book, Resolution - linkffn(1795399) which was solid, but the second book is great, still good writing but way more happening plot-wise.

The better news is that there is a third book and I have a 24 hour flight coming up.

  In the Mirror of Erised, Harry sees Tom Riddle. No one will tell him why he feels such a deep, unnerving connection to Lord Voldemort. Yet this one change has a butterfly effect, to alter the rest of Harry's life and perhaps the state of the wizarding world as a whole. Is he doomed to die with Voldemort, in order to save everyone, or can he redeem the man who has already done so many despicable things, saving both himself and the man that shares his soul?

** You've probably seen this elsewhere on the subreddit.

My Top HP 10 Fics: a copypasta.

Most of these are either Hinny, Peggy Sues or both.

1.  Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now.
2.  Ongoing: Before I read, Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry_potter_and_the_nightmares_of_futures_past/index/]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Essentially he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.
3.  Ongoing: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] linkffn(13230340) was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. And it's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not a dragon animagus an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: a Black-Backed Bookwyrm, a club of "Oddly Shaped Students," Astronaut!Ron, Neville whacking things with an iron pipe, Velociraptor!Hermione, the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever, and a very confused Draco.
4.  Finished: This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you're not endlessly wallowing in sadness.
5.  Ongoing: Inspired by linkffn(10610076) Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is by Tsume Yuki, ravenclawblues' The Heir Of House Black linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922]]) is another Peggy Sue, however Harry is born as Turais Black, the elder brother to Sirius and Regulus. If you've read Galleons, it's a far more in depth version of that, going into the events of each year, that really emulates the style of canon with mysteries. The original characters are memorable and provide interesting parallels to canon. It's just an overall good quality fic.
6.  Ongoing: Now for something that isn't Hinny, but Drarry. The Time Twister series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/670418]] starting with Draco Malfoy and the Resurrection Stone linkao3(10021610) by YouAreMyHappilyEverAfter. It's a Draco Malfoy Peggy Sue from after the war where he regrets everything he did and goes back in time to be friends with Harry and help him out. Only it turns out to be a lot more friendly than he intended. What I love about the fic is just all the wholesome feels that come from it.
7.  Abandoned: I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a couple things I take issue with like the whole age line thing and the fact it's abandoned after the end of CoS. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and the Hinny because I'm trash.
8.  Ongoing: Magical Metamorphosis by Eon_the_Dragon_Mage linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/chapters/24670002]]) is a Transgirl Harry or “Holly” fic that I think is the best of its kind. The fic actually goes in depth on the Trans experience, focusing on gender dysphoria, the reactions of the Hogwarts students and general public, and the struggle it takes to achieve a trans person's preferred body. Also the fic has the absolute miracle of creating a good and friendly relationship between Holly and Rita Skeeter. As in, they even go shopping together. It's surreal yet makes perfect sense.
9.  Ongoing: PadfootIsMyHomeDawg's Parsel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6146470/chapters/14082718]]) is a story where instead of going to the Dursley's, Harry, dubbed Silas, leaves the doorstep in the morning of November First in a snake animagus form to live among other snakes. After he has been missing for 10 years, he's discovered by Fred and George in the Forbidden Forest. It's a Harmony fic, cute as heck, and a cool exaggeration of Harry being a fish out of water, having to learn magic and how to be human at the same time.
10. Finished: In Care Of by Fang's Fawn, linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of]]) is a fic where Harry finds an injured bat in the Dursley's back garden and decides to nurse it back to health. What he doesn't know, is that the bat is actually Snape. A heartbreaking story about Severus learning about how spoilt Harry really is, and he's pissed at it all.

  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Friday/ Saturday. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

Its a next gen, JAmes Sirius centric story where he is a new Auror working with his dad and falls in love with another Auror, an OC character. Great writing, JSP is very Jake Peralta-ish from Brooklyn 9-9, defintely recommend. Canon compliant. Sorry, no link

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH
