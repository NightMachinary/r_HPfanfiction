For me it is Dakaath: Prince of Darkness by LT2000. Amazing story, well written and with elements I have never seen before.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2229687/1/]]

I started reading it when it first came out and was extremely disappointed when it was abandoned. My question to you is which Harry Potter fanfic left you disappointed, enthralled and begging for more?

PS. Please forgive me if I have messed things up in the post. This is the first time I have ever posted anything on reddit.

I know what you mean. I chose Dakaath because it is the one that had tormented me the longest.

Abandoned *ten and a half years ago* and in my opinion one of the best that fits your bill.

And you still remember it? Now that must be a good fan fiction. I am scared to click the link and read it now.

**** It doesn't age well, but it came highly recommended from cloneserpents who is a very popular H/Hr author. Considering the time frame it was written I think the author did a great job given just how many changes showed up in the last few books.

** Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen. The author says it's dormant, and he'll come back to it, but for the forseeable future, it's dead, which really sucks. It's lovely and hilarious and touching.

** Twists of Fate. The Vampire!Harry thing really worked out nicely in this and even making him the Vampire King kinda... fitted. Even with the vampires behind him he had to struggle, had problems and a lot of responsibility coming with the power. I really liked it.

Goddamn, I would pay money to see this continued. But it has been dead for almost a decade now (and I just realized that there are fanfics out there that are 9 years old or even older. Fuck, I'm feeling the age right now.)

*** Fuck!! I just realized what I did by starting this post. By the end of it I am going to have a bunch of fantastic fan fictions which I will never get to see completed! But yeah Dakaath was last updated in 2006 and I am still hoping against hope that I get an update. It really does make you feel old.

**** It really is the worst. Especially when they end after setting the stage nicely. Its like seeing the orchestra in the opera attune their instruments and then leaving without a single tune played.

** Eh, Dakaath was good for its time, but Harry completely changing his personality overnight is ridiculous by any standards.

As for fics I wish weren't abandoned, /Song of the Trees/ and /Control/ are on the top of the list.

/Prince of the Dark Kingdom/ also looks like it has been abandoned, but I still hold hope that the Gods of Fanfiction would grant me an update there.

**** I like it in a sense because it's humorous and a fun read. But as a story it's very cheesy and ridiculous. And the author is notorious for not finish his longer stories but I want to see what he had planned for the end.
