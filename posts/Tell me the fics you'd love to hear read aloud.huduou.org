I'm starting a Harry Potter fanfic podcast, which will be like a chaptered audiobook of all our favorite fanfics, with short, fun bonus episodes about HP fanfics. I'm a voice over artist and I've been reading HP fics for...17 years! (wow, truly just realized it's been that long.)

I'd so love it if you guys could suggest any fanfics you'd really love to hear aloud. 

For whichever fanfics I start with I'll definitely be reaching out to authors and asking permission, if I'm able to contact them! I'm so excited, and I love our reddit community. Can't wait to start!

*** Hey, I just wanted to say that there already is one (unfinished) audiobook of this on YT, up to and including parts of chapter 5. The owner of that YT channel posted it on here when he started recording. [[https://www.youtube.com/user/spineyrequiem][Link]]

As I said though it's unfinished so definitely a good suggestion.

** First, that's such a cool idea and I'm excited to hear some fics!

I think a good short one would be linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair).

It has some italicized words that when I read I imagine the emphasis and emotion in them, so I think hearing it out loud with the emphasis would be really cool.

Also pretty much everyone likes this fic so a lot of people would know it.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  A dazzling city under an Empyrean Night. Tame by day, gorgeous by night. Eight Individuals: each of contrasting emotions and wishes, and with their servants, struggle for an omnipotent relic, that which would grant their greatest desires and dreams.

** Faint Indirections - One-Shot, Post War, Draco/Harry!

Set in Boston, Draco is a student and Harry works at a library. They aggressively communicate through book titles. Obviously it becomes wicked romantic! Ron and Hermione are really well written. Title comes from Walt Whitman “Among the Multitude”. Really amazing scenes dealing with internalized homophobia and embracing being queer. In the authors version of what magic would look like in the States, muggles and wizards are integrated but muggles are just oblivious to their magic which makes for hilarious character interactions! Sooooo goooood!

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum...

**** Awesome, it's one of my favorites! I love the voice and the absurdist style of it. It deals with some really serious themes in a totally unique way. The side stories are also amazing. The LotR one has the Ring as a Horcrux and the Pokemon one raises interesting questions and the sentience of the Pokemon and whether they are enslaved.

If you decide to do I'll recording then I'll lol forward to it. Even if you don't, I hope you enjoy it.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
