(As promised) Many years back I wrote a series of stories set in and during the Harry Potter stories for my kids. The stories focus on other characters and are meant to interweave seamlessly with the Rowling books. My intention was always to have 7 stories, one of each year. I finished the first five but got complete stuck on the 6th. I have started posting the stories to fanfiction.net and will post links here to the stories.

Tamblin Demosthene and the Artiste's Alcove- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12203975/1/Tamblin-Demosthene-and-the-Artiste-s-Alcove]] The first tamblin story, an introduction to Tamblin, a character with some similarities to Harry and striking differences. Other important characters are Cascata Vega (original), Hannah Abbot, Susan Bones, and Theodore Nott.

Tamblin Demosthene and the Harlequin Accord- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12208777/1/Tamblin-Demosthene-and-the-Harlequin-Accord]] The second Tamblin Demosthene story. Discovery the secret of why Tamblin goes unnoticed and follow along on as his past makes a turbulent year at Hogwarts much more chaotic.

Tamblin Demosthene and the Unwanted Remembrance- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12209542/1/Tamblin-Demosthene-and-the-Unwanted-Remembrance]] The third Tamblin story. Family issues. A descent into madness. A shocking crime. I wrote this story with a different style from the Harry Potter formula as an experiment. It begins in medias res, covers about half the school year, and is told through flashbacks.

Tamblin Demosthene and the Narrow Ground- (Not posted yet) Friendships turn to romances, the Tri-wizard tournament gives Tamblin a chance to learn more about his father's history, and, in a world rapidly polarizing between the ministry and the Death Eaters, can Tamblin guide his house through the treacherous path of neutrality?

Tamblin Demosthene and the Empty Places- (not posted yet) Picks up directly where Tamblin Demosthene and the Narrow Ground leaves off. Hard times make even good people cruel, breaking into a place no one wants to go, and the Department of Mysteries takes an interest.

I'll post the links to the last two stories as I get them posted on fanfiction.net. Feel free to post questions or feedback.


** The stories are a tad darker than the harry potter stories, but still appropriate for kids. I'd say they start about where the 3rd HP story does in terms of tone.

** I have quite enjoyed coming up with mock covers for the books. I'm no graphic designer but I like what I came up with by and large.

** Just finished Artiste's Alcove and I have to say, it's one of the best fanfics I've read. You have that easy writing style that matches the magical feel of the early HP books so well. There was never much of a plot, but you kept things moving along nicely, raised some questions and I never got bored.

I like the focus you place on the characters, rather than the setting or the plot. I'm not sure Tamblin's all that likeable, but he has some fantastically awkward and introverted moments that make him a pleasure to read. Likewise, Cascata could get annoying in places, but she has some real heartwarming moments. That brief scene with Theo Nott was really odd, but I trust you have plans.

*** Thank you very much. I'm glad you enjoyed it. The first story is mostly an introduction to the characters, and a little lite on plot I would agree. I think the Harlequin Accord is where you really start getting into the major issues (specifically why Tamblin is the way he is). I'd be curious if you like that one as well (if so I think you'll like them all).

Nott is a reoccurring character who let's Tamblin interact with a peer rather than a friend. He's also devious and subtle. I really like him and there are some small style things I do when writing him that are fun.

  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

*** I don't understand, why would that help the reader? I was assuming people waited to read a story until it was all posted so they weren't at the mercy of the author's whims for when stuff got posted.

******* Not at all, but I'm not likely to see it if it gets posted all at once. I don't go trawling through the filters anymore in search of fics, I just use the [Favorites] + [Updated in 24 hours/1 week] filters and wait for them to come to me. So I'm much more likely to find out about it if you post it piece by piece.
