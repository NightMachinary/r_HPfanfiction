I read this fan fiction a long time ago. It was a marriage law one. Hermione was working for Severus in a potion lab. She was married toSeverus' wife's son. There were these rings involved that ensured hermione and her husband couldn't cheat. They burned if they did. I know it was once posted on owl.tauri which is now closed but I can't remember the name of it to find if it was also posted somewhere else. Help would be greatly appreciated!!!
