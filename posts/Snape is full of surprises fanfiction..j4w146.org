✓Snape centric.

✓ Language: English

✓Can be on any platform.

✓ Fanfic where Hogwarts staff/student body/Order members finds or sees something surprising about their Potions Master.

✓Good surprise.

✓Please not the fic where Snape has a secret wife/husband/child. Or Harry is his biological/adopted child. Or has a brother/sister. Or has a glamour casted to hide his beauty or his mate is the only one who can see past the charm.

✓For eg. Snape is in disarry (opposite of his all time immaculate self), Snape being a caring Head of House (like truly performing a role of gardien), being excited about potion,Snape's background, Snape is multilingual, his heritage, his boggart, his academic skill, has an accent his familiar, his academic records, has muggle college degree, or he's quite good in healing spells, can play music exceedingly well, wears glasses, can cast a doe patronus, something from his student days, his skills in potion or Dada, an animagus, etc....

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
