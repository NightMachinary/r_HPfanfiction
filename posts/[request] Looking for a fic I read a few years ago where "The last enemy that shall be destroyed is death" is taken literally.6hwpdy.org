All I remember from it is that Draco becomes a werewolf at some point and the final battle is between Harry and Voldemort inside of the Vail of death and they have to fight the guardian of death or something. I think Voldemort also has something that allows him to pass through the veil into death and back and uses it to travel.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Other Path) great story, I read it a few months ago.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's life up to his eleventh birthday was painful and harsh. Dumped in an abusive home by dead parents, running away from that home to take his life into his own hands and then surviving by his wits and his feet. Then a letter came, and opened a whole new world... An AU fiction with hopefully enough action and comedy to entertain.

** HPMOR and its child-fics take it literally too (or at least some characters take it so), but 'a few years ago' might be too long ago to be the one of which you are thinking.

*** It definitely came to mind. There's a big speech in the graveyard about how it /only/ makes sense literally.
