Looking for any and all "good" fics where Harry interacts with magical beeings/beasts.

Especially fics where Harry:

Raises and breeds magical creatures

Takes care of hurt animals like newt scamander.

Travels the world and keeps meeting interresting beeings.

The more focus is on the interaction with the creatures/beeings the better. Vastly prefer fics where the majority takes place outside hogwarts.

No restrictions on length, pairings or tropes, everything is welcome so my fellow readers can find something they like too :)


** Hmm

Maybe linkffn(Fair Lady by kideaxl) will be ok your alley

In the story Harry befriends and later romances Lady Death and meets all kinds of new creatures, not of just the Harry Potter world.

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.

**** Yeah I saw it was published in 2015, last updated the previous month, with just barely 100k. Is it worth the read or?
