[[/u/just_in_it_for_memes][u/just_in_it_for_memes]] came up with this genius idea: What about a fic that starts by Harry getting mauled by a stray on that doorstep on that cold november morning with naught but a blanket for protection. What about hypothermia?


** I've seen this before, but always with a werewolf.

**** No sorry, I tend to just skip werewolf fics, but I do remember one where it was greyback who bit him, perhaps that can help you narrow it down.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

  AU Eleven year old Harry's fondest wish is to disappear. With help from friends in a magical storybook he just might succeed. Warning: Mention of extreme child abuse and rape. Please don't read this fanfic if this will distress you.
