I'm looking for any story where the characters are aware that they are in a story or that they are actors. I'm also interested in anything that is filled with entertaining tropes.

  Hermione gives a lecture on "gender flip fanfiction"; i.e. fanfiction depicting an AU where one or more characters has been born the opposite sex. Of course, when the ones attending the lecture are Harry and Ron... or should that perhaps be "Holly" and "Ronnie"?... it might get a little difficult to stay on track. A very meta story.

#+begin_quote
  The characters of Harry Potter have certain pet peeves over the way their portrayed in fan fiction. So, they compile a series of letters to fan fiction writers explaining what their pet peeve is and why it doesn't work. Suggestions are very welcome.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.
