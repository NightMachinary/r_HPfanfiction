:END:
Looking for the fic called The Marauder's Companion by MibaMonsters, about Lily and the Marauders reading fanfiction of themselves. It was taken down from FFN for using a few chapters from the HP books (that the characters were reading), then posted on FictionHunt but it seems to have been taken down from there too. There seems to be a couple chapters around the web here and there. Really would appreciate getting to read this again in full!
