Mine has to be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6829556/1/My-Immortal][My Immortal]]. I started out reading it as a joke, then it was just so horrible I had to keep going.


** Cursed Child. Thank god, it isn't canon.

The highlight of my week has been watching [[/r/harrypotter]] tear themselves into pieces over this question.

**** /puts on the twat hat/

Um, I must have to correct you right there, Senior Wledig, as what I said was merely a statement and in no way resembled a question.

** For me the worst kind of stories are the ones with good premises and strong openings. It's only when you get into the meat of the narrative that it all falls apart.

I'm a slow reader, so by the time I've read my tipping point I will normally have invested at least a couple of hours into any given fic.

Most of the Romance genre is guilty of this and almost every Harry/Fleur ever written.

The fic that defines this feeling of disappointment is Heart and Soul. I stubbornly read forty chapters before giving up. I flicked to the last couple of chapters and knew I'd made the right choice.

Also Cursed Child.

** Someday karma will link to one of mine, I fear. The worst ones are forgettable to me. I don't finish them. But my answer---the ones that are angry, regardless of ship or character. I'm not talking about Harry angry with Dumbledore in OoP angry. I mean someone really using this to pour out the personal, payback-time, black-hearted ugly. It could be grammatically correct with careful metaphors, and it wouldn't matter, but so far that's not been the case for my reading.

If they have a baby come out of Harry's belly button or insist on everyone climaxing together that doesn't really help, either.

** Oh God, it was probably some crappy Dragon Ball Z fic. But in the world of Harry Potter and one I actually remember? Probably Runic Animagi.

I know everyone hates or loves /Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/ ,I found it amusing and different the first time through. I got to far through /Slaugh/ to turn back, but I had the discipline to stop at chapter 5 for A Peccatis. I just can't stop when there is a series.

same story as [[/r/strawberryshortycake]] just couldn't stop reading.

  When Neville agreed to become an Auror after the Battle of Hogwarts, he never expected to be asked to hunt down an old friend...or the nightmare into which that would lead. Sequel to "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness" set 5 years later.

** It wasn't a Harry Potter fanfic, but it was the worst thing I ever read. It was a Danny Phantom / Winx Club crossover. It was less that 1000 words, and basically amounted to, "Danny and Bloom fell in love...it was the most pure love ever in the world. They married and were happily in love forever. The End"
