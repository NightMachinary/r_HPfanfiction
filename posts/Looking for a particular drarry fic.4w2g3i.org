I remember a lot of what happens in it but for the life of me I cannot remember the title or any distinctive lines of dialogue.

Basically, Snape brings Draco to the burrow to be protected by the Order because Draco's been drained of all his magic by Voldemort so he's basically a squib now. All the other rooms at the Burrow are full so Draco has to share a room with Harry. Draco admits to Harry that he has no idea how to live without magic so Harry promises to teach him without making fun of him and this later turns into Draco admitting that his father uses the Imperius curse on him, so Harry gives him lessons on how to dodge it. Draco ends up kissing Harry on accident in one of their Imperius lessons. I forget what got Draco steamed up, but he got mad enough to storm out of the burrow one day and Harry ended up following him out without his wand. They then got captured by Death Eaters where they stayed in a cell for about three days and finally got together because they thought Voldemort was going to kill them before they got the chance.

If anyone could direct me to the fic I'm referring to, I would be extremely grateful.


** No idea what this is but it sounds pretty good!
