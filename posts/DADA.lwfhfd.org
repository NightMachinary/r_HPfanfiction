How am I supposed to think of dada, the subject. Cuz i cant see any self-respecting person calling their subject dada (pronounced as its spelt) but saying D A D A also sounds stupid, i keep seeing people have harry and what not say dada in a sentence and no matter what i do it breaks any immersion i feel, is this weird?


** I think the vast majority of students would possibly call it Defence? There might be a few referring to it as the acronym D.A.D.A... but that is weird. If I were a student at Hogwarts, I don't think I'd ever refer to it as its acronym, I'd just say Defence.

"It's time for Defence..."

That sort of thing.

** Pretty certain that in canon they call it Defence, not DADA.

I think fic writers got confused somewhere along the lines with the DA, which is referenced by its acronym. But I can't think of any moment in canon where someone talks about going to "dada" or that someone is the "dada" teacher. It's always "defence," or the full subject title.

** To be fair, in Con Law class we often refer to the Supreme Court of the United States as SCOTUS (which sounds really dumb). It's also like saying APUSH instead of US History. Does it sound kinda dumb? Yeah. Is that why we do it? Also, kinda yeah.

*** Idk, SCOTUS sounds better than DADA to me, probably because SCOTUS doesn't mean anything else to me while DADA is what a child calls dad

** Yeah. That's one of my little peeves about fanfiction. At least call it Defense if the actual name is too long. Same number of syllables and sounds a bit better than...DADA.

** I don't mind it to much, since I don't pronounce it in my head. If I had to read it our loud it might annoy me too. And if I think about it, I just pronounce it in my mother tongue, so it doesn't sound like any form of "dad" but reminds me more or Dadaism (modern art).
