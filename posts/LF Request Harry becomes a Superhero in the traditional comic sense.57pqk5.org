Surprisingly hard to find fics where Harry puts on a mask/hides his identity and saves people, fights villains and super villains alike.

Plus if it isn't Slash, Double Plus if Harry doesn't just murder everyone who is a villainous male only to "save" evil women


** Have you tried looking at crossovers? There's a small amount of HP/Worm fics where Harry becomes a hero. Sadly, can't say any of them are that good, but they exist.

Basilisk: Parseltongue (is canon, so easy to use). Maybe transform into that snake, or use the essense of the snake like Vixen does. Maybe nails that leak poison (instead of fangs) and which you can control to simply incapacitate or full on kill somebody. Hell, even the stare could be just incorporated that way.
