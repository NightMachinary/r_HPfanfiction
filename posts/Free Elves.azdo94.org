A recent fridge horror discussion on here mentioned how it's bad everyone is okay with slavery of house elves in the comments. I'm wondering if there were any fanfics where someone actually does free all the house elves? (And they like being free)


** linkao3(made of common clay by Lomonaaeren) has this as a plot point, but as it's done magically rather than by the kind of political/cultural/military solution freeing slaves in other contexts require and the story hasn't got to aftermaths yet, we don't know yet whether or not the elves like it.

**** It's not your usual Lord Potter fic. And it's quite good at capturing what disgusting institutions most aristocracies actually /are/, however decent some of the individual aristocrats may be in spite of what accident of birth has made them.

  Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

  It started with just seven steps to try and win Potter's affection, but life and relationships are rarely as easy as a checklist on a piece of parchment.

** I reckon the reason why people are seemingly fine with the "slavery" of House Elves because its become fanon that House Elves are symbiotic creatures who NEED to be bonded to a Wizard or Witch in order to live. This may not be true, but it's become one of those things that is universally accepted as fact in the fandom

*** I'm aware of this particular piece of fanon. I posted this because someone in the thread pointed out that it allowed people to write without having a free the elves storyline. The thing is I can't really remember any fics where that sort of storyline DOES happen.

  In the Department of Mysteries, Sirius Black lives, Lucius Malfoy dies, and everything changes. Draco, punished for his father's failure, is transformed by Fenrir Greyback into a werewolf, but Narcissa, rather than taking this as a lesson in obedience, abandons Voldemort's cause and turns to her sister Andromeda for help. As Draco struggles to adjust to his new life as a werewolf and a turncoat, he realizes that his only allies may be none other than his old professor, Remus Lupin, and (even worse) Harry Potter. Meanwhile, Sirius's near-death experience in the Department of Mysteries has brought with it side effects: the voices of the dead are calling to him from the other side, and they want something from him that he can't give.
