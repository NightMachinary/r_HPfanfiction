  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.

** Well, the only recent one is a smutfic with a bad plot (but it has a plot) called linkffn(Rose Paradox)

Its Harry/Harem, but with femHarry thrown in the mix. Its a clusterfuck of weird shit, in the first chapter Harry arrives mid-battle through the Veil in the MoM, headfirst into Bellatrix's crotch and gives her an orgasm, while everyone stops fighting to watch. (Bella is the "Sirius" of this world.) Complete AU though.

  Harry Potter has Issues. That goes without saying, of course, but when he finds himself in another world facing someone he has a lot in common with... maybe he will find a way to make peace with himself. HarryGirl!Harry with a few twists.

********* Once, when I asked if there is any femHarry/Nevile or femNeville/Harry, it was suggested to me that sometimes, if you want to read such a rare pairing, its better to write it yourself. I suck at writing and can't type for long because my hands hurt like hell (prolonged gaming, fuck you PoE, even if I love the game) I thought it was a good advice, so I thought to share it with you.

*********** Well, as for what to read, you could always use 0800-Rent-A-Hero as a preset and go from there, or HP and GWL, which is another good one (Though 0800 isn't romance and there's no pairing between the two, more of a mentor/apprentice relationship).

I don't think that its possible to have a self-cest without dimension travel, unless you go for slash (which I don't), so you can use these as a start. You can also use other DT for ideas, I'm still Here is a good one, and kathryn is usually really nice about using her premise for other fics, and just changing the harem aspect for monogamous. I honestly don't know why people don't write more of this pairing, considering is fairly easy to make it interesting with just a few alterations...

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N:fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.
