Hogwarts is odd; it has a Forbidden Forest, mermaid and centaur colonies, a half-goblin and half-giant for a teachers, trick staircases, stretches of wall that act as doors, Room of Requirement, a heated house rivalry, a mad founder, talking hat, etc. If I list them all I won't stop, not to mention it's 'the most haunted building in Britain' or words to that effect. Whomping Willow, Moaning Myrtle...

It stands to reason that because there are eleven Ivy League schools in the magical world, they should also have their own unique lore and history. Houses are a British thing, I think, so of there's that touch of individuality, it's highly appreciated. I always assumed that the eleven schools are the most prestigious, and historically schooling wasn't always that common. We know Durmstrang has a ship and a lake, at the very least, and Beauxbatons has winged horses, a half-giant headmistress and a fountain that Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel left behind.

Thanks in advance <3

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** @linkao3(Secret of the Patronus), not too much of a spoiler since it happens early and continues: Hermione leaves Hogwarts and transfers to Beauxbatons. Durmstrang characters also appear. The action takes place mostly at Hogwarts so there's not much "scenery" shown at the other schools, but we do get to hear about the cultural differences as it were.

  Harry and Hermione are young Ravenclaws with big plans to change the world. Harry wants to use the power of science to invent magical space travel, while Hermione is a celebrity Auror-in-training who wants to fight injustice. However, the two of them, in spite of their intelligence, can't seem to figure out how romance works. Also, there's this prophecy that one of them might destroy the world? Better reign in those science experiments, Harry.All characters are based on those from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (HPMOR). It's technically a sequel fic, but written to be fandom blind.

** linkffn(Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King): I haven't read this fic in a while but a very large part of it explores Durmstrang

linkao3(Train to Nowhere): This fic is slash but it does a good job with Durmstrang. I believe that the magic and the plot outweighs any hesitance about reading a slash fic.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
