It is quite vexing when you see a call out for a story, you recognize it, but for the life of you, you can't recall the name.

Basic elements given: James and Lily live in stasis inside a mountain. Harry eventually rescues them. Dragons are involved at said mountain.

It's nagging at the tip of my brain, but I keep drawing a blank...


** I don't know which fic you're looking for but it sounds interesting and it has piqued my interest, I hope it gets found soon.
