I for one would like to see a Rita Skeeter/Eddie Brock pairing in a Marvel crossover. Venomous reporter?

What are some of your written or unwritten unusual crossover pairings?


** I loved Severus Snape/John Watson from BBC's Sherlock. At first, it seemed annoying that John was simply replacement Lily, but then it the story took to his way.

**** SinceWhenDoYouCallMe_John: The Boy Who Balanced on the Train Tracks [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13516848/chapters/31003506]]

I have to warn you that the pairing doesn't last, but I loved it as long as it was there.

**** Theres a really good one on Fanfiction.net called The Swallow and the Dragon by Flameraiser, though it might be abandoned since it's not been updated since 10/01/2019. (MM/DD/YY) Dont know how to link since I'm on mobile

** Harry/Almost any alien Girl

Imagine the sheer hilarity of Harry introducing, for example, Ahsoka Tano as his girlfriend and everyone in the magical world is just like "yeah, dating an extraterrestrial is exactly what Harry Potter would do".

** I read the sweetest Nagini-Bucky story on Ao3, which is one duo I would never have imagined could work as well as it does. Not sure if it counted as a proper pairing, though.

** Luna Lovegood/ Ebenezer Scrooge from the Christmas Carol. She can make him less grumpy without haunting him.

** Harry/Pyrrha Nikos from RWBY. Sadly, there is only one half-decent story with this pairing, written by EmeraldGuardian7 and it's abandoned.

Harry/Daenerys there are absolutely zero stories out there with this pairing that is worth the few KBs of bandwidth you'll use to read it. Which boggles my mind tbh.

Harry/Cersei same as above but this one is understandable it's a weird pairing.

Harry/Wanda Maximoff I half remember a story with this pairing but I don't remember it's name, author had a unusual style (it wasn't bad or anything just unusual) and people kept bitching about it until story finally got abandoned.
