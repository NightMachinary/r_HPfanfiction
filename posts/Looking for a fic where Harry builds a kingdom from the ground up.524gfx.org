Looking for a fic where Harry is alone, and has nothing but his magic. I want it to have Harry using his magic and other skills to build a kingdom/civilization.

Over 70k+ words please!


** linkffn(11255223) If you don't mind crossover fics, this one is pretty good.

EDIT: Just realised this is only 50k plus words :/

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

The Difference One Man Can Make is a HP/ASOIAF crossover that has Harry build a small "Kingdom" beyond the Wall, earning himself the nickname "Witch King beyond the Wall", many friends and many enemies.

It has great building scenes, makes good use of existing characters and thinks the impact of such a culture through. I like it a lot and think its among the best ASOIAF crossovers out there, if not /the/ best.

Also, the Dark Wars series by the same author has Harry as a general who uplifts a fallen empire, but not the ruler.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
