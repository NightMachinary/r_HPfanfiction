The latest chapter, "Building Bridges," can be found [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/70897179][here]].

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

** So what you're saying is that by being in Gryffindor he acts more like how a Slytherin ought to be expected to act what with rational, well-considered decision making rather than his canonical Gryffindorish emotionally-driven behavior?

*** Quite so!

The main driver for Voldemort's poor decisions was his fear of death, so a (so to speak) braver Voldemort was able to take a different, more successful approach.
