  Can anyone suggest other drabbles that sort of tell what happen rather than show it to get a long idea across in a short amount of words?

It's been 7 months since that was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2xlvvv/completed_satisfying_drabble_pieces/?][requested]], so I guess I can safely repost. And yes, I did search for it so please don't link me the threads with the keywords fast paced, drabbles, drable, short and shorts.

Stories like linkffn(Red String;A Different Fate by lordhellebore), linkao3(Sisyphus by esama) and the tumblr post that i can't seem to find where Petunia raises Harry right. Summaries of months/years of 'what ifs' or others condensed into a lot less words compared to a normal fic of the same concept, or just fics without drawn out conversations, long expositions and annoyingly long inner monologues.

I'd prefer it if it's Harry-centric.

Thanks! :D


** The tumblr post story is expanded as a series on ao3.\\

  boy with a scar:\\
  What if Neville was the Chosen One, and James and Lily survived?\\
  &\\
  What if Neville was the Chosen One, and James and Lily were tortured by the Lestranges?

  the kids who chose themselves:\\
  What if Neville and Harry were both killed as infants, and there was no Chosen One

  no place like home:\\
  What if Petunia refused to take him in, and so Harry was raised in Hogwarts?

  the family evans:\\
  What if Petunia had raised Harry like a son?

  the heir or something or other:\\
  What if Harry was Sorted Slytherin?

  “Must be one of those weird Eastern European languages,” the Muggle nurse says to their coworker as they write the time and date -- the last few minutes of July 31st, 1980.“Mmm,” the other nurse replies. “Lucky little bugger, though. It's probably not going to be every day that somebody runs up to you and says 'Avada Kedavra'. Whatever that means.” {A Harry Potter soulmarks universe one-shot; could become a series based on requests and interest.} So this idea showed up in my head and I couldn't not. I'm taking requests for other HP character POVs and one-shots, as long as they're actual speaking characters (or Marauders Era).Mentioned exchanges: Draco and Harry:(in Madam Malkin's)"Hullo," said the boy, "Hogwarts too?""Yes," said Harry.(on the Hogwarts Express)"Is it true?" he said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?""Yes," said Harry.Ron and Harry:"Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurted out.Harry nodded."Oh - well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes," said Ron. "And have you really got - you know..."He pointed at Harry's forehead.Harry pulled back his fringe to show the lightening scar. Ron stared."So that's where You-Know-Who-?""Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it." Neville and Harry:"Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?"When they shook their heads, he wailed, "I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!""He'll turn up," said Harry. Hermione and Harry:" [...] I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?"She said all this very fast.Harry looked at Ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learnt all the set books off by heart either."I'm Ron Weasley," Ron muttered."Harry Potter," said Harry.
