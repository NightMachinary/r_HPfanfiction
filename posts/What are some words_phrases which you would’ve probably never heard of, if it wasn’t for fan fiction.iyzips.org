I'll start first. I don't think I would've ever heard of the phrase ‘creature heritage' if it wasn't for Harry Potter fanfiction.

*** Lol. I came here to say that I could have lived a life without "orbs" for "eyes".

Funny how we picked the same language. : )

** The whole ABO concept, I could have lived my life without learning about it.

Also: "Glowing emerald orbs", not that strange by itself, but when put in context . . .

**** linkffa(Harry Potter, Unexpected Animagus by DWDuck) was the first time. Although I've seen it a few times since then.

  For once, both twins blushed when they realized what they were about to explain to the girl they thought was destined for their friend and teammate, Harry Potter. “Um... well you see...” Fred stammered.

  “Harry's a bloody Parselcrotch!!” George blurted out. “We nearly ran screaming from the shower after Harry's first game and he was only 11,” he admitted. “I have no idea how he manages to balance on a broom with that bloody python between his legs,” he muttered.

  “To put it another way, where most blokes are packing wands, Harry packs a wizard's staff,” Fred told Hermione. He turned around in his seat and saw the slack jawed, shocked expressions on both Remus and Snuffles. The sight of the magical broadcasting equipment behind Remus made Fred frown. “We're still live, aren't we?” he inquired. Both the huge dog and Remus nodded in sync. “Shhhhhiiiit...” Fred whispered, drawing out the word. “Harry's going to kill us,” he moaned.

  With the love of a good woman, Harry becomes more confident and learns to handle the embarrassment that comes from being a teenage boy as well as an unexpected animagus.  Set during the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Severe Ron bashing ahead.  Rated M for crude language, even cruder humour, and sexual situations
