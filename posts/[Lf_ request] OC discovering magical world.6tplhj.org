Hello guys,

does someone know an oc fic with a muggleborn character? Doesn't have to retell the book, completely fine with voldemort not returning but it's fine either way. Oc can be friends with the trio but doesn't have to be. I'm fine with any house (esp. Hufflepuff is interesting). Either frequently updated or finished :)

Thx in advance, Nyx


** linkao3(For Want of a Mallory) - Haven't read it yet, but seems to be pretty well written from the quick glance I gave it. Note that she may not actually be muggleborn from what description imply.

#+begin_quote
  Follows the events of 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.' Mallory Hopkins is no ordinary eleven year old. At Hogwarts, she quickly realizes that her position as the only muggleborn in Slytherin is a precarious one, and it's up to her to put a stop to the bullying. That alone would be enough for any child, but the Chamber of Secrets is opening, and her teachers are whispering how she looks just like her mother. Meanwhile, Witches and Wizards are disappearing across Great Britain.
