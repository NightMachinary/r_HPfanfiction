Here's an idea: Attach a time turner to a vehicle so that the entire thing time travels. Enchant it so that things inside don't feel any acceleration. Then give it the ability to accelerate at 100000g. Accelerate to 99.999%c, turn the time turner as far as it'll go, and then fly back to earth. In theory this should greatly extend how far you can travel back in time.


** If it doesn't feel acceleration, then relativistic time slowing won't have an effect on it.

*** Depends on how the magic making it not feel acceleration works. If it's a spell that accelerates every atom equally it shouldn't change any behavior.

** Hmm. It does assume that the distance back in time which can be traveled isn't set by an external reference frame.

Still, worth testing. Unless you get DO NOT MESS WITH TIME.

*** I'm trying to write a future era story where space travel and FTL gets involved and I really like the consistent single timeline time travel established by PoA and want to use it as basis to establish how spacetime works in the HP universe, and I'm also trying to get it close to real physics and relativity (since that one scene in the leaky cauldron in PoA established that Hawking's a brief history of time is canon) I think I worked out a system, but whenever there's wormholes with instant transportation involved you get the problem that it allows time travel arbitrarily far back and forth, up to trillions of years (but not to before the wormhole was created). So any time limit like on a time turner is out. The relativistic turner would be a possible method for getting time travel to before you created a first wormhole. A time turner would be necessary to reach a location outside of earth's light cone, as the normal FTL would instant transport to a location many lightyears away and just as many years into the future (travel back through the wormhole would involve traveling into the past). Also, given wormhole time travel and time turner travel it'd technically be possible to have the restaurant at the end of the universe be a real thing, which, well, it'd make for a good location for the epilogue.

**** Which is fair enough. Personally, I've always thought that the six-hour limit on time turners was extremely arbitrary and had been set by whoever originally invented or regulated them in order to reduce the amount of timeline stress. It's far too neat and human-scale to be anything else.

Even in canon, the limit is eventually broken (although not until after the original seven books).

** Time travel and relativity don't really get along, and time travel and faster than light travel turn out to be the same thing. So I wouldn't try too terribly hard to be all scientist about it.
