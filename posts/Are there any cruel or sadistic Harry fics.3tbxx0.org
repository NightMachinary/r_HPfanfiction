  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][Birth of a Nightmare Man]] is a nice heartwarming story about Harry recovering from Azkaban dementor exposure. It's got a fair bit of bashing and a little bit of angst, so be warned about that, but once it gets going ti's a fucking bloodbath. It's the prequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]], I'd suggest reading what's written so far of Birth before going into the sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6764362/1/][Here's a fic that ships Harry and the Joker]]: Harry gets locked up in Arkham and snaps. Definitely qualifies as a sadistic Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/][Prisoner's Cipher]] is sort of a sadistic Harry, I think? I don't know. This story was too much for me to handle sober.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/][Equal and Opposite]]: This fics got more issues than you can shake a stick at. Harry literally gets addicted to fucking himself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/881050/cloneserpents][The Screams Series]]: The Ultimate Harmony ship. There are 6 one shots in the series. Take a look through his fic list to find them. They're probably exactly what you're looking for.

**** Here are a few more, some of them aren't from the Potterdom though:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9976928/1/The-bloody-Ashikabi][The Bloody Ashikabi]]: Harry gets raised by a psychopathic swordsmen. The Sekireiverse is kinda weird, but its a fun story with lots of violence and the whole Lord ___ - ___ - ___ political bullshit takes a backseat in the trunk of the car.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9117546/1/Birth-By-Fire][Birth By Fire]]: A fate stay night corssover. Shirou is raised by Kirei and is no longer a bland-ass motherfucker focused on heroism. Also Avenger is fucking awesome. I'm a little biased on this one since I really like fire so a story about a psychopathic pyromaniac kinda hits all the stuff I like in a story. I'm not 100% sure about sadisticness in this one though.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/slaughterhouse-nine-days-worm.361191/][Slaughterhouse Nine Days]]: This one's from the Worm fandom. It's told from the perspective of Jack Slash and is most him bringing a group of special individuals together for a higher purpose.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/phobophobia-worm.326972/][Phobaphobia]]: Another from the Worm fandom. In this one, Taylor's power is super strength powered by the fear of everyone around her. It increases the more scared people are.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8064299/1/Consuming-Direct-Control][Consuming Direct Control]]: Crossover between Prototype and Mass Effect. I'm not sure that this one is a sadistic sort of thing per se, but it's definitely Mercer doing terrible things for shits and giggles.

I'll probably come up with some other ones eventually. I'll post them when I do.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/Equal-and-Opposite]])
