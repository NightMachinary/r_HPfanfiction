It can either be a crossover or some OC unique character. Something like Itachi, is that a baby? but with less (or no) time spent in the other world


** Harry Tano was a thing.

*Er, sorry, it was like 2am when I posted this. It's sightly amusing but I wish that they'd really stayed in the "mentor" parts instead of doing the whole "technological revolution" thing (or at least delaying it until adulthood).

** I quite like The Snow Queen - linkffn(8724634)

A female harry raised in the hunger games universe, specifically to fight in the games themselves for all that entails. It's a massive shame it's unfinished and likely abandoned (updated in 2013).

I don't know much of the hunger games universe itself, so it might run roughshod over that, but it certainly dragged me in. I also love the backstory of Hermione, though that clearly deviates somewhat from canon (though pretty much any crossover story would)
