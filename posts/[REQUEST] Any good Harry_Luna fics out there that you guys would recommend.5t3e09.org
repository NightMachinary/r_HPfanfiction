*** The description for "Broken Chains" really confused me, with the pairings. I've never seen (or it happens infrequently enough that I didn't store it in memory) someone say "HR" in place of "Hr" or "HG". I was trying to figure out who had the initials with HR.

EDIT: I'm reading it, now, and holy /shit/. The Remus opening is /fantastic/. I haven't finished the first chapter, but hearing of the grief that Remus, Molly, Albus, Ron/Hermione and the other Hogwarts students who went to the DoM is beautifully /crushing/.

Albus having tears in his eyes while battling Voldemort to a stand still nearly wants to make me cry, myself.

Thank you for recommending this fic. Even if I don't like it, in the end (I tend to dislike cross-overs), the beginning has more than made up for it. <3

EDIT2: I haven't given up on it, but goddamn Chapter 2 is tense, isn't it?

[[/spoiler][Does Dark Lord Shaddix possess Harry's body throughout the entire series?]]

EDIT3: Goddamn you, [[/u/InquisitorCOC]]. God. Damn. You.

[[/spoiler][I'm on Chapter 3. Why did you have to give me a story with such WELL DONE FUCKING REACTIONS where Harry is (so far as I can tell) just going to be an evil Sith Lord throughout the rest of the story? It's so heartbreaking.]]

[[/spoiler][Hermione did not answer, because she never asked herself the question. But as she lay in her bed that night, staring unblinkingly at the ceiling, she considered how very much her life revolved around that sad, beautiful boy. She realized that she did love Harry. She also hated him in some small way, if she were honest with herself.]]

[[/spoiler][It's so beautiful. I really hope that Harry comes back at some point and can appreciate how much everyone loves him.]]

EDIT4: I had to stop reading so that I could favorite this story and author.

[[/spoiler]["Did you know that the boggart showed him a dementor third year?" she asked, more to herself than to the professor.]]

[[/spoiler]["Harry did not fear monsters or enemies," Dumbledore said as he gently placed a hand on her shoulder. "He feared failing others. His greatest fear was giving into fear itself, which the dementors represented. For that, he was in truth the bravest young man I ever met. To see him turned like this..."]]

[[/spoiler][Hermione turned to him in surprise when for the second time that summer she heard his voice crack, and stifled her shock when she saw a tear rolling down the side of the wizard's nose. He smiled at her and wiped the tear away. "Forgive me, Ms. Granger. I am an old man, and sometimes emotions do get the better of me. Seeing Mr. Potter like this is a stark reminder of the many, many ways I have failed him through the years. It does break my heart that I have failed him yet again."]]

This is some of my favorite writing... well, ever.

EDIT5: Fucking hell, this writing is so intense.

[[/spoiler][The leering, contemptuous expression warped into fury. "You stupid, foolish little /schutta/. I don't know who this Harry Potter is, nor do I care. If you like his face so much, you can look at it while I rip your soul apart!"]]

How have I never read this? Oh, yeah, it's because I never look at cross-overs.

I'm falling in love with this fic while it rips my fucking heart apart. What have you done to me [[/u/InquisitorCOC]] ?

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.
