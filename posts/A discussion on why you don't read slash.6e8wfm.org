** I'm not really in either camp to be honest. I don't really like popular slash pairings (Harry/Draco, Remus/Sirius), but do like Dean/Seamus, Albus/Scorpius, and other minor character pairings, I just very rarely see anything recommended that I like the sound of and I don't read a lot of fanfic anyway, so I'm not going to go searching for it. I even wrote a femslash Padma/Astoria and have a vague Deamus plot idea in the back of my mind, but not sure it will ever come to anything. As I almost exclusively read and write canon compliant (or at least fics that /could/ be canon compliant), that sadly excludes much of slash.

Edit: I have to say I'm always mildly amused by the amount of people on the sub who will condemn slash for being ooc in one breath and ask for harem recs the next.

*** agree. I'm totally fine with a slash minor character pairing, but just not the main focus. Also I find a lot of the men in HP slash pairings to be innately squicky. Snape, Riddle, Draco, Lucious, just make my skin crawl. Oddly I'm totally okay with Sirius/Remus mpreg. Unrelated but I guess sort of unrelated but on the LGBTQ topic: also totally okay with magic!trans, which is amazing that it is a Thing, though the 2-3 stories I've read with it have just been really well written.

**** I'm fine with it being the main focus, but like you I don't like any "bad" characters being the romantic interest and I'm yet to find a Sirius/Remus that kept them in character and, well, not sappy. I haven't personally read any trans fics, but again that's due to my canon compliance thing. I would definitely be open to it if someone took a minor character that route.

***** Something about Sirius and Remus just seems to attract the weird OOC shit, I don't know why. Angst potential? Tragic doomed romance?

****** I think it's the angst potential, but then strangely they take all that angst, take the most moody, angst character ever (Sirius) and then turn him into a sugary, infantalised, melodramatic queen, pairing him with his long suffering, Cardigan wearing, chocolate obsessed Remus. Works on modern family, but not in angst fanfic tbh, and for me it seems to exaggerate their differences to the point where it wouldn't work? I tried reading Marauders of the Mind because I loved the concept, but the wolfstar in it was unbearable.

I've heard good things about the shoebox project but not yet got round to it. I'm on holiday soon so will add it to my list.

*** I'm not one of those harem-seekers or slash-condemners, but I'd imagine that people generally tolerate more if the end result is something they find attractive, like the stereotypical fangirl loving pairings like Harry/Draco and Naruto/Sasuke or the average fanboy with dreams of harems and slave Leia.

** I don't read slash because I'm not interested in it. First of all, I'm hetero, so I have little interest in the details of homosexual sex. I can stand to read slash if it isn't shoved in my face very thirty seconds and has an interesting plot.

Thus, my major problem is this : the vast majority of HPslash is not, in fact, story. Just an excuse for two men to have sex. I can count on one hand the number of slash fics I have found that I believe to be worthy of reading. I should note, however, that I refuse to read a great many heterosexual stories that are often recommended here for the same reason. I don't read stories for the sex; I would go watch porn if I wanted that. It's just that slashfics tend to have a disproportionately high number of fics that have no plot beyond sex. Lots and lots of sex.

Moreover, from what I've been told by friends of a different sexual orientation, slash writing /isn't how it works in the real world/. The relationships aren't realistic, nor is the sex (still wouldn't read it if it was). The vast majority of it is written by teenage girls with little or no idea of how such a relationship would actually work.

** I doubt that this is going to end well but here goes.

Romance is a very important part of fanfiction for me. I originally got into it because I was a fan of a particular pairing that never came to pass in the original work.

I'm a heterosexual male and I simply want to read stories about male heterosexual characters. I don't mind side characters being gay but i simply want the MC to be easily identifiable with and gender and sexual orientation are easy ways to do that.

I mostly read fics that feature romance (that's not to say that /only/ read romance but i like my stories to at least have romance in them) and therefore I generally stay away from slash.

But too be honest i think there's more to it.

I actually asked myself the very same question when i was in an introspective mood and i wondered why I was so averse to slash. Because that's what it is for me, an aversion. I don't just ignore slash but i actively avoid it, even if the plot sounds interesting to me.

As I said, I'm heterosexual and not even a little bi-curious but i'm also fairly young (21) and while I wouldn't consider myself sexually inexperienced, I'm also aware that there's a lot of things that I /do/ in fact know nothing or very little about.

So the first idea that came to me that i might be subconsciously repressing a sexual interest in my own gender. Suffice it to say that I've safely ruled this option out. I'm simply not attracted to men.

The conclusion i've come to is that I just don't like being confronted with it. I'm not a homophobe, I don't care what other people get up to in their bedrooms but I /do/ care if it affects me. I get uncomfortable if I see two guys engaging in PDA (and curiously enough i don't particularly care if it's anything other than two guys, be it a heterosexual couple or lesbians).

I've also been hit on by men before and i actually felt a little flattered. It's a very interesting situation for me personally, because I like to be aware of myself and my feelings and I just don't quite understand where they come from.

I think it might be because I oversexualize relationships in general and theerfore the idea of gay men makes me uncomfortable because the idea of gay men having sex does the same thing...

Anyway, i know this reads a little disjointed but this is something i've thought a lot about and I've never put it into word before so I apologize. I hope i haven't offended anyone and I'm genuinely curious if anyone has some input for me.

*** Gay relationships haven't been normalized in the public eye, it's not just you. When folks think of straight relationships, they're more likely to think of platonic touching, versus thinking of same sex relationships solely in terms of sexual touching. If you deliberately pay more attention to platonic touch between men and readjust your eye a bit, it may help normalize gay relationships for you a bit instead of your brain going 'two men kissing' =>naked dick riding.

Same sex relationships- it's not all about the sex. ;)

*** This is pretty much me in a nutshell, except that I'm older than you. I fully support gay rights and being around gays doesn't make me uncomfortable at all. But when I read fanfics, the most important thing to me is to have a romance plot, and I want to see a hetero plot. It doesn't bother me to have a gay side character, but I want the main character to be hetero.

My wife (an English major) once told me that many female authors (including jk Rowling) used pseudonyms or initials to avoid showing that they were female, because while girls will read books about boys, the opposite is not always true. If that's true I feel guilty, but I wonder if that's going on here in a different way : gays will read straight fanfics, but straights don't do the reverse.

**** Another example of authors that do this is Robin Hobb. She used to write using her birthname Megan Lindholm and later switched to a pseudonym that was intentionally androgynous.

Another author, Krista D Ball, is very active on Reddit. She writes under her birthname, but comments a LOT on the challenges of being a female author, particularly in the fantasy genre, where people tend to assume anything written by a woman is romance/thinly veiled erotica. In addition, on [[/r/fantasy]], she makes lots of comments recommending different female authors, so if that is a part of literature you want to explore, definitely check out some of her posts.

** I don't agree that there are just two camps. I don't really like slash but I will check out a slash fic if I find the premise interesting and I don't think that's too uncommon.

Although I rarely read them, I have found that almost every single one even if it does look interesting very quickly devolves into a mess, with OOC characters, a focus on bad smut and discussion on sexuality which I don't find at all interesting or something I want to read about. I just don't see Harry/Draco/Whatever as gay so reading their conclusion that they are gay seems extremely out of character and annoys me. Although even if the character is realistically gay, reading about it just doesn't interest me because it not relatable or fun to read. It's even worse when with no warning, two characters decide how hot the other person is and start making out for no reason. I don't like that plot line between hetero couples and definitely not the even more unrealistic slash version.

The only slash fics I tend to like usually have slash that is skippable or in the background. Slash fics tend to go massively OOC though and completely ruin their story. linkao3(The boy who died a lot) is a great example. It starts out with such a great premise, characters, good writing, its very fun to read and awesome, before the entire plot line gets derailed by slash that makes no sense, OOC characters and one of the worst pairings in the fandom.

** My problem isn't with teh buttsecks.

My problems are more nuanced.

First, with the power imbalance inherent within 99% of slashfic. A good chunk of it involving Harry ships him with an adult male while Harry is younger, or with someone like Voldemort. That squicks me. Knowing that consent cannot legally occur when you hold power over someone makes these fics tantamount to rape in my eyes. This is before you even involve the adult/child aspect which is flat out worse. Why is Harry/Snape an acceptable pairing to the slash community yet Harry/Sprout is thought of as being absurd to the het?

When the terms Dom/Sub are involved, knowing that the author likely knows less about d/s relationships than the hack who wrote 50 shades, it is laughably bad. I am not wasting time there.

My next complaint is creaturefic or mpreg. It is just impossible for me to get into this knowing that it isn't supported by canon (the first), is nearly always bad writing (both) and is biologically impossible (mpreg). I am immediately out on both of these subsets, which tend to trend to slash.

Next, I hate "mate" stories (usually a sub-subset of creaturefic) for the same reason. I have stated my distaste of fics which remove free will as a trait of a character as lazy writing (also why I hate most marriage contract fics) so I just don't read it.

Finally, I have seen too many abuse!Harry stories where he is raped, then decides he is gay. I cannot even begin to tell you how wrong this is. Abuse is abuse and does not necessarily determine your preferences. Harry whoring himself for money because he is a runaway does NOT necessarily make him gay or prefer men.

Now that we have reduced it to people having consensual relationships with other people of their generation and/or consenting adults, my final objections are that most of the slash I have read simply isn't set up well. Harry wouldn't suddenly decide to be/realize he is gay (I have seen it presented both ways in fics). If he did, he wouldn't be a cartoonishly gay stereotype within a chapter or two. If the characterization is appropriate and logical, I have no problem with it. If he goes on a date with Cho then immediately wants to kiss a boy in the same chapter with zero lead in, I am out. Of course, I have the same response for womanizers in fanfic.

If you want slash to be worth reading, make the writing better. If your Harry is gay but your fic starts fourth year and is "canon compliant" then you'd better add some flashback scenes exploring the change/deviation from his canon personality, which is straight cis male as written.

Tl;dr: Most of the writing is shiatty, so I don't waste my time.

*** You made most of the points I've thought on writing. As a writer who ships mostly slash pairings, but still reads and writes different ones, I can say this is what truly bothers me.

And I will add to the Dom/sub thing: many people who don't know about m/m real life relationships think that one must be the Man(TM) and the other will be the Boy who needs to be guided and patronized by his significant other because of their inherent femininity. I really hate this and it happens usually, mostly with the already mentioned Snape/Harry and Voldemort/Harry. It also happens in Remus/Sirius fics, along with the mate stuff, which is why I haven't been able to find good fics on werewolves involving Remus.

** I'm gong to keep this short as it's late for me, but, as a lesbian, I tend to avoid slash because it often leaves me feeling fetishizes.

Most slash doesn't have serious, emotionally grounded relationships. It's smut and not much more. And when it's being written by straight girls who think that gay relationships and 'isn't it so naughty?' To have Draco/Harry, I feel very icky about the whole thing.

There is good slash out there. And I have no problem reading the ones that don't leave me feeling icky. But I'll continue to avoid the ones that fetishize homosexual relationships.

** I am a gay man. I started reading fanfic when I was 12 or so. I am now 29.

A lot of fanfiction is shit. Het, slash, gen...doesn't matter. A lot of the people writing fanfic are teenagers and a lot of them write adult characters from within the scope of their own experiences. They sound like teenagers. A lot of people writing gay male romances are women, and a lot of them also write from within their own experiences. They sound like girls. There are exceptions and I have read plenty of good fic by teenagers and plenty of believable male/male romances by women, but the bulk of it just doesn't work for me, especially when two guys act like teenage girls. I can think of some very popular fics that fall into this but are loved anyway because...I guess most of the people reading and raving about them are teenagers, girls, or both? I dunno. No judgement from me if they like it, but I'm gonna pass. Even stuff I read and loved as a teenager, desperate for characters I could identify with and explorations of relationships like the ones I wanted, I often go back to reread and think "wow this story is bad". As for the smut aspect...meh. If I want porn, there are better places to find it than Harry Potter fanfic. Bad sex scenes are worse than no sex scenes.

One of my favourite m/m stories ever, one that blew my mind as a teenager and made me start being a picky reader, was the Snape/Lupin story 'Third Time's the Charm' by Helenish. They acted like guys.

I will read any pairing and probably enjoy it if it's well written.

** Generally speaking, I think I fall more towards the first type. As others have mentioned, there are a truly ridiculous number of terrible fics that feature slash. More importantly, perhaps, is that most of the more common slash pairings are absolute shit. Why would you pair Harry with Draco, someone who has ardently argued for the extermination of people like Harry's best friend? Or Harry with the ugly teacher -- Alan Rickman was too goddamn gorgeous to play Snape, as much as I loved his voice and acting -- who hates his guts and constantly acts like a petulant child? Or Harry and Lord Voldemort, the guy who literally killed his parents and tried on several occasions to kill him? And so on. The characters are almost always out-of-character to a truly heinous degree, and the relationships are far and away the most important part of a story for me. I'd argue it's like searching for a needle in a haystack, except it's shit instead of hay. That's not to say that I won't read slash solely on principle, but... well, it's a bit like finding a fic that features some terrible trope like indy!Harry. Occasionally it can be done well, but 99% of the time I will wind up hating it and regret wasting my time.

On another note, part of what I like about the romance is the cuteness. In romance fics, I generally find the actions and reactions of the girl(s) involved far cuter and more interesting than those of the guy(s) -- perhaps because I can relate too well to all the missteps committed by men that are usually featured in said fics, and perhaps because I am attracted to girls and therefore naturally find them cuter and more interesting. I can squee over Harry and Hermione getting together because I find Hermione to be a romantically appealing character, not so much because I like Harry.

Does that all make sense? To be honest, I've been reading fanfiction for so long (and yet read so few slash fics) that I honestly don't even think about it anymore.

EDIT: And the far-too-common mpreg makes a fic so unrelatable as to be completely bizarre. Men don't have the necessary equipment for carrying a child, nor do they have anything even remotely similar. It takes the little suspension of disbelief I muster and repeatedly smashes it with a hammer.

** Because if you don't ask for no slash, then people start recommending terrible out of character Draco/Harry stuff to you. Just asking for no slash eliminates a big chunk of horrible fics since most of the main characters in HP are straight and writers often have to do a lot of mental gymnastics to explain it otherwise. Slash also tends to be pairings with characters who hate each other (and this is true in every fandom for some reason) in canon leading to even more OOCness.

I'd totally be down for a good slash Dumbledore story or a fic about someone else we don't know much about their sexuality like Charlie or something.

If Harry dates Draco, they are on complete opposite sides of the fence. They hate each other. There is no way to ease them into anything, Draco probably won't ever be a "good" person in that sense, and the relationship would probably be layered with tension, arguments and drama.

Another one is The Traitor Beru Cormorant (which [[/r/fantasy]] was obsessed with for like 6 months) which features a wlw romance and I personally really enjoyed.

There's also Song of Achilles which is basically the Illiad from the eyes of Patroclus. It's been hypothesized that the two were lovers but we have nothing explicit confirming that, and this book plays off of that. I personally thought it was probably 3/5 stars, but lots of people love it so you may too.

** To me it depends on what the core element of the fic is. As a heterosexual male, I have no interest in reading a fic (or book in general) where a significant portion of the plot is a gay love story. Likewise, gay sex scenes are a big no.

That said, if the main character happens to be gay or it doesn't dovert the plot too much I have no issue with it. Again and Again is a good example. I got into it because I was interested in Harry and the premise of the fic.

I read the first few sex scenes and Harry's romance with Voldemort because the fic had other things going for me (until it didn't and just became a romance fic so I dropped it).

This extends to non-slash fics too. I generally don't like it when a non-romance fic devotes a huge portion of its pacing/scenes to romance. For example, I thoroughly enjoyed The Lie I've Lived, because the romance is integrated to the point where it doesn't feel like it's taking away from the story.

That was a super long winded way to say (1) I don't like romance in non-romance-fics and (2) I only like reading straight romance fics. If a fic that I'm super into involved gay romance but it didn't detract from the story (like if say Harry and Blaise became a thing in Prince of Slytherin and it was handeled well) I wouldn't have a problem.

The reason why I don't like it is that it's usually not well written. Instead of reasonable plot they make the whole story based on gayness, which just isn't that interesting. I also don't envision Harry as gay, so it ruins the immersion for me. I don't mind so much when it's a believable character, like Dumbledore.

Then there are things I've read. Sacrifices Arc had abyssmal pacing and annoying angst so I've dropped it. Leo Inter Serpentes was a canon rehash, dropped. Butterfly Wings was much better than what "Snape is Harry's father" would imply. But the pairings were a part of the terribly boring second part and contributed to its boringness. So while the fic was decent, it actually would be better without slash (or anything romance related at all).

I have no problem with people being gay (or lesbian), but I also know that its not my thing and I have zero interest in reading about it, seeing movies about it, or to be honest... thinking excessively about it. As such, reading it is simply not interesting to me, and yes... at times... uncomfortable (sexual scenes mainly). I do like romance in the stories I read so that plays a big factor.

I would simply say that when I read, I liked to get sucked into the stories and at times put myself in the place of the main character. So because of my lack of interest on the subject, and the aspects mentioned before, I generally wont read slash focused fics. Note I mentioned slash FOCUSED. I don't have the same sort of aversion to fics where slash relationships do play a roll, just as long as the main character or main focus of the story is NOT slash.

And I think that's a key distinction in my case.

Edit: Id just like to add on that just like most heterosexual males, the idea of bisexual women or lesbians is definitely more intriguing than gay/bisexual men when it comes to reading (fantasy) material. I'm not going to pretend that its all that fair to look at things that way, but it is what it is. And if you are being sucked into the story or putting yourself in a main characters position, well... your views, feelings, and interests transfer.

**** Because I have yet to find a gay pairing that makes sense. I guess the closest one I can think of is Harry/Neville but I started disliking Neville because he's always the substitute friend for Harry and tends to be rather boringly written.

There are far more femslash pairings that are believable. Luna/Ginny or Luna/Hermione can be built on friendship. Hermione /Fleur can be fun if you either go with Fleur sees Hermione for the awesome person she is or by the kindred spirit approach where Fleur has few true friends and they simply get along once they start a conversation in private. Luna/Fleur can work in the same way. And there's always Tonks if you want someone cheery.

But let's take a look at the male side characters in Harry Potter.

There's Ron but for me the only good Weasley is Charlie and the twins to some extent. But I don't see either pairing working. Therefore the Weasleys are out.

We have a couple of relatively unimportant side characters that could maybe work with some good writing but I don't fancy playing smut roulette where 99/100 stories are just bad.

And then there are the Death Eaters. A bunch of racist scum that should be simply tossed through the veil, hanged or executed in an even more painful way. They started a magical SS. They should be purged without remorse because they showed none. A nice Nürnberg style trial before their imminent death. There isn't one of the lot that makes a believable parter for Harry and I'm not interested in reading stories with terrorists in any role but the opposition. I include both Draco and Snape in this category because I see them as bigoted idiots who supported a racist ideology. They are simply scum. I don't care about bullshitting exuses for them. Both were bigots before they joined.

There's Remus, who completely ignored Harry for most of his life. Who tried to run after he fathered a child. Who wallows in self pity. He's certainly not a suitable match.

There's Sirius but besides his questionable mental state he's better suited for a father role and not for a lover. I mean, Harry/Lily is a thing too, just not a plausible or well written thing.

Based on Rowling's work I can see the following pairings. Harry/Hermione, Harry/Luna, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Alicia, Angelina or Katie and Harry/Tonks. Everything else feels too OOC. Harry/Daphne is a thing this fandom loves but I've only read one good story with this pairing.

There is some slash out there that depicts gay sex in a way that /does/ make me feel uncomfortable. Because its horribly inaccurate. Then there is this weird section where gay men are depicted as these stereotypical pansy-queer types, which grinds my gears like crazy. Newsflash, being gay is a sexuality, not an entire character type. Same goes for the gay girls who seem to be allergic to any kind of femininity.

And finally, its the just awful, unexplained OOC-ness of so many characters in these fics, that it makes my skin crawl. +Tom Felton+ Draco is suddenly the hot and dark type with a tragic past in a family that wants him to be a blood supremacist be he sees the injustice yadda yadda yadda bla bla bla fuck off. Snape, Harry,... doesn't matter, the moment they become gay it seems their entire world circles around the fact that they're gay. If your sexuality is the only thing that defines you, you're a boring person, and if a character is primarily defined by sexuality, then its a godawful character.

Anyway. I think I've read /one/ slash fic that wasn't just awful for any of these reasons - but then had fucking magical cores in it to make me hate it.

** There simply is no way to write the majority of the major canon characters in slash stories without making them really OOC, with the sole exception of Dumbledore (and that I would be fine with). This is especially bad since the vast majority of slash pairings feature Harry with either much older men, or with Draco. None of those scenarios make any sense. The same goes for any of the other kids Harry's age. I could see a Dumbledore/Tom Riddle story if you squint reaaaaly hard, but frankly Tom was portrayed as mostly A sexual so even that wouldn't make sense.

The simple fact is there are not an abundance of gay characters in HP canon, much like in real life where homosexuals make up a very low percentage of the overall population. If you want to write slash that's fine, but to me at that point it really stops being a Harry Potter story and is just author wish fulfillment that has people with the same names and sort of the same setting.

Plus, I generally find stories that feature a lot of underage sexuality to be very uncomfortable and stay away from them. Hand holding and kissing is fine, but anything more than that and you should really be waiting until they're of age for that level of relationship.

**** Lord Potter Black is dumb the vast majority of the time because again, Harry goes super OOC. Sometimes it can be done well, but you had damn well better rebuild the world from the ground up to have it make sense that all these magical lords are running around. Harem stories are SUPER dumb, because I don't know of any girls who would be even a little OK with that idea (or guys for that matter if they had to share a girl). The only reason to read haram stories is titiliation, not for the plot. I might be excited by a haram story, but I would never be titilated by a slash story.

Harry raised by goblins would actually be pretty cool, because at least then you have a reason for his character to be dramatically different. Heck, that might even be a story where slash would make sense if the goblins instill those values in Harry. Wait, never mind, I read Harry Crow, and that was pretty dumb too.

Sexuality is a core component of someone's character and it determines the lens by which they view relationships and the world. Changing that about someone is something that you have to have a damn good reason to do, and frankly the reason their sexuality changed is probably more interesting to explore than writing graphic slash scenes anyway.

The big problem with slash is that by their very nature most slash stories make the slash the core component and most interesting part of the story. If you're already not interested in reading a really OOC slash story, they often don't have much else interesting about that that isn't resting on the fact that the characters are gay.

This is why in my stories, I change something then spend the rest of the story exploring how this would affect Harry and his character and change the world around him. Harry raised by SAS operatives? Better not have a basilisk show up year two and start petrifying people because there is no way the timeline didn't have a major shift. Harry bitten by a werewolf at the age of 6? You'd best not have a troll showing up on halloween 1991 because things are different now? Harry with red hair? Alright, who gave me those drugs again and why am I still writing this crack fic?

Anyway, if you can list for me slash stories where there is a compelling reason for the characters sexuality to change, the universe is impacted in a major way so the stations of the canon no longer play out in the same tired old way, and people's personalities are still in line with canon will reflecting the growth and change this new timeline would have wrought, I would be willing to read them instead of yet anohter fic where Harry and Draco hate each other right up until they're riping their clothes off.

Disagree. I don't see how Harry has to go about his life any differently, because he may or may not be attracted to men. In fact this is the recipe for an awful story. Where the author makes Harry completely different, just cause he like boys.

He's still a Gryffindor, he still has to defeat LV, he still was abused by the Dursleys. Maybe in addition to all that he finds Cedric mildly attractive cause he a hormonal teenage boy, and it goes like that sometimes. Doesn't make him a different person.

I like girls, and although that may change how I react to particular situations, I'm not so different than when/if I was straight.

****** No, it's not a light switch. That's why it takes something to change it. You can't flick someone's sexuality on and off, there is something deep within the psyche that changes. Why, if everything else about Harry is the same, is he suddenly gay? There is no reason given, no core part of his character that has subtly shifted. I agree that making Harry completely different just because he likes boys as dumb. Your'e working backwards. He should like boys because he is very different; his life experiences and psychology have changed and there needs to be a reason for it.

If your sexuality did change (which is an entirely different argument I have no desire to have as to if people's sexuality can change), then it is because you as a human being grew and developed in that direction. Something about your growth and development led you in that direction. If you are approaching this from the argument that sexuality is inherent, that's fine, but then why has Harry changed? Are his genes subtly different? If so, surely this has changed how he views the world and his relationships along the way.

If we are sexually attracted to someone, we perceive and react to them differently than if we find them uninteresting. If Harry is gay, you need to change how he reacts to the boys and girls, because there are going to be major changes to how he views and interacts with them. As you said, this is not a light switch, you cannot throw it and have just one aspect of Harry change. This is a core part of his psyche and it needs to have lasting impact on the character.

This is the problem with a lot of slash stories: they just flip the switch. They are then uninteresting for the same reason that stories that have "Harry starts sleeping with girl x because reasons" stories are uninteresting. Why is Harry suddenly very attracted to this new character? What about him has changed? Explore that and its consequences and then you have a good story.

I'm in this school. Sexuality is a spectrum. You can be mildly attracted to someone or majorly. There doesn't HAVE to be any rhyme or reason to your attractions and they dont have to be serious, but they can be.

So I do think a story should be developed. You can't go from him and Draco hating each other to being fine and dandy. However I do think that when they are written as themselves without major alterations they complement each other.

The next thing is that in canon the main characters demonstrate absolutely nothing but hetero tendencies so you have to start from scratch to show their gay character develop - and as recently discussed in another thread, I'm not that interested in reading full redo fics.

But the main thing is that slash fics tend to be written as fantasies by people with no sexual experience, especially since it seems women write more slash and men more femslash (I'm quite happy to be proven wrong there - that's just my impression.) I prefer stories where the smut is realistic.

Why on Earth should we have slash with Harry and Malfoy, when they both hate each other with a burning passion, and Malfoy has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It is honestly a similar situation with the power trip fics, where Harry is royalty, richer than god himself, and can blow up the world by snapping his fingers. I really cannot identify with that, and I honestly believe that they are low quality and not indicative of reality.

There's cute MWPP-era pranks and fluffy falling in love, there's /The/ Prank, which probably laid the foundations of whatever lack of trust caused Remus to believe that Sirius could have been the one who betrayed James and Lily, and the subsequent tensions of the First War, there's Lost Years where Remus mourns the loss of his friends, there's Laying Low at Lupin's after PoA, there's Bring Back Black and other fix-it fics...

Inexperienced writers who lean too heavily on yaoi cliches; a deluge of pairings that are either extremely uncomfortable, implausible, or personally unappealing; being in love is suddenly the only thing that the main characters are about; men written as (crappily characterized) women; abuse = love; my parents hate my gayness; applying Muggle biases to wizarding society ... I could go on.

Also, like most pairing-focused fics, the plot is quickly lost in the relationship. Even romance genre stories need to have shit going on in it other than sex scenes. I want to read a story with a pairing in it, not a story all about the pairing -- just the same as I want characters who /happen/ to be LGBT, and not characters who are /only/ LGBT.

(Also, constantly fucking each other is not a personality trait -- it's goddamn boring, especially if the fic is /not/ categorized as a romance.)

I have similar problems with f/m (pick a popular pairing involving Hermione that doesn't involve Ron or Harry and you'll see what I mean). Less so with f/f, which has a tendency to be written by the target audience, for the target audience.

Finally, I write romance novels for a living. I do not like to read bad ones.

In the end, it's much, much easier (and less infuriating) for me to filter out romance altogether, and, by extension, slash, if I want to read a story with plot and semi-decent characterization. The only one that I've liked in this fandom has been linkffn(October by The Carnivorous Muffin) because it's so atypical.

Edit: Shoot, I linked that first fic wrongly.

** This is going to be quick as I really want to get to bed.

A lot of writers, whether good or bad, fall victim to the same things. All these things vary and each of them can ruin a fic in a split-second. I'll try and list them for you, but I am tired and I may just ramble on about things no one understands.

One -- *General Relationships*!

The major issue is that if the main character(s) is/are gay, everyone else seems to be as well. It's presented as an ‘Oh, you're gay? Well, so is everyone else' situation. It's unrealistic, but this is something a straight writer will not comprehend. I cannot speak for everyone, but I tended to question everything and everyone. I always debated whether people were gay and I'd prod at it. Most of the time I'd get weird looks and then I knew.

What I'm getting at -- although, rather badly -- is that there needs to be conflict or issues. Not everyone you meet is either gay or straight, but the probability of it is very slim. There are a lot of closeted people that will vehemently deny being gay because they're afraid. You can use this as a great character building example.

Nothing should, just like in real life, proceed perfectly.

Make the character go through 1 or 2 other people before finding out that their future partner is actually gay. Also, the HP worlds is mostly set in the 90's. People in my town were hunted and beaten for being gay. I'm not saying that it's not accepted, but I cannot see someone openly flaunting it.

The 1940's were worse.

Two -- *Sex*!

There's a lot of preparation that you never see. I understand no one, besides a select few, want to read about the ‘cleaning', but it needs to be thought about. Also, not all gay guys like anal. I know a few people that identify as ‘bottoms' and they would never participate as it hurts, even if the g-spot is hurt.

Not all bottoms are girls with dicks. They don't break into tears when their partner threatens them. Some gay relationships can turn into a full fist fight. Men can hit each other without being dubbed as abuse (well, it can, but y'know). The point is, stop making the bottoms act like girls whereas the tops are manly men. I have seen it reversed, not at all, and equal.

Three -- *Other*!

The relationship shouldn't be the focus if that's not the intention of your book. Don't change all the characters because of their sexuality. Sexuality does not define a person and you shouldn't act like it does.

Also, not all gay men pop a boner whenever they see another man naked. I cannot say how much I have seen, “And Harry walks into the locker room and omg erection! Dick! Ass!” Stop it.

Everyone is different and using their sexuality as a character trait is pathetic and cheap writing.

** Ah, discussions like this tend to turn very ugly very quickly. But here is the crux of the matter, as someone who writes slash, reads slash, and mods a slash fic subreddit for Harry Potter. People are uncomfortable with homosexuality. The excuse of 'it makes me uncomfortable' is because homosexual relationships have not been normalized in society the way that heterosexual relationships have been. You look at every TV show, movie, book, comic, etc, and they are rife with romantic subplot and they are always hetero. It has been this way only until recently (like the last four-ish years) that homosexual relationships have really started being represented in mainstream media. People who are "uncomfortable" (Read: yes, this is a form of homophobia albeit not a malicious one...simply a result of a world that has not yet come to terms with homosexuality being an actual prominent 'thing') don't like seeing their supposed hetero favs being "turned gay".

The excuse of slash not being written realistically is just that, an excuse. There's about as much crappy slash as there is crappy het and I think what happens is it's easy to say that all slash is cliche and cringey mush and then avoid it like the plague as opposed to acknowledging that slash has some great fics and it has some shitty fics, just like any other genre does. Saying that all slash is written by virgin teens who have no idea how homosexual sex works is ridiculous because you will find the same to be true in the het side of things. I'd say a significant chunk of romance het fics are written by either A.) virgins or B.) virgin teens and are just as, if not more at times, unrealistic in their depictions of sex, romance, and relationships. Invalid argument is invalid. And also, this is fanFICTION about wizards so I'd say arguments about realism are pretty much null in this case.

I ship characters because I think their personalities compliment each other or the possibilities for a relationship together seems interesting. Yes, this does involve slash pairings for me (namely Drarry in the HP fandom) but it also involves a fair amount of het and femslash pairings. People are still too hung up on gender and sexuality as it applies to traditional gender roles and society. That is what the real problem here is.

And then of course there are just your run of the mill assholes who are homophobic and make no attempt at hiding it and think "gay sex is gross!!!!".

** Only once have I come across a situation that seemed to be leading towards slash, or at least harry being romantically involved with a guy, and I was okay with it. It seemed like it was an appropriate extention to the relationship that existed between harry and the character. For those curious I'm talking about [[/spoiler][Harry and Orion Black in Cést la vie]].

Other than that I've never read anything that has Slash since I imagine it caters to a need that I just don't feel comfortable with. I really wouldn't mind reading a story in which Harry gets romantically involved with a guy, but I just can't imagine it being anything but "fanservice" to something I'm a fan of. Most relationships Harry ends up in in the fics I do read, obviously with women, are like that, but they're straight (gheh) up my alley, so it works.

Other than general compatibility there's also simply the ickyness factor. To read something you have to (at least to some degree) Imagine yourself in that situation, and I kind of don't want to imagine being sensually assblasted by Draco Malfoy.

** It's not as if I don't read slash as a rule - I've written a Harry/Hermione/Ron story myself, and not in the "Hermione/Harry+Hermione/Ron" sense - but as others said, most often, Slash involves Draco or Snape, and those are not exactly my favorite characters, especially not when it comes to romance. And I'm not interested in reading about Marauders in school either, so that already cuts out most of the "Wolfstar" stuff.

** As a rule I don't read fics that focus only on romance. This is most prevalent in the slash fic community, I'm sorry to say. There are a few slash fictions I enjoy like Midnight Sun by Herald-MageAnuli along with it's sequel Darkest Before Dawn, mainly due to the romance having been worked into the superb plot.

Also, I happen to be into sprawling epics and long series of extended stories. Unfinished slash fics from the 00's abandoned by they're maturing, usually female writers turn me off slash immensely.

My gender and sexuality have nothing to do with it. I am a lesbian trans woman. I lived in the wonderfully gay streets of San Francisco for 5 years before returning to grey old Blighty. During those 5 years I saw all manner of homosexual interaction. I walked in on a friend and his boyfriend and couldn't care less. My reasons are based on the general quality slash writings.

At that point, you can still realize you're wrong. I know people like this personally. Bigotry can be combated with knowledge, especially when your still at an impressionable age.

And shoot me for saying it. But that is an issue that's fundamental between Draco and Hermione. Harry should and of course does care. That's his friend. But he's angry on behalf of Hermione. Not because of anything Draco did to him personally.

** So when I first started reading fanfiction as a 14-15 yr old sexually confused het guy any pairing I read was for the purpose of 'turning me on' so I never went looking for slash pairings at all... My only exposure was the really obviously badly written drarry and severitus... However given the amount of ff I've read I inevitably came upon slash fics that didn't immediately come out and say it...I remember distinctly a very graphic one that was a hp/ Stargate Atlantis cross over. The story was good enough that I kept reading... But I still avoided slash in general because I never saw any good pairings(the only ones I ever considered were crossover characters. Every other male hp character is not very compelling)... But with more exposure I slowly became acclimated to slash stories... One big example I can think of is the show sense8... The character lito gets up to some pretty graphic stuff and though it isn't a plus to me, it's not a negative either... Then I got a girlfriend who is really into slash though not in the hp genre... After that I read some of her slash to edit it, and even dabbled in writing some for her curiosity. Now when I come across a hidden slash story I don't immediately dismiss it. But I also don't go actively looking either mainly because I'm lazy and going to look for the good stuff is time consuming.

On an aside, I really don't like drarry fics. And it doesn't have anything to do slash...I read a femharry/Draco fic and though it was realistic given Canon Harry and Draco, it had all the makings of a slightly abusive relationship, which is the only way I can see it working other than a complete ooc Harry. The only way I see that pairing working without drastic altering Harry or Draco's upbringing is to have some extremely traumatic event happen to Draco...I remember a fic (not slash) where Harry and Draco become friends because Draco is killed by Voldemort and becomes a ghost... And eventually possessed an alternate reality version of him. Something like that I can see causing a friendship or relationship to form.

So Tldr; I'm became ok with slash in fics but the lack of compelling HP male characters combined with my laziness means I don't usually read them.

** For me, it's just really hard to associate myself with anything other than a straight male MC. I just don't have the interest in any form of slash, whether gay or lesbian. I can't form a emotional connection to the MC if I can't mostly identify with them. I lose interest really quickly in a fic once it gets tracked off the MC so a fic with a MC I have a hard time relating too is almost an impossibility to get into.

As far as slash pairings themselves, I can read them if they're not the main focus of the story. If the story involves two characters who do stuff and happen to be in a slash ship that's fine. I don't like reading twoo wuv in slash or het. I can also read if the pairing doesn't diverge from my head canon too much. I can buy Draco/Theo or Sirius/Remus, but I find Drarry to be entirely too implausible.

** I'm ambivalent to slash. However, I'll drop a story if there is any form of mpreg. That concept makes no sense to me, even with magic.

Idk if this makes sense, but I like emotional slash. I don't care much for lemons so if there are any I just skip the scene. When looking at HBP in a different light, Harry's obsession with Malfoy can be construed as a crush he doesn't realize he has. He even tracks Draco's movements ffs. In CoS, Draco's rant about Harry to his father can also be hilariously interpreted as an unconscious crush. It's easy to twist stuff like this into a romantic premise.

With that being said, a lot of slash is very OOC, but there are decent slash fics that are IC, epilogue compliant, and don't have any bashing. They are just harder to find.

A lot of the responses here question why Harry/Ron isn't a popular slash pairing. When I read the books, Ron comes off as very het, especially during the Yule Ball scenes and his reactions to Hermione's perceived sexual activity in the books.

** I don't mind slash. There are so many other things to put me off that the slashy bits become insignificant. I'm fairly open-minded, so I have no problems with gay or bi. Harems are less believable.

Most of HP ff is rubbish, so naturally most of the slash fics are rubbish. The pairings are often even more unrealistic and unbelievable than the ordinary fics. Harry/Snape? Please. Harry//Voldemort?/ No no no. Harry/Dobby would be more believable, he's just about to hump Harry's leg in canon anyway. I'll never accept Harry/Snape, but write it well and I'll accept Harry/Firenze.

There seem to be more unrealistic pairings in slashfics than ordinary fics, perhaps because some imaginary moral line has been crossed. When you cross the gay line, why not go all out? Let's make /everyone/ gay! And perhaps a little MPREG?

Where are the believable pairings? Harry with Colin Creevey or Cedric Diggory, that I can believe. Especially Colin. I can see him sneaking into Harry's dorm at night and have his wicked ways with Harry, while documenting everything with his camera to show in the next fanclub meeting. Creevey is a bit Creepey.

Then there is the fact that few authors have any idea what gay sex is about. Or any sex, really. I can understand that the graphic depictions gloss over the sticky bits, but real life sex is nothing like porn movies. If you write it detailed, at least get it halfway believable. My own imagination is superior to whatever sordid details the frustrated teenage mind of an average author invents.

So, after ignoring the adolescent fantasies, the wildly improbable pairings, the ridiculous bits (like MPREG), we're left with a handful of fics. And I haven't found any of them yet, so for now I usually ignore anything slashy.

** Because I'm completely homophobic of course ! ... no seriously, I dont want to read fanfiction for romance, but for the plot. I sometimes read fics with a good plot, that feature slash, but just as background in the story.

Most of slash fics just scream "Come and watch absolutely farfetched gay romance !" rather than "Come and read a good story, that may contain slash". That why I usually dont read slash.

On a side note, stop with Harry/Snape, or worst, Harry/Voldemort. It's called pedophilia, and it is disturbing, even in a fictional story.

Edit : In prevention to critics screaming freedom of speech, and freedom to read whatever the hell they want, I completely agree, I do have those too. You are interested in reading gay romance, it's your right. People can have different tastes, and refuse to read stories featuring gay relationships, but dont let anyone tell you that YOU shouldnt read what you want to read.

Like so many other commenters have said so eloquently, it just doesn't appeal to me. If the characters aren't gay in canon it's really difficult for me to get into.

** Before I start this I'll preface. I am a member of the LGBT community in my real life, far outside the internet. As an actual LGBT person, I hate slash fic.

For me it's half because too much of slash is as you said, terrible Quality writing. I have extremely high standards for what I read (guilty pleasure crackfics notwithstanding), and most slash simply doesn't hold up to those standards.

The other half is that I simply don't enjoy reading it; so I don't. It's just not my cup of tea. Same reason I don't read HarryxGinny, HermionexRon, and other pairings I don't like. If I don't enjoy reading something, then why would I read it.

In all, I feel like it's a personal preference thing that just like anyone else; I'm entitled to say "that's not my preference." Though admittedly I do feel a bit more entitled to say it's not my preference because as an LGBT person I'm out in the real world living through it as a part of my daily life.
