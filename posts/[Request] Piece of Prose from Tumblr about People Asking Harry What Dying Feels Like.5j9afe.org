I neglected to "Like" it when I found it, but it was a very nice piece of writing, though not very long. In it, people like Hermione, George, and Ron ask Harry what dying feels like, one of the answers he gives is "Quicker and easier than falling asleep." It was a very poignant piece of prose that I'd like to have the opportunity to read again.

*** Ahh thank you! I had tried googling, but I guess my google-fu needs work. Much appreciated, though.
