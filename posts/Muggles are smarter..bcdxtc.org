Hey I am searching for fics where Harry is raised by smart and logical people (preferably not Dursleys) who raised him to succeed in life. Businessmen, professors, lawyers, military men, activist or the like. A fic where Harry introduces logic to the wizarding world, or where he gets tired of the WW's stupidity etc... I would greatly appreciate it if they are fem!harry on top of it. I am a sucker for smart fem harry works. So? Any recommendations?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), seems to fit well. James and Lily were prepared that night and survived. Harry grew up with them and never went to Hogwarts, and he is bent on destroying the traditional magical power structures. But this fic doesn't consider Muggles smarter though, as Harry's ruling clique is mostly made up of Wizards. Voldemort is also doing very well.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
