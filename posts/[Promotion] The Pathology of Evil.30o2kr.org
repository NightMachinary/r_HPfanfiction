Please let me know what you guys think of the plot, worldbuilding, content, or grammar.


** It's too soon to tell from what I've read so far, but a few immediate impressions:

- I don't know how you intend to use the "magical cores" fanon, but unless they are really important to your story, I'd recommend excising them, since they have a bad reputation in a pretty big chunk of the fandom.

- Introducing a torture curse worse than the Cruciatus feels like you're trying too hard: like you're trying to say, "I'm so edgy, and my villains are so dark, their curses are *even more unforgivable* than the Unforgivables!"

- Dumbledore's Dark Arts "showmanship" seems off along the same lines. I can see (if I squint) a corrupted Dumbledore becoming a sadist. But, a theatrical display in front of an audience that applauds, as he sounds like a salesman trying to sell them on Dark Arts? That just doesn't come together.

- The scene with Riddle and Harry is too short. Harry, supposedly, knows /nothing/ about magic. Why is he in a medieval castle? What's a "Muggle"? What is "Polyjuice", and why does this strange man want to give me a weird liquid to drink?

*Edit:* Fixed a really embarrassing pronoun error.

I've read a fic where the writer added "Crucio Maxima" like "Bombarda Maxima"... Not a very good fic needless to say.

**** I feel like /Crucio Maxima/ should automatically rebound on the caster for poetic justice.

***** Well, I think that there should be three spells: /Crucio/, /Crucier/, and /The Cruciest/.

** So, just going to put it out there.

When you start with lung-expelling, blood-boiling, intestinal-eviscerating spells, it's hard to really build an arc from there.

My advice would be to rethink the whole story. It's titled the pathology of evil. Build up to evil, don't start with it.

Right now, it reads like a torture fantasy

*** Gotcha, I might move the opening chapter to somewhere later in the story and put something more tame for the first chapter instead

**** Yeah, I'd advise to hold back Dumbledore's more evil tendencies. Probably play more into the archetype of the smiling old man with the torture room in the back.

If you need a beta, let me know

** A little bit morbid as a start. It's personal preference but even if a story is dark it should slowly build up to it , not starting the first thousand words with full blown torture and gore.
