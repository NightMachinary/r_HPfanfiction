I've already read Albus Potter and the Hourglass Empire as well as the Rune Stone Path. So, are there any tics that explore that?

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

***** that's cool but the problem with fan fiction is there is no incentive to finish a bad one unless you like to dissect why it was bad. i usually just end up dropping one if it stops holding my attention

***** When does it start getting to it though? Is it overpowered? It seems long but since you think it's boring, I'm afraid to start it. Is the altering interesting or not worthwhile?

****** Its like this. H/Hr's relationship after a while gets boring because of the usual trope of GinnyPotionMaster, the fact that the reason WHY they didn't get together in the first place is because both of them are stupid as fuck(a really bad misundertanding right at the begning) and NEVER talk to each other, Harry becomes entranced by sex with a reporter, so there's that period that is classicaly called "will they/won't they", they get together, become the "It Couple" then Ginny fucks it up, making Harry cheat on her with several other girls because of a "secret" property of Amortencia that Snape (i think) is the one to explain to one of them (can't recall to whom, this was one of my first fics and never re-read). So they break up, angst inssued, Lada lada lada, They get back together in the end.

Romance aside, because it is a bit angsty at time, specially when Harry gets captured and subsequently "rescued", the story itself has A SHIT LOAD of interesting things, though could be considered clich√©. Harry's use of the Chamber for a bigger DA, Hermione adapting spells with other words (not just Maximus), new spells, the actual Fifth Element concept, Dumbledore being a nice guy, Luna/Hermione druidic rituals, a different type of Occlumency taught by Harry's personal Jackie Chan(no shit), Black Manor being a veritable fortress, Hermione teaching elfs to read and speak correctly, sexy uses of gillyweed, lots of sex, Ron being duped into a sacrificing ritual of conception (Voldy's attempt to impregnate Ron's GF, and her becoming a mix of a succubus and a faun/satyr), Stonehenge being a big and important piece of magical power, etc. For me, the most interesting concept that I've never seen anywhere else is the fact that Fawkes is actually the one that "lead" the Order of the Phoenix by choosing someone, its alluded the fact that Dumbledore (not canon, I know) isn't its creator, it was another dude before him that Fawkes was bonded to, later bonded to Dumbledore, making him the Leader of the OOTP, and because of shit that goes on later, "Fawkes/Hermione" bonds with Harry, making HIM the leader of the OOTP. And then the story ends. Sorry if this was too much, I was in the mood to write.
