Over the last few weeks, I've heard several people suggest that there may have been early drafts of "Deathly Hallows," where Luna was killed, hence Harry and Ginny memorialized her with their daughter's middle name.

I'm not sure how true that theory is, but the idea is rather intriguing, in a heart-breaking sort of way.

Hence, the prompt. Could Luna have been tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange as a way to get Hermione to reveal how they got the Sword of Gryffindor? Or perhaps she insisted on staying behind to help and wound up taking the knife to the chest instead of Dobby? Or maybe she dies, taking a curse for Ginny at the Battle of Hogwarts?


** You monster.

But good luck finding something anyway. I haven't come across any, but I've never looked.

** If she dies in the battle for hogwarts, nothing would change. If she dies in Malfoy Manor, Cho would be the one helping him infiltrating the Ravenclawn tower.

** I believe, it could be the original JKR's plan (Luna seems to be ideal victim: she hasn't developed any substantial relationships, all readers would cry a lot), but as with the similar plan about killing Ron (which was apparently a thing), alienating of readers would be probably so massive, she decided not to go there. Perhaps, Dobby was killed instead of her.

*** Yeah, the outrage that would have occurred if Luna died--especially if she died in Harry's arms--would have been...very noisy.
