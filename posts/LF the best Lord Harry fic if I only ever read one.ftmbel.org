The trope is infamous.

Ridiculously so.

And I've never encountered it thus far! If one exists that encompasses the major aspects of the trope (preferably with decent writing and grammar...) I would be very curious to try my hand at reading it, just so I can say I've read one at the very least. Thanks in advance!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]] is the one. After years I have finally decided to take the plunge and try a Lord Harry fic again and so far it has not made me want to throttle Harry.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) includes (and subverts) a lot of the tropes surrounding that trope and is one of my favorite on going fan fics. The writing is quite good imo.

If you want something that's more traditionally tropey but still fun to read, I'd recommend linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

He gets OP and becomes king of his own island/nation and all that, but he's definitely not related to any of the founders and I don't think it even mentions the peverell line there?

** I dont have one to give you but just be aware people on this sub are super polarized about these types of fics. I personally like the world building involved and if done well they expand on our knowledge of the Harry Potter world.

There is one I would recommend, but the details are fuzzy. I'm fairly certain it is a Wrong Boy Who Lived Fic where Harry's brother mucks everything up and Fate and Death(personifications) tell Harry "hey go back do whatever to fix it just dont screw up. I believe he has pairings with Daphne and Hermione

** linkao3(40371566) is pretty bad one, or linkffn(10622306), which is obviously a crackfic. linkao3(16472705) is pretty bad too.

The most crazy quality of White_Squirrel is that he is able to write very reasonably but in fact rather tropey stories. So, linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) has actually plenty of bad tropes, which are commonly misused, but in some well done form that it is not offensive.
