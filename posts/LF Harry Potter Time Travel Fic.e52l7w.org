:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello!

I'm searching for a time travel fic where Harry travels back to the Marauders era. All the characters think Harry is James at first, and he runs into a few at the Ministry, but then the cover story is that the two of them are cousins. One of the scenes that I remember is Harry being in the Great Hall for breakfast pretty early in the morning and having soft music playing around him, Lily and Severus go up to talk to him? And he does wandless magic there? And I think he's good at runes?

I only remember the strangest things from it?? And my brain is really struggling to remember the name or anything else... I created an account so I could post this, so I would really appreciate any sort of help!


** This one? Harry meets James in the ministry and pretends to be his cousin. I'm not too sure about the Great Hall and music though.

  Harry was massively disappointed in how things were going after the final battle. Nothing had changed, it only looked like it on the outside. So he decides to change the past to prevent certain things from happening. Being the Master of Death has its perks. Time-travel, Harry / OC

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
