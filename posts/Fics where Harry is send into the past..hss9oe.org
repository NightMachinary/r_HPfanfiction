** Wizard From Earth - it's abandoned, however: linkffn(8337871)

If the founders era is alright, I have a few more for you.

**** Various quality. The one with an old English title is slash (more sweet than explicit). One is founder's era Dramione (the Latin title), the rest are about Harry.

linkao3(2352896; 4597659; 12644880)

linkffn(8550820)

A fifth option is Of a Linear Circle, which, in Part 3 is Harry in the founder's era. It's like, 250k words into the story, however, and most of it is slash... well, the founder's era part isn't really and the romance isn't the focus of the story, but it's still there. [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/755028][The series is here.]]. I suppose you could /technically/ read part 3 first and be fine, though there'd be some spoilers when/if you go back to part one/two. And if you want to read more, you have to go back and read part one/two.

EDIT - looking at it again, I have the Darth Marrs one labeled wrong in my library. Not time travel, and not very good either.

  Caught in the backlash of Voldemort's Killing Curse, Harry is thrown through time to a world so very different from his own.

  The morning after the ministry fiasco, something amazing happens to Harry Potter. He discovers not just the truth behind his heritage, but also the unique and pressing obligations that come with it. Powerful Harry, multi-ship, no slash. Inspired by Gryffindor's Heir of Magic.

  Hermione and Draco stumble upon a mysterious portal and find themselves hurtled back through time a thousand years. Forced to team up to find a way home, they quickly realize that much of the history they believed to be fact, wasn't true after all. A founders era, time travel Dramione.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
