This time interested in paring-oriented fics (SSHG, SSHP, SSLE) rather than severitus.


** (Yes, this is a shameless self-plug) I'm not sure just how overprotective you want him to be, but I have a thing that is SS/HG/LM where both men are territorial and protective of Hermione. It's a WIP and updates slowly due to my editor and I having busy lives, but I think you might find it interesting. Let me know if you're interested and I'll grab the link. It's only on AO3 and Wattpad at the moment purely because I haven't bothered moving it to ffnet yet.
