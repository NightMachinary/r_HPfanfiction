  "Punishment will be Master Harry being Dobby's wizard."

  Harry blinked in surprise. "If I break the bond you become my elf?" That didn't sound too bad.

  "No, no!" Dobby shook his head so hard his ears flapped and bared his teeth in a bloodthirsty grin. "Dobby will not be being Master Harry's elf. Master Harry will be being Dobby's wizard."

  He gulped, eyes wide. "You would make me your slave?" he whispered, horrified.

  The elf crossed his arms and nodded firmly. "Dobby can not be thinking of worse punishment for betraying Miss Iris Potter."

(From [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/6/0800-Rent-A-Hero][0800-Rent-A-Hero]], a story in which Harry is dragged into another world where his counterpart is Iris Potter and Voldemort isn't yet defeated.)

Does anyone know of any stories, where for whatever reason (love, punishment, political statement, mutually beneficial contract, etc), a house-elf owns a wizard rather than the other way around?

-----=====-----

Addendum: I can't help but think of ideas for how 'house-elf owns wizard' might get started:

- After Harry frees Dobby, the latter swears to testify to Lucius Malfoy's involvement in the Chamber of Secrets incident; when an irate Lucius attacks them both, Dobby risks his life to save Harry, forming a life debt between them. Some poorly chosen words by Harry afterwards (e.g. 'I'll do anything you ask') causes this life debt to transform into an elf-bond with Harry as the servant; though breaking it is /possible/, Dobby refuses to shirk his newfound responsibility, swearing to come to Privet Drive and make sure Harry does all of his summer homework.

- The Weasleys win the lottery, but Mrs Weasley falls seriously ill and can't go to Egypt. Percy and Ron team up and use the lottery winnings to purchase a house-elf to help her with the housework instead; however, the catch is, they've never made a bond with a house-elf before. When the kind and understanding elf tries to lead the sons through the words, he accidentally bonds Ron to himself in the wrong direction. While Percy researches to find a way to break an elf-bond when clothes don't work, Ron tries to hide his new circumstances from his family and friends, while the elf tries to masquerade as a properly bonded elf and help Ron become productive and successful at the same time.

- During Harry's 3rd year at Hogwarts, a bizarre discussion between Remus Lupin and one of the Hogwarts house elves ('Could an elf be turned into a werewolf? Would they still be bound to obey while transformed?') leads to the latter two making a bond 'just-in-case'. This pays off on the fateful night that Peter is exposed (and this time, captured), but...whoops, I'm not sure how to continue this one.

- After Umbridge exposes and dissolves the DA, she discovers that Dobby is a free elf; rather than continue to pay him as Dumbledore had done, she instead binds him to the castle by force. This blatant disregard for the rights of a sentient being makes Hermione go berserk; aided by Harry and Ron, she hatches a scheme to force Umbridge to release Dobby (probably involving multiple Confundus charms, and possibly an Imperius), which works. Dobby isn't satisfied, however, and wants vengeance, in the form of making Umbridge /his/ slave and making her run Hogwarts responsibly.


** I recently watched a few eps of Jeeves and Wooster and with your Q, I am now imagining an adult and somewhat inept Harry Potter guided through Magical Society by Dobby's firm hand.

And now i want to write this.

*** Why, thank you. It does pose the question of "If the Weasleys don't go to Egypt and Scabbers doesn't appear in the paper, what makes Sirius Black break out of Azkaban?", mind.

Actually, what would Scabbers/Peter do if he learned that Ron had been house-human'd? What would Harry do when there's absolutely nothing trying to kill him at Hogwarts that year (no Sirius Black, no Dementors, the only werewolf is under control, nothing)?

...Hmm...Sirius Black or not, Crookshanks could still sniff out Peter, and might try to expose him, possibly leading to a big public kerfuffle in the Great Hall as cat chases rat.

Caught on camera by Colin Creevey, the incident makes it to the Daily Prophet...and presto, one Azkaban escape!

...Or, I suppose, there's always the subplot with Buckbeak. With more time on their hands, Harry, Ron, Hermione and the rest of the staff might be able to dedicate more time to help Hagrid, resulting in his winning the initial hearing regarding the hippogriff; with his first attempt to discredit Hagrid failed, Draco might try to engineer more trouble, which (in dramatically satisfying fashion) might lead to a creature rampage as the climax to the story.

...That's pretty tangential, though...how to bring it back to Ron's big secret...hmm...

-----=====-----

Edit: Got it! Looking at the definition of serfdom indicates that serfs were bound to a particular property and bound to obey whoever owned it; I can't find the quote, but there was a bit in Order of the Phoenix about house-elves not being allowed to leave without their master's permission (Dobby's noted as violating that rule.), and I'm pretty sure the Hogwarts house elves work that way.

So, assuming Ron can't be freed by being given clothes, he can be freed by being granted a patch of land instead, becoming a 'freeman' with his own estate. The Weasleys have plenty of land, a patch of it that Ron can dig up and turn into his own vegetable garden should do.

...Of course, that brings the complications that the house-elf who owns Ron (let's say that he/she is called Pinky, for now) has to receive that land from Mr. & Mrs. Weasley first, before giving it on to Ron, which means Ron has to 'come out', so to speak...and there's also the question of if a minor can be a freeman, and whether Arthur & Molly actually own their land or if they rent or if it's allocated or they're a regency of some sort, and if Pinky herself can legally possess a land title...

-----=====-----

Oh, wow, I just thought of how to turn this plot into crack fanfiction!

When the 'being granted a parcel of land renders you a freeman and thus nullifies any bond of servitude' thing comes up, some legal rules about passing on land you've acquired and minimum size of the land and how much land the landlord has to own before they can give some of it away and proof of honorable service and so forth all crop up at once.

With no way to free Ron (through the 'gift of land' route, at least) without first becoming a wealthy successful landowner, Pinky the house-elf ends up setting out to take over the /entire/ wizarding world, acre by acre, aided by Ron's strategic genius and understanding of pureblood mores.

...How the heck do you write a tagline for that?

  The Brain: The same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try to take over the world.
