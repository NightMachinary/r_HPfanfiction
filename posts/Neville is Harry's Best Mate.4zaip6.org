Looking for fics where Neville, rather than Ron, is Harry's best mate.


** In many stories of Robst, Neville is Harry's best friend - though he usually remains a rather bland character without that much character.

*** I just wanted to pop back here and say thank you again for posting this. I only browse here infrequently and have been away for a while so have not ready much fan fiction, but I have powered through this fic and just finished it today and have to say I thought it was amazing. I enjoyed it almost as much as I did the original HP series, so thanks again for this! :D
