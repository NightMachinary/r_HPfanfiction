Prophesy is unfortunately a verbal endeavor and this homophones can cause some trouble. The power Harry has was clearly defined; he's really good with tying and untying knots.


** "Shibari" cast Harry, pointing his wand at Bellatrix.

"KYA!" Harry never expected such a girly noise to come from the supposedly terrifying Bellatrix as she was bound. "Mmm... Master... be my Master. Punish me.... far better... than the Cruciatus" moaned Bellatrix, much to Harry's shock.

It turns out that Bellatrix's own fetish surpassed even her loyalty towards Voldemort. Finding out about the Horcruxes and Voldemort's own weaknesses from his greatest supporter simply through a proper motivational punishment

** That kind of doesn't work, because the wording was, "he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not." So it's Voldemort who's good at tying things.

*** I love that this exists.

I was thinking somehow just like a plain old bowline somehow being pivotal to voldemort's defeat.

**** Probably not a bowline, but that brings up the idea of using knots that have evocative names, such as a sheepshank, a sheet bend, or a terminal Turk's head.

Over at [[https://www.animatedknots.com/complete-knot-list][this site]], you can find knots with names such as the blood knot, the monkey's fist, the slim beauty, the strangle knot, and the whoopie sling.
