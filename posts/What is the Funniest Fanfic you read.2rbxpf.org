** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]], a story where a D&D teen wizard is accidentally summoned to our world, and goes to school with Harry and co. Very funny, especially if you know about tabletop RPGs.

** First fic that comes to mind is:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
#+end_quote

So funny. I've probably reread this fanfic the most.

And:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Sarah1281's Oh God Not Again!]]

#+begin_quote
  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
#+end_quote

Haven't finished it, but in the 1/2 I've read, it's hilarious!

I'll post some more later.

#+begin_quote
  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare?
#+end_quote

As long as you can get past the overly mushy first chapter, you'll be cracking up constantly. I love Ron and I guess that you could call this story 'Ron-bashing', but he's a completely different character in this story that it could hardly count as that. But goddamn it is funny.

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Cannon to Epilogue, then not so much...

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9807593/1/Harry-Potter-the-Geek][Harry Potter the Geek]] by Andrius

#+begin_quote
  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.
#+end_quote

Decent writing. However, it's quite long for a humor fic (65k+). If you'd like something shorter, I recommend the following:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4951074/1/Harry-s-Little-Army-of-Psychos][Harry's Little Army of Psychos]]

#+begin_quote
  Oneshot from Ron's POV. Ron tries to explain to the twins just how Harry made the Ministry of Magic make a new classification for magical creatures, and why the puffskeins were now considered the scariest magical creature of all time. No pairings.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6487391/1/Why-is-it-Orange][Why is it Orange?]]

#+begin_quote
  The premise: 'A confused Ron finds Hermione's Dildo'
#+end_quote

And finally, an incomplete SI fic (I know...) that I find hilariously and awesome (WARNING: has plot): [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][Magical Me]]

#+begin_quote
  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all. (Formerly titled 'Gilding the Son of Lily').

** I have two recommendations:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] by The Carnivorous Muffin

#+begin_quote
  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.
#+end_quote

Carnivorous Muffin describes this story as absurdist. It may not be everybody's cup of tea. but it made me laugh out loud numerous times.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4838629/1/Not-Quite-A-Maia][Not Quite a Maia]] by Kara's Aunty

#+begin_quote
  Middle Earth has a problem: Gandalf the Grey is AWOL in Time & Space after destroying the Balrog of Khazad-d√ªm. But who will take his place in the Quest to defeat the Dark Lord Sauron? Not who you think... HP/LOTR Crossover. Wildly AU!
#+end_quote

Obviously this a HP/LOTR crossover, so again it may not be everybody's cup of tea. Neville Longbottom and Molly Weasley are sent to Middle Earth. It sounds bizarre, but surprisingly it works really well. I found it to be both hilarious and satisfying.

** Oh! There is of course, the classic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3689325/1/The-Original-Naked-Quidditch-Match][Naked Quidditch Match!]]

The twins made a bet (which they lost), and now the Gryffindor team has to play the text game naked. Excellent use of the "MMail" system, which basically has all the characters sending sarcastic little messages to each other.

** Another vote for 'Seventh Horcrux' and 'Lily and the Art of being Sisphysus'

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4810036/1/On-a-Train-Switching-Tracks][On a train, switching tracks]] is a very short, but quite excellent fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8892557/1/The-Chronicles-of-the-Dark-Lord-Ginnymort][The Chronicles of the Dark Lord Ginnymort]] is a strange fic where Tom Riddle successfully displaces Ginny's mind and controls her body.

It's a story where Harry was raised by The Rock. Dumbledore starts acting like Vince McMahon, everyone is body slamming everyone else through tables, it's madness and I loved every word of it.

  Dumbledore has started a blog. Read thoughts from Dumbledore, Harry, Ron, Snape and even Voldemort! Moderately AU. Coauthored with a friend of mine. Rated T to be safe. COMPLETE!

Summary: Complete! Draco hits his head and wakes up in a world where he's a Gryffindor and Harry is a Slytherin.

Basically, Draco is hilariously snarky throughout the entire thing. I've reread it multiple times and die laughing every time.

** Seconding LP and the Art of Being Sisyphus and Seventh Horcrux.

Also Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot is probably my favorite humor fic of all time.

If you like R/H, check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4721967/1/Biscuits-A-Love-Story][Biscuits: A Love Story]] as well as other fics by that author. Actually, check it out even if you don't like Ron, because this fic made me fall in love with Ron and Ron/Hermione as a pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3639659/1/A-Bad-Week-at-the-Wizengamot][A Bad Week at the Wizengamot]] is good too.
