Her name is Heather Potter, and she (like her brother) lived under a title. /A mythic bitch./

Unlike Harry, she accepted her Slytherin Sorting with pride. By September of her second year she ran the school; not even Dumbledore dared to cross her. None met her eyes for fear of the consequences. And yet every boy wanted her and every girl wanted to be her.

She was everything the Dursley's said she would never be: popular, loved, feared and beautiful. She had it all. She was the queen of the castle.

She was also prone to drinking hard, maxing cards, skipping class, scaring girls, screwing guys and kicking nerds in the nose...

But in 1994, the Tri Wizard brought her first true challenger. A pretty little French girl who made the mistake of not only dragging away the masses attention from her...

But also for not keeping her grubby little mitts off her baby brother...


** Congrats.\\
You have just created a mary sue. =)

*** Not really. Mary Sue's are flawless characters that everyone likes who don't struggle or change at all.

People literally call her a bitch.

**** "enoby is not a Marie sue, she haz problemz, she's a satanitz! She's deprezzed for God's sake!" People calling her a bitch isn't enough to keep her from being a Mary Sue. You said in a different post that the idea is a reference to an 80's comedy though, so fair enough, though. Mary Sues can honestly be great in comedies, like in that one fic where Harry is raised by Itachi Uchiha from Naruto.

***** It was just an example. I've not actually written her, so it's kind of a stretch to call her a Mary Sue just because she's in an advantageous position.

E.g. the character she's based off "ran her school" and was a conniving, heartless wretch who was poisoned and murdered after threatening the maim character. You wouldn't exactly call her a Mary Sue, would you?

***** It happens irl, but having it in fic is really unnecessary, I agree. Also, it doesn't seem to fit, since OP mentioned the Dursleys. I feel like sleepy suburbia with an abusive family that hates bad rumours isn't really the sort of environment that encourages hard drinking, maxxing cards, and screwing guys at a young age (and where would you get cards to max at Hogwarts? irresponsibly running your vault out of gold is hardly a Slytherin move...).

****** And usually when 12 year olds are promiscuous it's because something at home is very wrong. 6th or 7th year I could understand - you've gotten over most of the awkward newfound puberty bullshit, and physically you're an adult, even if you aren't fully mature mentally - but anyone under the age of 16 acting like a hardass gets a hard no from me. You're a child, and would be slapped down so hard by any adult it would laughable.

***** You mentioned her running the school and overpowering Dumbledore at 12, and then in the same paragraph, the "everyone wants her/wants to be her" bit. This is also mentioned before the 1994 tournament, so one can assume that everyone's supposed to be jealous of her and wanting to screw her before the tourney, aka when she's really very young still.

******* Most people, nowadays, know Heathers from the musical remake they made in 2014. In my mind it wasn't unreasonable that a few people would get it on here but know you audience I guess.

Look it up on YouTube. The first thing that'll come up is the soundtrack with millions of views per song.

*** I like it, but my idea is that he's aware (and when irritated enough will act just as menacing as her) but tries to distance himself from her and act independently. He loves his big sis because she's constantly protected him and doesn't want to be a burden and let's her live her life.

Heather, though she won't admit it, is terrified that her baby brother is pulling away from her and blames literally everyone in his life for turning him against her.
