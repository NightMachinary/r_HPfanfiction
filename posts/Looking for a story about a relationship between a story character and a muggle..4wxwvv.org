  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Fred and George are so inseparable that most people say their names as some kind of a set. Fred&George. Twins, brothers, business partners. Then the War strikes and nothing is ever the same again. Just when George is finally coming to terms with all that has happened, can it be that Fred is back? Or is it just another loose end come back to haunt him?
