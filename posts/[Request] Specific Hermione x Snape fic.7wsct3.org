I'm looking for a fic that I have read before. It was a long time ago and I might be fuzzy on the details but I hope someone remembers it.

I believe it started out with Hermione being tortured by Bellatrix at Malloy manor. The chandelier falls, the crystals somehow transfer her to this strange limbo place, where there is a door that she goes through.

Meanwhile we meet Severus, who has only recently taken the dark mark. He is regretting his decision and is taking a walk in Cokeworth, trying to sort his thoughts when he comes across Hermione, stumbling through a door that's not there.

Also contains(SPOILERS):

A book on necromancy that is blank unless a necromancer reads it

Hermione finding out Dumbledore is also a necromancer and not a good guy

Closed time travel loop; when adult Hermione used magic after going to past, she effectively 'stole' baby Hermione's magic. So when although she still exists, the baby Hermione granger in this universe will only be a muggle.

I know this is not too much to go on but any help is appreciated. Thank you in advance!

Edit - formatting


** Hi, I'm pretty sure the fic you are looking for is Futura Futurum by idon'tedit on fanfiction.net. I read it once a few years ago and remember enjoying it.
