It's a specific fic I read years ago. Harry created an version of himself with a perfect family under a fake name that he wrote about in a diary. I can't remember the name Starborn? Starfall? I'm not sure.

Draco sends a letter without an address looking for advice and it finds Harry. They converse for a while, Harry as his alter ego. Draco finds out after a while but forgives him.

I can't remember much else, but I think Draco was looking for advice about Scorpius?

Any help in finding this fic would be appreciated!
