I was recently talking to a friend about what they would do if they found out they were a wizard, and they told me about how they would use magic to create some of the abilities from anime. This really got me thinking about how cool that concept seems.

Enough rambling, I'll get to the point. What I'm looking for is, as the title implies, a muggleborn student going to Hogwarts and doing exactly that.

The request is already pretty specific so aside from that, anything else would be fine.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** I guess you might be interested in linkffn(Harry Potter, the Geek) which is similar. It's not perfect but at least worth a skim.

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.
