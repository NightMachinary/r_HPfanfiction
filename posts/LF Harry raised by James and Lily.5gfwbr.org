** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809][Harry Potter]] [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021][and the Boy Who Lived]] - Non-BWL Harry attends Durmstrang. Fic focuses mostly on his magical research. I have some problem with how it often goes into "Harry is so awesome", but it's still very good read. And of course it's dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12123765][Harry Potter & The Wizarding World: Book I - Dark Arts]] - Okayish fic with nonBWL Harry. Has some strong points, but they're countered by plot convenience and bad planning/research.

** Hallowed by Shinysavage meets those criteria. Slow updates, but the last one was just last week. linkffn(7469856) Pairing is Harry/Lisa Turpin but that's not the focus of the story at all.

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.

** So it has H/Hr but I have really enjoyed The Last Casualties by muggledad. He hasn't updated it in a while but he has been putting up updates on his profile page regarding that.
