And how many of them have actually good plot?


** Tricks for increasing review count:

- Dangle multiple love interests for the protagonist and never commit to any one of them, resulting in shipping.

- Cliff-hangers (only works if you have a decent update rate).

- Have a character endorse a controversial view (whether IRL controversial like politics/religion or fandom controversial like a particular character interpretation) and have the narrative suggest that the author thinks they are correct.

- Write author's notes putting forward arguments about canon.

- Crossover with a recently released popular franchise.

- Regular updates.

- Long chapters.

- World building.

*** From my personal experience, including any references to religion is more likely to have readers straight up dropping your story though you get plenty of hate reviews to.

**** Hate is the ticket to lots of reviews. People will far more often review to say they dislike something than to say they enjoyed something. So the trick is to hook them with other parts of the story then selectively piss them off, balanced so they keep reading but leave regular hate to boost your review count.

***** I suppose that's true. Personally I find people leave the most reviews after they experience some sort of pathos. Something that evokes a sense of awe, like an incredible fight scene or really good world building, a really funny joke or scene that makes them laugh, and also something they really, really hate. Hell, Harry Potter and the Iron Lady got lots of reviews that amounted to "Margret Thatcher is a bitch and you're one too for writing about her."

And the best part is that Margret Thatcher was barely in the story at all. She had an important role in the introductory chapter, and then for the rest of the story she would basically just show up and grant permission for other characters to go through with whatever plans they came up with.

**** Because to me at least it makes no sense that the magical society would follow any mainstream religion. Maybe Germanic, Celtic or Norse religions, but certainly none of the monotheistic ones. I mean, half of the stuff Jesus does is pre-OWL stuff. If every teenager can do it, turning water into wine is no longer a miracle but just McGonagall's homework assignment.

Also, witch hunting happened in most large religions and having Wizards still be part of a religion after centuries of persecution makes 0 sense at all. I can see the German/HRE magical community be part of the Protestant church due to their struggle with the Catholic one for political reasons, but certainly not because they believe walking on water is a sign of divine intervention.

***** Exactly! The fic I am working on also has references to several old European religions and their clashes against Christianity.

A bit of digression, but the Christianity vs Pagan(or what we call so in modern days) has many mundane components such as....property fight and aristocrat's greed for political power. Surprise, right?
