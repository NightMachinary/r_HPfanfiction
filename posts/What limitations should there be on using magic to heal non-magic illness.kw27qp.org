I was reading the wiki entry for the Fat Friar, which says he was executed by the church for healing muggles of smallpox, (in addition to pulling rabbits out of communion cups.) I also recall that Hagrid suggests it's a good thing muggles don't know about wizards, or they'd be wanting magical solutions to their problems. Finally, I can't remember where but Rowling mentions that wizards are less effected by muggle diseases, but suffer from their own ailments like dragonpox.

With all that in mind, I wanted to write about a healer who ventures into the muggle world to study the effectiveness of magic on non-magic disease, but I can't think of any barriers they would have to healing a patient. Do you think it's reasonable that some magic simply can not resolve muggle disease? I'm starting to think wizards are too powerful in canon when it comes to resolving these kinds of issues. Are there any fics that have addressed this?

Other than the Statute of Secrecy?

If we go by Rowling's writings outside of the book, then I'm pretty sure magic should be able to cure just about anything.

If we stick strictly with book canon, then there is evidence that magic either can't cure everything, or there are compelling reasons not to do so.

- Harry, James, Dumbledore, McGonagall, and plenty of other characters all wear glasses, suggesting that magic can't fix eyesight. It is possible that some of them are using magical glasses to enhance already perfect eyesight, but that is definitely not the case for Harry, at least, and plenty of other characters would have known that and suggested he get his eyes fixed if he could.

- When Slughorn was trying to not get recruited by Dumbledore, he claimed that he was "Not so well. Weak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Can't move like I used to. Well, that's to be expected. Old age. Fatigue." Slughorn was probably lying or exaggerating to convince Dumbledore to leave him alone, but Dumbledore's response was basically "you moved pretty fast," not "Poppy can cure that in an afternoon," so there's probably still no easy cure. Filch is also described as rheumatic, making it more unlikely that there's a magical cure. And if there is one that just happens to not work on squibs, it probably wouldn't work on muggles either.

- In CoS, Filch got the flu, so once again, probably no cure that works on squibs and muggles at least. Trelawney also predicted a flu outbreak in PoA, but it never happened (as far as we know), and she probably shouldn't be taken too seriously, but Hermione also didn't say anything about how magic cures the flu in response.

- Acne can be cured with bubotuber pus, but apparently some students come up with "desperate measures" to remove their acne instead. This may show that not all magical cures are easily available. Or it might just mean that kids are stupid. Could go either way.

- Brain damage is /probably/ not easily cured. Lockhart and the Longbottoms were damaged by spells, but the results were similar to muggle brain damage, and nothing was really able to be done for them.

- Slughorn, Filch, Dippet, Arthur, and probably a few other characters are described as bald or balding. Hair loss certainly isn't a serious condition, but it's one I would still expect most wizards to want to fix. Hair-growing spells are even canon, so there must be some reason they're not being used more. (And Kingsley gets a pass because his baldness is probably a completely intentional fashion choice. Everyone else, not so much.)

Also, diseases kill tens of millions of people worldwide every year, even in years without COVID. Would the magical world as a whole be willing to have all those muggle deaths on their collective conscience if they could cure them? Probably, considering that was why the Statute of Secrecy news created in the first place. Magicals are kind of huge assholes to muggles.

With all of that being said, if you want to write a story about a healer trying to cure muggle diseases, I think you could justify any amount of success or failure that you want.

*** i would probably put in supply chains aswell, the magical world don't have the infastructure to produce the neccesary supply to heal a huge amount of pepole.

**** That is certainly possible, but not guaranteed, I think.

First of all, some healing can be done with spells. Episkey is a notable example, as is the spell Lockhart tried to use to heal Harry's broken arm. There may not be a cancer curing spell or anything like that, but trivializing the treatment of relatively minor ailments would still help.

But even if most diseases do require potions with magical ingredients to make, I don't think the supply chain issues are that difficult to solve. As far as I can recall, there's nothing in canon that says that muggles can't grow and process magical plants. So if the Statue of Secrecy disappeared, there would be more people, land, and tools available to grow magical plants available to meet the increased demand. It might take a bit of time to start up, but everyone is going to be very strongly incentivized to make it happen.

***** Healing spells still take time and effort to cast, and only a small percentage of magicals can do them. There's probably only one magical healer for every one million humans. Assuming a typical work week, that gives every human about 6.5 seconds of healer time a year. Even if the magical world significantly increased the number of healers, perhaps to 50% of the population which might be a hard sell, that'd still be only 10 minutes to heal each person. Not practical for anything common, so mass produced potions are a must. Plant based magical ingredients can probably be produced in decent quantities, but ingredients from animals - especially those with long lifespans - would be hard. How do you get millions of griffin claws if there's only a few thousand griffins in the world and those take several years to reach maturity?

****** Not that much time and effort. Harry was able to use Episkey after seeing it once. It's more likely that healing spells just aren't part of the normal Hogwarts curriculum. But I can see how the number of magicals could be a problem.

Fortunately, most potion ingredients we see in canon come from animals that are non magical and/or easy to breed in large numbers (snakes, doxies, newts, etc), or use body parts that are easy to harvest, like hair. Of course, it could just be that no one wants to give students the really expensive potion ingredients, and we don't see many details of potion brewing anyway. And of course, there's no way to know what sort of ingredients the potions to cure any particular disease might be.

Basically, there would be problems, and they might take years to completely resolve, but I don't think they're insurmountable. And there must be at least a few muggle diseases that could easily be eradicated through magical cures. If it turns out that magic can easily cure diabetes and dementia, but not cancer or heart disease, I'd still call that a huge success.

******* I do think it'd be doable, but not without major changes to society and an end to Secrecy. It'd be a hard sell and many people might not like it. Plus some muggles might be very sceptical of letting weird wizard people put magic into their bodies, take current antivaxx stuff about Bill Gates, 5G and lizard people as example, and I'd not be surprised if the conspiracy theories inspired some religious extremists to blow up a wizard clinic.

******** Well yes, all my speculation was assuming an end to the Statute of Secrecy, because otherwise there would be no need for a massive supply chain to create magical solutions to muggle diseases. Unless the magical world decided that it wanted to secretly help the muggle world, I guess. And while that could make an interesting story, it is also wildly out of character.

I am sure people would be sceptical. But I don't think that many people who actually have fatal illnesses would turn down a magical cure once magic is proven to actually exist.

And while antivaxx people are loud, they're still a minority. But it will be interesting to see how many people actually get the COVID vaccine once it becomes widely available.

Why not bring up the process of trying to create a cure for X disease(s)? I doubt everything would be cut and paste as diseases can take several forms, can mutate, etc. Not every wizard/witch would be as powerful as Dumbledore or as savvy with Potions as Snape. So just being average in itself would be a challenge to overcome. Trial and error, mix a few muggle techniques (examining things under microscopes to see what kills/gets rid of the cells), even having volunteers to try the solutions. What if someone is allergic to something in the potion? What substitutions can be introduced in that case?

This isn't something you need to fix, magic is meant to be powerful and I really can't see how this would be a problem for stories.\\
Mundane diseases are utterly irrelevant to wizards and they have plenty of their own problems they can't magic away.

I'd agree that you can't think of any barriers, because there aren't really any. But I wouldn't say that makes wizards too powerful. The battlefield is simply shifted -- yes, you can cure any ordinary illness (provided you are a competent wizard and/or potioneer, it could still be /complicated/ to do so), but in turn there are magical illnesses. It's just another variant of Scrimgeour's quote In HBP:

#+begin_quote
  “But for heaven's sake---you're wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out---well---anything!”

  Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, “The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.”

** One limitation could be the fact that muggles need to genuinely believe the magic works in order to work on them. The trope of magic working only for people who believe in it is quite common in fairy tales, folklore and mythology. Another common trope that appears in Western tales at least is that of magic always coming at a cost. Most of the common spells we see in the books come at minor price for the wizards and witches (except maybe for Lily's sacrifice or Voldemort's horcruxes) but maybe whatever natural force grants them their magic asks for a higher price for muggles. I would assume that if it's something as simple as curing common cold, the price would be small enough but if one were to try to cure something such as terminal cancer, the price could even come at one's life because, say, Death would want to claim another soul in exchange.

** Also despite it being canon wizards have a slightly longer lifespan than muggles, a lot of wizards die in their 50s and 60s. Some of this could be convenientitis (e.g JK didnt want to write too many characters and she herself admitted to being bad at maths).

I recently read a fic (not one for everyone it was a dark!Harry Tom/Harry where Harry is a reincarnation of Sirius' death eater uncle) where the author explained they changed the dates to avoid things like Cygnus having been 12 when Bellatrix was born and explained away early deaths by saying there was an epidemic of dragon pox. I thought that was clever.

So clearly wizards can die of illness (both James' parents and Abraxas Malfoy died of dragon pox in canon). We don't know what dragon pox is though. Beyond it being a potentially deadly illness. Is it a predominately childhood illness like chicken pox which would disproportinately effect older people or is it more serious like small pox.

There was another fic (not dark harry but i think he was a time traveller) in which Luna tells him St Mungos is rubbish for illnesses but great for injuries and muggle medicine is actually better if you get sick (might have been oh god not again).

I think if illnesses could be cured by magic quickly and simply more wizards would do it (especially muggle borns with sick family members). If magical illnesses can't respond to magic I don't see why muggle ones would.

However, it is your fic write what you want, that is the purpose of fanfic.

If I was doing it I would look to potions, maybe wand waving does nothing but potions, although not a cure, can ease symptoms and maybe cut fatalities by savibg, not everyone but more people (like certain drug treatments do in reality).

It would be interedting to see maybe a wizard healer finding out a potion cuts deaths in a certain muggle illness but is trying to justify giving it to the patient, after all drug treatments need to be approved for use on the NHS even experimental ones and then the wizard would have to explain what was in it (I doubt boomslang skin or whatever would be approved).
