I don't really know how this would turn out but it's been stuck in my head for a while. How would hogwarts react? I just found it interesting to see Harry with the punk/goth fashion,mindset and music taste It doesn't have to be at Harry's first year,maybe after his fourth year? Harry just not putting up with umbridge. Malfoy insults Harry and makes fun of Hermione for being muggleborn,Harry straight up punches him.


** Linkffn(call me) is something like that but doesnt really go into hogwarts. Summer after 5th he finds a note in his things from Lisa Turpin asking him to.call her. They start a relationship and harry kinda goes a little skater punk in his look gets a couple tattoos. It's not a bad fic.

  A found phone number, the decision to tale a risk. What does a different summer of 96 hold for Harry? A tale of light romance. No secret training no major angst. For once Harry meets someone normal. Now completed. A tale of one summer.
