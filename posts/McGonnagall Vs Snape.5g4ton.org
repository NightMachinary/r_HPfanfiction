Who do you think would win? I say McGonnagall because... shit, McGonagall is a badass.


** If you recall they did duel in canon. I think Snape has the edge on her, just about. The duel was pretty even, but Snape didn't really want to hurt her whereas she was going all out. On top of that, he didn't flee until Flitwick arrived, which may imply that he felt that he had the situation under control until that point.

As much as I hate Snape, if he went full on dark and fought to kill, he would have wiped the floor with McGonagall.

**** Yes, it was a full-on duel in which McGonagall is fighting to kill. It's probably the second best duel in the series, after Dumbledore vs Voldemort in OotP.

#+begin_quote
  “Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I must insist ---”

  Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed: her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance.

  She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape ---

  Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast ---

  “Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.

  “No!” squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. “You'll do no more murder at Hogwarts!”

  Flitwick's spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken shelter: With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers: Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after him: He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, “Coward! COWARD!”

  “What's happened, what's happened?” asked Luna.

  Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window.

  “He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room.

  “You mean he's dead?” Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick's and Sprout's yells of shock at his sudden appearance.

  “No, he's not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand . . . and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.”

  With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, batlike shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.

it's neat: they also did a similar spell sequence to the voldemort v. dumbledore duel

#+begin_quote
  ...Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.

** Given the fact that Snape was holding back while McGonagall was going all out, and Flitwick needed to join the duel, I'd say it was heavily implied that Snape would have beat McGonagall if he was actually trying to kill her. Its like a reverse of the Dumbledore vs Voldemort duel. Voldemort put up a fight but Dumbledore wasn't even trying to kill him, and was preoccupied by Harry and keeping Bellatrix out of the fight. If Voldemort had no Horcruxes and he and Dumbledore dueled to the death, Dumbledore would easily win. Likewise, if Snape and McGonagall were both dueling to kill and nobody interfered for either said, Snape would easily win in the same way that Bellatrix would easily beat Hermione, Ginny and Luna if Molly didn't get involved. They matched Bellatrix but it was clear Bellatrix was never in danger of losing to the three girls at all. Bellatrix was in control of the 3-v-1 duel, and once Ginny got killed, both Hermione and Luna would be shortly killed by Bellatrix.

Back to Snape and McGonagall. McGonagall is clearly strong, but I'd argue that Snape is easily the fourth strongest wizard in the series. The first, second and third would be Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort respectively. Those three are on a different level than anyone else though. Even if Snape is the fourth strongest and IMO would be significantly better than McGonagall if actually dueling to kill, Voldemort would be so much more skilled than Snape that Snape would get crushed in a duel regardless of if Voldemort used his regular wand or the handicapped Elder Wand. Voldemort is just THAT much more powerful than every character except Dumbledore or Grindelwald when plot armour and the Deus ex Machina of love isn't holding him back.

The fact that Flitwick even needed to get involved strongly implies that McGonagall couldn't defeat Snape in a 1-v-1 duel, even if he wasn't trying to kill her. I'm not calling McGonagall weak for not being able to win, though the fact that McGonagall needed support from Flitwick as well as for Snape to be holding back doesn't make her look good.

*** I'd say that Alastor Moody is the fourth most powerful wizard, based on his number of dark wizard arrests and also on the fact that Voldemort went after him first during the escape of the seven Potters in DH, thinking that Harry was likely to be protected by the most powerful wizard. And Bellatrix would probably give him a run for his money for fourth position

I guess either Kingsley or Snape could be the fifth( based on Voldemort going after Kingsley when Moody died)

** Snape didn't want to hurt McGonagall, and she was going all out on him, and she was additionally fighting to kill him. Had he fought to kill, he most likely could have done it.

I think Snape has an edge on McGonagall. Not as close as Dumbledore vs. Voldemort, Dumbledore vs. Grindelwald, or Voldemort vs. Grindelwald, but still a close enough margin for the fight to have to be hard won.

** Good point that Snape didn't really want to hurt her, but don't forget that in 5th year Minerva got shot with all those stunners basically at point blank range - I wonder how much that ended up hurting her overall. I've read so much fanfic that I can't remember if Flitwick being a dueling champ is fanon or canon.

** I hate to say this, because I actually hate his character but Snape.

I honestly think that if Snape wanted you dead, you would die period end of discussion. The reasons behind this is that Snape would not fight fair. He would poison you, or set someone else up to kill you if he couldn't do it himself. He was a vindictive, vicious, and cunning man who was the epitome of Slytherin.

There is no such thing as a fair fight, everyone has an advantage or disadvantage somewhere. I do not doubt for a moment that Severus Snape was an extremely well rounded wizard who could duel and fight on equal grounds with anyone short of Voldemort, Dumbledore or Grindelwald. Also, I believe that even those three would have issues with him if he didn't not want to die.

Voldemort killed him yes, but it is my belief that he stopped caring. He had not seen Harry, he saw that Nagini was alive, and he saw his students being attacked. His world was crumbling, his promises lay broken, he wanted to die. When harry appeared before him as he lay there dying to snake venom, he did his duty before passing on.

** Now I'm a little biased as I generally see transfiguration as the best subject but Minerva. From what we see in the books throwing curses around in a fight is all well and good but a transfiguration master can change the way the fight goes. From Dumbledore in OOTP to James Potter (a transfiguration prodigy) defying Voldemort we see a history of the few known transfiguration masters holding their own against the very best of the curse slingers. We also know McGee lived through the battle of Hogwarts which adds to her skills, I know Snape never had a chance but I'm saying against regular death eaters she won. We can assume that Snape is a master of curses and counter curses and would be competent against any opponent using them we don't know how he would do against McGonagall.This assumes a straight up battle no trickery or planning.

**** My problem with that duel is it wasn't a real fight. McGonagall might have been going for it but Snape was just trying to survive and flee. In a locked arena they'd have a better chance to run through all their skills, to find weaknesses in each other. Age gives experience and we have seen transfiguration and animation can provide a defense against the dark arts, the question becomes who has the better tricks and who falls back into predictable patterns. I doubt either of them are significantly faster than the other so it comes down to skill and creativity which I see as the skills required by transfiguration. In an extended fight I think McGonagall would have the edge even if Snape's tricks are nastier.

For all we know, James or Sirius could transform since third year, and had to help Peter learn to do it, or Peter learned first. We only know when they all were animagus was fifth year, which would actually put them on par with those fourteen year old Uagadou School children.

**** The last portion of you comment is incorrect.

James Potter, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin were renowned as astounding students. Peter Pettigrew was over shadowed by that. By no means was he a weak wizard. He used a single curse to blast through around a meter of asphalt, through a solid metal pipe, and the curse still had enough force to spark an explosion. He was an Animagus by fifth year, and was skilled enough in potions to resurrect the Dark Lord.

To claim that Pettigrew was a weak wizard magically is a bit much dont you think? He is a coward, a weakminded rat, and a Death Eater yes, but he is still a wizard who is competent.
