....I love Harry Potter. So in the spirit of fan fiction I went out of my comfort zone and read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/][Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma]].

I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Harry Potter fan fiction. Canon compliant about 5 years after DH, great original characters and plot line, action packed, tear jerker, no traditional pairings, complete and well, zombies.

Anything you just read that is worth a recommendation?

Thanks and happy reading!


** It's a really minor nitpick, but zombies are not even remotely the point of that story and could easily be replaced by almost anything. It's a story about politics in the end, but a really good one.

*** Fair point. However, the politics in the story, while not new concepts in the Harry Potter world, really come to a head because of the situation with the zombies. Just curious, what do you think the zombies could be replaced with to echo the political agenda in this story?
