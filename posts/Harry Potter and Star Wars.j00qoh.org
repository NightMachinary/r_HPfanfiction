I'm looking for some good Harry Potter and Star Wars fanfiction. Mainly Harry and Padme, but I would take Aayla or Ahsoka or Jaina Solo with Harry. I already read What's a Gungan, I still haven't found what i'm looking for.


** Linkffn(havoc side of the force) is imo the best Xover in this genre. It doesn't have your preferred pairing tho

Linkffn(revenge of the wizard) is another nice fic, but its with Leia rather than those you listed..

Linkffn(magic of the force) has multi pair with pad me and aayla and has one of the best dooku characterisations I've seen. It is a huge fic.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the ravaging of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.

  Thousands of years ago, non-magical humans abandoned Earth. Left to their own devices, the magical inhabitants of Earth spread to the surrounding planets and star systems. Over the years, they isolated themselves from the galaxy. Jedi Knight Harry Potter, a ma'jaii from Earth, is sent to protect the Queen of Naboo as her planet is invaded. His presence causes ripples in the force.

*** Not my favourite pairing but the story is well written so far. It has potential. Main plus point is that they bring forward the whole mystism of the force without disregard some the controversial canon issues. (for example the thing with the /midoclorians/ )
