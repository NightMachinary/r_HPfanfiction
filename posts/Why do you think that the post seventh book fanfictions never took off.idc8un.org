I feel like when the books were being written fanfics that went ahead of the books and treaded into uncharted territory were a lot more common. Or is that just the nostalgia talking?


** I mean, EWE or “Epilogue, what epilogue?” Is basically a sub genre of HP fic. I even read an analysis that supposed part of the purpose of the epilogue was to effectively close that piece of the series to future options and opportunities (which is why it was so widely disliked). I mean, I think it did kill some of the fandom's ability to engage in it (b/c there's always a subset that find it really hard to say “Ef canon, we're going to do it this way”.

** I think a big factor is Hogwarts: one of the main appeals of the books is the setting - Hogwarts is an enchanting place, and despite all the crazy and danger, I think a lot of us would still like to go there.

Fanfic that takes place after graduation pretty much inevitably takes place somewhere else, so it doesn't appeal to people who want more Hogwarts.

Them again even curse child is not with out some redeeming features, mainly the Greengrass Bloodline Curse.(I know it probably unfair for me to judge it without seeing the Play,)

I prefer Draco as a antagonist. And even if Draco did end up in Prison I doubt he would end up with life in prison.(Draco as a antagonist that learnt from his fathers mistakes and stays away from politics and pretends to like the muggle world but really he has just found a way to use the muggle world in some sort of scheme.)

******** The thing is, 19 years later, he has a son who is 11. Which means that at most, he spent 7 years in prison (and that's assuming he fathered Scorpius within 3 months of coming out of prison). A more realistic time frame for meeting Astoria would end up with him serving 5 years, which is as much as you can get for pirating movies via torrent here.

Which is entirely unsatisfying given the long list of war crimes his attack on Katie alone involved, nevermind the unforgivables, the Slughorn/Ron plot and repairing the cabinet. And neither coercion nor being underage is a valid defence against such accusations since what he did/attempted was as bad as what he was threatened with.

********* The most he got in the ones I've read was two to three years.

But for the sake of satiating your thirst for justice, here's an exercise of imagination. We are not told when Draco met Astoria. For all we know, he could have started courting her during his sixth year and then marry her as soon as she was of age while awaiting trial, which is entirely plausible since many students become of age during their sixth year. I believe that JK mentioned at some point that Azkaban became more humane after removing the Dementors so I don't see why they would not allow conjugal visits and at some point Astoria got pregnant while Draco was still imprisoned. Of course this would contradict some stuff from CC, but some authors choose to not consider it canon.

Why should Death Eaters have the right to a family when they violently denied it to others?

I mean, I can think of a few ways to make it work, ranging from simple bribery to what Rowling said about Lucius (doing a Karkaroff), but neither of those is a satisfying story element unless your plot is about throughly cleaning up the Ministry due to decisions such as mercy for Malfoy.

Technically, the only crime he committed was placing Rosmerta under Imperius. He did not give Katie the cursed necklace, nor did he poison Slughorn's wine. Also I don't think repairing a Vanishing cabinet would be illegal in itself. He never manages to cast the Cruciatus on Harry because Harry slashes him before he can finish the incantation. He is unable to kill Dumbledore.

Also in Book 7, the unforgivables are legal... otherwise how could the Carrows cast them on students or Harry not end up in prison for torturing a man in front of several eyewitnesses? Narcissa and Lucius did not fight in the Battle of Hogwarts because they were both wandless.

So unless they had some sort of anti-terrorism legislation, they could not arrest people for simply being Death Eaters. According to trials after the First War, it appears that Death Eaters still had to be arrested based on individual charges and whatever laws they had during Scrimgeour's time were ineffective since they ended up sending innocent people behind bars.

While I'm not defending the Malfoys and I agree with you that they should have been sent to Azkaban, I could see how they would have weaseled their way out if Harry didn't testify against them (and canon Harry wouldn't because he is very forgiving). I'm sure JK didn't put as much thought into it and only saved Draco because he was a fan favorite, but this is all for the sake of an imagination exercise.

************ Him doing anything Death Eater related while wearing Hogwarts robes (and therefore disguising himself as civilian) is a war crime called perfidy. The necklace and the poison both are the use of poisoned weapons and weapons which cause unnecessary suffering and the Imperius, when used on civilians such as Rosmerta and Katie, is also a war crime since pressing enemy civilians into your service is illegal and, in the case of Katie, likely pressing child soldiers. And assassinating Dumbledore outside of a battlefield situation is another war crime (battlefield snipers and such are fair game, but not outside of the combat zone). Leading Death Eaters into a school violates another half dozen lawa about protecting civilians, children and such.

And the funny bit is that although Voldemort forced Malfoy into his service, his only illegal order was the assassination of Dumbledore. Everything else is Draco's plan and doing, with him responsible. And that's not even mentioning regular crimes such as attempted murder, treason and so on.

** Do you mean as in "a continuation of the world of DH" or "screw DH, maybe HBP too, this is what the world looks like 5 years after OotP?

Because there is a deluge of next gen fics with countless completely forgettable characters which spawned from Rowling shoehorning 10 pairings into 10 pages. Generally speaking, the canon compliant crowd likes their postwar fics which usually continue from DH or the epilogue.

Complete AUs of the war and its aftermath on the other hand are way rarer since they are way harder to write and even simply questions can cause you hours of research and World building for background lore (best example would be whether it's called Spanish Netherlands, Austrian Netherlands, annexed by the Netherlands or Belgium, and your answer requires a lot of additional alternate magical history just to figure out which magical countries are around, nevermind what they do in your story).

*** True with the books I feel like to me they peaked in fifth year somewere during the conversation that Harry and Dumbledore had after After Dumbledore and Voldemort duel. But before th prophecy.

There are thing I like from after that point mainly the new characters,magic and world building but for me that is when Harry's story started to go down hill.

I really don't think there is much you can do to fix or salvage the sixth and seventh book. Or at least nothing worth rehashing over.

Really I think the best way to do it is a four or five year timeskip, not bothering with eighth year or the three years of Auror training and just skip to the start of Harry's life as a Auror. Mabye even skip the first year or two of Harry time as a auror or how ever long a person is a junior Auror or Auror apprentice and go from there. So that way you have the Ministry to play around with and the rest of magical world.

** People want to read about Harry Potter and his friends, and particularly want to relive the experience of the books, so anything too detached from the original premise is likely to be less popular.

I wouldn't say it never took off, it just wasn't too big to begin with. But Cauterize, Grow Young With Me and Strangers at Drakeshaugh are some of the most popular fics around, and they're all postwar. So the genre isn't /that/ small.

Next gen fics are a whole different animal, a lot of them are essentially original fic with the stock character names JKR gave out. There are some really high-quality, creative, lengthy series, but none of them have the popularity that a similar-quality fic would had it featured Harry and co.

** Honestly, I think it's because the last few books (some people say the Fifth as a start; others, the Sixth) were terrible disappointments in people's eyes.

JKR didn't organically evolve her story/outline, as she wrote the end-game: She stuck to the same outline she penned out when she first started the series, and it shows. The genre was still stuck in 'Young Adult/Child' when her fans had grown older.

The nonsensical plots, the rushed romances, how Voldemort had an idiot ball...

Frankly, she choked in the home stretch.

Not many people want to try to build a fic based on a post-HBP or post-OotP time-frame, and that includes the Epilogue, so they veer off into AUs pretty early.

Plus, then we got the utter shit-fest that is Cursed Child, and the overall reception to the Fantastic Beast movies has been mixed, from a lore/canon perspective.
