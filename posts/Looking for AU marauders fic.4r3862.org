Basically, about marauders, but with changed ending, like Peter doesn't turn traitor or something. I have never read a proper marauder fic, to my shame, but that's because I know that in the end they are going to die or suffer and just can't bring myself to read one. Now that I think about it, there are probably Marauder fics with alternate ending, right?


** [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7287445/1][All These Complications]]: Instead of going to the cave himself, Regulus goes to his brother after discovering the existence of Horcruxes.

Another story with the same premise that is not as good: linkffn(11095448)

  Sirius never expected to see his brother again, let alone in Death Eater robes, claiming to hold the key to the Dark Lord's downfall. And he's willing to sell it for a little bit of help. Help the Order is only too willing to give. But the tides of war are not so easily turned. Dark and dangerous times lie ahead... AU. First Wizarding War/Marauders-era

** Not AU, but since you haven't read any - I strongly recommend The Life and Times. Canon for me!

p.s. Shoebox Project is also great, but Remus and Sirius are gay. So yeah...
