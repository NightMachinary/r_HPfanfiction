:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey guys I'm looking for a fic I read a while back. Harry was sorted into Slytherin and he made friends with his housemates. I don't remember much but I think Draco was like his right hand man and Blaise was an assassin (his mother taught him, i remember that, I think he used knives instead of magic/wand). I think it was a dark harry fic but I can't remember if he sides with the Dark Lord or makes his own side.


** I feel like I've read that but I'm mixing it up with another fic. It wasn't a Regulus/Harty fic was it?
