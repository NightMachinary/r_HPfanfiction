Basically, any time any time the situation turns into one of the major plot points and his "friends" try to drag him along, he just nopes the fuck out of there.

** He gains such a massive reputation for staying away from danger that:

A) No one in Hogwarts believes he's the heir of slytherin and they don't hate on him for the chamber of secrets.

And

B) Everyone believes Harry when he says he didn't put him name into the goblet of fire, because why would he ever do something so dangerous?

This, understandably, saves a lot of people from a lot of headaches.

  "Fuck this shit, I'M OUT!" Harry spins 360¬∞ and storms out of the room. He stylishly bursts through the door, which slams into Snape's face, driving his beak-like nose into his brain, killing him instantly.
#+end_quote

Boom! This gets rid of one of the major interruptions, which drags the whole event into taking too long. Which was what attracted the Dementors.

Snape is dead, no Dementors, they go to Dumbledore. Dumbledore actually does something with one of his other jobs (which is shown). Criminal Justice chapter of the Super Sirius Trial. He gets freed.

And then Hermione remembers Buckbeak halfway through summer break.

** Harry the Hufflepuff kind of fits, but it's more in a "I'm too lazy to care about this drama and it's naptime so fuck off" way than a "Nope I'm gonna fuck off that way fuck this shit" way. 4 part story so be sure to get those too.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

** Dumbledore sat behind his desk, fixed me with those damn piercing eyes of his and said ‚ÄúHarry, there's something I must tell you...‚Äù

Well, when I heard those words, my thoughts were ‚ÄúHarry me boy, you're for it, he's getting all set to drop you right into the soup one more time!‚Äù

If I could have mustered the scratch for a ticket, I'd've been excusin' meself with a claimed need for the privy. Then out the window in two shakes of a Sphinx's arse and running for Heathrow, and a one-way flight to Pago-Pago. Instead, I had no choice but sit in the bearded old-fool's office, looking stern and noble, and listen while he gassed away. All the while furiously trying to work out what horrors he was proposing to land me in this time.

If you've read the previous volumes of my memoirs, you'll know they're as fine a record of knavery, cowardice, back-stabbing and running for cover you'll ever see outside the pages of /The Proceedings of the Wizangmoot/ (how the Devil I was never made Chief Warlock, I'll never know). All the while I was being used as a human shuttlecock, bouncing backwards and forwards in the horribly lethal game being played out between Dumbledore and the late Dark-Lord Snake-Face, long may he rot. Looking back from the perspective of old age, it's sometimes hard to tell which of the two was the more lunatic.

However, I'll not say being acclaimed the saviour and great hope of Wizarding Britain was without advantage. For references, consult the Beaubatons classes of 1994-1996. And don't be surprised if they call me ‚ÄúAh-reee.‚Äù Sounds ridiculous, I know, but I can tell you it doesn't sound half-bad coming from a French Veela with her clothes on the floor and with legs up to....

Oh, where was I? I was quite distracted there for a moment.

****** Not saying you're wrong. But it's harder to make a good story...

*Harry*- "Oh crap, those Death Eaters are looking to kill me, I'm out of here"

*Harry on a beach in Australia* - "Wow, that worked out really well. But what's the author going to write about for the next nine chapters?"

With a protagonist who /wants/ to flee danger, but who is frustrated or who accidentally lands in even greater danger, you have exactly the same character to play with, but with action, suspense, peril, etc. added in.

I'm not saying it can't be done. I'm just saying it's harder.

There's also linkffn(Potters Against the World) though it's a revenge/time travel fic with twincest elements you may not like. Harry and co don't want to involve themselves in the fight against Voldemort coz the British wizarding world sucks and they leave, but only after exacting their revenge.
