** From /DH/:

#+begin_quote
  “No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?”

  “Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”
#+end_quote

Because dark wizards who make horcruxes place powerful protective enchantments on them in the hopes of keeping them intact. Harry had no such enchantments. I would argue that potentially Nagini lacked those enchantments as well, as Nagini was beheaded/decapitated and thus beyond magical repair.

Of course, it doesn't have to be basilisk venom or fiendfyre to destroy a horcrux:

#+begin_quote
  “It doesn't have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can't repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it's incredibly rare ---

  “--- phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.

  “Exactly,” said Hermione. “Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they're all dangerous to carry around with you. That's a problem we're going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won't do the trick. You've got to put it beyond magical repair.”
#+end_quote

Basilisk venom ended up being the safest thing they could use to destroy the horcruxes.

*** This entirely. Horcruxes need to be destroyed with things like basilisk venom or fiendfyre because the objects they're in need to be damaged "beyond magical repair," not because horcruxes themselves are magically resilient, so it would be reasonable to assume that, for a horcrux placed in a living being, the death of said being would constitute irreparable damage.

**** Voldemort: "I was ripped from my body"

Slughorn in HBP memory: "Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form...”

The Killing Curse is literally death, which is why it is unblockable (death is inevitable/cannot be beaten is a major theme here). From OoTP to DH various characters, in more words, tell us when one dies the soul leaves the body. Ergo, the Killing Curse rips the soul from the body.

***** Dementors rip the soul from the body. Desouling a person does not kill them - the body lives on.

The Killing Curse makes you dead. The soul leaving the body is a consequence of being dead, not the mechanism by which it occurs.

******* I doubt it. Per Hermione in DH, the relationship of soul and body is different in a horcrux than in a human. A human is a soul with a body, and the soul is capable of existence without the body. In a horcrux, on the other hand, the soul and body are one and the same, such that the soul shares the body's fate. The soul itself is inaccessible - the only way to destroy the soul piece is to physically destroy its body.

******** I actually disagree with the thought that the horcrux and horcrux container are one and the same. With every destroyed horcrux we see the soul piece fade away AFTER the destruction of the object, implying that the two are not one and the same at all. Ergo, dementors could probably deal with horcrux's, but it wouldn't destroy the object. Might be a way to keep the object around actually.
