Do you know any good fics that present different types of magic than the one shown in books? I am not talking about the usual runic rituals or wandless magic. I am referring to magic of the scale of the love protection or the Horcruxes, magic which is less tangible and little understood. For example I know that in NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series there was a set of ancient rituals/spells from each all known spells derivate. There was another fic where people could look into the fire to see the past, the present and the future but the act is so addictive that most people lose their minds and just end up staring in the flames. Another one had sucking on various reptile bones in order to prevent your soul from becoming brittle after committing a murder. Any other fics containing such types of magic?


** linkffn(I Fleetly Flee, I Fly) This is mine, with a Marvel crossover. Harry is mentored by one of the MCU's sorcerers, so we've got their magic system throughout. I'm trying to blend and contrast the two magic systems throughout.

  At the end of his first year, Harry's battle with Quirrell goes a little differently. Dumbledore asks for help outside the wizarding world to heal the damage. A HP/Avengers crossover that respects the timelines while throwing in new twists and characters you may not have seen coming. Year 3 is finished, coming up on Year 4. Enjoy!

  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.
