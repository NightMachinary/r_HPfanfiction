He discovers magic at the Dursley's before the Hogwarts letter. Or he transferred over to Hogwarts from a more advanced school. Or maybe Lily and James are alive and teach him magic before school (usually a WBWL theme).

To put it in simple terms: Kid is a prodigy and shows up to impress.

Pairings are all fine, no slash. More mature themes are welcome.

Ex: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

Harry transfers to Durmstrang because Hogwarts was too easy for him. He joins classes way above his year and receives many awards for being at the top of his class for multiple topics.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  His preparations had taken him years, but in the end it would be worth it. He had lost everything, but now he would get it all back, and more. For him though, vengeance was not the primary goal, but if he did happen to bring it down on his enemies. Then that was good too.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
