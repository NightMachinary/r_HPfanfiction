Many years ago I read an amazing HP fanfic about Rose and Scorpius called the Quidditch Bet by an author named Sher on Checkmated.com As the site is no longer running would anyone know where else I may find it?


** I'm so sad. I just went on the Wayback Machine to try and access this story, but no such luck. I made it to the author's page and accessed her old website [[https://cherry-skies.net][cherry-skies.net]], but that's about it. Last year I tried getting in touch with CM's Allison in hopes of getting the website archived, but she said she would think about it and never got back in touch with me. I wish there was a way to retrieve all of those stories. I had so many on my Favorites list.

*** Thank you for trying :) Would it be worth contacting Allison again? I know there are so many people who would love to see the site up and running

**** Agreed! Myself included, there are lots of people just waiting for it to be archived! I miss CM soo much! I got rid of my Facebook, but someone gave me her information to get a hold of her on there if you're interested. I could PM you if you'd like to give it a go! If she's willing, someone has been archiving old HP fanfic sites on a03 and offered. She was extremely nice, I just had anxiety and never messaged her again to check up on things. I know so many of us are desperate at this point.

** I've never read the old fic, but I found a newer one involving a bet and the two. Maybe it can tie you over :(

** I am so sorry, this is the third reply! I have found Sher on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] under a new penname, Belfast Docks! I bet if you message her about the story, she'll send you a copy or upload it on there!!
