** linkffn(To fight the coming darkness). Starfox5 tends to make Madam Bones someone who enforces the law too rigidly and linkffn(Hail Odysseus) makes Susan an antagonistic version of said caricature.

****** I mean the sheer hate for the each and every character from the books. I agree. I mean I don't like either, but super Hermione tends to be very annoying. She's like "I know all the answers because I can read, and I'm the brightest witch of my generationâ„¢ so I can't be wrong /s, and I'm more desirable than a veela." It's disgusting. People think she was too good for Ron, but I disagree, I think Ron was too good for her.

She was a very flawed teenage girl. Who takes teenaged girls seriously? Her character isn't even that great. Look at Snape. Inventing spells and modifying potions, to the point his annotated book made Harry get a better grade than Hermione. Not to mention her hypocrisy.

Look at Harry. Masters a patronus at age 13. Then Rowling decided to make him super dependent on Canon Hermione, because any sort of competency is frowned upon. I think Rowling should have killed her character in book 5.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
