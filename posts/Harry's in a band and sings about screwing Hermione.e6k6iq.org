It's a oneshot where ^ happens. It has this really odd cliche about trans people at the end that I'm actually writing a paper on. Any help would be appreciated.


** /Ronny doesn't know that Hermione and me/

/Do it on my Broom every Sunday/

/She tells him she's in church, but she doesn't go/

/Still she's on her knees and Ronny doesn't know/

*** It works as part of the point I'm making, about how ever present the cliche is in all forms of media. I'm citing a Family Guy episode as well if you want to look down on that too ðŸ˜…
