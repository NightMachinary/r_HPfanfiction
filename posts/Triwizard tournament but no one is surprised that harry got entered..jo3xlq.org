  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

***** You know, I always thought it was a bit unfair that of the 4 people in the lake, 3 couldve been Harry's hostage- Obviously Ron, but actually that year he had spent much more time being Hermione's best friend, and then there's Cho aka the girl he asked to the Yule Ball. Kind of ironic that he ended up saving the only other person that DIDNT mean anything to him.

** After 2nd year, there is a running bet on what horrible thing will happen to Harry on Halloween. Harry gets in on it himself and Trelawney of course predicting the worst outcomes.

However, 4th year when the Triwizard Tournament is announced and the champions will be picked on Halloween, all of the bookmakers put no odds at all on Harry to be picked as champion because it is too obvious that it will happen.

The big odds are for anything else which of course won't happen, because of course he will get picked.

** Had the canon actually progressed naturaly, when Dumbledore says "Harry Potter.", Draco would just say "Potter." And that would be that. No one is surprised, most ppl groan internally, some sigh outloud, Snape would take more points in potions, and mcgonagal would be as useless as ever.

Maybe Albus would finally emit light from his eyes from overentwinklement when he looked at Harry. Probably Fudge would find a way to enter himself in the picture as soon as possible. Hagrid definitely would invite the golden trio to tea at Hagrid's and nobody would worry until the third task.

** Yeah I'm sorry but It's a bit of self promotion but I'm linking this here just simply because the story has a betting pool for people trying to figure out what the hell going to happen to Harry Potter this year.... Cedric Diggory makes fun of him for it in a good natured sort of way, Everyone in hogwarts is so used to him nearly dying it's really not surprising to them..

** In either "Child of the Storm" or its sequel "Ghosts of the Past" by NimbusLlewelyn (I forget which one actually has the TWT in it, but you kinda have to read the whole thing to know what's going on anyways), the reaction isn't so much disbelief as it's just a resigned "here we go again..."

Fair warning, it's a mega crossover. At a minimum the DC Universe, Marvel Comics, various mythologies and the Dresden Files novels are part of it.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...
