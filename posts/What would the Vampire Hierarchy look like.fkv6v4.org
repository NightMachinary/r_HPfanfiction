** I have two interpretations for vampires.

The first is that in the UK at least, vampires aren't really feared much anymore, not like werewolves are. They aren't organized or anything, so Masquerade or Volturi or clans or anything like that. There aren't many young vampires as most vampires choose not to infect others. They are somewhat culturally tolerated and made room for, with things like blood lollipops at Honeydukes showing that they are tolerated in regular businesses. I like to think that there is a vampire pub that serves donated blood from muggles and that the vampires as a whole self police anyone that kills.

The second has no canon backing, just an interesting take. Most knowledge about Vampires is misinformation. Vampires themselves not being any type of creature and not being able to infect others. They are a small group of wizards that have developed a magical ritual to achieve immortality. The ritual involves magical sacrifice of the users very blood and gives them immortality while tying them to the need for others blood to be consumed in a ritual manner. They are exclusive in those that they are willing to even let know the truth, let alone join in their immortality. They all know each other and any new vampires must be approved by the group.

*** Canon implies that vampires have their own culture/customs since that author at Slughorns party wrote a book about it while he was living among them.

** What's the Vampire Hierarchy? Is this a new thing in canon I've missed?

*** It's a thing often seen in other works of fiction that heavily feature vampires. Think Vampire: The Masquerade, any of Anne Rice's works, or similar.

**** Ah, okay. I knew it was something in other works - I'm a big fan of VtM and more - but I hadn't heard of anything in this fandom and the lack of description made me think it was something perfectly obvious that didn't need elaboration on that I hadn't heard of. Thanks for filling me in!

** Well, I don't know enough about HP Vampires to narrow down what would actually work and what wouldn't, but I generally take Vampires along either of two lines - communal or solitary. ie. The Coven or The Hermit.

Vampire Communities would likely be tied up in how they turn one another. As our hierarchy is based on age and social status and subsequent inheritances (ie. the timings and resources of reproduction), so too would theirs - they were once human, after all. So, you'd get the senior vampires being the oldest or the most prolific (likely the oldest or the most sneakily prolific, given the need to hide from the Muggles) and then work down the hierarchy to those who had less of the things Vampires value.

There could also be some biological impetus to a hierarchy, something bound up in what makes a vampire a vampire rather than social status/what making vampires gets them. To give an example to illustrate - they could be like a Bee Hive. You have the Elder Vampire (Queen Bee) who turned the senior vamps that act as a sort of Praetorian Guard or Ruling Council or something, who then turn minor vamps into the other functionaries in the Hive - Drones and Hunters and Messengers and whatever other role an Elder might need their servants to play. The specialised play the most minor role as Drones and are unable to procreate, while the senior vamps play the senior role as Managers/Elders and are the ones that turn new vampires. Could even have a secret higher level than the Queens, a sort of 'Queen of Queens' that they answer to and possibly get their powers from in a similar style to the Elder Brains of the Illithid from D&D.

There wouldn't necessarily be a hierarchy in Solitary Vampires, but if there were it would likely be based around whatever happened when they came into contact - hard to have a hierarchy by yourself, after all. Boss of none is boss of nothing and all that. Could be a martial hierarchy - the better fighter is the senior Vamp. Could be back to that biological impetus and have them automatically kowtow to the senior vampire, which might have pheromones or something to indicate their higher status, which would be due to what they are as a senior vampire rather than any status or resource possession (species caste, basically). But could be due to anything, really. I wrote a D&D campaign once where Vampires were avid appreciators of natural beauty - they were all near-isolationists obsessed with gardening. Vampire seniority was determined like a Hunger Games of Gardening, basically. The ones with the prettiest garden were judged by the old champions and the winners got to join - the senior vampires were all technically the same rank, but mostly infought in really stupid and juvenile ways (think the Neighbours from Hell games) to destroy one another's gardens to get ahead. It was quite, quite ridiculous.

Generally, you can work out a hierarchy by finding answers to three questions:

- What do they value? - because the people who have more of it would be higher status than those who have less, or the people who fit a certain profile would be higher status than those who have less.

- How did the group/organisation come about? - because the originators would probably influence the hierarchy to keep themselves at the top, or somebody else depending on their beliefs. If it was formed for a reason or to meet a need, then the hierarchy would be influenced by that too.

- What big changes to the group might've happened in their existence? - because Revolutions happen and things change, so find out what happened to cause the change and how an organisation would adapt to it. If a big schism happened or a big accident and they lost a tonne of members they weren't able to replace, that would simplify a hierarchy.

** My headcanon is that Vampires, at least the sapient kinds, are not made, they're born. That is, they are a category of several separate species that merely resemble mankind. Hence why Voldemort never sought to become one in his quest for immortality.
