** The Hufflepuffs don't need such shenanigans. They're the administrators of the Wizarding World: Hard working networkers who are often overlooked by the studious Ravenclaws, Heroic Gryffindors and ambitious Slytherins until someone needs things to get done.

They have the connections, they have the know-how and they have the work ethic needed to make any plan, research program or political scheme work. They don't need to rule the world, since the rulers rely on them to run their organisations for them. That affords them all the power they could ever want while responsibility is kicked upstairs.

Why bother ruling the world when you control those that rule it after all? It amounts to the same thing in the end.

** This sounds like someone who is bitter at being sorted into Hufflepuff and not Slytherin.

** The "betray" part is rather un-Hufflepuff and a tremendous waste besides. Discarding a painstakingly cultivated asset is rarely ever the correct choice.
