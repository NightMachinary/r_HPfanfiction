Honest question. Does it bother anyone else to read the fics where a character just ignores the no and Continues usually his but sometimes her seduction of the pseudo consenting party? I'm not a Casanova or the most experienced guy. But stories like that seem like rape to me.


** If there's a, "no", and the other person keeps going anyway, it doesn't just /seem/ like rape -- it /is/ rape.

Unfortunately romance novels and the like have romanticized, for many decades, the "No-that-really-means-yes" bullshit. :\ Like, the idea is that by /saying/ "no" even when they /mean/ "yes", the victim gets to stay a "good girl" (or "good boy"), but the other character Magically Knows that they /actually/ mean "yes" and so listens to what they mean instead of what they say, so the victim gets to both be a "good girl/boy" /and/ get the "amazing sex", the best of both worlds.

It's a completely crap concept and has probably led to a lot of people communicating very, very poorly about consent issues in real life, too.

*** Needs to pointed out the communication issues are on both ends. Girls actually say 'no' when they mean 'yes' and expect guys to understand the difference. Guys are left wondering if they're suppose to be forceful to break the facade of refusal. The answer is that you don't play around with this shit, no means no. Even if you miss an opportunity for sex.

**** ...and if you do play around with it you make sure to get a safe word that /really/ means "no".

*** Hmmm, I have a couple of friends who are into the more..... adventurous things in life. They have a safe word, because they do enjoy rape-play. So in that case no does really mean yes, it's all part of the game. But, this is a very specific instance of two consenting adults being very open with communication. The rest of the time I agree with you.

**** Well, obviously, if you're talking BDSM and have a safeword or similar set up, that's a whole different kettle of fish. In such a case, the /safeword/ means "no," and everything else is part of the scene.

But, again, that's pre-negotiated, intentional, and very firmly consented to despite the content of the scene they've decided to play with.

** If the story is flagged with the correct warnings then i have no problem with it.

This is the world of fiction. I would rather have everybody be able to write and read about everything than to have somebody tell me what is okay to read. Even something as sinister as rape.

*** I think OP is talking about fics where the author doesn't realise they're writing a rape scene - the sort of examples that get plucked out of crappy romance books like 50 shades, for instance.

*** I really hate when fics feature sexual violence without a warning. I've read a lot of books with rape and sexual violence, but I can't stand it in Harry Potter world. JK created the cruciatus curse to implement torture, but in an abstract way. And after 15 years of living in this world I can't stand to see something so fundamental in it change so much.

**** Well, what about Bellatrix carving directly into Hermione's arm? And Greyback wanting some alone time with Hermione after Bellatrix is finished with her? If you think the books are sanitized from real violence you aren't reading the same books I'm reading.

**** See, i know its a book aimed at young adults, but i could have been a way-way more evil dark lord. If all Voldemort's got is a torture curse and smoke and mirror magic.

I actually prefer my dark lords with a tad more about them in the way of darkness.

(I promise i'm not insane.)

***** You might not be insane, but you completely ignored the part about /implementing torture in an abstract way/.

That's the thing about HP spells and why they're so wonderfully - and /terribly/ - powerful in their versatility. A Disarming Charm doesn't just deprive someone of a wand. It can do the same for guns, swords, and spoons. It can incapacitate an opponent who has the ability to attack you. Whatever it takes to /disarm/ an opponent, a master of the Charm can do it... which is the exact reason why Head Auror!Harry would scare the shit out of me.

Now let's take a look at the Cruciatus Curse... actually, no. The scope and depth for what one might define as pain or torture is infinitely more frightening.

***** Rape isn't /evil/. It's /petty/. Just petty. Because it's just abuse and nothing more than that, regardless of the fact that it can have quite notable consequences.

So yeah, I think the torture curse is actually a much better choice.

Which is co-incidentally the definition of evil.

These things happen. If you write your fic a PG paradise without issues or conflict or any sort of social dissonance, you are, quite frankly, a shite writer and I would like nothing more than you go write children's books instead.
