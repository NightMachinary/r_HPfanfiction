Looking for fic like this. Any recommendations?


** Actually, that's the canon. If you read the heavenly King's Cross chapter in DH again, it is obvious he used (and invented) the phrase when he was fifteen, and I guess mostly regretted it ever since. And swear to me you have not done anything when you were fifteen which you regret now. Hopefully, not on that scale.

** Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure: linkffn(9824342)

An interesting case, featuring a GoodGuy!Dumbledore being placed in the body of a Manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore to correct the mistakes of the latter.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
