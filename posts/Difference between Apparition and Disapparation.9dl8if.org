** Disapparation is when you're going from somewhere. Apparation is when you're arriving somewhere. :)

It's like disappear and appear. :)

**** Yes, it's just a matter of how you're phrasing it. I leave my house and enter my yard. I'm not /only/ doing one of those things, but which one you would say depends on what's more relevant in context.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione talks about how you can't disapparate from Hogwarts, which obviously means that you can't apparate either.
#+end_quote

You cannot apparate or disapparate on Hogwarts grounds.

**** As far as I can tell, it's the coming and going that's important.

Note that in GoF, Snape says:

#+begin_quote
  When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side.
#+end_quote

The fact that he specifically mentions both suggests they are different acts. As such, you Disapparate *from* one place and Apparate *(in)to* another, but the sum total of Disapparating and Apparating between places is simply called Apparating/Apparition.

From what I remember about how the Apparition class is described in canon, this does not seem to be the case. Instead, the witch or wizard decides on a target location and wills themselves there, with no seperate steps between disappearing at the original location and appearing at the target location.

****** Bad phrasing on my part. As an act, yes, it's all in one, but it's like leaving a room--you're stepping (Apparating) over the threshold, but you've still left (Disapparated from) one room and entered (Apparated into) another.

******* Yes, in that way it is two acts, but what Snape says suggests that one Disapparates first from where one is and then in a seperate action Apparates to a new location, which would mean that one could Disapparate but not Apparate and thereby be nowhere at all. Otherwise he could have just said "When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Apparate, instantly, at his side." However this explanation is not otherwise supported by canon so I suppose it is just a weird phrasing on Snape's part.

**** It's fairly straightforward with one caveat.

Disapparate can be combined with out, away and similar. It's the action of being somewhere and moving out of that zone. It's the starting location. He disapparated from point a and apparated on point b.

Apparate has the caveat though. While it means arriving to the destination, it also has a wider usage for the action itself. The spell is not an apparation/disapparation spell. It's merely an apparition spell.

When you perform the entire action, you apparate.

The Dobby story is clear - he came into the cellar, so he apparated into it. Say his starting location was the a meadow.

Dobby disapparated on the medow (exited the medow) and apparated in the cellar (Entered the cellar)

The same aproach can be used with what Hermione is saying. You cannot disapparate in Hogwarts - your teleport cannot have a start point in Hogwarts.

You cannot Apparate into Hogwarts - your teleport cannot end in Hogwarts.

I recommend mentally renaming it to enter and exit. Imagine you are going trough a doorway from outside to inside. You disapparate outside and apparate inside.

** You disapparate from somewhere and apparate to somewhere. It is the same as emigrating from somewhere and immigrating to somewhere.

** Apparition is the act of teleporting or the act of arriving Via teleporting

Disapparition is or should be the act of leaving via teleporting

Kinda like embarking and disembarking

** Can we talk about the speling for a moment? The spelling of this is one of my pet peeves (hey, we should have a thread about those!)

I'm fairly certain it's apparate, disapparate, apparition and disapparition. Wikia and the English language agree with me.

Discuss.

*** The only reason apparition is spelled differently is its existence as a legitimate word in English (meaning a vision or ghostly presence -- something that appears, unnaturally). The spell-checkers don't choke on it.

****** Of course they do - that was the source of [[/u/pudpop][u/pudpop]]'s frustration (and mine). All over book 6 and book 7, it's Disapparate, Apparating, Disapparated, Apparates... but the noun version is Apparition/Disapparition, damnit.
