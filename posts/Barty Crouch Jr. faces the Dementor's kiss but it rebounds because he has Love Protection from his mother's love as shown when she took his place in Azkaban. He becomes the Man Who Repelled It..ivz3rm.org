** Barty Jr. is a real tragic character and rife for more exploration, IMO. There seems to be so few stories that really explore his talent, and canon sells him way short on the decision-making front while simultaneously painting him as a prodigy.

Here's a guy who somehow broke the Imperius, ambushed and captured one of the most notoriously paranoid and competent Aurors, somehow got his hands on gallons of Polyjuice, /taught Defense Against the Dark Arts while impersonating said Auror/ under the watchful eye of /Albus Percival Wulfric Brian/ Fucking /Dumbledore/ no less, engineered the confunding of an ancient artifact to the end of getting a 4th-year Harry Potter to win the whole damn tournament, *also while his dad was overseeing the tournament*, only to be concerned that when Harry returned with the cup that his old boss had successfully returned and that he didn't hate Barty.... like dude knew he was going to be caught and just repeatedly asked Harry about details on who Voldemort's fave-five were.

Oh yeah, and all this after being in Azkaban + under the Imperius curse for years. Which, admittedly, might have addled him a bit, but it certainly didn't take away from his competency.

Like, holy shit. I don't think /anyone/ on team-Voldemort was nearly as successful in getting shit done as this guy. He's like if Hermione had gone full dark-mode but had a lifetime passion for acting, in relative terms. He's the perfect spy / sleeper-agent if you needed one. He pulled off being Mad-Eye Moody better than Mad-Eye himself.

On top of all that, he doesn't seem to show any remorse to the fate of his mother or father, if I recall (can't really blame him much on the dad-front).

It's pretty tragic that such a dynamic and competent villain was reduced to being Kissed by a scared Fudge.

*** I think Barty Jr. might be the only death eater voldemort might have actually cared about.

Voldemort even mentioned Bartys issues with his dad, which means that voldemort must have known about those issues and cared enough to remember.

I imagine voldemort must have been livid when he heard barty had been killed as barty was his most loyal and capable servant.

**** He was truly his most loyal and capable. I like to imagine the second prophecy being about Barty escaping the clutches of his father, because I prefer, when all characters are operating with the knowledge they're supposed to have and are reasonably competent, that he gathers allies and brings back Voldemort earlier. If everyone was actually following their character goals, Voldemort would be back waaaaay sooner (and you don't necessarily have to have a revival ritual in the way it was done).

As it is in canon, it seems like Barty broke the Imperius, happened upon a wrecked truckload of alcohol and polyjuice and formed a plan.

It didn't even seem like he was in contact with the others, at least not much, since he was so insistent on getting Harry's perspective of Voldemort's reaction.

Barty wanted validation over everything, and godamn is that sad.

*** This. So much this. He got two more OWLs than Hermione, even.

And to be fair, on the mother front, it had been twelve years since the switch took place. That's probably enough time to get over the initial raw pain of losing a parent. Or he could have been focusing so much on other things that he didn't have time to dwell on it. Didn't get to speak much as himself, either.
