I have had an idea for a fan fiction on Quotev for a while and I have recently started the writing process but I need an editor. I have been searching around recently but this is where I am going to get my hopes up. The story is an Oliver Wood story that starts with the trip to Diagon Alley. If anyone wants to help with the story DM me on here (is that possible?) or on Quotev( @ElainaAvery or @LainaAvery)


** You could also search for Betas on ffn.net. There are many capable and many not so....
