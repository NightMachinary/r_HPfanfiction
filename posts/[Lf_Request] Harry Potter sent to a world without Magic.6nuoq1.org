** Theoretically every HP/GoT crossovers should qualify as the magic in that world is very weak compared to HP.

--------------

I'd like to read a fic in which Harry travelled to our world where his story exists as fiction, and he fell for Emma Watson.

**** Harry is actually 10 years older than Emma.

Emma's current boyfriend [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3435754/Emma-Watson-finds-love-American-tech-entrepreneur-ten-years-senior-visited-Oxford-home.html][William Mack Knight]] is about ten years older than her. Harry in disguise?

Emma is most likely prettier than Hermione.

of course, Hermione was just average, becoming 'pretty' after 3 hours of prep for the Yule Ball.

I think no one would call Emma Watson average

  When Harry and Hermione's visit to Godric's Hollow goes terribly wrong, they escape into a parallel world where greed and rancor rekindle an old war for the mastery of the sea. And it so happens someone they thought dead crossed too, long before they did.
