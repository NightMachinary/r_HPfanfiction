Two examples of this are; Patron by starfox5 and Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19. Preferably a Harmony romance but I won't mind other suggestions

Long stories please.


** "Divided and Entwined", linkffn(11910994): also by Starfox5. AU after Year 4, Fudge decided to sell out Muggleborns in order to appease Voldemort, thus leading to a much more vicious civil war. Like in "Patron", both Dumbledore and Voldemort were much tougher and scarier.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I don't know if this is long enough, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) has that going on, but it isn't as overt as the two fics you mentioned.

Since it is in 2nd year at the moment, it is pre-pairings.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.
