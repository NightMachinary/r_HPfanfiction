*** sarcastic reply, but true (and a good way to find similar stories). If you like stories where Harry kicks butt and overcomes some Dumbledore manipulation, that's great. Great because there are probably a few hundred stories over 50k words with a similar premise. That's not a knock - I'm right there with you!
