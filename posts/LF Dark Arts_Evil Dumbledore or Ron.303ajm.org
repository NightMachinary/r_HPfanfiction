** Hmm. Ron actually learning the dark arts sounds* really OOC.

I mean, him going out of his way to study /anything/ is OOC.

Lots of evil and dark arts Dumbledore out there. Maybe focusing on that will turn up some nice Weasley bashing for the rest. I mostly give those kinds of stories a miss, but I understand the appeal.

--------------

Though...I'd read the /hell/ out of a story where a Dark, Evil Dumbledore (DED) seduces (non-romantically speaking) Ron to the dark side.

Say, DED intentionally causes Harry to fail to save Ginny in second year, resulting in her dying but Harry still killing the basilisk to keep the school from closing. As DED planned, of course, to drive Harry to even greater self-sacrificing heights.

This turns an unsuspecting Ron to the dark side in the process, leading him to seek to become DED's apprentice so as to gain the power to protect the rest of his family.

That would be, quite frankly, the best. Transcending crackfic into actual originality.

Sigh.

It goes on my writing list, I guess.

*** Omg i'm so looking forward for something like this.

I hate the evil manipulative but DUMBledores .

I mean making a GOOD evil dumbledore gives a lot of conflict that allows interesting plotting surrouding the heroes (giving them powers without making them mary sues)

if you do write it remember me pls :)

**** Will do. Might just make a short one-shot first. Not sure how much meat there is on that idea, and I can always fill it out later into a novel-length fanfic.

Anyone else should, of course, feel free to run with the idea as well.

***** the genre i'm really looking for but there's nothing decent about it is evil!smart!dumble or good!misreported-history!salazar (who would ever let a school house continue existing if his founder was actually a dark lord? )

All dumberdores or silly explanations for salazar being good , history might be misinterpreted but you have bases of truth , he for sure experienced the dark arts , doesn't mean he was corrupted by them.

I'm rambling , sorry :P

** sry if this is irrelevant, but can you please explain why evil dumbledore/ron appeals to you? I don't understand so people who post here might be able to clear things up.

**** well, couldn't you make that reason for the rest of the cast?

Anyways, you mean that these characters are too perfect so you want to see them be the complete opposite and then fall to the "good guys"?

** Lady Khali's abandoned story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] is one of the best I know with an evil Dumbledore. (Barty Crouch Jr. mentors Harry and the cemetery scene plays out differently from canon.)

The Bobmins wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3150414/1/Parallels][Parallels]], which has an evil Ron and Ginny. Not great writing, but it might be good in a pinch.
