:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for an AU or time travel fic. . All I remember is that Harry is blind and is housed at Hogwarts. I know this isn't a lot to go off of but any help would be greatly appreciated!


** The only blind!harry fic I know of is Manifesting Magic, but it's not a Time Travel fic. It is fairly AU, in the sense that harry is blind, but not all that much is different otherwise.

Well, and his magic is alive in the form of a sister that it's insinuated he has had sexual relations with, which is kind of creepy, but it's never actually shown. Discontinued, as far as I know.

** This the one I thought of immediately ... It's just blind Harry as far as I remember

  HPFA Winner of Best JKR Character portrayal, for Severus Snape! Snape retrieves an injured Harry from the Dursleys-- only this time, the damage is more permanent, and Snape is not prepared to be cuddly. Complete!
