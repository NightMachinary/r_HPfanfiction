I've tried looking for it but have been rather unsuccessful. If there are good stories, I would love to read it. If not, I wonder why? The French Revolution was such an important piece of history for not only France and Europe, but for the world down the line as well (Yes I'm looking at you, Napoleon Bonaparte).

It's a travesty that J.K. Rowling did not expand much into this important piece of history through Pottermore (But then again, I'm not really surprised). The only thing I found on the official wiki was a stub article called 'The Terror' which was just a 'meh'.

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Terror]]

The wiki says that the French Ministry of Magic was founded in 1790 during the French Revolution. Which organisation was in charge of Magical France prior to this year?

Were King Louis' crazy taxation laws implemented on the Magical Citizens of France as well (those who were not the nobles and clergy)?

The way Maxmilien Robespierre slaughtered anyone who disagreed with him, were there magical victims as well?

What happened to the French Purebloods who were definitely nobles in Magical France and would have definitely been part of the Second Estate?

Did the Malfoy Family lose an entire Branch Family to the Revolution, which is a reason for their disdain towards the non-magicals, as in their eyes this was a muggle revolution?

Could it be that the current Noble House of Malfoy of Great Britain /is/ a branch family and the main was slaughtered by the sans-culottes and this is a damning secret the Malfoy's would never let out?

The Ancient and Noble House of Black has its motto as "Toujours Pur". Does that mean there may have been a branch family of the Blacks in France as well? If yes, what happened to them?

Could many French Purebloods have managed to flee to places like Great Britain, the Holy Roman Empire, Austria, Russia, the United States of America, the French colonies of Louisiana or Quebec and then continue their lines in those nations but at this point not bothering about keeping their blood pure but just ensuring the survival of their genes, which would mean even procreating with muggles and muggleborns?

If the answer to the previous question is yes, is it possible that the trauma (especially for the children) from the revolution was so bad that many Purebloods deliberately suppressed their magic to the point that subsequent generations were born squibs until, say the post 1950s many so called muggle families' children had magical abilities and we're got to Hogwarts but were looked down upon by the British Purebloods, and many died in the later First British Magical Civil War (I refuse to call Voldemort's first crusade against the muggles before he was defeated by baby Harry as "The First Wizarding War" because it doesn't make sense. Same thing for the second one.)?

Is it possible that someone like Lily Evans could be a descendant of a French Pureblood Family that may not exist now because of the passage of time?

THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT FANFICTION COULD ANSWER!!!!!

What do you guys think?


** The Revolution is a fascinating piece of history - but it's so incredibly complex that it's also very difficult to do it justice in fiction. I'd be disappointed to find it oversimplified like in a lot of narratives (particularly the anglo-centric ones), or overly noble focused. (For instance, the oversimplification on Robespierre in your post would be something I wouldn't be a fan of. Same with describing the French taxation setup as "King Louis' crazy taxation laws", when it had basically nothing to do with him and /entirely/ based on the historical background of Europe in general. Basically, I'm very picky on the Revolution :P .)

I find it easier to take a few steps back and kind of draw out how it could have affected (and been affected by) the french wizarding community. I've got an AU somewhat/mostly figured out that was based on that, at least for Western Europe - where the French Revolution also had a massive wizarding impact.

In that view, I'd have the wizarding world as analogous to the real one - with wizards falling into both nobility /and/ commoners, and the French wizarding community starting off with the more noble/rich purebloods in rather firm control. The revolutionaries would thus include wizards - and, in my view, having some of the more notable ones be wizards also fits well. Danton would be a /perfect/ half-giant, for instance.

For the French magical government, much would depend on how and when it is set up. In 1790, it would likely be a fairly moderate institution. If in 1792-1794, it would be much more radical. An interesting point to decouple the magical and muggle world, however, might be with the establishment of the Consulate (when Napoleon first took power, essentially) - having a magical consul would be a lot more unique.

One of the reasons I like having the wizarding world involved in the revolution, with wizards on both sides of the cultural issues, is that it'd help establish/explain the seemingly more open French attitude towards the non-humans in canon. At least, with both Madame Maximme and Fleur being important characters and seemingly not really discriminated against due to their ancestry, or far less so than they would have likely been in Britain. That would appear to me to be a natural inclusion into the wizarding revolution.

It would also be the only way I can /really/ think of to explain why french pureblood nobility would become emigres - because with magic, it ought to be easy to hide from muggles. So if you want them to join the diaspora, you need to have wizards involved too - with all the hand wringing about breaking the statute of secrecy that'd imply. For links to the British, I would say that the Malfoys would likely have had a branch of the family in France, but the Blacks don't give me that same impression.

For the muggle world, the revolution was /the/ main political event around which everything in Europe orbited for at least 50-60 years. Why not make it the same for the Wizarding one, too? ;)

*** I like this, but I'm iffy on the ‘Danton is a half-giant' thing. Maybe he was part giant, but certainly not half one, at least not in the books. Hagrid and Madame Maxime are both around twelve feet tall, the same size of the troll that almost killed Hermione in PS. Compared to that, Robert Pershing Wadlow, the tallest man in medical history, wasn't even nine feet tall (although very close).

**** True - Hagrid's size is one that I never really pictured like it was said in the books (even before seeing any of the movies, that's how big I was picturing him). So it'd depend a bit on the author, really, and how close they want to skew to the actual size in the books.

** I feel like people who say the Malfoy family would still have secondary branches in magical France don't fully grasp the family's namesake. People joke how they're named ‘Bad Faith', but don't seem to realise that is is not either a name associated to land or a profession like Valois and Potter are respectively. This was name forced in some way upon Armand Malfoy and - most likely - his forefathers. This was not a name they decided for themselves. The Lestrange family has a similar situation, but being ‘étrange' is very much less worthy of being kicked out of the country at the first opportunity.

Also, Louisiana and Quebec were already separated between the British and the Spanish with Louisiana becoming French again under the rule of Napoleon before they sell it to the US, if we're going with Muggle history accuracy. Children wouldn't have become Squibs in your scenario, but Obscuri, which would have definitely been recorded considering how destructive they are and how so many children would have died because of it.

But yeah, it would be cool to know what happened during the French Revolution, the Terror and Napoleon's reign. We also know the last Triwizard Tournament was held in 1792 before it was cancelled, so maybe they just didn't care like they did for the American Independence War.

*** Armand Malfoy came to England with William the Conqueror or William I as part of the Norman Conquest. Where does it say that "Malfoy" was a title forced on to Armand or his ancestors? If it was, surely William I, who had already given him land and riches as a reward for fighting for him (and carrying out behind the scenes and unscrupulous work) would have declared that he would no longer be called "Malfoy". The House of Malfoy is proud of their name and what it represents in Magical Britain and maybe Europe as well. I think it's honestly far-fetched that Armand Malfoy would not have a brother/s at that time period who were magical and just as unscrupulous as Armand themselves.

Let's say that the adults supressed their magic because they had better control and if the children did so, they would turn into obscurials. But isn't that if they did so willingly to avoid persecution? What if the entire event had been such a bad experience for them that the trauma hampered their magical abilities. Maybe their children could be born with magic, maybe they would not. Maybe those kids would lose faith in magic altogether and pray their children aren't born magical. It could be anything that would in the end see them as children with no magical abilities being born and would then be just like the other muggles.

** If I recall correctly, there is a Harry Potter fanfiction where one of Harry's friends has a grandfather who runs a theater company. They do a couple of plays, one featuring a Triwizard Tournament which takes place at Beaubaxtons during the French Revolution and the story of the tragedy is told in great detail. I'm not sure what fic it was but I'm positive it's The Accidental Animagus.
