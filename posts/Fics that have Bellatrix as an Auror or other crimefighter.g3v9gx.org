I could imagine her being a very talented Auror, so i would like to read something with her being an Auror from the get go or she is a former DE and fights as a Crime Fighter (not necessary for the ministry only, maybe she is independent). Maybe she keeps her light crazy behavior. This and her being talented in Magic makes her feared among other DEs. It can happen AU, maybe with Canon crossovers. Like she gets teamed up with Harry or even become his Teacher.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** I don't remember the name but there is a fic where her and Molly Weasley are both put in hufflepuff instead of their canon houses, they become friends and she is a member of the Order, she is still a godlike duelist but eventually get injured badly. You might be able to found it by searching with her and Molly as a Tag on fanfiction.
