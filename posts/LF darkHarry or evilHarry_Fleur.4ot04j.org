  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** Its not posted because I abandoned the idea to focus on others, but I had started writing a FF where Fleur was the main character focus, and she sees Harry's power in 4th year, and takes him under her wing to turn him into her personal "dark/light lord", aiming to take power and give equal rights for Veela and similar races/species.

I had the idea of her being more sexual and powerful in nature with more of a "dark angel" style, and more open about those abilities, and Harry being as powerful as Voldemort/Dumbledore, but without guidance and support due to his life experiences (until Fleur comes along, and helps him tap into and control it).

The problem I had was writing Fleur tbh. I struggled so hard and realized it would be damn hard for me to write something good without being comfortable writing her. But perhaps I will try again when I am done with my current one.

**** I plan to start again at some point but I need to figure out how to write Fleur first, and finish the other 2 FF I am currently working on.

I am really good at writing the starts to stories and then losing interest lol. Probably the only reason I have yet to share my FF outside of a few friends. I dont want to start something I cant finish as I HATE that as a reader. So I want to get enough done so I can publish, confident I will complete.

** I'd like to see a fic where Fleur's nonhumanity is played up, basically by giving her a set of morals that differs from 'normal' people. This would allow for a darker Harry/Fleur, I think.

*** Giving her a set of morals like the Fallen or Winter Court in linkffn(Denarian Renegade) would be quite a good characterisation for darkFleur.

**** Something like that, yeah.

Though when it comes to the Courts from Dresden Files, Summer Court may be more appropriate, as she is a creature of fire.
