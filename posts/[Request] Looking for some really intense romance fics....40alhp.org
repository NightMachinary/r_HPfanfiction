Okay, I am looking for some romance fics where I can really invest emotionally. Any pairing, slash, non-slash, weird age differences, I've been reading fan fiction for almost nine years and I've seen it all.

Word count doesn't matter, although I would prefer something at least novel length, so I can really get into it.

Some stuff I've liked in the past: linkffn(Pantagogue), linkffn(Tied for Last), linkao3(Forged in Flames), linkffn(Rebirth by Athey), linkffn(Again and Again)... The list goes on, but those are some of my favorites.

Basically, any romance that I can get overly emotionally invested in to help distract me from the fact that I've been single for a while now and have no dating prospects in the foreseeable future. Help me, [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]]. Help me live vicariously through fan fiction.


** Well, I recommend this one all the time and have like three times already this week, but it's Hermione/Sirius, like 700k words long, and I think pretty well written. It's an entire journey, like seriously. On her Tumblr she gets people joking about making sure you eat/drink while binge reading. I'm actually reading it right now!

linkffn(the debt of time by Shayalonnie)

Oh, the summary does say four part series, but they're all in the same link. It's just she makes it clear where the boundary between parts is. No sequel or anything to worry about.

  FOUR PART SERIES - When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the Veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. (Pairings: HG/SB, HG/RL, and Canon Pairings) - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. *Art by Freya Ishtar*

**** I agree, certainly a few parts could have been shortened.

If you're cool with Hermione/Snape, how about linkffn(chasing the sun by loten) or linkffn(when a lioness fights by kayly silverstorm) ? They're both over 400k words, very intense at parts, certainly have romance in them, and they'll demand your attention. I also recall liking linkffn(before the dawn by snarkyroxy) though I can't remember how the romance developed in that one, only that it did. I don't think I'd actually classify either of the three as romance fics though, they're more about the war.

Since you liked Debt, have you read linkffn(the last Marauder by Resa Aureus) or linkffn(Roundabout destiny by maryroyale)? Same ship(s), nowhere near the epic length but still long, and romance is an important part in both of them.

** I saved this thread on a whim because it targets everything I love to read in HP fanfiction, and I finished the first story listed, /Tied for Last/ two days ago. It's probably got something to do with the circumstances of this week (Bowie and Rickman dying within a few days of each other will do that to a girl), but the ending of /Tied for Last/ felt like a strong punch in the gut. It sounds ridiculously hyperbolic, but I've been so impacted by that story that I feel like I've spun into an existential crisis.

It's two days later and anytime I think about the ending of that story I just start choking up. THIS IS NOT LIKE ME. I don't just burst into tears at inopportune moments. I haven't been able to sleep right these past few nights because the sheer emotion that story evoked keeps threatening to overwhelm me. Intermittently throughout the day my throat closes, my chest tightens, my eyes water, ALL IN REMEMBRANCE OF A FUCKING FANFIC I FINISHED A FEW DAYS AGO. In short, I'm a wreck, and it's all I can do to not seem like a crazy nut job as I go about my daily affairs.

I guess I just wanted to let that out. I haven't been able to mention it to anyone because I feel ridiculous saying a Harry Potter fanfic triggered an existential crisis. I'm no stranger to death, nor to endings, nor to ridiculously well-written fanfics. I had a parent die when I was a kid, I think about mortality regularly, and at this point it's safe to say I've read thousands of fanfics. This one came out of left field, and I don't know what to do with myself. Still, thanks for the insanely impactful recommendation. I'm almost scared to read through the rest of the list now...
