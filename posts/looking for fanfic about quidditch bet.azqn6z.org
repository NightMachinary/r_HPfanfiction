SOLVED I read this fanfic probably like 5-10 years ago and [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. Basically Luna, Ginny, and Hermione all make bets to try to sleep with Quidditch players. Ginny gets together with Draco, which is the main ship, Luna gets together with Harry, and Hermione tries to get with Ron, but she ends up sleeping with Blaise who was helping her try to get with Ron. I don't know if it's still on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] but if anyone knows somewhere I could read it again I would be super grateful.


** I want to read that!!!

** After looking through my [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] PMs, I have discovered that the name of the fic is "Boys of Quidditch" by BriniMC. Unfortunately she deleted her profile so if anyone knows somewhere else I can read this that would be awesome
