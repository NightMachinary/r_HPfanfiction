** While I can appreciate 'hard magic' themes, I really don't think it fits very well into this world. At least, I've never come across a fic that does it convincingly. Even HPMoR struggles with it, although I'd criticize /that/ fic more for bad prose, bad science, insufferable characters, cringeworthy nerd-elitism, awful plots, etc etc, than for trying to explain magic in the Harry Potter universe.

Some non-fanfic hard magic stories/series I can recommend are:\\
[[https://qntm.org/ra][Ra]] by Sam Hughes - Basically exactly what you're looking for. Heavy on the (internally consistent) magibabble. [[https://qntm.org/aum][This chapter]] is a standalone snippet about how it all began.\\
[[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]] by wildbow - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5jnfqg/i_think_pact_deserves_far_more_credit/dbhloyv/][This comment]] explains why its magic system is so unique; or just go ahead and dive in. Warning: it's kind of an exhausting read.\\
In more traditional fiction: The Magicians (by Lev Grossman), The Laundry Files, Sabriel, The Name of the Wind, Codex Alera, Dresden Files, and Skullduggery Pleasant.

*** Seconded what you say about HPMOR. I loved it's use of science and disliked a lot of the other things you pointed out about it.

I'll check out your recs though!

** The problem with your request is that Potter magic is already relatively 'hard' in that we know a lot of the details already. Gamp's Fifth Law is explicitly stated, we know exactly what's possible and impossible, and the characters use this knowledge to beat the bad guys.

Any author who tries to define Pottermagic according to a few broad 'rules' (a la Sanderson) is in for one hell of a struggle. There are simply too many little inconsistencies and complexities.

The fics you mention bypass this problem entirely:

- HPMOR tinkers round the edges. Yudkowsky's magic is largely independent any canon phenomena (e.g. canon has no view on partial transfiguration).

- JPS extends Rowling's magic to science-y phenomena, but doesn't try to explain anything.

And neither fic really tries to apply the scientific method to magic. Yes, there's that one scene in HPMOR, but I'd argue that was largely aesthetic, since it didn't actually accomplish anything. (There's also the bit where they discover the Interdict of Merlin, which was genuinely clever. I'm still calling that tinkering though.)

*** Oh 100% true. JK Rowling didn't build the world of HP with hard magic in mind like Sanderson did, so it's hard to fit a lot in.

The only other fic I've seen that does this well is the Prince of Slytherin, which is similar in that it explains magic that is going to be relevant in depth, and leaves the edges of the world as a mystery.

I still thought that was cool (and it's much more jntetnally consistent than canon - the author explains Divination, Horcruxes, etc and ropes them into his previous explanations.

If you've read it, I'd be interested in any fic like that.

**** The only fic like that I'd be willing to recommend would be [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=127274&chapter=0][Alexandra Potter]] by Taure. It contains a lot of info on how the author think HP magic works, even textbook passages (which actually sound like a textbook for once).

The author isn't happy with AP and pulled it from FFN. But he's such a good writer that it's still far better than any of the dross that gets usually mentioned here.

** In general I'm a fan of that attempt failing spectacularly due to magic sticking the finger up to any analysis of itself, but I think I have something for you.

If my memory serves me correct, In the Mind of a Scientist has a Harry working with science methodology and knowledge to spread out what magic can do. He's also certifiably insane.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

*** I'm the kind of person that hates stuff that seems to make no sense. I see people waving their wand and I wanna know why.

I guess to me the sense of wonder comes at seeing how all the rules interconnect. Not in the "mystery" or w/e of magic we don't understand.

It also seems super unrealistic to me that a civilization that relies on such a crucial tool wouldn't have studied it to its maximum. The Ancient Greeks may have been totally wrong about their scientific theories, but at lest they tried to make some.

At least my benchmark is if Magic is gonna be used to solve problems it better be well explained. Like well well explained. I mentioned Mistborn, because I feel it does this well.

**** But the point is that this isn't advanced technology, it IS magic. Harry making his aunt balloon or opening locks when he's stressed isn't some technological innovation.

I'm not against your request, some people like MPreg, some like harems of 11 year olds and some like technical explanations of magic. I'm just wondering why you would want to read something that tries to take all the fun out of it.

You might like linkffn(Knowledge is useful but power is power) which has some description of spell hierarchy or linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw by LeadVonE) which has units and equations to format and regulate magic but still keeps the fun.
