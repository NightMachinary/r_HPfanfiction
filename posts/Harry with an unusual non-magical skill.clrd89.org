Vernon flatly says NO to Hogwarts and makes Harry get a job. Years later, Harry's a carpenter and a decent artist when he's forced into the TriWizard Tournament.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.
