Is there any fanfics where it focuses more on the dark arts and explores more "evil" parts of it, like horcruxes or necromancy. Doesnt have to be the main focus, but atleast a big part.

**** I absolutely recommend it. I was kinda sceptical at first too, the font and the tagging thing was really weird to me at first, but when I figured out the logic of it I realized that it is so much better than ff.net. Once you go ao3 you don't go back ¯_(ツ)_/¯

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

**** It was part of the ritual to make a horcrux. But it wasn't one of those cringy edgy Harry stories. He was dying and the only way he could live was to make a horcrux. IMO the author did a good job of making you feel sad that he had to resort to it.

** My personal favourite of these types of fics is The Dark Witch and the Necromancer. It's a Harry/Bellatrix fic where Harry becomes a Necromancer.

Another one I really enjoy is The Saving People Thing. This is Harry going full Dark Arts for his own ideals. It DOES have a harem but the story is really good imo.
