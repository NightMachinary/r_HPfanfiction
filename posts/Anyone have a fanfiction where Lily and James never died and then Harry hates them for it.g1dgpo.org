** I remember the story but I can't figure out which one it is. I'll keep looking. If i remember correctly they followed Dumbledore's advice and pretended to be dead and then come forward once harry is in Hogwarts and are surprised that Harry won't forgive them. Harry quite appropriately blames them for the hell he went through at the Dursleys and wants nothing to do with them.

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

**** I never read that one. The story that SymphonySamurai found The Fall of the House of Potter by Bobmin was the story I was thinking of.

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

** This is an /excellent/ WBWL story that mostly meets your requirements. Lily and James don't die and Harry hates them, but not (technically) for that reason. It's a WIP, but quite long already. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
