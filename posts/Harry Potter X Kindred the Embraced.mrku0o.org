Has anyone ever seen a crossover with the vampires from Kindred the Embraced? I think they might like some of the main characters.


** Sadly, I've never seen much in the way of vampire Harry story that didn't turn into either slash or harem porn.

We don't really know much about vampires in Harry Potter, so the author could make them anything they wanted. We see Sanguini once at Slughorn's party, but that's about it.

Taking ideas from VtM would be cool, though I wouldn't grab the WoD wholesale. I'd more steal the idea of clans of vampires tied by blood, myself.

*** I tried to think up which clan might want each character earlier and it got me curious as to if anyone had ever done it

**** Hermione would be Tremere. Ron would be ... I'm honestly not sure. Part of me wants to say Nosferatu or Gangrel. Harry would be Brujah, but not the punk type. Luna, of course, would be Malkavian. Draco would want to be Ventrue, but would end up the blood doll ghoul of one, instead.
