Hi all, I'm looking for recommendations for some good fanfics to read. Right now I'm looking for ones that involve a more grey/Dark Harry. Some good themes would include but are not limited to, Slytherin Harry, Father figure/Actually father Snape, Dark harry, and/or stories where the Dursley's treatment of harry managed to make him darker. Longer is prefered, but not required, but if it has been abandoned please mention that.


** My edited comment from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/54c8zc/dark_harry_fanfiction/][this thread only a week ago]]:
