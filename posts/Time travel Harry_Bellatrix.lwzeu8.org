Basically the title... Harry travels back in time and goes to a bar, death eaters attack said muggle bar and Harry kills all but Bellatrix Black. That's all I remember


** I never got why the fandom classifies Wind Shear as a Harry/Bellatrix story. It's entirely one sided for the entire story on her part and only barely alluded to in the final chapter as something that's happening entirely off screen. I get that the ship is dry and barely has any stories but it's truly not a Harry/Bellatrix story.

*** If you look at the story summary, there are no relationship brackets around Harry and Bellatrix.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
