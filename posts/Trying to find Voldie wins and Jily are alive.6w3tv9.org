All the marauders are alive and raising Harry while also working for Voldemort. A large part of the fanfic takes place at Hogwarts because it's the Triwizard tournament, but I think Harry goes to Durmstrang? There's a lot of gore, and the twins are in the tournament. I can't remember what site I read it on, unfortunately. But, I rarely stray from ao3 or fanfic.net. Thank you for any help!

  Voldemort's mastery of dark power was unrivaled in history. Grindelwald's legendary charisma came a hairsbreadth from bringing Europe to its knees. "Now, which one will it be for you, Mr. Potter?" Massive AU, Durmstrang Harry

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".
