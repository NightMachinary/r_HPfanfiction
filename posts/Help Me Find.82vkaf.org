  I'm looking for a specific harry potter fanfiction. I first found it a few years ago read it and then forgot to save it. This was on fanfiction.net, I don't remember the specific plot but there are several scenes that i can remember. It was either a crack or humor fic, it started after first year but I don't remember in witch year. Throughout out the story Harry played multiple pranks on the school, one of the reoccurring pranks was turning himself or others into the opposite gender. I also remember that it was crossed over with Ranma, Harry jumped into the spring of the drowned girl and pushed someone else into another one of the springs. Sorry but that's all i can remember. I hope someone can help me find this story every few weeks i get the urge to reread it and spend a few hours looking but i can never find it.

  Edit: The crossover only played a small part in the story and only appeared near the end.
