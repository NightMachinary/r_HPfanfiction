Anything that features a not so much ooC Hagrid would be nice. He doesn't even have to be a main character. I just noticed that in most FFs he either doesn't appear (even in mention) or is severly dumbed down. Thanks in advance!


** Well, there is always linkffn(Lessons with Hagrid).

But that's the only one with a prominent Hagrid I ever read.. I think. Do you have any recommendations?

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.
