This is going to be a very long shot, but I figured it was worth it. Obvious throwaway is obvious.

I'm looking for a very old (2000-2002) fic that was posted on either Ink-Stained Fingers or The Restricted Section. It was a shortish piece, sub-10k, and centered around Sirius' early time in Azkaban. Sadly I cannot remember the username it was posted under, nor the title of the fic, but I do remember a few specific quotes.

'Mediterranean skin loves warmth, sun, ocean.'

'How many times do I have to tell you, you can't break your fucking toys.'

Additionally, James, Lily, Sirius, and possibly Remus as well were referred to as 'an incestuous little tangle.' The entire fic was basically two rape scenes, and there was nothing sexy about it--Sirius' horror at the situation was quite apparent.

I also remember that the site it was posted on had a yellowed parchment-looking background. If anyone has anything at all, I've been looking for this fic for over two years, with no luck, and would appreciate any help you guys can offer.


** No idea about this fic but the hex files was a site with the yellow parchment theme. And all of those fics were just moved to Ao3. So that's a good place to start.

*** Hex Files was a Drarry site, and the fic is not in that collection. I'm actually the author! I know I uploaded it to one (or both) of those sites. It was lost from LJ in the Deletegate; if it appears anywhere else, it was without my approval.
