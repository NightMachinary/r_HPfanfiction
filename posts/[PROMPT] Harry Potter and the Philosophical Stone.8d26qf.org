** Harry looked into the Mirror, and waited for his family to appear. Instead, his reflection pulled a dull grey rock out of its pocket, winked at him, then slipped it back in. A weight in his pocket told him that the Stone was now in /his/ pocket.

"What do you see, Potter?"

Harry gulped. "I see, erm, my parents. They're smiling at me-"

"OI, WHAT'S THE DEAL, BIG FELLA?"

Harry blinked, then pulled the Stone out of his pocket. "Excuse me?"

"THAT'S RIGHT, YA LIL' NERD, I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT FOR!"

"I thought you were the Sorcerer's Stone."

"UGH! C'mon, that thing is /boring/, doesn't even talk! I'm..." the Stone trailed off before it realized it couldn't strike a dramatic pose. "the /Philosophical/ Stone!"

"To save time, can I call you Phil?"

A frustrated scream reminded Harry of the dire situation he was in. He turned back to Quirrel, who seemed to be clawing the back of his head. The strange voice was screaming, but seemed to be muffled by Quirrel's turban.

"Hey! Nerd!"

Harry glanced at the Stone. "Me?"

"No, I'm talking to the /other/ midget who's holding me. Yes, you! That guy who's screaming, is he like evil or something?"

"Yeah."

"I have this other magical power I can show you. What you'll want to do is throw me as hard as you can in the face, I'll do the rest."

Harry shrugged and threw the Stone.

"/WHEEEEEEEEEEEE-/ HA! TAKE THAT, YA JERK!"

"Phil, what was that?"

The Stone was silent for a second. "Oh, right, I forgot I can't roll my eyes at you. I hit him. Ever heard of a little thing called '/Blunt Force Trauma/'? That's my other magical power."

Harry sighed and walked over to Quirrel to pry the Stone out of the man's face. The moment he made contact, the man burst into flame and quickly disintegrated, now just a pile of ash.

"You know, I'd love to pretend that was something I did, but it wasn't."

** ~thump~

"Yaaaawn."

Quirrell turned and stared at Harry...or rather at Harry's robe pocket.

"I say, I appear to be surrounded by black fabric. Am I in a bag?"

"Um...no. You're in my pocket." Harry awkwardly answered the unfamiliar voice.

"/Accio stone/!" Quirrell snarled, the.../blue/, not red, stone flying out of Harry's robe.

"And now I am no longer in your pocket, young wizard. A pity, it was a comfortable domicile while it lasted."

Quirrell stared down at the strange sapphire rock in his hand, "Is this...are /you/ the Philosopher's Stone?"

The rock glowed slightly, "I suppose I could be called such. I like to think I am appreciated as a companion by philosophical types."

Quirrell shook it, "Will you give immortality to my master?"

Another pattern of glowing from the stone, "I do know an elixir that grants immortality, of a kind...but while it is simple to brew, it bears a heavy price."

Then, the other voice, the one that sickened Harry to his core, "What kind of price..."

"Oh, four-and-a-third times your mass in pure gold, for starters. And a human sacrifice." Quirrell's eyes flickered back up to Harry, who paled, "Those are fuel, to catalyse the magical properties you'll need..."

--------------

A few minutes later, having evaded Dumbledore via usage of Harry's invisibility cloak, and having pulled an entire potions laboratory out of his robes ("Where the heck did you get that?" "Pocket Potions Lab, Potter. You didn't think I'd be welcome in the dungeons after stealing the Stone, did you?"), /and/ having transmuted large parts of the stone in the room into gold ("Oh, I know how to do that too, it's very simple..."), Voldemort and his host Quirrell were finally reaching the end stages of the immortality potion, guided by the Philosopher's Stone.

"And just a pinch of green mercury, careful now, it's volatile..."

"Now use that bronze rod, that one there, to stir that symbol on the surface, you'll know you did it right if it starts glowing..."

"Now just a shaving of hair...or fingernails, any of your essence bits really, this bit is like that one shapeshifting potion, what's it called, Polyjuice..."

"And done! Now you just need to sacrifice...what was his name? Harry Potter, that was it! Just bring him over here and dunk him in the cauldron..."

Harry shot a look of shock and betrayal at the stone, before Quirrell waved his wand, raising the bound Harry into the air and slowly lowering him into the cauldron.

It felt like...a really warm spa, come to think of it. Harry's body went limp as he relaxed all over, helpless to resist as /something/ was drained from his body.

"Right, now, remove his body and put him aside for the time being," he groggily heard the stone say, before he was lifted out of the warm cookpot and tossed on the stone floor again.

When Harry could think clearly again, he could see Quirrell standing with his back to the cauldron, Voldemort's face on the back of his head prodding at the rim carefully.

"And now?" the chilling voice of Voldemort asked.

"Now?" the stone answered, "Now, you get in and stand in the cauldron. It's charged up, you simply need to stand in it to be transformed into an immortal being...strip off first, it's a waste of power making your robes immortal too."

Quirrell's head twisted to let Voldemort glare in the stone's direction, before he, with somewhat reluctance, began removing his robes; Harry squeezed his eyes shut to avoid the undoubtedly gross sight.

There was a quiet splashing sound, then Voldemort's voice came again, "Well?"

"Just wait. Oh, and by the way, there's a bit of fluff on your chin."

"Is there now? Quir-"

ZZZAP!!

"Harry Potter, you can open your eyes now."

Harry opened his eyes...and winced briefly; there, standing quite naked amongst the remains of a disintegrated cauldron, was a quite naked gleaming silvery statue of the two-faced Quirrell, hand reaching for his chin in a way that made him distinctly resemble Michelangelo's David.

"Did...how did...you turned him to stone?" he asked slowly.

The Philosopher's Stone glowed again, "Adamant, actually. A magical metal that can only be shaped by transmuting it from other materials. Nothing known in the world is able to destroy or alter it."

Harry continued to stare at the naked statue, "So...he got his immortality?"

"At a heavy price."

After a pause, Harry started wriggling again, "Well, if he's dealt with, would someone hurry up and untie me?!"

"Alas, I am but a talking stone...I could endeavour to tell you all about the Incarcerous spell and its counter, and the means of wandless magic..."

--------------

Despite the stone's instruction, Harry did not succeed in dispelling the ropes on himself before Dumbledore returned to search the room a second time.

So, he ended up in the hospital wing anyway.

"Mr. Potter, your magic is completely exhausted! 100%!" Madam Pomfrey said, somewhat amazed, "I've never seen anything like it!"

"My fault, I'm afraid," the Philosopher's Stone explained, "The potion Voldemort and Quirrell brewed to give themselves immortality, drained away Harry's magic to help fuel itself."

"I'm not a Muggle now, am I?" Harry said fearfully.

Pomfrey shook her head, "No, but you won't be able to do any magic at all until you recover...with drain like this, it'll take the entire summer holiday."

Harry crossed his arms and grumbled, "So much for the Quidditch Cup. And hexing Dudley."

"By the way, what happened to the statue of Voldemort and Quirrell?"

"Oh, I put a Notice-Me-Not Charm over the naughty bits and put it up in the 4th floor corridor as a sculpture of the roman god Janus."

*** Excellent. Two little flaws, I think, though --- Harry wouldn't need magic to play the Quidditch Cup, would he? But either way, did you /really/ have to bring magical exhaustion into this? Oh well. Still a very good read.

**** I mean, he /was/ a sacrifice. Also, I doubt Madam Pomfrey would let him even /if/ he didn't need it to play.

** Standing rooted to the front of The Mirror, Harry's eyebrows knitted together as confused lines appeared on his forehead.\\
-”What is it, boy ?”, Quirrel enquired quite excitedly, “do you have it?”\\
-”Hmmm... maybe?”, Harry said.\\
-”Liar!”, said a voice.\\
This seemed to startle the professor, ”Master... is it wise to revea...”\\
-”Silence, seize the boy!“\\
-”What do you mean when you call me a liar?”, said Harry, seemingly unfazed by the exchange, “do you mean to say that I don't maybe have the stone, or that I maybe don't have it?”\\
-“What ?” said Quirrell.\\
-”What do you have in your pocketses ?”, the voice whispered dangerously.\\
-”Hmm... I'm not sure, would you like three guesses ?”\\
-”Enough! Potter, empty your pockets at once !”, said Quirrell, regaining his composure and waving his wand threateningly.

The boy acquiesced and began rummaging through all his pockets, unearthing a varied aggregation of sweet wraps, used parchment and long-lost crumpled rear-admiral's hat, until he produced a dull grey stone that could fit in the palm of his hand.

-”Good evening”, said the stone.\\
-”What is this!”\\
-”I'm afraid I can't quite answer that in a definitive fashion”, said Harry.\\
-”Master, it does not look at all like the descriptions of the stone... and it talks!”\\
-”Yes, indeed, quite astute of you, young fellow. You see, I am the philosophical stone.”\\
-”What are its powers... what does this mean ?”\\
-”Did the old fool fool me or was I fooled by my own fool's errand?”\\
-”But in the end, is what matter most the power of the stone itself or the power you seek to find in yourself by possessing it?” threw in Harry with a grin on his face.\\
-”Quite”, said the stone.

It was a long night that followed these statements, and by the end of it, the future would not look so bleak for the wizarding world. Voldemort would go on to exile himself at the top of a mountain in his spirit form, occasionally offering advice to travellers who would seek the Wisdom Of The Peak. Quirinus would live the rest of his life naked inside a Butterbeer barrel, and Harry would come to be accepted as Dumbeldore's heir in the eye of the world.

-”My work here is done”, said the stone, soon disappearing from concrete existence with a gentle pop. Leaving the world forever safe in the knowledge that should the need for critical thinking and abstract reasoning become so dire again, a magical rock with a heart of gold would rise anew to save the day. Healing minds, one at a time.
