Hey I don't remember much about this story, but I remember Harry was abandoned as a kid, he has like a vampire girlfriend I think, and he took the title of lord Slytherin. If anyone knows this it would be great.


** Is it possibly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6611996/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hidden-Truth][Harry Potter and the Hidden Truth]]? He is Lord Slytherin and has three wives, one of which is a vampire.
