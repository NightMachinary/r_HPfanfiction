Going back a few years now, i was in my 'weird alternate reality fanfiction' days and i came across a story. Talking to one of my friends who also reads weird fanfictions, she is also interested in finding it however that is pretty hard to do when i am unable to remember its name.

All that i remember about the story was that it took place in a genderbender AU where during his 6th year Harry became a she at the request of the Ministry so that they could keep the Chosen One safe, whilst at the same time have someone masquerading as Harry (an Auror on polyjuice) taking down Voldemort and keeping up public appearences. Harry ends up in a female body and attending Hogwarts in the Ravenclaw house, becoming best friends with Padma Patill.

That's all i really want to say without ruining too much of what i remember of the story (for those that also want to read it), but hopefully there is someone out there who remembers reading the story, and also the name. Thanks in advance.
