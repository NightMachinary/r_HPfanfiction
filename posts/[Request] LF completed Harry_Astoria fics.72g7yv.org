  Astoria Greengrass wants to set up Harry Potter with her sister, Daphne. But her plans don't really go the way she wants them to. Not your usual Harry/Daphne/Astoria fic. Rated for some language and some adult content.

**** I think I read this on my phone once a few years ago. And I got up to a point where things were looking cool, but it was a cliffhanger and I lost track of it after that chapter. Glad to see this link, gonna have some good memories as I go through it fully.

Otherwise, completed Harry/Astoria fics are exceeding rare, and she is often part of a harem.

Astoria plays an important role in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), [[/spoiler][as she was the head of Harry's personal guard. She wielded extraordinary influence in his court, but the author has so far not indicated they were in any kind of romantic relationship.]]

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him.
