*** BajaB's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][Almost a Squib]] is also great. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute][The Substitute]] is another that's really interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]] is a really short romance oneshot that's fantastic.

** Well, a couple of my favourite oneshots have already been mentioned, but here are some more:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5101357/1/][The Potter Family Grimoire]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has an unprecedented amount of freedom the summer before his Third Year. He stumbles into an odd shop in Diagon Alley that will change his life forever.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10485934/1/][Inspected By No 13]]

#+begin_quote
  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6171610/1/][The First Task]]

#+begin_quote
  An irreverent adventure in the Harry Potter verse where several hallowed institutions are destroyed...its probably been done...then love conquers all!
#+end_quote

and of course the good old time-travel thingy without any summary (as its /really/ short, don't be lazy :P)

[[http://soulriders.net/brian/fanfic/troublewithhats/][Harry Potter and the trouble with Sorting Hats]]

[Edit]: Also, though not really oneshots these /are/ comfortably below 50k words and /hilarious/:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7447454/1/][The Dark Lord's Much Needed Vacation]]

#+begin_quote
  Dark Lord Voldemort needed a vacation. He even had the perfect plan so that his followers would not even notice his weeklong spree. Too bad his closest horcrux resided in Harry James Potter, the "Brat-Who-Lived"!
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4145459/1/][The Horror! The Horror!]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry goes to Africa and sets up a potions ingredient business. Wackiness ensues.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8376496/1/][Hunting for Potions]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry has enough of being imprisoned with the Dursleys over the summers and with Voldemort back, he decides to have some fun and face a little danger. He goes to Africa to become a Hunter, people who find rare and dangerous magical potion ingredients. Idea borrowed from Rorschah's Blot's fan fiction 'Odd Ideas'.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6560750/1/The-LipLock-Jinx][The Liplock Jinx]] is one of my very favorite oneshots. It's a Harry/Draco fic, a little over 20,000 words, and quite hilarious. I re-read it often.
