Looking for a creature inheritance harry potter. No veela, vampire,werewolf harry. Looking for those extra rare creatures(Sirens,Kitsune,Ookami, etc...)


** Not sure if you are ok with "smut w/plot or plot w/smut" (depending on how you look at it), but Incubus If I remember correctly fits the bill of unusual creature inheritance:

  Harry's world is flipped upside down when he is visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare type of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of his problems when he finds out just how drastically his life is about to change. How will young Harry manage an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive!

** Monster Lord" might qualify. Certainly an exotic creature inheritance. NSFW though.

  Harry Potter understands you fight fire with fire. So does Hermione. Voldemort has done all sorts of rituals to increase his power (or so the word goes), so why not try one to increase Harry's? Unfortunately for Harry, they picked one that will leave him feeling a little... blue. (Now in its proper category!)

** This community should help you out. I doubt every fic will be what you want but it should tide you over for a while. No clue if they're worth a read though.
