It doesn't have to be the whole story, and I'd find it interesting if it was set at Hogwarts, so teenage Harry whose mind is wiped, can have new reactions to people, situations and the like.

But, it can be when Harry is an adult as well, either one is fine.

Would like Harry to remember eventually, of course.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Can be as canon or as AU as possible.

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

No character bashing: An author going out of their way to make a character bad/evil when they aren't, is a no go.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Threesomes and the like. (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing).


** There's linkffn(12011689) Summary days that there's some bashing, but I don't remember (hehehe) how bad it is

  A freak potion accident renders our hero without memory of who he is. Watch as the new Harry takes Hogwarts by storm. No one is going to tell him what to do. AU 4th year. Super!Unfettered!Cussing!Harry. Some bashing, but not stupidly so. Not a crossover, but with a lot of Sci-fi references. Harry's a bit of an ass.

** I haven't finished this one yet but it starts out with Harry being different because of Lockhart's obliviation. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9821300][swung by serafin]]
