Like imagine that Harry retired and went away from the magical world but gets pulled back in later on and is like a complete badass John Wick style character..


** The only story I have read was an abandoned short (6 chapters for a total of 8700 words) called Noctilucent by YouTalkLikeADentist

  Is he cursed? It seems like no matter what Wick does, he can't seem to shake off the shadow his past casts over his life. Always a fight, always corpses littered around him. And now he has his own little shadow, Harry, a boy with a cursed luck of his own.

** Bungle in the jungle and the sequel. Harry is trained by hit wizards and is all around the biggest badass. Amazing fix, though the premise was some weird bashing, just ignore that. It's epic!

  Retirement is great but the worst part of being retired is everyone keeps trying to get you to come back. Rated T for Language and Violence. lots of violence. Now beta'd
