I'm looking for a fic where harry reincarnates in a parallel universe. The one that stood out the most in my memory was when he was playing football for england and Ron was a cop.


** Think you're talking about one of mine. The Real Memory, written back in 2011. The soccer world was the first one. It's also posted on Ao3. linkffn(The Real Memory)

  Voldemort strikes and Harry falls. When he comes back to himself he isn't at Kings Cross with Dumbledore. Instead he's at the Dursleys, going to Stonewall High instead of Hogwarts. Why?
