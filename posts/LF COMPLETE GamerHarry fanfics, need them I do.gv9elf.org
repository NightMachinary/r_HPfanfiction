As I said, COMPLETE fics, where Harry's life is turned into a game.

I'm currently four for four gamer!Harry fics and each one of them is uncompleted, it's absolutely infuriating, so I now require complete ones to soothe my brain

I don't care about the pairing as long as it isn't slash or some weird pairing like Harry/Dobby or something similar

Over 70k words

And finally

Not written like the author just learned of the english language

OH AND IT'S GOTTA BE COMPLETE

Thank you and stay safe

Remember, COMPLETE

Edit: I FORGOT ABOUT UPDATING FICS, THOSE ARE GOOD TO LINK AS WELL


** I have never met a Gamer!Harry fic that fulfills all of those criteria.

I hope someday i will find one.

*** Probably because there isn't one. Across all the fandoms I follow I've only seen this happen twice, and both were horribly written and unworthy of anyone's time.

OP should either accept short fics, or incomplete stories.

**** The only one I know of is a Naruto fic, and that's only technically complete - there is an ongoing sequel.

The only two that are decent are a HP fic (probably abandoned at this point, last update a couple of years ago) and a Naruto SI/Gamer fic (updating very infrequently, and although not terrible, has infrequent spelling errors and typos).

Gamer fics tend to write themselves into corners by making their characters too OP. the first fic I mentioned dealt with it by using a Fallout-derived Gamer system that heavily restricted powerups - and that ended the first (complete) story with the protagonist undergoing literal apotheosis

The sequel has other gods opposing him, like Jashin, as well as goals that even godhood (or at the form he achieved) can't implement easily (at least not without violating his moral code)

***** I know right I read a lot of Gamer fics but I've only read one Gamer! fic/series ever that meets all requirements and it was for the fandom RWBY (The Games We Play and it's Sequel The Lies We Tel), I can't think of anything at all for HP!

** OP, if you're interested in Gamer fics, you're also very likely to enjoy LITRPG and Progression Fantasy books. I recommend browsing [[/r/litrpg][r/litrpg]] and [[/r/ProgressionFantasy][r/ProgressionFantasy]]. Most are series that contain many books and are very well written. It also definitely scratches that Gamer itch. I have to warn you though that most of the series(that I have read so far) haven't been completed, but some have like 8 books written so far and the authors are active so I'm satisfied.

*** I think I should have added "updating" to the list of acceptables, and if there are even some that are completed then I'm fine

Thank you! I'm going to check them out now

*** Linkffn(harry potter and the critical game)

Linkffn(harry potter and the game) (arguably the best of the four, nvm three)

Linkffn(harry potter and the gamer reborn)

I can't find the last one now.. fk but start with the middle one, it's the best in my opinion
