** As a computer scientist- that's a terrible system for them to have implemented.

*** To be fair they do say that its going to be integrated soon, but I agree. It kind of sucks. I got a response back from one of the readers who had PMed me using the app, and turns out he'd quit my story because he thought I was a rude jackass since I kept updating chapter after chapter without responding to him.

It was a headache, and not one I'd wish on anyone.

**** They quit reading something the enjoyed because the felt ignored? I would have thought the writer was spending the time they had available to write instead of replying to reviews. Chapters are more important than chatting. Still, sucks that you had to deal with it.

** Thanks for the heads up! Is this app only available for android users? I can't seem to find the app for my IPhone.

*** Its android only for now. There is no iOS version yet. Fictionpress Twitter says that they don't have the resources to manage and develop 2 platforms at the same time, which is why they are focusing on Android first.

**** Really? There are resources out there that allow them to write once and publish many times, regardless of platform. Someone just got lazy. :/

***** No doubt there are many great resources out there, but what I meant was their lack of money. The site can barely manage to maintain the servers and keep the employees it has with the Ad revenue it gets. I'd assume an app would be difficult to develop with such tight monetary restraints, which is why I don't really blame them.

****** I more meant that, with their existing code base, they could create the iOS app quite easily. And with little work.

** I used the app once. Chrome did the job better than that pile of code.

It really isn't good (yet?)

*** I like it because it saves my spot directly, gives me easy access to my favs and follows, and doesn't require me keeping my mobile browser open. That and better visual options (for me at least).

*** Its actually pretty good for what its meant to be, which is an app for reading and accessing the archive. Plus they're updating /significantly/ every couple of weeks. They recently added in a Document Manager feature, which was a pleasant surprise.
