:END:
Harry is thought to be the heir of Slytherin and gets blamed for Ginny's death/disappearance and is sent to Azkaban. I think he and Sirius actually break out and are not cleared until a while after that.

I vaguely remember these scenes (hopefully I'm not mixing scenes from multiple fics):

- Ron/The Weasleys confront Harry after he comes back to Hogwarts and Harry says that he asked the Ministry to come back to Hogwarts so he could go down to the chamber to look for Ginny/her body but they refused

- Harry being lead out of Hogwarts by aurors, I think Hermione and Ron are there at the time

- Harry expecting Hermione to still hate him and think he's a murderer but she doesn't. I think they meet on the platform before school. I can't remember if they become friends again though.
