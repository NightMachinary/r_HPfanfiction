** NaNoWriMo is for a production of a rough unedited draft, if I'm not mistaken. I hope you just put this up for brief feedback, and don't plan to continue to post without editing. (From your author's note, I assume you plan to have a beta or something.) I'm always of the opinion that authors who write their whole stories, edit/beta them, and then post on a set schedule are going about it the best way. That's my unsolicited two cents on posting... haha. Before I give specific critique, I'd say that I would definitely be interested in reading your story once it were beta'd and/or completed. I think it's a unique idea, so please don't be discouraged by my comments!

That said, here in my unprofessional opinion.

I tried a couple times to read Chapter 1, but the conversation between Lily and James was really stilted and awkward. Nothing that I think editing/beta'ing couldn't fix, but it was difficult to get through. It almost feels like Lily and James are filler until you get to the part you want to write about - Voldemort's entry. Perhaps consider cutting most of it out? I think it would make for an excellent story opener to have a tense, longer scene with Voldemort/Harry/Dumbledore. Especially since Dumbledore's actions seem rushed. Perhaps most of this is stuff that will be post-NaNoWriMo editing. (: I'm also assuming that the random appearance of Mad-Eye will seem less random with later chapters/information?

Chapter 2 - Why /Desmond/? Also, the bit with Snape at the end feels rushed, whereas the scene with Minerva seems drawn out; many of your readers understand what goes on in a Hogwarts meet and greet with a child who doesn't know he/she is magical... so make this scene unique! (: In the same vein, you've created a different Snape than we know from the books. Feel free to give him more of an introduction.

In Chapter 3, the dream sequence is a good idea, I think. Again though, it feels like a lot of information really quickly delivered. Take your time with this! Build up to it. Has Harry had headaches all his life? Does he see flashes of this old man growing up, and finally recognize him as the man now in his dream/vision? Also, Harry has been to Godric's Hollow before, by himself at some point before his 11th birthday... and he is currently making this journey at the tender age of 11. Alone, calmly, and fearlessly. I don't have kids and being 11 was a long time ago for me, but I always am skeptical of fanfic kids acting above their age... Perhaps just be cautious of that? Lastly, I think the potion is a good way to work Harry and Severus into a relationship, but I believe it happened to easily for Harry. He's singlehandedly ticked through a list and is well on his way to this story being accomplished in 5 more chapters! Just teasing... But this situation is the perfect place to add well done tension; what if Snape weren't at the last place Dumbledore knew Snape to be, and Harry had to track Snape down? This in particular would have me rooting for little 11 year old Harry; how is he to complete such a quest at his age? It feels more hopeless. If things just fall into place for Harry, it turns into too much crackfic for me. What if Harry only ran into Snape at school? Let them meet later, maybe. Harry can work on sneakily collecting ingredients or something, and later when they meet Snape can sneeringly think Harry is an overachiever. Just something to add conflict for Harry to work through.

Anyway, you did ask for feedback and I hope you don't think I'm being harsh. I only took the time to write this up because I think your story /does/ have a lot of potential. I think you have a solid idea here, but make sure you know where you want to go from here. It seems the main point of conflict will be the creation of the potion, but where from there? You don't want to overdo the "Mark of Cain" shunning, because then I feel like you'll get a lot of emo poor-pitiful-me Harry like from OotP.

Naturally, I don't know where you plan to go from here, so some of my comments may not apply. I do hope some of it can be useful. If you ever need help/editing/opinions, feel free to shoot me a PM. (:

*** Hi there. Thanks for the critique!

I agree that first conversation was a bit forced- I was writing at great speed.

Desmond Scott was named after the Anglican Ministers, Desmond Tutu and Ted Scott. I imagined he'd be named at the hospital he was eventually brought to. (I may exposition that.)

I like the idea of some foreshadowing for the dream. Perhaps have Sister Olive mention the child insisted on going there once, and comment on his independence.

When I was eleven, I used to ride city busses all the time to get from one town to the next, going to the library and such- but that might just be my experience growing up (I grew up in Israel, and kids tend to mature a lot quicker and have a lot more freedom there.) I also assume that this Harry would be a lot more independent and used to doing for himself.

I agree that having more conflict by not having Snape be at home at Spinner's End would add some nice tension, rather than Harry just finding him there. Perhaps I'll have Harry find him on Knockturn Alley, working at an Apothecary.

I'm not going to edit what I've written too heavily, as that's anathema for NaNo month. But I will refer back to this comment when I am ready for that stage. I'll also reply again when I've got a more complete story.

Thank you for the feedback on this! Very much appreciated.

I always love brief author's notes and the end of chapters. If, in your final posting/draft, you gave a short explanation as to why Desmond was chosen, I as a reader would probably would be more accepting! haha.

Yes, something like this would be great! It gives you more time to flesh out his childhood a bit, which would be good since you've put Harry in a semi-Tom-like situation. Also, maybe I was just a sheltered child. d: I was rather shy as well. But I think Sister Olive mentioning his independence (and implicitly accepting his independence) would would make his travels more believable.

Good for you! Keep writing on, and save the editing for after November for sure. I commend you for doing this. And I'd be very interested in seeing how things turn out, so do reply! I'd appreciate that a lot. (: Good luck!
