This has bugged me for a while. There's a lot of fics where Harry's like "oh my, guns are just an I win button against wizards," and that somehow nobody has ever managed to notice this before, despite Grindelwald's close association with Hilter and the Nazi armies during WWII and it's prevalence of rapid-reloading and automatic guns.

I was chatting with a friend and realized that, depending on exactly how unbreakable and cushioning charms work, it's not entirely unreasonable for pretty much all wizarding clothing is completely bulletproof. Unbreakable cloth means you only have to deal with the force of the (non-magical) impact as there will be no penetration, and comfort/cushioning charms might deal with that force just fine. Sure, wizards would still be vulnerable to to being shot where their clothing isn't, but between robes, hoods, and big pointy hats there really isn't that much exposed skin on the average wizard on a day-to-day basis, much less if they were expecting trouble.

Hell, death eaters have /no/ exposed skin when they're in their uniform.

Then there's the issue that non-magical wounds are stupid simple for wizards to fix and that they're outright tougher than muggles anyway, so a gunshot is likely less debilitating than the same shot on a muggle in the first place.

So... agree? disagree? I think guns would be almost worthless against wizards. In specific circumstances a skilled (or lucky) shooter against an unprepared wizard could probably take out the wizard before the wizard knew what was going on, but it really seems like the kind of thing where you have one chance and one chance only to score a headshot before the gun becomes worthless in that fight.


** This is one of those topics that everyone gets all up in arms about, pun intended. Honestly, the only answer I can come up with is that it doesn't matter if one is stronger than the other. If you are the writer of that story, if you are trying to write a compelling and engaging story, then it is your obligation to find ways to fix that power imbalance between the the two kinds of weapons. If you believe guns are better than magic, then you have to write situations in which the effectiveness of guns are reduced, in order to allow magic to fight back. If you believe magic is better, you must create conditions in which gun users are able to actually make their weapons effective. Make excuses for how magic is unable to combine two spells, make guns jam, turn bullets into fish. The list goes on.

Buff guns and nerf magic, do the opposite, or buff or nerf both of them. It doesn't matter, just make it so it's not a curbstomp on one side.

Plenty of Canon evidence contradicted this form of 'Wizard Wank':

In the Final Battle, many Death Eaters were shot down by Centaurs using bows and arrows and cut down by House-Elves using kitchen knives.

Throughout Harry's time at Hogwarts, students beat each other all the time, with plenty of injuries to boot.

And then Wizards were scared of Acromantulas, Giants, Trolls, and Werewolves, whose attacks were all physical based.

--------------

Even if these charms offered some protections against non-magical damage, they could be easily worn down and overwhelmed by constant assaults or attacks much stronger than, let's say, rain drops.

*** Did it really /contradict/ it? Because as far as I remember it wasn't that it didn't work against things but rather it never got used by anyone to protect themselves, and with Madame Rowling's track record with certain things I don't feel that this can be taken as proof that it wouldn't ever work.

That said, this does still speak a lot about any kind of “average wizard versus average muggle” scenario, sure, because if the wizards don't remember their protections then that's not very effective anyway.

***** I can agree with that. That said, the point of my reply was not to state that it was “about Muggles vs Wizards” (the “muggle” in the quoted part of what I wrote was supposed to represent a person with a gun), but rather to say that while I do agree that the charms aren't shown to be effective in the books, they aren't shown to be ineffective either because we haven't seen them being cast at all and thus they may very well simply not be there which would mean that canon does not contradict the idea, at least not as far as we know.

That said, I will expand that unless the caster wore many layers of clothes all enchanted with those charms, it would probably still hurt like heck because that's a lot of energy for a small point of impact and heck knows if a single cushioning charm stop that from bruising, so yes, I do doubt that it would be as effective for an average wizard as OP makes it out to be.

** In my fic, linkffn(Driving Miss Weasley), I simply say that shield charms don't work with guns. It's not a case of whether or not it's logical (because nothing is logical in the HP universe), it's more a matter of plot reasons and upping the excitement factor. I think that's the most important thing to consider. We know absolutely nothing about the way shield charms work, so you can pretty much do whatever you want with them.

** Guns are a tool, and to effectively use them you need training. Not as much as to effectively use magic, but you can't just pick up a gun and be good with it. Which means that if you want to use guns in a war involving wizards, you need a good reason to make the time spent getting proficient with guns worth it.

Guns do offer several advantages over wands. Much longer range (especially for longarms), much better rate of fire even with semi-automatics, and much better precision (and no, in canon, spells do not auto-aim - even Voldemort misses Harry in his fight in the graveyard). But all of those advantages are situational. And people will adapt. You can't count on sniping working well forever. Or machine gunning clumped up enemies from outside their range.

** In the duel between McGonagall and Snape at the end of Book 7, McGonagall shoots daggers at Snape and he has to block them with a suit of armour, so I guess that's a point towards physical projectiles. Also, if cushioning charms could stop bullets, they'd probably be able to stop swords or claws or whatever, which they don't seem to be able to do. I suppose guns might backfire around magic because of too many moving parts or something? In the third book, a description of a gun in the Daily Prophet is "A kind of metal wand muggles use to kill each other". This seems to imply that the general Wizarding population doesn't know what guns are, but they don't seem all that worried about them, so who knows?

** Hm...probably depends on one factor and one factor alone:

The element of surprise - if the person with the gun has that then the wizard is probably dead, but if not? Yeah, then the gun-wielder is probably the one incapacitated or dead (depending on the mood of the wizard and if they like killing or not...Voldemort and the DEs would probably splatter muggles with guns all over the place, while the order would probably stun then and modify their memories)

ps: Only two things could change that: Firing many guns while making it impossible to apparate (forcing a wizard's shield down with overwhelming force!) or modifying the gun (runes on the gun and/or the bullets for example) with magic

** Well, what can a wizard do against a gun-wielding assailant?

Use a shield charm, transfigure a solid object or levitate one to use as cover, Apparate out of the line of fire, use Disillusionment or an invisibility cloak to avoid being targeted, use a human-revealing spell to locate the shooter then down them with a curse...

   :END:
The thing is, muggles have equivalents of almost all of those, except perhaps Apparation; wear armor, take cover or use a shield, wear camouflage, use thermal-vision goggles...

Now, admittedly, a regular muggle is not going to have all (or any) of those, whereas a regular wizard, assuming a functioning DADA class at Hogwarts, will be able to summon up their defences with their multipurpose wand they always have with them. Sort of the equivalent of having a 'Force Field' app on your smartphone.

   :END:
Still, the point I'm trying to make is, since muggles have their own, real-life equivalents of many wizarding defences, the things that can foil those muggle defences should also be effective against wizarding defences; in a nutshell, a handgun might not work, but a rocket-propelled grenade will.

And, while most all wizards have wands, it's a mistake to assume that all of them are perfectly combat-competent; it's pointed out in Half Blood Prince by Fred & George that most wizards in the Ministry can't actually do a good shield charm, instead getting their hats and robes enchanted with it.

So you have wizarding civilians who aren't hot at combat, and muggle civilians who aren't hot at combat, and Aurors and Hit Wizards who /are/ hot at combat, and muggle S.W.A.T. and military who are hot at combat.

Stealth was Wizards' best defense. Any target that could be identified could be destroyed. It's actually the same in Muggle warfare. During wars, locations of those in chain of command were actually unknown. I'm pretty sure the US would very much want to kill Al-Baghdadi and Kim of North Korea at moment, but they are in hiding.

Apparation would not be too effective against Wizards with guns. I expect anti-apparation charms to be standard combat and security procedures. Furthermore, apparations would be very risky because destinations that still allowed apparations could be designated kill zones.
