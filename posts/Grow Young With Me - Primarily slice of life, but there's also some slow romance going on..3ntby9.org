And here it is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me]]

Difficult for me to go into why I'm enjoying it so much without listing plot points. Hopefully a few of you enjoy it as well.


** A fantastic story that deserves way more attention. One of the few post-hogwarts stories I've enjoyed in ages. It just feels very real.

** I'm an avid reader of this fic as well. It's very well written, compelling character development, interesting OC. It's right up there with /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/ in my book as an amazingly well told story that you just can't stop reading linkffn(6331126)
