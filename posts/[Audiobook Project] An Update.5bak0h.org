Hello, all,

Last night, I finished recording Chapter 1 of Not From Others and sent it to [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] for feedback and review. I did not edit her voice lines in before I did this. When she gets back to me, I will edit her lines in and post it to YouTube and SoundCloud.

Best,

ThePianoProdigy

EDIT: Audacity (My preferred editing program) can't edit m4a files, Oh, well, guess I'll just have to rerecord it. Still, the audacity!


** Audacity most certainly /can/ import and export M4A files. It does, however, require installing the FFmpeg plugin.

On Windows, the download should be linked on Audacity's website. On *nix, it should be available through your package manager of choice.

Edit: wtf, autocorrect?

*** Linkffn(not from others)

I'm re-reading it now, it's a canon compliant 7th year story from Ginny's point of view. It's pretty good.

*** Not From Others is a fanfiction written by FloreatCastellum. It follows Ginny through her sixth year (Harry's seventh year) of Hogwarts. It's considered the definitive fic for an alternative POV of Year 7.
