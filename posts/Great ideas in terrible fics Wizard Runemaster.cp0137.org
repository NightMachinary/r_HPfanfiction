Before I start I'll link the fic that gave me the idea to make this post

linkffn(Wizard Runemaster)

This fic is filled with brilliant ideas and combinations and the crossover actually works. HOWEVER it's ruined with an excessive and unrealistic harem and terrible â€˜romance'.

What could be a fic about people from the world of Harry Potter adapting to living in Azeroth ends up being a fic about how many women can be put in Harry's harem.

Here's some examples of fantastic moments in the fic:

In Warcraft there is a group called the Forsaken; they are a group of undead who regained their personalities from their lives. They suffer serious discrimination and hatred due to their appearance and how unnatural they are. In the fic Harry recruits the Flamels and suggests they modify Voldemort's resurrection ritual to return the Forsaken to life. That is genius! That is what crossovers should be, combining knowledge from one universe to help another's problems!

Another example would be when Harry brings refugees from Earth and has to convince the High Priestess of Elune to allow these races to settle nearby, every bit of that chapter was clever and well thought out.

All these great ideas are drowned in a fic of smut and an excessively large harem.

I think right now the harem consists of two night elves, two dragon gods, two goat people, and two corpses. There might be more that I'm not remembering.

Still I'm gonna keep reading the fic whenever it updates in hopes of getting more amazing chapters and less smut ones.

As far as fics go it's a 6/10 but if you have the patience to slog through the shit there's some real golden moments in there

I see Harry's taking the "Noah's ark" approach to harem-building.

*** I think it's a sad sign of how jaded I am that eight women doesn't seem like an "excessively large" harem, at all.

I blame fics like The Harem War (both Radaslab's and Vincewossname's), where they quickly reached double digits and just kept climbing. When you have to use a Time Turner to give your ladies any attention, it's too much.

Well....

#+begin_quote
  The 6th-century BCE King Tamba of Banaras (India) is rumored to have had a harem of 16,000. Kublai Khan, the 13th-century Mongol leader, had four queens and 7,000 concubines. He habitually culled and refreshed the pool of concubines every few years. The 15th-century Sultan Ghiyas-ud-Din Klijn's harem of 15,000 necessitated the construction of a separate walled city to house them.

Harry needs to do better, really. Eight women is pitiful.

** It's just full of terribly written smut scenes and the plot only moves forward when Harry needs to add a new woman to his harem. Plums had said they won't be getting into any of the big stuff that the players get into in the actual game, so the only reason to read it is if you get off on reading about someone fucking characters from WoW.

It's not like it'll ever be completed anyways. It was years between updates, and if you read the update that came out a few months ago, it's pretty obvious plums had written those chapters years ago when he was writing Wizard Runemaster, and put them up this year saying he was back.

** In MoR (yes, I know...) I've always enjoyed the concept of transfiguring part of something based on the fact that items are Made by atoms. I'm not sure if it had been made before, or if others consider it /great/, but I thought it was interesting.

The [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Human_to_shark][wiki]] does seem to imply that it wasn't on purpose, but then again, it is just conjeture.

  A Weapon. A Hero. But now... a loose end. Harry Potter resolves to destroy the enemies who betrayed him on his terms, only to find all his plans torn asunder when he's summoned to a new world plagued with the same enemies as his own.
