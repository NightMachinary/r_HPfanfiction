It's a major turn off for me if in a fic the main char will see a girl and the world will stop and they will forget how to speak and decide right then that there going to be together. Does anyone else hate this or does this actually happen and I'm just a loveless bastard?


** There's a difference between shitty, poorly written "romance" and actual relationship development/progression. You're referencing the former, which I think most people would prefer not to read. I'm fine with the latter.

** Romance is different for everyone, isn't it? For me, the moments I realized I fancied someone were when I was alone, thinking about that person. It never started in the middle of a conversation. But that's just me.

Remember that the story written by a person, and they will probably use their own experiences in writing. Often times a work of fiction is actually an autobiography in disguise. Not that there's something wrong with that, of course.

But you do have a point that the "he looked at her and he momentarily forgot to breathe [...massive internal monologue...]" trope is used very often in fanfiction. Sometimes it works with the style and focus of the fic, sometimes it doesn't.

I don't hate it. It's often fun to read if the writer can properly convey those feelings to the reader. But I do dislike those moments where the protagonist has a massive internal monologue right in the middle of a conversation, which leads to awkward moments. I'm more of a rambler myself in those situations, so I can't imagine just staring at someone and not saying anything to them. It feels strange when I read something like that and it stands out too much.

** It depends on the context. If it's eleven year olds and they fall madly in love with an accidental magical "bond" or they're "mates" than yes it's a major turn off. But if they are say seventeen and it's the amazing mystical bond or mate thing then I'll enjoy it and probably even love it.

However that's probably not what you were thinking about in terms of romance. I don't think HP fan fiction really has the canon material to write a good "love at first sight" romance. I'm not saying that the writers are incapable of producing well written romance I just happen to believe that because HP was not primarily a romance or IMO have a slow build relationship that was the main story of two people falling in love and being together. I often look elsewhere for my romance fix.

Again there can be some great romance for HP but often times I believe the tone doesn't match with the romance or it becomes weird and sloppy. The latter often seen in my experience with A LOT when Harry is the main character.

No not a heartless bastard I don't often really like what's offered in romance section for this fandom.

for me, it's true love at 11. creeps me out. 11 year old kids are TINY, and in no way capable of a functional romantic relationship. imho.

*** Yet kids tend to have their first crush at 5 or 6, and it's typical at that age for kids to imitate the trappings of real relationships they see around them.

On top of that, it's fair to argue that magical kids mature faster than muggle kids.

So you're right that a fully functional a romantic relationship is beyond the 11-year-olds of Hogwarts, but the first steps of trying may not be, and with a little dose of magic, it's not unreasonable for some of those early steps to transform into something later.

In canon, James latched onto the idea that Lily was the girl for him right during the first train ride, didn't he? It was only because he was a toerag that they didn't at least start holding hands or something in first year. So I'd say that there is even canon support for at least the /possibility/ of a lifelong romantic relationship getting its first, tentative steps as early as first year.

Unlikely, to be sure, but not categorically impossible.

**** I don't see why magical kids would mature faster - if anything, it would be the opposite. Like, magical people live something like 50% longer, why would they be falling in love or settling down /earlier/?

**** It's different for each person how old they are when they first start feeling romantic feelings. Some have it when they are 5-6, some only start having feelings like that when they are 14-15.

I don't think it says anywhere that magical kids mature faster than normal ones, that's just fanon, created by people who want to speed up their pairing. And we don't know when James first started feeling for Lily. All we know is that he asked her to go out with him during that scene with Snape. And later Snape says that James fancies her. We don't know anything else.

When you're that young (10-15), you will go through changes, as will your romantic feelings (exceptions are there of course). Plus, as a young teenager, you often lack the empathy to be in a good, healthy, lasting relationship. And hormones will often cloud your perception and that can lead to fights etc.

Not to say that romantic feelings aren't true at that age, they can be earth-movingly intense, but it's more than often temporary. And there's a difference between a crush and love. I couldn't tell you what it is to be in a relationship with the one you love, but it's safe to say that it's something else entirely.

Everyone is indeed different, but if you read up on the research of child development experts, you'll find that 5-6 is normal age for first crushes to develop. It usually involves a bit of hand holding and occasional kisses on the cheek if the feelings are reciprocated in any way. Sometimes they will even go so far as to "marry".

It's not a real romantic relationship, obviously, but if the first tentative steps are starting by the age of five, it's no surprise if something a little more serious might develop by twelve.

I didn't say it did, I said "/it's fair to argue/ that magical kids mature faster than muggle kids." They are given and then trained in the use of what amounts to a deadly weapon at the age of eleven. At the age of thirteen they are, all on their own, with little or no input, choosing classes that will help determine their careers. They are left for long periods of time with little or no adult supervision in an old castle. They start making actual decisions about careers at the age of fifteen. They seem finish enough schooling by the age of seventeen to start on high-level professional career tracks.

That's all at least two to four years in advance of similar progress among muggle kids.

****** Your argument about the responsibilities of magical children is good, but I don't really agree with it. Maturity isn't a bar you fill, or something you can measure in percentages. True, children in warzones, children who have to stand on their own two feet and children who know the harsh consequences of a big mistake handle pressure and responsibility much better than their peers. Harry's a perfect example of it, because he shows that while you can be very mature in some areas (facing Voldemort and fighting back, handling life and death situations extremely well) he's very underdeveloped in others (his date with Cho, afraid to go into a girl's bathroom during CoS).

I don't think more responsibility will make magical children develop steady relationships at an earlier age. Not necessarily, anyway.

But in the end, it's a story, and the author has every right to bend whatever rule to make their story click.

***** I'd have to agree with maturity thing in HP. We read Harry Potter in the POV of a kid who had the world on his shoulders so perhaps some thought that other magical kids would also be mature in a similar way. It makes sense but the fandom amped it up to a whole other level. While it makes sense for them to worry about the state of things and want to fight Voldemort and think about sex. A fourteen year old should not be able to buy a house in ANY fic, it just makes it silly.

** What I loathe the most is a character suddenly going out of character so that the romance can work. Harry/Tonks is the absolute worst for this. In order to make this work, so many people make Harry super confident and 'witty' in a way which loses all resemblance to the character.

I just don't see Harry as that sexual. He rarely has crushes or notices people. If he suddenly starts going super playboy, l roll my eyes and back button out. You need character developments and interactions to show a romance can work. Not just 'he was a boy, she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious?' (I'm looking at you, JKR, with your Harry/Ginny and your Remus/Tonks.)

** Chest monsters and true love at age 11 is ridiculous. Sure, some percentage of high school sweethearts actually go the distance and last, but that small percentage is way overblown in fanfiction. It seems like it's something like 40% in stories, and I agree, that it is ridiculous and way overdone.

**** Also, because they don't want to write (or can't) proper romance and want to characters to get together as quickly as possible with the minimal amount of effort. Same thing with marriage contracts. It's not a good plot device, and the story usually ends up as a disjointed mess with terrible pacing.

***** Those fics are largely because they can't make the characters personally interact so they need to force the issue. Harry and Draco don't really engage beyond Draco making snide comments, so something needs to push them. Snape and Hermione have a lot in common, but also loathe each other and avoid each other where possible.

"You must get married/have sex/be in close proximity to one another, or else."

Boom. Incentive to work on those issues!

It's very rarely "Harry and Hermione were soul bonded. Which worked out fine because she was totally type A and he was very intuitive and reactive with a better sense of perspective," or "Harry and Luna were sympathetically traumatised children together and it was super sweet".
