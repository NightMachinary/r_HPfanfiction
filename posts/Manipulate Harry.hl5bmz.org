Harry being a carbon-copie personality-wise of the Manipulative!Dumbledore trope. Could be that he is trying to manipulate other students to kill Voldemort or even that he is manipulating a completely different situation while ignoring Voldemort entirely, would be specially funny if Dumbledore/Voldemort/whoever was trying to manipulate him, overheard him saying something that makes it sound like they are succeeding but then it's revealed that he was actually speaking of his plans to his own manipulations (maybe he is trying to manipulate the Ministry into letting him skip Hogwarts entirely to play pro-Quadrich or something along this lines?)


** Canon Harry can be manipulative from time to time. His one conversation with Dumbledore in CoS resembled Tom Riddle's word for word. He played psych game with Ron to boost the latter's confidence. He got Slughorn drunk and then guilt tripped him into revealing his true memory.

*** Yup, but this is something that a sane individual with objectives that make sense would do. When I say manipulative I mean in the sense of the manipulative Dumbledore trope, as in stupid as a rock with millions of ridiculous plans that seem to be done for non-sense ends held together only by the sheer fame and power of the manipulator plus the general stupidity of the rest of the characters. Things like almost start a nuclear war while trying to convince a Ministry official to wave away some minor charge.
