I like the idea of Harry being a book worm but Harry's not the most academic of characters, so anything that involves him spending his waking hours studying is generally pretty out of character.

I was thinking that a good way to make him a bookworm but not a second Hermione would be for him to enjoy reading fiction. I've read plenty of stories that briefly show Harry reading muggle fiction but it seems like a waste of an opportunity to show what a magical person's version of fiction would look like.

A clue in a cozy mystery might involve describing the wand movements and appearance of a wordless spell, for instance.

The wizard version of The Da Vinci Code might involve something like the the Sacred 28 families protecting Merlin's bloodline.

A post-apocalyptic book might start off with a new variety of Dragon Pox that standard spells/potions don't work on or the magic being revealed to muggles and a war.

What would a the magical version of a fantasy novel look like? A world without Muggles? A hidden and unknown magical country in the back of someone's wardrobe? Time travel to the founders' time? OP characters with wandless magic?

What's the magical version of science fiction, then? Would more advanced spellwork substitute for the advanced tech? Or would it be integration of magic & technology? Perhaps Arthur Weasley's car is a result of him being a huge sci-fi buff.

I bet that Mad Muggle comic book of Ron's would be amusingly inaccurate. Or perhaps it's a graphic novel adaptation of the magical version Twain's Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court but it's dumbed-down for a young audience and all the social commentary of the original was lost.

What does their book market look like? Are there scanty offerings due to the low population and lack of a language arts class at Hogwarts? Or is it somewhat robust with lots of international offerings? Perhaps there's a nifty translation spell you can use and the big academic debate isn't whether or not to read something in the original language but whether to trust a publisher's translation spell or get an original version and do the spell work yourself.

Do humans read much fiction by non-humans? What does that look like? Perhaps mermaids are known for great poetry and goblins are known for more militaristic books? Vampires write excellent historical fiction. Would that make room for any cross-species pen names? Perhaps there's a goblin who loves to write romantic poetry but has to publish with a mermish pen name so that people will actually read it.

Etc.

There'd probably be some room for new conflicts between Harry & Hermione. Hermione probably wouldn't approve of reading fiction when one could be learning new spells. Harry could end up taking Ancient Runes so he can read the magical version of Homer, while Hermione thinks that's a waste of time when he could be reading old grimoires instead. Perhaps Harry thinks Hermione taking Muggle Studies to understand a wizard's perception of muggles is useless when she could simply read a couple of novels with muggle characters instead. Perhaps Harry is more credulous of divination since he's already been introduced to the concept via his reading. Or perhaps he reacts very differently to seeing Sirius before 3rd year since he already associates a big black dog with death omens.


** Just had another thought - if the Wizard equivalent of fantasy is a set in a world without muggles, or one where wizards rule the muggles, that might make them extremely popular with bigoted purebloods, whereas sci-fi that blends magic & technology would probably be more popular with halfbloods & muggleborns.

Perhaps Harry is a huge fantasy fan in the muggle world and picks up a Wizard fantasy novel but when he gets around to reading it, he's completely horrified by the premise.

I can see literature based assumptions too... "You're reading FANTASY? You're a future death eater!" A sci fi fan? Must be a mudblood or blood traitor.

** I am sure there is a market for interspecies romance. I am also sure it is considered tratshy by many for different reasons ("Proper" purebloods: " This is disgusting. It is bad enough some people want to sleep with muggles-borns, but at least they are still biologically human. " Creature rights activists: " This is so wrong. It fetishises these people and does not touch on the issues they are dealing with.").

I wonder if there is at least one book about a young Squib making his way in muggle society. Actually, I think there are probably several. There will be one rather new story that focusses on the adventures of learning a new culture, on wonder and exploration. There will be one by some older author that focusses on how "bad" muggles are, that Squib child was damaged but at least from good stock and he gets lost in their muggle ways because he never could accept his place and in the end he repents, but dies. There will be one, nearly as old as the second one which focusses on the unfair way squibs are treated (I imagine it to be somewhat of a wordy tragic story, too, Dickens style, maybe, with some funny side characters and a lot of social satire. ) It will have some things in it that to modern readers (especially modern muggle -borns) still will feel uncomfortable, but was more than fair for its day.

*** Interspecies definitely would exist! All sorts, too - the lurid ones fetishising a centaur's endowment, and sappy forbidden love type ones between members of incompatible species - perhaps a mermaid and an air breather, or large male giant and a small female of another species.

Doubt that Harry as a 11 yr. old boy would even give these a second thought, but he might overhear a few older girls giggle at them in the corner of the common room.

Oh, even better... I bet there's some older plot twist laden Dickensish story about some poor pureblood orphan that had a jealous older relative that hid his Hogwarts letter and convinced everyone he was a squib in order to steal the inheritance. It could have all the social satire about how bad squibs are treated, then end with the happy ending of finding out the truth and going wand shopping!

Harry would probably adore it, given the great lengths that his aunt & uncle went in order to try to keep him from Hogwarts.

**** Oh my god, of freaking cause the Dickensian story would have a kid who is not actually a Squib but treated as such and then get the happy ending after a lot of bad stuff! That's very "Oliver Twist" right there. - There probably is some other "too good for this world" character around, though, who dies. That just kind of happens a lot in those books. I am just trying to figure out if that one would be an actual Squib, a sick relative, or a devoted house elf (who either is devoted to his young master despite believing him to be a squib, or bound by his actuasl master to not tell the truth but trying to make the child's life as confortable as he is allowed to within his restrictions) - You know what, "wizard world fiction" sounds like it should be its own fan fic genre now. It probably would not have many readers, but I kind of love the concept of imagerning how diffrrent types of stories and authors would develope in that world. (Kind of like Neil Gaiman writing "A Study in Emerald" which is as if we had an Arthur Conan Doyle story in a world ruled by things from the Cthulhu Mythos. Yep, Gaiman is awesome and hit two birds with one stone with his fan fic.)

***** It'd be an elderly house elf, very devoted to the child and his late parents, who desperately wants to tell the child what's going on, but has been ordered not to and can't disobey until the child becomes of age and inherits.

(edit: Oh, one of the plot twists would HAVE to be that this elderly elf had a plan in place to get the child his Hogwarts letter. Sadly, the elf died mere days before the child's letter should have arrived, which is what gave the evil relative a needed distraction in order to intercept the Hogwarts letter and send an owl to decline the spot.)

I'd definitely read a "Wizard world fiction" fanfic!

This would be a fun concept for a "If On Winter's Night a Traveler" type story, where you alternate brief vignettes from Harry's POV with excerpts from the books he's reading during those scenes.

Too bad I'm such a shitty writer. I'd never be able to do the concept justice.

** Probably a lot worse quality. The magical world is tiny, so instead of one in a million best artists it's just one in a thousand.

*** To counter that, longer lives would mean more time to perfect your art. Magic could reduce your cost of living and make it easier for art to be your full-time career rather than having to make it a hobby.

But perhaps the wizard world's contemporary fiction does kind of suck in comparison to muggle contemporary fiction. Perhaps they read more classics rather than modern lit? More international/interracial fiction?

**** Magic might reduce cost of living but the much smaller population means much less sales means much less revenue. Unless books are significantly more expensive compared to typical consumables, it's much harder to make a living on writing alone. Lockhart charges several galleons per book while many other things cost single digit knut amounts (100x less) so translated to muggle economy they're about as expensive as american college textbooks, read totally overpriced.

***** Possibly - but didn't the Weasleys remark on how expensive Lockheart's books were? Though that might have just been the number of books, not the individual cost per book. It's been a while since I read that scene. But Lockheart was a self-important jerk, so overcharging sounds like him.

What about some sort of installment/subscription system like what existed back in the 18th/19th century where most novels were serialized in newspapers/magazines? Individual issues weren't too expensive and they each had parts to several stories in them, but you had to buy every single issue to get a full story. Then the proper bound books were luxury items.

And you'd have the supplemental income from advertising, too.
