In some fanfics, especially those with time-travel/redo or reincarnation SI fics, the concept that wandless/silent Legilimency, sometimes called passive Legilimency, exists and often used by Dumbledore and Snape, forcing the main character(s) to learn Occlumency and hide knowledge from their friends even when they want to share. There are places where they establish eye contact, but it could be simply to get a better read on Harry while making him uncomfortable so he has harder time hiding his secret... Was it ever established within the story that Legilimency can/was used that way?


** Probably the most relevant passage is Harry and Snape's duel in HBP. Snape says that he's able to block Harry's spells because Harry has failed to close his mind. Yet Harry does not have the subjective sensation of someone rummaging through his thoughts and memories. So yes there does seem to be a "light touch" type of legilimency which is different to full on "memory interrogation".

** Passive is the wrong word for this, but, while it's not stated outright, wandless, silent legilimency would explain how Voldemort knew Harry had the stone in his pocket. Snape may have also done this after Sectumsempra and on Draco in HBP.

*** That scene can't really establish that for quite a few reasons. IIRC, eye-contact is required for legilimency to work, and he was hidden under a turban. It could easily be that LV was good at reading most people, or that Harry wasn't the best liar. Plus, LV does have a backdoor access into Harry's mind, so whatever rules legilimency has might not apply to him.

**** Wouldn't it make sense for Voldemort to charm the turban transparent to him so that he can see what's going on? Also makes sense why Harry got a pain in his scar when looking at the turban and Snape during the sorting feast, that's when Voldemort tried to read him the first time but he got an unexpected reaction. Later Voldemort figured out how to read Harry without triggering it.

**** Not only that, but Harry felt the Stone come into his pocket. He may have shifted his weight somehow and Voldemort noticed, while Quirrel didn't.

***** No, he didn't move when it landed in his pocket and Quirrell was standing directly behind him. When Harry lies Quirrell moves away from him, but not into a position where his back is to Harry as Harry can see his lips not move when Voldemort says "he lies."

When he takes off his turban, he turns so that Voldemort could see Harry. Quirrell even walks backwards so Voldemort can see him.

Voldemort cannot see Harry to make eye contact or see body movement and he cannot look through Quirrell's eyes. He's also very unaware of that connection until the middle of OoTP and even when he knows of it he uses Legilimency (DOM scene). So, from where I'm sitting, he's either omniscient or it was legilimency.

** I don't think so. Honestly, as far as I can tell, Legilimency is an active skill, a spell. I know it can be cast silently and, theoretically, wandlessly. But it has to he an active, conscious action by the caster.

*** I feel like when discussing Legilimency, we should keep Queenie in a seperate corner of her own. Her kind of Legilimency seems unlike than the rest, not to forget, she does it all the time.

My understanding of her skill is that as an underage witch, she started to gain control over her skills, and started casting Legilimency because it was amusing to her (like how Tom Riddle gained some control and was able to use his powers for a purpose), and as years went on, she got better at it by the amount of times she used it, and by 1927, she started to use it on every person she held eye-contact with. I believe It can be blocked by Occlumency (like Grindelwald did, and Tina was shown to keep a [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Protection_Charm_Your_Mind:_A_Practical_Guide_to_Counter_Legilimensy][book]] on Occlumency as shown in the first movie - so we can assume that it can be blocked).

** It's strongly implied to be so. Snape and Voldemort are both shown to be at least tell that the person they're talking to is lying, without any spell, even a wandless one. However it seems that this kind of legilimency can only pick up surface thoughts, though this makes it unnoticeable to the person whose thoughts are read.
