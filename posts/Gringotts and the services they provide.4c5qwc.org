I read a lot of stories where the characters go to gringotts to get a heritage test, get information on magical schools, get super secret goblin rituals that normal wizards have never even heard of, find out about super powers and information about houses. A muggleborn can walk in a muggleborn and walk out a very rich Lady of a very long died out pureblood line.

It seems odd to me, I mean when Harry gets a heritage test and inherits a bunch of vaults, wouldn't his dad or his mother have inherited those first?

I don't know. Where does this idea come from? And what services does Gringotts really provide.


** Oftentimes, this is just a poorly thought out or lazy way to make a super harry or have a very AU world. As far as we know (or as I know anyway) gringotts is a bank, and only a bank.

** I think the curse breaking part is just to find more treasure for the bank, right? Or are they for hire to the average witch/wizard?

*** For the right price I would think they would allow people to hire them. Consider the curse breakers as a separate branch within the umbrella of Gringotts. Like an investment manager they can help you grow your personal wealth. For a price.

*** Its a way to find more treasure for the bank, but i do believe that yes, your average witch or wizard "could" hire Gringotts curse breakers to provide curse breaking services. But I think it has to go through Gringotts.

** In canon, gringotts doesn't do anything beyond provide secure vaults for storing money and treasure. Also they hire Charlie as a curse-breaker.

In fanon, they're either incompetent and know nothing beyond that, or they're hypercompetent, offering a wide range of services, often acting as a kind of concierge service for their richest clients (of which Harry is usually one)

** Their core competency is security, of course. You dump a pile of gold in your vault, they make sure that only the people you authorize can access it. Their cursebreaker branch is an offshoot of that: they know how to secure a treasure, and that means knowing every way that security can be defeated.

The second most obvious criterion for who can access a vault is inheritance. (The most obvious is "only the people I name", which isn't very forward-thinking and is probably a source of a lot of goblin wealth.) If you are keen to trust Gringotts with your security, you might want them to have a way to ensure that a given person is in the proper inheritance chain.

That's for someone who walks up and asks to access a specific vault without a key. (And pays a fee in advance for the privilege.) It's not for Harry finding out he's the lost heir of Merlin, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Rasputin, and Peggy Schuyler all at once and is thus heir to a fortune large enough to crush all who oppose him with the weight of the gold alone. That sort of inheritance ritual is not in the goblins' best interests, and it's unlikely they would agree to keep vaults active for centuries without payment.

Most likely, money with no owner that's located in the Gringotts vaults is split between the Ministry and Gringotts -- and the only reason the Ministry gets a cut is due to past goblin rebellions.

I tend to prefer depictions of goblins as technically honest but unhelpful and usurious.

** If you need /somewhere/ to do these things for the story to move forward, there's not really much choice. JK gave us a very limited world, so you can either 1- make up a place or 2. repurpose one that already exists.

Not saying that I partcularly like that trope, because I really don't, but I can understand it.

...what? I mean, okay. I'll admit that there is not as much explained about it in the books as I would have liked but the HP universe is literally our universe and then some. And even within the limitations of what we know about canon, there have to be better options then making the bank run by a different species do things like wizarding heritage tests. That's what we have a ministry of magic for. (And let's not even talk about weirdly specific rituals to remove powerful spells and/or Horcruxes from a person.) Especially if it's just "Drop some bloodinto this bowl and that's it."

I think most people do it because a) it's a trope by now and sticking to trope is what fandoms do best, sadly. And b) Gringotts is conveniently right there in Diagon Alley where wizards hang out all the time, especially Hogwarts students before the term starts. Making up an excuse for character x to be at Gringotts is laughably easy.

Basically I think it's a lazy and at times rediculous way to get a story rolling but I don't mind that much if the rest of the story is interesting.

** You are thinking too much :) Just enjoy the stories. Besides, there are ways to explain things like Harry inheriting things while his parents didnt.

For example, perhaps not everyone has to have an inheritance test (as long as you have a key to your vault). In general it would only happen if there is a dispute or someone wants more information. So Harry's parents and grandparents and so on, may have been ignorant of their history.

As for what Gringotts really provides... all we have to go by is the very limited information in the books/lore. Thats why often people give Gringotts other powers and jobs in Fan Fiction, because its implied that Gringotts and Goblins are very powerful in the magical world. So much so that wizards/witches somewhat fear them.

Gringotts:

- Exchanges money
- Stores artifacts and money
- Provides curse breaking
- Provides money/affairs/property management services
- Provides a loose sort of... "stock market" style of system
- Provides identity verification (to some degree)
- Sponsors events in the wizarding world

Keep in mind that Gringotts and Goblins operate a commodity based system, and its my understanding that they do not pay any interest on money stored in their vaults.

They do however help you earn more money with your money via business ventures, investments, and other similar things. Point is, you earning more money, means they earn more money from you in payment for their services, as well as more money stored in the vaults which "could" be theirs one day based upon the restrictions on the vault as well as your current condition (alive/dead/incapacitated) and heir situation.

Also remember that there is a flow of money between Gringotts and the Muggle world (part of why they provide exchange services), meaning one could earn interest in the muggle world of banks, if wanted.

*** "Cursebreaker for Gringott's, in Egypt", wink-wink, nudge-nudge, know what I mean know what I mean?

From what we've seen in HP canon about curses and the breaking thereof this job title might as well be an euphemism for mercenaries in the internal power struggles between the various goblin clans or professional thieves, excuse me, "security specialists" recovering valuables after hostile takeovers.

** Since canon is open-ended, Gingotts can basically be anything as long as it is in addition to being a bank.

As for Harry's parents having inherited the vaults, etc. first, not necessarily. Considering they died during a war in which presumably many others could have, then those vaults could only have lost their heirs between the last time the Potters Sr entered Gringotts and Harry's first trip.

I personally imagine Gringotts to be a bank and little more. They provide deposit, investment, and loan options. Cursebreakers function as developing and maintaining the security of their premises and vaults. Additionally, they are sent out to recover valuables from tombs/ruins, functioning as a method of investment--think mining rights.
