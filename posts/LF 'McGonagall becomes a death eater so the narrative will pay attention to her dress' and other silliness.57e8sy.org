To clarify: A long time ago while I was on holiday, I ran into the silliest of silly fics. There was zero fourth wall in it; in the first chapter, the characters openly chatted about their scripted lines, Ron and Draco complained about being bashed, Padma complained about the harem plot...I think.

To be honest, I don't remember the specifics. However, I do remember, /possibly/ in chapter 3, that Professor McGonagall shows up, and announces that she's joined the Death Eaters; when the narrative starts describing her new outfit, she explains how she's sick and tired of picking out her wardrobe every day only for the author/writer/etc to never pay any attention, hence why she joins the dark side so that the narrative actually describes her change to 'evil' clothes.

Does anyone know the scene and fic that I'm thinking of?

Addendum: Euthoniel got it!

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

** Hmm...you know, short as it is, this story does skewer a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction cliches.

Does anyone want to talk about the cliches brought up in Potter Ever After? Is there any particular protocol for converting a Request thread into a Discussion thread?
