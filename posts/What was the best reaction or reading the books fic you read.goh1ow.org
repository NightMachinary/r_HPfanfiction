I would love to read such just because but they're all usually deleted quite quickly. Oh well. Personally I'd like a reaction fic of all seven books.

** For what it's worth, this should be flaired as “Request”, not “Prompt.” Prompt flairs are for story ideas to encourage others to write. “Request” is for making general requests for fanfics that already exist meeting desired criteria.

Also, I made a very similar request you can find [[https://reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gmlzku/for_the_love_of_meta_humor_story_reactions/][*here*]] that already has a few suggestions
