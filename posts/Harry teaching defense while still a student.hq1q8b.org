** I actually have something I want to write along these lines but I'm always way too busy w/ school or family stuff

Basically dumbledore sees the way tides are turning at the end of year 4, he has harry sit his defense OWL (among others but that is the only one where he does well, some others he fails and some he barely passes), after this he hires harry at the last minute as DADA teacher to avoid being forced to instate Umbridge

Unfortunately I had this idea over a year ago and I haven't gotten past a few preliminary notes like this one

**** It /could/ be a good read, it would be the first fic I ever wrote so no guarantees of quality. At any rate I don't see myself having time to invest in it for at least another few months
