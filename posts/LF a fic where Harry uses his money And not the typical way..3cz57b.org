** linkffn(Oh God, Not Again! by Sarah1281)

It's fairly famous so you may already know about it, but if not, it's a pretty well done parody where Harry gets sent back in time. He actually uses his money this time around on things like bribing various officials and reporters, investing in the Quibbler, buying awesome gifts for his friends, andinvesting in Fred and George's business. He also constantly finds ways to make more money like working with Lockhart on a book, carrying around signed photos, and offering to translate conversations with snakes.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.

** So, I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5333171/46/The-Weapon-Revised][The Weapon Revised]] at the moment, and once you get past the first part where Harry is behaving increasingly obsessive, the story is actually quite good and (now to the relevant part) Harry is using his money to further his goals in the war (build an army etc.).

**** Moody stays crazy but doesn't get much screen time later on. (Though he stays part of the story). Also, he might not be the canon Moody, but at least the characterisatoin is consistent throughout the story. That's always a plus in my book. I was far more annoyed by Harry's never ending inner monologue in the first part of the story. While all of that is necessary for the plot, I think the story only really starts getting good after [[/spoiler][Harry's stint in the hospital wing. When his craziness calms down a bit.]]
