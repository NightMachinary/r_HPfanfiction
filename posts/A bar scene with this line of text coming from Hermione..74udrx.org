** Hermione, working in her uncle's pub to help him out after he broke his ankle---and after a suitable bribe of money to buy books---had finally been driven to her limits by the chavs at most a year older than her and all with toddlers she had been serving all morning. "It's Mi-MO-sa, not Mi-mo-SA!"

“... And then the waiter couldn't even tell me what was in the Russian caravan! He told me it ‘tasted like Russia.' What the hell does that even mean!?” Hermione took another large swig from her collins glass. “I assumed it was a blend with some Lapsang Souchong, maybe some Assam, but why do they hire people who don't even know what they're serving?”

Ron's eyes were glazed over, but he suddenly leapt from his seat and shouted, “Over here!”

Harry and Ginny had just arrived at the pub; Ron walked briskly over to Harry. “Fair warning, mate, but she's gone mental tonight again,” Ron whispered. "I thought some alcohol in her would help, but I think it made it worse. I don't know what the bloody hell she's been talking about for the past twenty minutes. Apparently she went to cream tea with Luna a couple days ago and can't stop bitching about it.”

Harry sighed. “The drink nomenclature rant again? I thought she'd be over it by now. What did you do, Ron?”

“Nothing,” he replied, a bit sheepishly. “Aw, hell... I might have ordered a chocolate martini.”

Ginny's eyes went wide. “You /know/ she hates that!---All those drinks that have basically nothing in common with an actual martini other than the shape of the glass. No wonder she had a fit.” Ginny gave Ron a shove on his chest. “And since when do you drink such girly drinks, Ron?”

“I just thought I'd get something different to try for once. I didn't know it would set her off....”

The three hesitantly approached the table. Harry put a hand on Hermione's shoulder. “You okay?”

Hermione slowly exhaled before looking up at Harry. “I'm fine, Harry. I assume Ron already filled you in. That waiter was so awful, though.” Her speech was slightly slurred, and she gulped down the rest of her drink. “I mean, he asked if I wanted a herbal /tea/, Harry! A /herbal TEA/!”

Ron and Ginny glanced at each other, then both gave a look to Harry, who sighed again. He knew he was the one to talk her down from this. Harry sat down and took her hand in both of his. “I think you might want to slow down with those drinks.” Hermione scowled at him. “Okay, okay. Listen, all three of us know that most herbal, er... drinks don't actually have tea in them. They're tisanes or herbal /infusions/.” He articulated the last word clearly, in a deliberate calming tone.

“Infusions,” Hermione repeated. She looked at Harry and a relieved smile broke out on her face. “Thank you, Harry. I'm glad you're finally here; you always know how to cheer me up.” Without warning, she set about snogging Harry heavily, ramming her tongue around in his mouth. Finally she pulled back, eyes closed, and let out a contented sigh. Then her brow furrowed a bit, as she appeared deep in thought.

Harry was flustered as his cheeks reddened for a moment, but then he just shrugged. Their red-haired companions finally sat down. A bewildered look was on Ron's face as he leaned over to Harry. “You know, if you keep doing stuff like that, people are going to think something's going on with you two.”

Hermione finally opened her eyes and stared at Harry. “You... you taste like pumpkin pie.”

Harry rolled his eyes. “And you taste of orange vodka. But yes, as always, you figured it out.”

“You went to Mike's? You went to my favorite pastry shop without me?” Hermione looked a bit hurt.

“You know, you could always just ask me where I was, or what I had for lunch, or who I was snogging. I'd tell you.” Harry was shaking his head at Hermione. “This is a bit ridiculous you know, even for us.”

But Hermione had already pulled out her parchment and quill and was rapidly making notes. She seemed to instantly sober up from her earlier state. “Duration of kiss: approximately twelve seconds. Lingual examination of incisors displayed hints of vanilla and cinnamon, particularly on vestibular surfaces. Strong hint of pumpkin with custard texture throughout the oral cavity.” She finally looked back to Harry. “It was some sort of crushed crust wasn't it? Digestive biscuits, perhaps?”

“Yes.” Harry couldn't help a smile. “You're unbelievable.”

She took down some more notes, muttering, “Hmm... unusual pie style. How very American.”

Ron finally interrupted. “What the bloody hell is going on?”

Hermione shot a glare at Ron. “There's no need to be snippy. It's just research.”

“Research? Again?” Ron cried in disbelief.

Harry put up his hand. “Ron, you know Hermione gets these projects from time to time. First it was those kissing experiments with me at Hogwarts. Then she wanted to test the sensitivity of various parts of the male anatomy.” At that, Harry put his hand on Hermione's and smiled a bit. She grinned back at Harry and leaned into his side. “Lately, she convinced me to participate in this study on---what did you call it?”

“Osculatory investigative techniques,” Hermione pronounced.

“Yeah, I don't know what it's all about. But apparently it might help us out in the Auror Department. Hermione is convinced that if we have to go undercover and end up snogging someone, it could help crack a case.” Hermione's cheeks turned slightly pink, though it was obscured a bit by the rosiness from her inebriated state.

“Is she now?” Ron's head slowly shook as his eyes shifted back and forth between them. “I give up. You two are both completely mental.”

Harry turned to Hermione and said in a slightly sing-song tone, “You know, we might be making someone a bit jealous.”

Hermione glanced to Ginny, whose eyes were shooting daggers, then smiled back at Harry. “You let me worry about that.” Then she set about snogging Harry again until they were both left breathless and flushed. Both Ron and Ginny looked on, mouths agape.

“What the...?” Harry sputtered.

“Just needed to check. I suspect Mike has added some nutmeg into his recipe.”

Harry wiped his swollen lips with the back of his hand. “Yeah, I thought so too. But was that really necessary?”

“What do you expect? You went to my favorite shop, so I guess I need to have a taste this way.” She smiled mischievously at Harry. “Besides, I'm always thorough in my research.” Harry felt her hand creep along his thigh, causing him to jump.

Ginny coughed loudly, while retrieving a small box from her bag. “We did bring you a slice, though it seems you already had more than your share.”

Hermione's eyes brightened as she leaned over and gave Ginny a lingering sloppy kiss on the cheek. "You're so sweet.” Ginny's eyes narrowed.

The waiter happened to show up the next instant. “Can I get anyone a drink?”

“YES!” the two men nearly shouted together. Harry nodded for Ron to go first. “I don't know. I saw something advertised out there. How about a mimosa?”

Harry and Ginny gasped, as the waiter hastily retreated from the table. Hermione's face grew tense, before she blurted out, “RONALD BILIUS WEASLEY! I'm not even going to talk about the absurd concept of ordering a mimo-SA outside of brunch. Even if there were such a drink as a mimo-SA! It's mi-MO-sa, not mi-mo-SA.” Not sure her point was getting across, she climbed atop the table before Harry could grab her. She put two fingers in her mouth and sounded a loud whistle. “EVERYONE SAY IT WITH ME!” The pub patrons made a collective eyeroll, but they all knew it was pointless to argue with a drunken Hermione Granger. “Mi-MO-sa!”

“Mi-MO-sa!” they all replied in unison, holding up their glasses.

Hermione staggered down with Harry's assistance and smoothed her clothes, before falling onto Harry's lap. “Wherever did you get such a silly idea, Ron?”

“It was on the sign outside, advertising happy hour.”

Hermione rolled her eyes, before noticing the waiter approaching the table again with trepidation. “There are plenty of more appropriate drinks to order for happy hour if you want something a bit sweet and fizzy, even in the orange variety.” She held up her empty glass and looked over the waiter. “I'll have anoth---“

Ginny grabbed Hermione's arm and cut her off. “Dear, I think it's about time we get you home. You've bothered Harry quite enough for one evening.”

Hermione wiggled her hips and smirked, gazing intently into Harry's eyes, wrapping both arms around his shoulders. “Ooh... I think he's just beginning to be bothered...” Harry, for some reason, couldn't look away from her, the phrase /chocolate orbs/ strangely echoing in his brain.

Ginny finally managed to tug Hermione up, giving her a quick peck on the lips. Hermione closed her eyes and took a deep breath, before a closed-mouth smile emerged.

“Wait,” said Ron, “so what was your sweet fizzy drink again?”

“Orange crush,” Hermione replied dreamily. “Such a better way to end the evening...”

“But... but that was always my drink!” Harry objected.

“We could always share one, Harry,” Hermione replied huskily, glancing over at Ginny.

“Hermione!” Ginny blushed, before whispering in her ear, “We were going to talk about that first! And you're in no bloody state to...” Ginny looked up to see Harry and her brother staring at them. “Anyhow, we'll see you later, boys.” She wrapped an arm around a now slightly sleepy Hermione and guided her out the door.

The two men ordered another round before Ron turned to Harry. “Okay, out with it, mate. What's going on with you and Hermione?”

“What do you mean?” Harry's eyes grew wide. “OH! No, Ron. We're just best friends. You know that. Besides, I'm not even sure if she swings that way anymore...”

Ron shook his head, wondering whether it was possible for anyone to be so dense. But his thoughts were interrupted by the vision of Hermione bursting back through the door, chased by Ginny.

“First they advertise mi-MO-sas for happy hour,” Hermione muttered, before shouting aloud, “Happy ‘hour' for FOUR bloody hours!? How the hell can an ‘hour' last for four hours, or even all night on Mondays? What does that even mean? Where's that moronic manager again? I'll need to reintroduce him to a dictionary. Sam? SAM!?”
