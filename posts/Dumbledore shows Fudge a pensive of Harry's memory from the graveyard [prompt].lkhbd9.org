How does this change the last three books?


** He will probably claim memories cant be tampered with, and that Harry's wouldn't count since he is a minor who could have been confused or something. Honestly Fudge would have refused the truth even if he SAW Voldemort. The only reason he seemed to accept it in the end of Ootp is because it literally was in the middle of the ministry with so many witnesses. I doubt the public would have sided with Harry either, since they all feared Voldemort they'd rather believe him dead.

** This is a great "What if," but honestly, I don't think it will change much, considering how well he reacted to Sirus' innocence. He'll still try to deny Voldemort's return no matter what Dumbledore does.

** Basically, the question is what would the rest of the story look like if Fudge has been persuaded that Voldemort truly returned (by whatever means available).

There is “The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14078862), where it happens, but it doesn't turn that well.

Also, I like “A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool (Rachel500)” linkao3(1085412), where Fudge is coerced into collaboration, and then helps (together with Dumbledore) as expert politicians in the team which tears down Voldemort.

Another alternative would be the functional equivalent of all those Harmony stories, where Madam Bones becomes the Minister of Magic and fights Voldemort. It could very well be Fudge himself instead.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

  Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Probably makes up some rationalisation as to why Harry is lying/mistaken.

What forced Fudge to accept it at the end of OOTP wasn't that he saw Voldemort with his own eyes, it was that Voldemort was seen in public by multiple trustworthy ministry officials. If OOTP had ended with just Fudge witnessing Voldemort and Dumbledore's fight then Fudge would be right back to calling Dumbledore and Harry liars when he'd calmed down the next morning.
