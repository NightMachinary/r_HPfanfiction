  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) The runes professor becomes his legal guardian.

It's also a bit of a trope in WBWL for a divorced Lily to wind up as the Muggle Studies prof.
