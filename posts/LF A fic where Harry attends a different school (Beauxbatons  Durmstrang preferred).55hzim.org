Bonus points if it's WBWL or Not-BWL


** Aside from the obvious linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) I don't know of very many GOOD stories where Harry goes to one of the other schools.

Here's a FFN community for those kinds of stories though, if you want to brave it out. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Beauxbatons-Durmstrang/83372/]]

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
