I've been nervous to make this post, due to the fear of getting lambasted into the hellish region called down-votes.

However, with the sub's recent fight against homophobia, I've gathered up enough courage.

So, hit me with your best Harry/Ron. Can be short, can be long, can be fluff, can be carnal, just anything.

  In which Ron realizes that maybe, just maybe, you aren't supposed to feel this way about your best mate. But only after a dance at the Yule Ball, months of being busy with other things, Cedric Diggory's death, the return of Voldemort, and a quiet knock at his door.

*** I didn't even know this was a problem. The HP fanfiction community in general has plenty of slash, must just be sort of this sub and how they embrace (don't embrace) slash recommendations?

I used to be into hetero smut like 7-8 years ago but hetero or slash I'm just not too into it being a big part of the stories I read anymore. Maybe one of my internal biases is that when I see something described as slash I instantly think it's a gay smut story. If there's a gay relationship in a good story I'm cool with it.

** Finally a pairing that is believable. At least a little. I could see Harry/Ron pairing if both of them were bi or gay. I'm not homophobic so I'm not gonna downvote you but I'm not getting the pairing Harry with other males. I don't have a problem with Slash which is one of the genres that I read if it is good but HP community pairs Harry with the unlikeliest people. Just yesterday I saw someone pairing Harry with Voldemort. Aside from the gut wrenching feeling of reading someone pairing 70+ plus serial killer magical terrorist with the child of the couple he has personally killed, Harry doesn't feel like a bi or gay to me. When I'm reading Hp slash fic, it feels like the Harry is turned into a meatsuit of the author. Don't get me started on Snape/Harry pairings. It feels way creepier than the Voldemort one and even that feels extremely wrong to me.

*** .... Wow. I don't agree with Snarry, Drarry, or Tomarry (First and third due to age, Drarry because.... Harry and Draco).

People who make posts like this do have to have some fear of backlash though. Slash fics get some horribly worded reviews, and while Reddit is far, far better, it isn't a guarantee of avoiding homophobia.

I understand that you may be frustrated, but you have my word that I am not aiming for a circlejerk post nor a karma farming post. The last couple of posts in the sub simply helped me to give this request without fearing backlash.

And last of all, thanks for the recommendation :) Cheers :)

** "However, with the sub's recent fight against homophobia" The purported fight was people whining about "muh homophobia" due to being downvoted on subjects of slash. Bringing it up means you support at least tacitly the agenda of blaming some type of bigotry for the downvotes. Pretending to be a victim while being a cheap and easy way of getting immediate support is harmful in the long run as most people tend to recognize the manipulation. That is what all "the community is toxic because it doesn't pander to me" posts are.
