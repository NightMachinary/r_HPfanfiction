Hi readers and writers,

I've been working on this infrequently for some time. The chapters remaining to be published only need to go through a last round of editing before I'll post them, so this story won't remain in progress for very long.

I always like bettering my writing, so criticism would be wonderful. Thank you in advance.

"Death Eater Leta Watkins has been ordered to manipulate Hermione Granger towards the dark side, so she'll be able to mislead Harry Potter, and the Dark Lord will finally be able to kill him. (full summary inside) AU / Canon divergence ; Hermione/OC ; F/F"


** My first bit of criticism would revolve around the character of Leta. She seems a bit bland, to be honest. That may be a premature statement, but the 4 chapters I read so far didn't make me care for her even one bit. If there is more to her character, I think there should be evidence of that sooner - first chapter ideally. Right now shes a very smooth character with no edges or even blemishes. Sure, intellectually the reader knows she is a Death Eater and therefore scum, but if you remove that she is just some woman who is homosexual... full stop. Everything that (I think) is supposed to make her character is told to us, not shown to us. We are told she was abused by her mother. We are told she is a great negotiator.

Hermione suffers from the same "broken and submissive" syndrome she always tends to suffer from in these Hermione/Death Eater stories. Its just not believable that Hermione wouldn't fight for every inch in this situation. There are certain things Hermione takes pride in to a degree of unshakable devotion to those principles. Her interaction with Leta should be best described by Immovable Object meets Unstoppable Force. Hermione should constantly look to escape, take Leta's wand, make a run for it... not just give up after one token effort.

And if she was already beaten into submission, she should be broken -depressed, short spoken, tired and indifferent - and not schoolgirly shy/meek.

And the speed with which the relationship moves is just way too fast. We're not even done processing that Hermione doesn't rebel against her warden, when we're confronted with the fact that they kissed.

I skipped over the next 2 chapters. This is definitely not for me. As for a final criticism: Rethink the characters, especially Hermione. Show us more of their character and don't just tell us. Slow down... a lot.

*** Thank you for your time, I appreciate it!

I will most definitely consider these comments, and rewrite when I have the time. Now that you have spelled it out like this, I must say, I agree the characters' psychologies are far from being on point, so I will certainly work on that.

I was already aware the plot is moving too fast, and I had already planned on adding scenes, so thank you for the suggestion of adding "show don't tell": it gives me material for elaboration, along with making the story more realistic. I am too used to writing flash fiction, so this will be a nice challenge.

Thanks again for the honesty. Have a great day!
