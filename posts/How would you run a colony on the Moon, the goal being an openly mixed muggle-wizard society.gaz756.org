Let's say this colony is 20 000 km², with a roughly 2.5 million people. This resembles the region that I live in, very roomy, not very densely populated, mostly agricultural. The whole thing could basically be a giant hydroponic plant under an enchanted roof à la Hogwarts Great Hall (with extra magic to shield from cosmic rays).

Assume that somehow this happened: a group of wizards and muggles got together, found a way to the Moon, and got building. The initial journey will probably have involved some difficult melding of magic and technology, but once that is done, a skeleton outpost is set up with a stable portkey link back and forth from Earth. It becomes possible now to discreetly Fidelius the spot and build up a new base.

If all goes well, after a while, there's a habitable environment where you can grow crops and raise animals, and generally build a life for yourself. Some wizarding and muggle families come along via word-of-mouth invitation, and eventually there's a whole separate, self-sufficient society minding its own business on the Moon.

How do you run such a place? Like, how would the conomy work? What sort of government might it have? Would it even have one except some sort of reserve war council to prepare against possible invasion attempts from Earth?

Only I have a faint suspicion that the whole thing might turn into what is described in E. F. Russel's /...And then there were none/ ( [[https://www.abelard.org/e-f-russell.php]] )

Do you know any fics that tackle this sort of question, of independent mixed-magical communities?


** If you can go to the moon with magic, going to Mars is just as easy as it only requires more energy but with magic that doesn't matter. Mars has better gravity and a 25 hour day. Changing the length of a day is much harder than just flying a little further.

So my moon colony would be on Mars instead. Or on an exoplanet far, far away if it's supposed to stay hidden from muggles for the next few centuries.

** Not quite what you asked for, but I'd recommend linkao3(209494).

It might not be your cup of tea, as it's Voldemort/MOD!Harry but it's not about romance iirc but more about MOD!Harry coming from a future where muggles killed the magical community, so they decide to move the magicals to the moon and hide them from non-magicals. It was a really intriguing plot and included a lot of technical details you mentioned in your post and it's really well-written, too.

  Harry's world ends at the hands of those he'd once fought to save. An adult-Harry goes back to his younger self fic. Semi-super!Harry
