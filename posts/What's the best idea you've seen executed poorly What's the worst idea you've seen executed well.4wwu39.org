linkffn(8186071). Harry Crow. I'd /really/ like to read a story about a goblin-raised Harry where the tiny creatures who run Gringotts aren't predictable plot devices.

#+begin_quote
  Worst idea you've seen done well?
#+end_quote

'Lazy Harry' sounds like an awful idea. Protagonists who aren't motivated to do anything have the potential to be quite boring. How on earth could a character who spends most of their time asleep ever find the opportunity to have entertaining adventures?

But Harry the Hufflepuff linkffn(6466185) does a great job convincing the reader that a lazy Harry has a lot of potential. It's hilarious from start to finish.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power]]) doesn't really fit the request, but the end was so disappointing that I'm tempted to consider this fic a excellent idea with a poor ending. I mean it still works, but after one of the best "conpiracy"/evil ministry fic, and certainly one of the few unbreakable vows magical contacts fic that actually works, the ending was really not up to the task.

My memory is that they mainly bound up and pacified them, rather than using them as weapons. Am I misremembering? However, the enforced mediocrity did make the Ministry corrupt and sclerotic.

That said, the pen /should/ be mightier than the sword in a civilized society, and it was the best they could do.

Without the power birth lottery, there is no fic, though. It's right there in the title. If power could be gained through learning and practice, Hermione would have All the Power in their year, and the fic would have to be about her. :D More seriously, power would be far more equally distributed, so there wouldn't be a need to bind people in convoluted ways.

To adopt the premise of the fic to the canon model, where knowledge, practice, and emotional disposition drive magical ability, the society would have to bind the most intelligent and driven, because those would be the best predictors of future magical power... Actually, that would make for a pretty good Idiocracy-style comedy fic, where everybody pretends to be stupider and less ambitious than they are, lest everyone gang up on them and bind them.

Powers would not necessarily be more equally distributed. Not everyone would have the drive needed to become really powerful. Not to mention the financial worth and networks, especially if anything advance is either kept hidden by a few corporations or labeled dark by the ministry and thus forbidden. Which means every powerful wizards would be de facto a criminal. Though it would be difficult to prove.

It seems indeed difficult to fix that story. But except the end, I like it. Powerful people being targeted because of that by corrupted and weak government officials sits well with me I believe.

Nah. It's the Slytherins and the Gryffindors you need to watch for. If you focus on Ravenclaws, you'll miss people like Dumbledore and Hermione. Ravenclaws don't have the drive to actually put in the work to become dangerous, nor to actually use what power they do have. In fact, Gryffindors are the most dangerous, because Slytherins can usually be bought off, while Gryffindors will try to fix the world, whether the world wants it or not.

#+end_quote

Yes and no. The factors that affect magical ability (general intelligence, investment of time and effort, and emotional disposition) feed on each other in a virtuous cycle, so there would, in fact, be a long-tailed distribution of capabilities. However, rather than being distributed essentially at random, they would be correlated with things like diligence and wisdom, and develop gradually, which would make them less disruptive. And, if nothing else, if the powerful ones messed up enough and destroyed the fabric of society and what social safety nets there are, /everybody/ would have to work hard to survive, and so enough of those those intelligent-but-lazy Ravenclaw types would arise to match and overthrow them.

I can see the appeal. Perhaps /Atlas Shrugged/ and /Harrison Bergeron/ strike a similar chord? On the other hand, with whom should one choose to identify in that story? Here's my answer (a repost of myself from another forum).

Roll 5d6. If you got all 6s, then congratulations, you won the genetic lottery and get to be one of the Powerful. Otherwise, someone else got the Power, and it's only somewhat correlated with their general intelligence, and is completely orthogonal to empathy and humility; and even then, power corrupts. So, you should hope that nobody who won the die roll takes a disliking to you or yours, and that you and yours manage to avoid becoming cannon fodder or collateral damage when some of those who won the die roll take a disliking to each other and go to war. (History shows that three out of the four Powerful wizards of the 20th century that we know about did exactly that.)

That fourth wizard, who didn't try to take over the world? He just indiscriminately crippled the closest thing to a police force the wizarding world has, and that force was in charge of punishing common crime, preserving the Statute of Secrecy, and protecting Muggles from abuse and exploitation. Roll 5d6. Unless you got all 6s, you're a Muggle. Have fun.

********* I don't disagree with that. Just saying, as a story, it's just so much more cool. If I had to actually live there, that would be another thing entirely.

One thought though, which is the more dangerous to you, an bunch of extremely powerful wizards that mostly keep things among themselves (and are, to you, something like a natural disaster if you cross their road at the wrong time) or a curious government that seek to control everything (and has unbreakable magical oaths to enforce it)?

It's not an easy question by any mean.

I think, personally, I would prefer the solution that doesn't requires me to take mandatory oaths. Even if it means I would have to be careful not to offend the wrong San Goku-like wizard. But then again I'm not there so...

Thanks for the link, gonna check this later.

No need to apologize for spelling or grammar mistakes. English's not my natural language so I'm sure my comments are a pain to read.

I can agree with what you say about the Ravenclaws but remember that there's the truth and then there's people's misconceptions. A lot of people would equate intelligence and power anyway, so I still think it would be a bad move to be sorted there. In Hufflepuff it would be hazardous at best to keep your true power hidden, since everybody pays so much attention to everybody else. I would keep an eye on the Slytherins, cause although you're right about a lot of them being for sale, some might be ambitious enough to be dangerous, and they certainly have the brains and mindset to understand the way the system works and how to exploit it, ignore it or even charge it. Which is where the Griffindors are leaving (even if they got the brains, there's no way they got the mindset).

But what would be very dangerous would be a small group of talented people from all four houses. Could make for an interesting fic. Something like "let's make or own conspiracy to fight against their own conspiracy".

Just remember one thing from power is power that really bugs me, a line of dialogue that went something like "Don't change magic, change the people". Can't read that and not see Hitler's and Stalin's ghosts over it...

I was being a bit facetious. Of course, all houses have potential for mischief. That said, don't sell Gryffindors short. Heck, in the fic, Harry and Sirius screwed the Ministry over in a way that Voldemort never could.

That seems like it would more than quadruple the chances of the conspiracy being uncovered. It's easy enough for two people who eat, study, and sleep in the same places and at the same time together to meet and work in secret. Then, again, there's DA and the Protean Charm...

How about Harry and the Dark Lord working together to move the entire wizarding population of the world to the /MOON/! Sounds like a total crack fic, but it was completely awesome! Linkffn(Xerosis by Batsutousai) Side note, the descriptions says it's a slash fic, but it's not from what I remember. Flirting and I think one drunken kiss was as far as it went, so don't let that scare you off.

***** I just read the first chapter and it does seem very flat, it is written exclusively in passive voice, and it reads like fanfiction.

Not sure whether that qualifies as crappy, but compared to pieces of fiction that are professionally written, this is not as good.

****** The plot of Xerosis is better than its writing technique. There were some issues with characterization that made me quit a recent re-read, but I'm a sucker for time travel fics and witty banter, so the first time was fairly enjoyable.

Out of curiosity, have you found many fanfics that are on par with professionally written fiction? Truly well-written fanfic are ridiculously difficult to find, even through I've been aggressively searching for years. I'd love to hear any recs if you have any.

******* There are two main issues with fan fiction writing that seem to categorically separate it from professionally written books and stories, neither of which are damningly indicative of the writer's skill and both of which are the same thing: editing

Having a professional editor is more than a spell check and is almost entirely absent perhaps even anathema to fanfiction. It's multifaceted but simple, a "real" editor is an important part of the clean and quality prose that authors create.

More importantly is a personal edit, a second and third draft, a rewrite and another. No Fanfic authors spend, probably because they can't afford to and understandably if they simply don't want to, the amount of time necessary to hone a piece of writing to a well oiled machine of prose and a dialogue and description.

Even the best longer fics fail regularly at being well written, because their authors can't care enough or, especially in the case of young authors with lots of time, don't have the experience to really dissect and rebuild all suspect components of a piece.

A short answer is simple, do you mistake any fan fiction for even just well written genre fiction from a quality author, much less honest to God literature? Well me neither.

I too look around for good fics, and if you've been aggressively searching for years, then my passively searching for years probably hasn't uncovered anything new. I would point out that some of the one-shot and short fiction, most of which I've found through DLP, has the best chance of actually being well written, and furthermore as certain individuals in the fandom have gotten older and gained some experience there appear to be more really well written fics coming out.

Of course that has again dwindled these last few years, but equally have my taste changed. Personally, I think the overall quality of fan fiction has improved even if the quantity being produced has dwindled dramatically.

As true today as it has been since before OOTP, if you want a great piece of writing in hpfanfiction, you'll probably need to do it yourself. Great stories and ideas abound, sometime with execution that borders on 'great' but I've yet to mistake swimdraconian for Cormac McCarthy, or 'insert author here' for Pratchett either.

And that's not even considering objectively the merits of plot, or underlying meanings and thematic elements, or philosophy and moralisms. Just the quality of the written words.

All that said, I mostly come here to find fic rec's to wile away some time here and there, so I doubt I've found anything you haven't. I've just read a lot of fan fiction, and what I wouldn't call almost any of it is well written. Except for all those exceptions.

******** This is a perfect example of a young author or an author with less time than his/her inspiration is worth. Currently enjoying "Hearts in Detours" and it reads like a college kid is writing it. It is unpolished, by turns brutish and clever, drought with underdeveloped prose and sophomoric mentality.

While it is great for fan fiction, it smacks of fan fiction. Errors, both grammatical and thematical, questionable turns of phrase, ill wrought cliche inversions.

I am not turned off at all, but this is how a young person writes, how a lay person writes, surely the output of a reader, even a thoughtful reader, but it is quite obviously amateur.

It is worthy of enjoyment, the author is clever, the plot has its merits, and the execution is interesting, but the writing is fan fiction through and through. It's cheesy. It's underwhelming. It's not the work of a professional, but only as it stands. This could easily be transformed into a worthwhile piece, but it lacks polish. This author may find a career as a successful writer, but this piece (Hearts...) is not considered enough, not formatted well enough, not dissected thoroughly enough to merit that success.

Tldr: Still lacks editing. Stilted prose, plodding exposition, muddled mentality, tons of fun. Fanfiction. Also, sincerely, thanks for the rec, this is quality fanfic.

********** Just about finished Hearts on Detours and it is simply not polished enough to seem professional. It's not the author's intellect or talent that is so glaringly amateur, it's the editing. It is fun and fanciful and worth the time to me. But it doesn't come off as professional because it isn't meticulously edited.

There has been a decline in the quality of genre fiction editing in the last ten or twenty years so comparing it to self-published works or the Sookie Stackhouse books it is similar but comparing it to old spy novels or science fiction (pulp genre fiction ie) it is not on the level.

** I know this is a subreddit for discussion of Harry Potter fan fiction, but the worst idea I've seen done right honour would have to go to a Team Fortress 2 fanfic: Eight Mercenaries and a Toddler. The RED Scout gets turned into a toddler in a respawn accident and the rest of team has to take care of and hide him from the Administrator and the BLUs while trying to figure out how to turn him back. Starts out stupid, then gets hilarious, then gets really serious when it starts to explore the Spy's background. The sequels are equally amazing. linkffn(8302553).

  When Respawn malfunctions and their annoying Scout is turned into something far more precocious, it'll take all of the RED team's wits and patience to look after him. At the same time, Engineer must find a way to turn Scout back into an adult before the BLUs-or anyone else-realizes what's happened. No pairings, just a bunch of exhausted trained killers and one hyperactive child.
