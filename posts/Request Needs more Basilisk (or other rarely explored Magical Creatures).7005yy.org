So, I'm looking for good stories that include the Chamber Basilisk as an influential character. Now, I know that it was such in Chamber of Secrets, but I enjoy the stories where we see it interact with the MC on a much more frequent base. I would like recommendations for stories that use the Basilisk in unique ways, atypical to the canon.

Also would enjoy similar stories involving other rarely used Magical Creatures. (i.e. Phoenix, Griffin, Acromantula, Sea Serpent, Hippogriff, Dragon, etc.)

*** I second this. It was a good one-shot. Wish it was a multi-parter though.

*** I would like it if they weren't entirely background characters or minor plot devices. I don't want a story where Harry or whoever gets some amazing animal companion that is never mentioned after that chapter. I would like them to have a semi to major role in the story.

#+begin_quote
  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, and spells are learned or created... (Canon-compliant except for the aforementioned tweak in lineage.)
