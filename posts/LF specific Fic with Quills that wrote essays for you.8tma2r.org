It wasn't Harry the Hufflepuff, but there was another one. He wrote Bullet points, and the quill basically did the essay for him, and he made it by taping several different types of quill together. I can't remember the rest of the fic, but I think it was interesting at least.


** I remember the story aswell, but I am not sure if it was linkffn(3885086) or the Harry is a Hufflepuff fics linkffn(6466185)He also started to sell the "rights" to one of his Housemates, if I remember correctly.

Dang, now I want to read it too =/

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
