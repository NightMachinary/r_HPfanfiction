It's one thing I don't read too much, every now and then I'll see a Harry who plays a single prank and that's it. But never a prankster so a little help? Would prefer stories instead of one shots but I'll take what I can get. Thanks again


** This one has Harry and friends playing a few pranks.

#+begin_quote
  When Tonks is forced to go undercover as Harry's bodyguard at Hogwarts, chaos ensues. Who ever said that fighting Dark Lords couldn't be fun? Slow-building Harry/Tonks. Fifth year. Rated M for crude humor and a few adult situations.
