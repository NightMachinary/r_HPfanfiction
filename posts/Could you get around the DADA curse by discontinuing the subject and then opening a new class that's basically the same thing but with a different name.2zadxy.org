If there hasn't been a DADA teacher that's lasted more than a year in the past 40 years, I think it's pretty safe to say that there's something wrong. Even the professors that doubt that there's an actual curse on the position have to admit that something is going on.

Could this problem be solved by shutting down the class and creating a different one?

Thoughts?


** It's my belief that the curse Voldemort put on the position is for the DADA professor to be confronted by his or her worst fears;

1st - Quirrel was devalued, used, and then thrown away. His death wasn't even investigated

2nd - Lockhart was forced into a do or die situation, revealed as a coward and huckster, then had his own Memory charm used against him

3rd - Lupin's lycanthropy was exposed and by losing control he threatened the lives of those closest to him

4th (a two-fer) - Moody is blindsided by a Death Eater and his identity/reputation used against his allies; Crouch Jr. kills his own father before he can prove his worth, misses his Master's resurrection and then gets Kissed by a Dementor

5th - Umbridge has her authority destroyed and then falls victim to half-breeds and creatures, because she was deceived by a muggleborn

- Harry also taught Defense; his relationship with Cho imploded, he was betrayed by someone trusted (Marietta Edgecombe), they all were caught by Umbridge with help from his hated rival (Draco), and he later lost the closest thing to a parent he had left (Sirius).

It's probably for the best that he and Ginny hadn't started dating yet.

6th - Snape is forced to choose his side, ruining his reputation with those he respects. He also has to kill Dumbledore, the one man who knows his true motivations

7th - the Carrows witness the fall of the Dark Lord and are captured and sent to Azkaban (a place they had avoided up til then). Amycus gets a dose of his Cruciatus from Harry.

In a sense, I see the Curse as an answer to the insult; Riddle felt he was the best possible candidate for the Defense position, and his curse would force any other contenders to prove their superior fitness for the position. It ends when he dies, but not because curses end with the death of the caster. It ends because he could no longer take the position.

*** This is a very interesting take on the curse I've never seen before. It even makes sense to boot. Combined with the answer above, it seems the answer is a resounding 'no'. As long as the intent is to teach defense, the curse will take hold. I wonder if JKR considered it similarly.

Even if this is the case though I can still spare a giggle or two for fics that snark at canon by getting around the curse as op stated.

** No. HP magic isn't semantic, it's symbolic.

It wouldn't work for the same reason a Death Eater couldn't Oblivate / Confund someone into kidnapping Harry from the Dursleys - magic has a definition of "kidnapping," and tricking the person into thinking he's helping Harry doesn't trick magic.

Understanding how HP magic is different from D&D style "letter of the law" magic is a key insight into understanding why some of the various proposed fanon "plot holes" are not actually plot holes.

*** I like this explanation as far as the nature of HP magic is concerned, but you're kinda skipping over several key concepts here. Even if it is symbolic, what is powering the curse? Is it anchored to an object, location, or person? Is it simply affecting reality in some way we've not seen in canon? How does the existence of the ability to essentially destroy and redirect fate like that over such an incredibly petty thing affect the rest of the world of magic? Is Voldemort simply so powerful that he can force reality to bring about the removal of the defence professors no matter what they try to do? If so, why couldn't he apply this somewhere else?

I'm probably communicating this very poorly but I guess what I'm saying is, if literally nothing , whether it be a new name, new room, moving out of hogwarts, can allow the childRen to be taught defense by anyone other than Voldemort, then it is focused on and activated by a very loose concept with hundreds of variables and that is in fact a Plot Hole. If he's the only one capable of that magic he's a god, if that magic is common, then why isn't it utilized better?

Magic. It's a mistake to think of magic as needing some kind of anchor or mana pool or shit like that. That way madness (and magical cores) lies.

The curse is on the position itself. Magic doesn't need a physical anchor.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

No, it's affecting reality in the standard way magic does in canon. Magic is seen to affect, in canon, at various times: people, animals, objects, buildings, locations, words, memories, and concepts (such as secrets.) This is what I mean by the HP magic being unlike standard roleplaying game magic. Concepts and context matter - it's not as simple as "cast spell for 8 mana, does 10 damage to target."

#+end_quote

It's not as complex as you're making it seem - and, though it's a powerful curse, no doubt, Voldemort is on the upper end of the HP magic power spectrum. But it's really not a loose concept with hundreds of variables. If you, as a reader, look at a situation, and ask, "Is Defense Against the Dark Arts being taught at Hogwarts?", and you consider it in a common-sense, non-semantic way, and the answer is "yes," the curse is in play. If not, then it isn't. It's actually pretty simple. Magic cares about /results/ - Is the Defense Professor still teaching at the end of the year? Yes? The curse comes into play, and the result will be that he/she doesn't come back next year.

It's the same as people arguing about the /Protego/ spell, about what kinds of different Muggle things it would stop. It's really easy: a properly cast Protego will stop things that would harm you. The concept of the spell has to do with "protection." It's not a physical analogue for some kind of sci-fi forcefield - it's /magic./ Concepts matter. If you're under the Shield Charm and someone points a laser pointer at you, the Charm does nothing. If they amp up the laser so that it would hurt you, the Shield Charm blocks it. Because it would hurt you. Again, magic cares about /results/ - would X hurt you? Yes? Then X is blocked by a properly cast /Protego/. That's the logic of the magical system JKR implies.

(And yes, we can complicate this by talking about how magic can defeat other magic: /Protego/ won't save you from fiendfyre, etc. For the purposes of this argument, we're talking about /mundane/ ways to defeat the Defense curse, such as changing the name of the class or its location.)

***** Do you know any noteworthy stories that explore magical theory in a similar manner? Also, have you written any stories yourself, if you don't mind me asking?

/edit:/

I myself came up to something similar to what you are describing. But, however you look at it, I think there are still some unsolved problems and that you'd have to involve some additional elements for the necessary resolution:

- it could either be anthropomorphism of Magic, after all, --- e.g. something akin to what [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]] did for their series --- a consciousness developing itself wherever large amounts of “magic” concentrate, or a consciousness distributing certain powers of “magic” (“light”/“dark”), etc;
- it could be something powering itself from certain hosts of consciousness (wizards; wizards and non-magical humans; these two groups and developed enough animals; etc). This way the “common sense” affecting the results with magic would start making sense because it wouldn't matter any more that certain laws by which magic operates are based on definitions that are extremely subjective in their nature. In other words, it wouldn't matter that “evil”, for instance, is subjective, because as long as a large enough portion of the population (unconsciously) evaluates certain things as evil, it would get recognised as such by [their magic] / [Magic].
- or it could be a system that envelops the entire Magical system inside of it and emulates all the necessary effects --- a virtual reality, perhaps, or a meta-magical dimension of sorts that would be too esoteric and incomprehensible for wizards to understand and describe.

**** I mean that magic has its own conception of what, to us, are merely symbolic or subjective ideas. "Love" isn't just an emotion, it's an actual force with actual power. And the Sword of Gryffindor, for example, needs to be taken under conditions of "need and valor."

In the real word, "need and valor" are subjective. I might think I need the Sword, but you might disagree because my "need" involves a great party trick where I cut salami really fast. But, to me, I really need it.

In JKR's magical world, "need" exists as something that magic actually knows about and checks. (Resist the urge to latch onto "knows" and anthropomorphize magic). You have to /really/ need the Sword, and you have to /really/ display valor when you take it -- you can't have someone Memory Charm you into thinking there's a dragon you just fought to win the sword.

"Flesh of the servant, willingly given." - There's a reason "willingly" is included in that ritual. It's something the magic cares about, and it's not something you can fake.

In the context of the DADA job, the curse is on the position itself. Calling DADA something else is semantics - it's still /actually/ DADA.

While certainly not valorous, it certainly sounds delicious.

Thanks for fleshing out your earlier comment. The conditions or "checks and balances" you've enumerated make a lot of sense within the context of the series. I never would have thought of it in those terms myself.

As an brief corollary, do you think that the curse on the DADA position was lifted once Voldemort died?

****** You could make the case for it either way, but I'm betting it was lifted. There's evidence for magic weakening or going away once the caster dies - Dumbledore as Secret Keeper for the Order; his death made everyone who knew the secret an individual Keeper. We also have Voldemort's defeat (at Godric's Hollow) breaking the Imperius on various people he'd enchanted.

Probably the strongest evidence is when Harry is unfrozen atop the tower at the end of Half-Blood Prince. Harry basically says straight-out that Dumbledore's death lifted the Full Body Bind.

******** If the curse was anchored to something, for example with runes carved into it or something like that. For example, Bill being a curse-breaker and working on the old tombs in ancient Egypt - the people who cursed them are long dead, yet the curses are still in effect without being actively powered by the caster's magic anymore. I'm sure other old enchanted objects exist - maybe the hand of glory or cursed necklace that were sold at Borgin and Burke's, or the Mirror of Erised. Also, wouldn't it make the sale of magical items difficult if they would stop working once the caster died? Like Dumbledore's pensieve, Moody's foe glass, Harry's sneakoscope, the deluminator Dumbledore willed to Ron, the products Fred made at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes.... It would also probably be an unreasonable drain on a wizard's magic if they had to keep actively powering every object they'd enchanted. I think there's a difference between active spells like the body-bind or imperius curse, and long-term enchantments.

This seems like an important distinction. Many times in fics that extrapolate on Runes they use an example of a water-conjuring rune to explain the presence of something /resembling/ modern plumbing in a thousand-year-old castle. The runes would need to be powered by something and the founders are long dead.

Your explanation goes a long way towards resolving some interesting details of the HP universe.

********** I'm really glad my comment made sense to you =D

I haven't heard that example about the water runes and the plumbing, but you're right, a lot of the enchantments at Hogwarts would require power long after the founders were dead and gone. Of course there's counter-arguments to that too (the headmaster, leylines, magical residue from spells being cast....) which is why I decided not to really include Hogwarts among my examples, but that's one of the great things about fanfic, I think, is that you can write magical theory to suit your fic and your tastes. It's only when you start saying, 'no, magic /can't/ work like this/do this' that you start running into problems, I think.

** It's an interesting question, but you'd think in 40 years someone would have tried that.

It also depends on the application of the curse. One ff author I read tied it to the Professor's contract.

Personally, I would imagine that LV tied the curse to himself given his attempts at immortality.

If I were to end it earlier - as a ff writer - I would think about attempting to contravene it from the professor's side. That is magically creating a new identity year after year. This would be pretty inconvenient, but not much more than getting a new professor each year. It would probably be classed as 'Dark' Magic though.

That's why I don't like fics where Harry manages to get around the GoF just by screwing with contract technicalities. I always like to think of *magic as intent-based*, it works by the *spirit of the thought* rather than the intricacies of the thought.
