So I've noticed that people will be more ok with making certain characters who were evil or antagonistic good from the start or redeem them, but aren't ok doing that with others.

And similar thing with the good guys where people are ok turning certain protagonists into villains over others.

So what makes you want to see certain villains as good and certain good guys as bad what sets them apart?

Which villains do you hate seeing as good?

Which good guys do you hate seeing as evil or antagonistic?

And Why?

For me it usually a mix of 1. a problem I had with the series 2. I think things could be more interesting this way

Examples

Dumbledore i think makes a great villain so I like seeing him in that role

Draco I think is generic and boring in canon and good or redeemed Draco is more interesting the way I usually see it.

Bellatrix is way more interesting as a unhinged villain to me so I don't like seeing her redeemed or good or sane.

It always bothered me a bit that the leader of the supremacist movement was a halfblood from a muggle orphanage. So Tom Riddle ending up good or morally gray au's I like.

Crouch makes me mad I wish he was called out more in canon and I want to see it happen in fics more. I want to see the negative impact he had explored more.

What are yours? And why?


** Generally, I'm okay with whatever so long as it meshes well with the story a person wants to tell and fits with the rest of the narrative themes they've crafted. Good, bad, ambiguous, flipped, whatever. It's just an idea and no idea is narratively bad in and of itself - just use it well to tell your story plot and explore your narrative and I'm okay with it.

The only exception is when the flip happens (good to bad or bad to good) but it isn't well-founded or exhibited or progressed. If your change happens within the story, it has to be well-founded in the text or in the narrative - either we see them change and the events that lead up to it, or the change is sudden and there's a secret we readers can uncover and theorise about until the big reveal later on. If Ron just wakes up one morning and he's a dick, or if Draco just wakes up one morning and he's a cinnamon roll, and we didn't see them change and there's no hidden details to theorise about, then that's just dull. If it happens before, but their backstory hasn't changed and nothing has happened to make them that way, that's also... dissatisfying.

If you actively ask questions of yourself and think about this stuff, it can get so interesting. Working out why a person might change through a story, or what might've made them different beforehand, can lead to so many interesting narrative beats and themes to explore.

Like, a Snape who actively realises what he's doing is wrong (maybe after meeting and getting Chewed-Out by Wand-Reflection-Lily in the Graveyard) and tries to change is great - especially if he struggles with it. Can you imagine what it'd be like to actively realise those habits you've had for so long to protect and insulate yourself aren't healthy for yourself or others, and try work to change them? It'd be hard, and you'd backslide so much, but the journey (and the effects Snape undergoing that journey would have on the rest of the plot/setting) would be brilliantly interesting to read.

And the idea of Umbridge losing her dogmatic faith in Pureblood Rhetoric and the Ministry fascinates me. Like, she's undoubtedly the kind of villain you could hate and is a truly terrible person, but the idea of her losing all the foundations for her beliefs and self-confidence and learning that her mentality is a problem is so incredibly interesting. Imagine if everything that made her 'her' broke and she had to learn new things to replace them. Again, it'd be a fascinating journey to read.

Bellatrix is a particularly interesting person to see flipped - especially the Delenda Est-esque Bellatrix where she doesn't quite get how typical people work. I'm currently writing a fic where I'd describe her as chaotic neutral - she means well most of the time, but her methods can be a little... terrifying. And I looked into why she might've been different and found a bunch of great backstory things I'm going to enjoy exploring - her relationship with her family, her beliefs, her self-image, her wants and fears, etc.

Hermione and Dumbledore would both be interesting villains for the same reason. There's a lot of potential sadness there, and I can see that kind of Intelligence-fueled Righteous Knight Templar Anger kicking in to lead them to some dark places. And there are a million things that could punt them both to the dark side. Hermione is absolutely a bad day away from becoming a supervillain and nobody can convince me otherwise. :D

So yeah, the most interesting 'flips' are when they're well-founded in the plot or narrative and aren't completely out of left-field, when they have actual consequences and impacts on those characters, and when the differences that found the flips are actually influential on the plot and fit into the narrative as a whole. The flip is a piece of the puzzle, not a puzzle in and of itself, so it should fit into the narrative like it does.

I'm not sure how much sense any of that made. I'm quite tired rn and I kinda just rambled all of that out.

** I like Dumbledore as a villain but not the incompetent "for the greater good" scheming idiot that Dumbledore bashing fics depict him as. I've read a few good stories that reveal him as the villain in a plot twist because he's forced to step in in the final battle due to some fuck up on his minions' side. He is usually a force to reckon with and in those usually Harry barely escapes.

*** Ya Im more a fan of fics that sort of highlight how terrifying it would be for someone of that much power and influence to be evil just the potential of that and less a fan of the ones that are like calling him evil because of things he does in canon

** Why does no-one ever give Crabbe and Goyle redemption arcs? Maybe they could switch loyalty from Malfoy to Hermione as a sign of respect following her punch

Edit: OMG. Crabbe and Goyle decide to try being Hermione's wingmen in 6th year. Might write that tbh

*** There are some beautiful ones ... I remember one when Hermione recognized one of them as being a dyslectic and helps him to get trained out of it (I think, “Ah, Screw It” linkffn(12125771)).

*** Tbh no one ever like develops Crabbe and Goyle? Im not really sure why? Like ya they minion like characters for the most part in canon. But so are Pansy and Blaise and they get developed.

I could say like its because they aren't considered attractive in canon but Pansy is called pug faced in canon and is still imagined as hot in fics usually so I don't think it's that.

I mean I guess cuz they supposed to be dumb muscle is my only guess why

**** I suppose it's because we actually see Pansy and Blaise interact with people so you sort of get an idea what they're like. However the only time we see any of the two talk is when Crabbe tries to kill Hermione and then conjures fiendfyre.

**** I've seen a few good fics that give one of them character development...but only after one of them dies.

They are usually a prime example in the fandom of why pureblood ideology is bad (besides the explicit fascist comparisons) because "they are purebloods but are ugly and stupid! so ha, inbreeding is fucked up after all." which is not...wrong? But while think incest/inbreeding is certainly not good morally or for the genepool, I think using exclusively these two characters as laughingstocks while leaving others alone is likely just because they're not described as conventionally attractive as you mentioned.

But even in fics that are pro-Slytherin/pureblood/whatever in nature, it's shocking how much they still get bashed for being 'dumb jocks'

If you are looking for good Crabbe or Goyle fics I have a few recs!

I recommend giving these all a read, they are all under 5k words, and it's worth your time if you like character development.

** I love reading about morally grey or dark Hermione. I think her canon personality has certain traits that make her going dark plausible. Anything involving Hermione on Death Eater side or as a 3rd party type of situation where she makes morally questionable choices is definitely my cup of tea.

When it comes to Bellatrix I generally like her staying true to canon but seeing her intelligence and maybe that she can be logical while maintaining that psychopathic mania she has is also very intriguing. Though I've read stories where she was redeemed and enjoyed them very much.

I typically like both versions of Narcissa, or maybe three I should say. One where she completely turns side, the one in canon where she helps Harry and one in which she never betrays Voldemort and her actions that help the DE are more fleshed out.

Luna is also one of my favorite character that could be possibly flipped. I think either way, good or bad, her personality would not change much but it would make certain situations arguably way more bizarre.

Generally though I feel like I like stories that describe both sides of the war as morally grey. Where both sides use cruel methods to get what they want while having different goals. We know in canon that the Order is meant to kill their opponents but I greatly enjoy stories where it's way more obvious.
