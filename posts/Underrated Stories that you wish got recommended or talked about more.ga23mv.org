Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. (Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing).

Anyone can be the main character, can be from any era, can have any warnings, can be from any site. Can be AU or canon.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

No Weasley Bashing. No OP Harry, no Harem Harry, no Lord Potter stories.

Harry slightly more powerful or slightly smarter then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Can be oneshots, drabbles or multichapters.
