I just had this idea after reading a couple of fics that had Harry go to Gringotts and meet Griphook.

Griphook might be a title or rank, much like Bellhop, Clerk or Bartender.


** I think I once had a similar idea, where gri-fook is a goblin slang for the most basic and demeaning of service jobs. Then they started working with humans and they had to make it sound vaguely threatening (because they had an image to maintain).

*** it could also just be a cultural pronunciation difference.

like how we australians say melbourne like melbin and non australians say mel bourne.

**** I'm half convinced that cultural pronunciations line that are a secret way of telling who is or is not a local. I knew people from Norfolk VA and they pronounced the name as Nor-fuk or Nor-fik, with the L /always/ silent.

And I know locals pronounce New Orleans more as Naw-lens.

**** In the second year it will. I'm going to dole out the references slowly.

There are so many good quotes

'He died in a bizarre gardening accident'

'Well, I'm sure I'd feel much worse if I weren't under such heavy sedation.'

'It's such a fine line between stupid, and uh...clever.'

'I think that the problem may have been that there was a Stonehenge monument on the stage that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf.'

'Do you have any artificial plates or limbs?' 'Er, not really. No.'

**** Can't recall per se as it's not quite my cup of tea, but I've skimmed stories where the author describes a whole actual goblin nation, usually around South or East Europe, with kings and princesses and so on. Basically they're barely background scenery in canon, there's so much that can be done filling in the gaps, why bother rewriting canon?

***** That does good, I'll have to have a look around. But if I'm honest I don't see how you couldn't do both - maybe goblin culture is super work focused or something, and so they assume the name (first name, anyway) of their job? It's hardly rewriting canon, and it could be a cool idea to explore.

****** Eh, I dunno. It's just my preference I guess, if possible I try not to reinterpret unless there's a question created by canon that desperately needs answering. I would rather spend the time and wordcount on filling gaps than convincing the reader "okay so actually this means that"
