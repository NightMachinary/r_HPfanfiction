Prompt is the title, I've left it a little open-ended to encourage discussion.

My thoughts:

- It could drag Snape or even other people into the tournament to prove a point.
- It could force Snape and Harry to switch places.
- It could force Harry to relive Snape's life as a student of Hogwarts, while forcing Snape to relive Harry's.
- It could start actively judging both of them based on everything they say and do, with a large, visible point score hanging over both of their heads for everyone to see, possibly with notes and comments as well, like a teacher grading a paper.

*** Having just read the whole thing, I would be inclined to agree. I'm somewhat critical of the fluff and delays: for instance, I don't really feel it was necessary to show the other three champions at all, which is basically three chapters that don't need to be there. The goblet ignited because people were questioning Harry specifically, so it makes sense that it would only bother justifying that choice.

That said, while I feel it dragged it's feet a bit, it's a very good story. I agree, it's a shame it doesn't have more chapters. I have a bit of a shameful vice, in that I really like "watching the truth" style pieces of fan fiction, where characters are forced to confront the reality of events that happened which they did not know about. There are some really good Code Geass and Naruto ones, but until you shared this, I didn't know of any Harry Potter ones.

** Forcing them to relive their student years would be hilarious. Snape would die in either first or second year, as would anyone without Harry's plot armor, but Harry would love Snape's life. He's not famous, he would get along great with everyone, his parents would be alive, and he'd have years to do something about Voldemort.

I think it would be hilarious to have Harry breeze through Snape's life and be totally confused by it. “My mom was your best friend and nobody tried to murder you at all. How did you end up such an asshole?”

*** That's basically my thoughts on it. Snape would keep dying and being brought back and forced to continue, because otherwise the judgement/vision/whatever doesn't mean anything, he's got to experience the whole thing up to 4th year.

Meanwhile, it's juxtaposed against Harry having an incredible time. He's best friends with his mother, he would end up being friends with the Marauders, he would have a peaceful school life, no monster attacks or anything insane. He might even learn how to be an animagus. It's even possible that he could mend the rift between Snape's parents that caused them to have a falling out, or even if he can't fix the problems entirely, at least keep them together and stop the domestic abuse. People would respect him for his own merits and who he is as a person, which as we know from the hat, is the nature of Harry's natural 'ambition,' that made him worthy of being sorted into Slytherin. He would have friends, a family, a talented and successful school career. Nobody would see him for a scar he doesn't have. It's everything he ever wanted.

Things start to get dangerous near the end of his time in school, because that's when the war is really heating up, but then Voldemort attacks the Potters and the war is over; I'm not really sure how this works, if Snape isn't tattling to Voldemort. Maybe it's the goblet's doing, because I imagine this isn't really time travel, more a sort of hyperreal hallucination that massively distorts time and your perception of it. The timeline corrects itself to push the plot forwards, because it has to, Voldemort is defeated, 'Harry' goes to live at the Dursleys, and the actual Harry spends the next eleven years teaching students and becomes a beloved member of the faculty that everyone looks up to and respects, because he's a massively talented young teacher that everyone enjoys being taught by.

Then /Snape/ arrives in school, and Harry tells him to stay behind in his office after their first class, and the two of them conclude, after Snape starts yelling and Harry calmly assesses the problem (because Harry is now over 30 years old and is far more mature than he was in canon), that the goblet is probably running this up until the moment Harry's name comes out of the cup. Which is, of course, correct, that's exactly what is happening. So now Snape gets dragged kicking and screaming through the first three years of Harry's time at Hogwarts while Harry get to reluctantly try and keep him alive, in some sort of convoluted reverse Severitus fic where Snape is a reasonable, mature, and admired adult and Harry is, well. He behaves just like Snape does in canon. Because that's who he is.

Also, his life at Hogwarts would be much easier with the lack of marauders and soon-to-be death eaters. His summers, while unpleasant would be a bit of an improvement without physical violence.

Are you sure about that?

Because I seem to recall "teenage Snape, moodily shooting down flies in his room while parents scream in the background," juxaposed to "mentally 25 year old Harry Potter, sitting in his room while the same thing happens to two people who love him and have repeatedly shown they love him," but you seem to suppose he'll just stand by and do nothing, you know, /like he always does/.

You tell me who has better odds of sorting it out. Depending on when Snape's parents got married, Harry may very well be damn near their age, mentally. As nonjon frequently pointed out in /You Did What!/, Harry Potter post DH! is actually older than both of his parents during those events. He is physically and mentally their senior when they end up coming back from the dead.

There's NO WAY he could mend a broken relationship between two grownass adults.

Regarding Snape's supposed apathy toward his parents' fighting, there's a behavior called Learned Helplessness. It's where someone is put in the same hopeless situation over and over and over, and they eventually give up on trying to change it. Likely, any times he tried to change it, things got worse. Because abusers frequently escalate their abuse when they perceive they are being challenged by the people they are trying to maintain control over.

Teen Snape was a CHILD. Children are absolutely not ever responsible for their parents' behavior. It's not okay to hold a teen responsible for not intervening when their parents are fighting. That's not a child's job, and they should never be expected to run interference on their parents.

Look at it this way. Harry was abused and neglected by the Dursleys, kind of like how Snape was abused and neglected by his parents.

Do you really think 15 year old Harry would selflessly jump up out of bed and run downstairs to stop his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia from fighting? Because I sure do not. And he should not.

******** Dude no. Just no. You don't fix domestic violence with the Power Of Love. A CHILD has zero power to fix their parents' relationship. ZERO. Even if it's an adult in a child's body, if that child's body is living in a home with two adults in a toxic relationship they have exactly zero power there.

Heck, even an adult trained mental health professional housemate living with a couple with an abusive dynamic has zero power to make them change.

To suggest otherwise is hugely damaging to children putting misplaced blame on themselves for their parents' relationship issues, divorces, violence, etc. Kids thinking they have the power to influence their parents behavior, that they did something wrong or right that make a parent hit or not hit, is super common and not okay. It's not the kids' fault, and they can't make it better. The only person who can make it better is the abuser recognizing they have a problem and seeking the proper help and support to change their behavior.

Having them just see one another's life would help with understanding, but having them actually experience it as if it were their own, as if they weren't the people who they are in 1994, would be better. And the cool thing about that is that both get to keep their memories of this "fake" life, so both have essentially 40+ years worth of memories.

**** I don't think Snape would have any problem with first year.

He stands no chance at surviving second. Acromantulas are a XXXXX classification monster according to Rowling's printed run of the /Fantastic Beasts/ textbook; rank fives are incredibly dangerous wizard killers that should not be approached without a small army of trained professionals: other rank fives include dragons, basilisks, quintapeds, and nundus, all of which are capable of running through dozens of skilled and armed wizards like shit through a goose. An acromantula */colony/* is an */unimaginably dangerous/* hazard. After reaching the colony and talking to Aragog, he would have to run his ass back through the woods without help, because it's highly doubtful Snape would have Ron and Hermione as friends, and he certainly would not have stolen Arthur Weasley's car to get to Hogwarts when Dobby tried to stop him. Nor presumably would Ron have needed to, since if Ron isn't hanging out with Harry he wouldn't have been caught in same trap Harry was. So Arthur Weasley's car never gets flown anywhere, and it's certainly not in the Forbidden Forest. Snape would get eaten by spiders. 100%. There's no way it does not happen.

He would also be killed by the Basilisk. I doubt very seriously, even if the goblet gave him some sort of groundhog day checkpoint system where he could try over and over again to get it right, that he could kill the basilisk AND save Ginny at the same time. Ginny is functionally doomed in the Snape version of events.

He would get stuck in second, and die an awful lot before he floundered his way through it somehow.

To say nothing of third year. All SORTS of things could go wrong in third year, especially considering how hard the goblet chooses to enforce what it considers the "correct" order of events.

If he's not friends with Ron and Hermione, he would not be friends with Hagrid either and be safe from the colony since Hagrid was the one who put him in danger in the first place.

****** Snape will have to at least tolerate Hagrid, because Hagrid is the key to solving the mystery, and if he's avoiding Hagrid then he doesn't have the answers he needs. I'm not sure Snape DOES know it's a basilisk, I haven't re-read the second book in a long time, so I don't remember precisely what happens in the ending scene, but to my knowledge what happened in the Chamber is kept between Harry, Ginny, Dumbledore, and a few of the Weasleys. The monster wasn't publicized. The school at large never knew exactly what happened. The faculty MAY have been made aware after the fact by Dumbledore, but we were never given any indication that this is true. As far as we know, he covered the whole thing up, and rightfully so, since the ministry would have probably completely repossessed the school if it had gotten out that Salazar Slytherin hid a magical weapon of mass destruction underneath the basement. I imagine Dumbledore is canonically struggling as it is, trying to keep the school open when he keeps losing a teacher for a core subject every single year for 36 years in a row.

More than any of the other books, book 2 was a mystery book, and without all of the pieces to assemble the puzzle, anybody trying to resolve the chamber incident in Harry's second year is functionally fucked. The fact that only Harry could hear the monster was a hint that it was some sort of serpent. The fact that Harry was hearing things nobody else did was only a clue in the first place because Harry had friends to ask "hey, do you hear that?" A loner Harry wouldn't know what the voice means, he wouldn't know other people can't hear it. Hagrid was blamed last time, but why? How?

Hagrid's involvement is key to narrowing down the monster's identity AND where the Chamber is located. Hagrid's roosters being strangled is another key tip as to what exactly the monster is, and the ONLY reason they were able to figure out where the Chamber was located is because */Aragog/* told them that the only victim of the last opening was a girl who died in a bathroom.

You yourself admitted it: Snape wouldn't be friends with or care about Hagrid, and thus would never go speak with Aragog. But if he never speaks to Aragog, he's */utterly fucked/*, because to paraphrase Professor Binns, the brightest and most talented witches and wizards of the last thousand years have turned the castle inside-out looking for the entrance to the chamber, and none had any success at all.

Snape's problem is that he already has the correct answer to the big reveal, which is that Tom Marvolo Riddle is Lord Voldemort, but he has */nothing else./* Riddle's identity is actually the least important piece of information in the overall story of second year. Even if you assume Dumbledore told the rest of the staff that the monster was a Basilisk, he */does not have/* the information necessary to realize where the Chamber is hidden. Only somebody who was /friends with Hagrid/ and cared about Hagrid being arrested and wrongfully blamed could have gotten the extra information they need to solve the mystery and enter the chamber.

And then, even after Snape bumbles and screams and tantrums and /dies/ his way through all of that. He's got to fight Riddle and the Basilisk. And the curse Riddle put on the position of Defense Professor means that /Lockheart/ is going to get dragged into all of this, no matter /what/ Snape tries to do about it. So Lockheart sticking his nose in at unpredictable and dangerous moments in fulfillment of the curse that's dooming him is yet a further wildcard that Snape will have to deal with.

If we're assuming the goblet is allowing Harry and Snape to have their own take on each others lives, but is also not going to let either of them 'pass' and continue further into their respective timelines unless they make the big events happen more or less the way they did, then Snape is going to slam face-first into a wall in second year. He's going to have to die multiple times, maybe even dozens of times, and will have to 'hard fail' the scenario of year 2 (which I assume would be the school being closed down) several times, before he is eventually forced to try and retrace Harry's own steps, associating with the people Harry did and trying to figure out how Harry managed to do this.

Snape will /not/ enjoy Harry Potter's second year at school. His skill as an adult wizard will /not/ be a get-out-of-jail-free card for any of it.

If Snape is in contact with Dumbledore, he has no need to receive the information about Myrtle from a giant murderous spider, effectively removing the need for Snape to meet it entirely. Dumbledore can also easily tell Snape why Hagrid was expelled if he doesn't know that already. There are also far too many wildcards to predict what exactly would happen if Snape was sent into second year, such as if he has Harry's previous memories or not. If he does, he can easily see that he is now a parselmouth. He will certainly die however, if he is just placed in front of a basilisk with the hat and a Phoenix because he cannot use the sword.

*** Unfortunately plot armor is all that Harry ever really had going for him. His friends (particularly Hermione) managed to get him TO the major confrontations, but the only reason he survived any of them was last-minute authorial ass-pulls. "Mother's protection burns the bad guy" was not even hinted at throughout the first book, and felt like JKR got to the final scene, said, "Shit, how do I get him through this mess?" and then just made something up. Similar to the hat/sword/phoenix-tears of book 2, the twin wands phenomenon of book 4, and ESPECIALLY the "fickle wand joins Team Harry when he stuns Draco but doesn't switch to Team Tom when he KILLS Harry" bit of book 7.

tl;dr: Yeah, anyone but Harry would die 99% of the time, even knowing what was going to happen.

*** Snape has to find the Chamber of Secrets without being friends with Hagrid. He has to survive confronting Aragog to learn that the location of the Chamber is in a bathroom where a girl died. Then he has to go there and fight Riddle and a Basilisk, alone.

He will not have Hagrid's friendship to help feed him the clues he needs to suss out the location. He won't have Hermione or Ron to help him. Snape would never be friends with Ron in a million years, which means the twins have no reason to rescue him from the Dursleys with the Ford Angelia and he would not be staying over at the Burrow. Which means the Ford Anglia wouldn't get flown to Hogwarts, so it's not in the forest, it can't save "Ron and Harry" from Aragog's family. Ron wouldn't be involved in the scenario. To find out where the Chamber is located to even attempt to end second year correctly, Snape has to find the acromantula colony, confront Aragog, and survive escaping. And if he's not friends with Hagrid, Hagrid has no reason to give a tip-off to thin air of "follow the spiders." So he has to figure out Aragog's entire involvement with this by himself.

He then has to go into the chamber, alone, and fight Riddle and the basilisk. Snape does NOT have any faith in Dumbledore, at least certainly not the kind Harry does, which means even if Snape is allowed to pull out the sword because he's "Harry," Fawkes would never come to his aid.

So Snape is fucked. He's going to die, a LOT, in second year. He's going to have to try and brute-force the solution by abusing the fact that the goblet of fire is making him complete the scenario. He has no other choice.

**** Snape wouldn't try to fight a basilisk with a sword in the first place, he'd probably just conjure a rooster, failing that we know he's capable of the killing curse and that works on all the big scary monstery (only 5 things are canonically immune, nundus, dementors, ghosts, lethifolds and poltergeists)

**** The thing is that you are being too arbitrary about what the goblet forces on the characters.

Does Snape has free will at all? The fact that he is not friends with Ron says that he does but if he does have free will why in the world would he go to the trouble of solving the mistery?

He doesn't have Harry's hero complex why would he bother? At most he would tell Dumbledore about the events of the second year and stay out of it so the school wouldn't close.

Also he wouldn't be stupid enough to get trapped in Aragog's nest by going alone into the forest...

Honestly Harry complicates things unnecessarily in all the books and is mostly okay because he is a child, Snape is a grown ass man he wouldn't do any of that. And again if he was compelled... Well he can fly.

And Snape very much trusted Dumbledore and even if he didn't he would be able to trust him with all those specific situations.

***** Yeah, I am being arbitrary about what the goblet forces on the characters, because otherwise it's not an interesting story. It doesn't matter if Snape or Harry just watch a movie of the other's lives, that's not interesting and doesn't prove the point. Harry said Snape couldn't deal with living his life, Snape said he easily could. The goblet said CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.

Are you actually so oblivious to the dangers involved in second year that you think being a fully-qualified wizard or being an adult would help? Wizards who would have wiped their asses with Severus Snape couldn't solve the chamber. For that matter, any wizard alive would die fighting the basilisk without Fawkes helping them, and Fawkes only came because of something very specific that Harry did. Cry about whatever "hero-complex" you think Harry has on your own time; that doesn't change the fact that Snape would spend dozens of lives trying to figure out a way to get through the chamber and defeat Riddle.

Hagrid was the key to everything, and if Snape doesn't figure out that he needs to cultivate a relationship with him, he WILL keep getting stuck and losing second year. And even when he eventually pulls his head out of his ass, he still has to deal with the chamber event itself. Being "a grown-ass wizard" won't help jack shit for that.

****** Why so angry?

Isn't this time for debate? If not feel free to ignore the comments.

The thing is... you are disproving your own point. Adult Snape could have lived Harry's life and you are proving that by having to force him through the Goblet to be incompetent so he fails.

But I mean is your plot do whatever...

And just to clarify Harry's hero-complex is canon I think? isn't that something Hermione says? And dude... I'm on reddit this is definitely my own time

****** Sooo... just wanted to point out that consulting with Hagrid and the whole Aragog field trip had exactly zero to do with figuring out the monster was a basilisk. All they learned was that spiders are scared of it. Not a great clue.

HERMIONE figured it out on her own long before they visited him. Even after the visit and Aragog side quest, they still didn't know what the monster was. It was the ripped out page about basilisks balled in Hermione's hand that conveniently went unnoticed by all the adults that identified the monster.

If kid-Snape was smart enough to be literally the only student outside of Remus' dorm that figured out the kid was a werewolf, pretty sure he could figure out it's a basilisk without chatting up Aragog. He was very knowledgeable about the dark arts and dark creatures as a student so would be familiar with their traits, and his studiousness/nerdiness/observational skills are pretty on par with Hermione's.

Also, do they get each other's abilities or no? Because Harry being a parselmouth and hearing homicidal voices was a big clue for Hermione, and also the literal key to opening the chamber. Honestly if there are no parselmouths in Hogwarts then /nobody/ is getting rid of the basilisk unless they do something smart and passive like fill the hallways with tons of roosters or something.

Actually, that's all he or anyone else would need to do to kill it. No fancy swords or phoenixes needed. Just conjure a rooster and as soon as it crows, bam, basilisk is dead.

** I mean at least we see Snape work for what he has. If Snape changed places with Harry he would probably create some dragon sedative with potions not try to out fly it. He also lived at the school a lot longer then Harry and would know how to deal with the giant squid and mercreatures probably would collect samples for later use. If Hagrid is in charge of them then Snape definitely knows how. I always wondered how they cleaned the glass in the Slytherin's room to keep algae from covering it. Especially since Harry didn't know how to swim. So yeah an adult with a Masters in a subject that takes clear thinking and time to learn would easily out class Harry who wasn't even 17 yet. Who never put effort into learning because he taught not by the Dursley's and by Ron's standards.
