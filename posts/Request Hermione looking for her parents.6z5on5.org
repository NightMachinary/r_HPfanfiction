Are there any stories where after the war Hermione looks for her parents in Australia?

Please no Draco/Hermione or Harry/Hermione.

Any rating is fine.

Best fanfic I have ever read.\\

*** But Ron is such a dick in this fic that I ended up bad for Hermione. I usually don't condone Ron bashing but after reading this fic i had to read some of those dumb fics just to cleanse the pallet so to speak.
