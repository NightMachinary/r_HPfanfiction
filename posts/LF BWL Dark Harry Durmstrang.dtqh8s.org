Hi I am looking for fanfics with Harry As Boy Who Lived ( same initial situation as canon so no Sirius in the beginning) who go to Durmstrang ( because Hogwarts doesn't prepare him well for war ) . Something similar to A Beast's Virtue by Arlienne .


** Well, I know this isn't quite what you're looking for since you wanted Harry at Durmstrang, but if you wanted a school that's to prep a BWL!Harry for war, there's linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) a take of Harry Potter in the style of Ender's Game. It's very AU and was a fun read. It's incomplete, though I'm holding out that the author will update eventually since it was two years between his most recent update and the previous one. Sirius only appears once or twice in the fic.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

** This is a wrong bwl with Harry starting at hogwarts but going to durmstrang after 1 semester, one of the best docs out there IMO [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]]
