Most fanfics I've seen that feature Narcissa Malfoy in any significant capacity tend to focus on her motherly or elegant nature. I'm not really looking for fics where she's as bad as Bellatrix, but fics where she acts haughty, vain, racist, or generally less than pleasant to people outside the family would be appreciated.


** In Prince of Slytherin,she's as insane as Bellatrix but does a slightly better job masking it

Starfox stories often have her as a minor villain who often gets got along her husband
