** I think your intentions are probably good but you might want to consider rephrasing this request, it comes across as quite derogatory to people suffering from mental health issues.

**** No problem - like I say, good intentions. For me I don't like the use of the word weird and linking it to MH, just seems like an insult. Admittedly I'm trying to think of a better way to phrase your ask and I am struggling as in the same context, quirky or odd feel like insults too.. Just my two cents anyway :)
