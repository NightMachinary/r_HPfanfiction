#+begin_quote
  My dear readers,

  I'm sorry for disappearing off the face of the earth; it was rather inconsiderate to the people who have been supporting me for so long. To be honest, I think I was hoping that I wouldn't have to write this at all; I was hoping my feelings would change, and I could get back to business as usual. It didn't, I don't think it will.

  Last summer, J. K. Rowling released an essay, after getting in several...I guess you could call it "Twitter scandals"...Twitter is weird. Anyway, she made a number of public remarks and then released an essay about her feelings on transgender people. I say feelings, because it wasn't /about/ transgender people - it was about whatever strange, twisted idea someone got into their head about what transgender people are. It was full of misinformation and poor reasoning - to me, after reading it a few times, it was clear to me that these were the rationalizations of someone who didn't necessary /dislike/ transgender people, but nevertheless wanted their lives and health to be complicated and damaged by a deeply misinformed, scientifically illiterate, and wilfully ignorant society. Soon after, her new novel came out, and that cleared up any last hopes I had that this was maybe a passing blunder by someone who just didn't know what they were talking about, and would soon correct themselves.

  I am transgender. I live my life struggling to get the healthcare I need and wading through the administrative obstacles constantly thrust in front of me as I just try to get on with my life. I also live my life seeing ignorant, cruel things written about people like me on the internet every day, which is kind of demoralizing, but it is what it is. But it's a little different when it's coming from an author of a work you have a deep personal connection with, whose fantasy world you've spent hundreds of hours exploring and expanding. I don't begrudge anyone for still being a part of the Harry Potter fandom, and indeed, I still have fond feelings towards it, and consider myself a fan to some degree. But my personal connection to it has changed, to say the least.

  I've always made it clear that to me, this story was a highly personal endeavour, that it was a therapeutic project I was using to explore characters and story-lines that reflected my own struggles, and write my way out of them. I've found I can't really do that anymore. I still find joy and excitement in the wizarding world, but I can't find comfort in it. I can't use it as medium to express my vulnerabilities and personal journeys. I know this isn't a rational reaction, but it isn't meant to be - it's purely emotional. And writing is a very emotionally driven thing, for me. If I want to engage in unemotional, analytic writing tasks, I have my research, my career for that.

  I can't do this anymore. I was initially going to at the very least clean up, flesh out, and post the last five chapters I had written, but I can't even bring myself to to that, to be honest. I won't be finishing this. No matter how much I want to, no matter how much I want to bring closure to this plot and these characters, I can't. I'm sure I could push through it if I had to, but it wouldn't be something I could feel proud of, and it wouldn't be enjoyable for me. On the bright side, I've started writing original fiction again, and it's going well. I've almost finished a novel that I'm really excited about, so I haven't given up writing at all. I'm just...moving on.

  I imagine there will be some people who are angry with me, and disdainful of my reasons for abandoning this story. That's alright, you're allowed to have your feelings about things, just as I am allowed to have mine. It would be nice if you could respect mine, but this is the internet, and...well, enough said.

  I've loved working on this story and hearing from my readers. I've loved building something that other people can enjoy. But it's time for me to move on.

  Thank you for everything,

  a friend.

** Oh, I didn't know that the author was trans.

Yeah, it really sucks how many good fics have been abandoned because of JKR's comments. The author of Malarkia has really slowed down their update pace for similar reasons.

Speaking as another transgender fanfiction author, I've been doing my best to keep updating, mostly because I view my fics as defiling her work and there's no way she can stop me from making gender transition both a widespread and commonly accepted thing in the magical world. Hermione is gay, Harry is nonbinary, Tom Riddle fucks, and no one can stop me!

I'm another trans author, and it has been very gratifying to see the number of people who have gone and said "Author's a terf? Well I'm gonna just make my story a million % queerer as a fuck-you."\\
But I also get where Imaginizer is coming from. It's just hard to muster that same sense of joy and wonder when it's linked to such a miserable person. I'd be lying if I said it hadn't factored into my own hurdles in continuing my fic, (though my writer's block is still primarily just laziness.) I'm still interested in HP as a fandom, but I'm not going to be spending any money on merch or at the Wizarding World any time soon.

**** I mean, I also come at fanfiction from.a very different angle than I think most do. Harry Potter is something I enjoyed a lot as a child but am fairly critical of as an adult. Between the Anglocentrism, poorly handled genre shift, and worldbuilding that feels half-assed at times, I get a media series that I once enjoyed greatly but see large room for improvement.

I do this because Harry Potter has a fascinating premise but fails to deliver in many aspects. I want to take that world and make something new and (hopefully) better out of it.

I also wasn't too heavily affected by the remarks because, being a transgender person in a lot of far left spaces full of other transgender people, there was already a decent amount of suspicion about her views regarding trans people. It felt more like a disappointing confirmation of suspicions than anything else. I do what I can go help combat ignorance about transgender people, because that's all that I can do at the moment

***** Fair enough. It definitely wasn't a surprise when her transphobia blew up last year, and I do remember the reaction on [[/r/transgender][r/transgender]] being basically "We've known that for a while." She had a long history of tweeting suspect stuff for ages before it came out.

And you've said it better than I could in terms of seeing it as an opportunity for improvement. Most of the expanded canon is lazy or bad or problematic, but it can serve as a basis for fans to build upon or revise and not repeat her mistakes.

This is what drew me to fanfiction.

I understand what the original author intended to portray. But /I/ don't like it. I want it to do something else. I wanted the author to have written something different. And fanfiction allows you to do exactly that.

I understand that JKR wanted lycanthropy to be some sort of AIDS metaphor. But I don't like it. With fanfiction I can go look for a fic where it's not (although finding a fic without abo is quite hard).

This is what allows me to completely separate the author from their work. I care not for what JKR says for I can /reject/ her canon. I can reject her and her words.

***** Honestly, at this point I feel like HP is certifiable garbage dug right out of a garbage can... but it's sentimental garbage and people do a lot of really fun and interesting transformative work with that garbage.

Although I didn't see much in the way of suspicion of her transphobia before the whole twitter blow up, I definitely saw people pointing out the inherent racism and antisemitism in her work, so when that happen, it just... wasn't a surprise. It was more like "ah, you know, some stuff makes sense now." The biggest surprise really was how hard she went on it... but again this followed shit like the American Wizarding School houses controversy where she'd already made it clear she doesn't give a shit about who she hurts and doesn't care how much her fans /want/ to support her and help educate her and see her come back from an initially shitty stance.

There's also a specifically shitty history with American (school) sports teams using native Americans themselves as mascots for their teams, so it is sort of a poke in the eye about an already culturally sensitive issue.

*** I come from the same perspective. I'm also a trans fanfiction author and honestly? The fanfic I'm working right now barely counts as canon. I've changed the magical system, the characters were mostly unexplored, I'm using all the open spots here.

As a kid, I thought the books were amazing. But re-reading since I was 14, I started realising world building errors, bad writing and a lot of things that could be edited and made better. So that's what I'm doing now, years later. I'm not fixing it, but exploring it to it's full potential. Expansive world building, new magical system, make it darker, explore the horcrux creations, explore the more mysterious and grimdark side of the magical universe. And, most of all, make it queer. So queer Miss Joke would try to file a restraining order against me.

So yeah. The big joke with my friends is that until I get a restraining order or a cease and desist? I'll carry on writing fanfic and putting every thing she thought was too dark out in the open. I just hope one day we all get to see the look on her face when she finds out there are trans authors that wrote fanfic better than she did her books and are more loved.

linkao3(Scrambled Sorting) nonbinary Harry. It hasn't come up yet in the story, but that's how I write him. Also features several differences from canon, a Dumbledore who is both good and competent (if a bit wacky), an extreme large cast, and heavy themes of anarchy.

linkao3(Unseen Perspective) Have you ever wanted to read a fic where Voldemort is an unhip mom? She's dead set on mentoring Harry and has a moody teenage daughter. Harry keeos doubting his sanity because Voldemort keeps showing up at Privet Drive and taking him out to lunch and is constantly upfront with him about a lot of things.

But it does get harder when the author is still alive and constantly spewing new "feelings" and beliefs that belittle you personally. And possibly publishing new works- that might tie into the works you love- showcasing those insults. And everyone is constantly identifying them as the author of the works you like, and people are going back through the works you like to try and see evidence of the author's feeling influencing those works.

It sound like the fanfic author still has good memories of Harry Potter, but at this point it's just a constant reminder because the news cycle is always throwing the concepts together that "the author of Harry Potter hates trans people" so if you pay a lot of attention to Harry Potter issues and trans issues after a while the separation becomes more difficult- ever play one of those word association games? If someone said "Harry Potter" there's a good amount of people now who would blurt out first thing"-hates trans people!" because that's what they associate it with.

***** That's the way life is, mate. You have to get along with people despite their differences. At least insofar as this stuff goes. I mean, it's just Harry Potter for heavens sake. It's not like we're sharing toothbrushes and all.

If we like the same characters and we like the story, we can get along in that way. And so we should. I couldn't care less what JK herself thinks. It didn't affect my enjoyment of the books previously, it won't affect me now. Now if we don't like the characters and don't like the story, that's something else. In which case, well we can find other stories and other people to connect with. 7 billion individuals out there, loads of stuff to enjoy, with people we can find common values with.

And this is why I don't agree with the extremes of modern cancel culture.

But that might be off the subject...

**** The problem is that having dead animals contaminate the water is a real issue with real noticeable effects on the quality of the water. So obviously, everyone would care and not be willing to swim in a pool that has dead animals rotting in it.

A more fair comparison would be that you find out that the guy who owns the swimming pool made homophobic slurs. Like, that sucks. But it's not going to retroactively pollute the water.

For me, I like Harry Potter, I like Harry Potter books, Harry Potter fanfiction, Harry Potter movies and I want to play Hogwarts Legends. I get that it sucks Rowling is a terf. But that doesn't effect Harry Potter for me at all.

#+end_quote

You're potentially throwing a lot of things into the same bucket here. Most TERFs probably don't hate trans people.

The core message of TERFs as I understand it is simply that cis women and trans women are different in some ways that matter and have consequences, e.g. they believe that certain traditional women spaces should be kept spaces for cis women. That's neither hateful nor particularly unfair.

Sure, the TERF label can be used as a dogwhistle by those who really do hate trans people. But the core message is something pretty legitimate that ought to be allowed in the general space of discussion.

#+begin_quote
  Trans people don't hurt anyone
#+end_quote

As a general rule, absolutely. However, every sufficiently large group of humans contains assholes. Which means that there are asshole trans people who *do* hurt others, and that causes backlash.

That backlash is likely overblown, but for an outsider it is hard to understand why the trans community explicitly or implicitly defends the assholes.

** In a round-about kind of way, this is the reason I'm really hoping that new Hogwarts Legacy game does well. JK isn't attached in any creative way, the rights were licensed from her, which means the only money she'll be getting from it is what she's ALREADY got from it.

Its important the game does well because then it can show WB that the franchise CAN function without her. You can tell they desperately want to, but are just worried about fan backlash. There was once a time when her word was law in the HP fandom and they want to avoid another "only George Lucas Star Wars is REAL Star Wars" situation.

And look - continuing to enjoy a coming of age story about a boy with magical powers does not make you transphobic, we all know that, separating the art from the artist IS a thing, but for many of the general populace its (understandably) too close for comfort. Especially while she is still directly gaining from support of the franchise. In a lot of fan communities this attitude is becoming more and more common, people unwilling to accept you can both like HP and violently disagree with JK, to the point of where I have had to argue with friends about whether its ethical.

If WB can be shown the license can function WITHOUT JK Rowling, if she could be removed from the franchise and the two could stop being so closely associated with each other, that can go a long way in redemption.

"J.K. Rowling is not directly involved in the creation of the game, however, her extraordinary body of writing is the foundation of all projects in the Wizarding World. This is not a new story from J.K. Rowling."

The general understanding is a few years ago she was handed a large sum of money to sign a contract that said they can do/tell whatever story they like in the game and that was the last she heard of it. I say a few years ago because the game was having leaks way back when JK was only starting to be controversial, so the publishers are probably patting themselves on the back for the good foresight.

Also, the recent news that the gender customisation will not be directly tied to the characters sex they pick, thus allowing non-binary/trans/everything players definitely feels like they did that to clap back at the association they have with JK.

So if I'm interpreting what [[/u/CGPHadley][u/CGPHadley]] says correctly. In that Rowling has already been paid for the rights and at this point only makes money off of preexisting royalties from the movies/books?

At that point, I won't feel any kind of guilt for supporting the game. It's already been used as a low-key selling point for the game that Rowling has had very little creative input and that alone is why I might be willing to buy it used.

** Personally, I'm someone who tends to do things out of sheer spite, and it's had me involved in a great many things that I otherwise might not have glanced at twice. This isn't the decision that I would make. But it's also a decision that I can definitely understand, nonetheless.

We don't control this human's actions, and frankly, I wouldn't want to be someone that tried to keep them active in a fandom that would only just remind them that there's someone out there they've devoted a great deal of their attention, time, and joy towards that doesn't believe they should live comfortably, or as themselves.

Something like that can be absolutely devastating to people, and trying to convince them to continue on with it /might/ end up with a bit more to read, but it won't change the pain that Rowling's statement left behind in them.

If leaving is what they've chosen to do, then so be it. That's fine. I only hope that one day they can find the same joy it once inspired in another thing, and that, someday, Rowling sees sense, and it won't hurt so bad.

** I've written on WebNovel, along with fanfic. I have seen people get so pissed when I write one sentence, saying that the MC slept with a guy(yes I did not give any warning, but does anyone give warnings for straight smut? Nope. And mine was just one sentence, it doesn't even count.), and literally got hate comments, bad reviews, and a lot more. Of course, there were supportive people too, but in the end I had to abandon the fic because I just couldn't do it anymore.

I'm straight, but I wrote my MC out to be bicurious, but straight later. They didn't like this, and I felt bad. I can't even begin to fathom what actual LGBTQ+ people felt reading those comments, or what the LGBTQ+ authors feel when they get such hate.

I haven't read The Accidental Horcrux yet, but you can bet I'm reading it tonight. Take care!

*** We mostly don't give a shit about JKR's opinions. Yes they are hurtful, but so are many other people. It's a bit harder to ignore her because of how famous she is, but whatever.

No, the real problem is that she uses her considerable fame and power to convince many of her fans of her views, and thereby contributes to society as a whole being more transphobic, which is very harmful. She is not just some random idiot on twitter who has dumb views, she actively wages war on us.

*** Because sometimes when someone has painted an image of something (in this case JKR and her books) and that image breaks, like, completely shatters, it's completely normal to start having negative feelings towards things related to that no matter if you want to or not. Everything is associated to that shattered image and your bad feelings towards that and sometimes you just have to let go and move on instead of trying to work past things.

*** The book is just part of it, she has been super transphobic and also problematic in a number of other ways on twitter.

She is someone who wants people to think she is an ally, but she doesent really want to work for it. For example: "Dumbledore is gay" well cool, could you like do something with that, like maybe in the movie you are making... the one about young Dumbledore and his ex-lover (which would make an excellent plot point but is not even metioned in the movie (to my memory)) the one that you wrote the fucking screenplay for?

Man idk it is just so frustrating to look up to someone as a writer, who produced your favorite childhood series, literally the metric I judge books in the fiction genre by (at least for overall tone) and see they have let fame get to their head, and now just say shit to appear pc but wont fucking take action, or actually reasearch issues.

It is frustrating because she is famous, she says shit and people listen, she has the ear of the populus and she is filling it with TERF bullshit.

It is totally valid to say 'I can't support this person's work anymore', it is one thing to seperate the works from the artist, but she fucking writes this shit in books man.

**** Note, I agree that it makes sense to be upset about JKR's transphobic comments.

However, I thought the second Grindelwald movie made it pretty clear that Dumbledore and Grindelwald were lovers in the flashback to them doing whatever ritual made them not be able to attack each other? I guess since I already knew they were gay it was clearer than it would have been if I didn't already know that, but that did seem to be what that scene was going for to me.

***** You are probably right here, I honestly don't remember much about the movie besides a snake woman and my dislike of it, however it seemed like (after rewatching clips) it was not the major plot point it should have been. The ideal would have been a movie without the Fantastic Beasts tie in that focuses only on Dumbledore and Grindlewald and actually doccuments their relationship, that would feel like much less of a sell out.

*** To answer your question, no it's not. In this one, the Scarcrux is sentient and starts manipulating Harry from a very early age, positioning itself as his only friend. He comes to Hogwarts relatively naive but trusting of Tom and from then on it's him being pulled between Dumbledore and Tom's sides. Before the fic ended, it was shaping up to be a legitimate three-way conflict between Harry, Dumbledore and the original Voldemort, really the only instance of that trope that I enjoyed.
