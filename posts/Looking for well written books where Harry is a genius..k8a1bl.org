Hi All,

I was wondering if anyone knows of any well written books where Harry is a genius or has an eidetic memory. Please only complete books.

Thanks in advance,

** Flair should be request, not reccomenedation. Other than that, Loose Cannon (by Mannatee-vs-Walrus) kind of fits, he's not a genius, but he is smart. It's also not complete, but it is 96 chapters and updated weekly. The chapters aren't short either.

*** This annoys me so much. Like I want to see what fics people specifically like enough to make a topic just to recommend, but the vast majority of topics with the tag are incorrectly labeled request topics so the tag is basically useless.

**** The person you replied to was recommending a story, not the author.

I know little about the author's own personal beliefs, and after a quick google I was not able to find much at all. The only belief I was able to find that is noteworthy are his opinions on A.I. which are worrying, but I would not call them disgusting. I'd be interested to know what those beliefs are, or what the cult you referenced is.
