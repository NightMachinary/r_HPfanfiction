I tried to create a writing prompt that has a universe attached to it. Not so much inspiring creation as setting boundaries for it, it is my hope that it might inspire some fanfiction specifically about the war, not just the characters in it. it's abit all over the place but... its the best i got and it's late. Take what you want leave what you hate.

Once again the wizarding world has fallen into its misconceptions about Light and darkness, of heroes and villains. As if Grindelwald single handedly carried his banner over the continent, as if every great “dark” wizard fought alone against the forces of “light”. As if Dumbledore fought Old Wald from the shores of Normandy all the way to berlin.

This is not how wars work and it never has been. Wars are won by men on the ground slowly eroding power bases and stifling supply lines. And of course let's not forget, killing as many of the bastards as possible. So sure, Harry Potter did a great thing in ending Voldemort but let's not be overly dramatic here.

The first and second wizarding wars play out very much like the muggle world wars. Often when describing the end of the first wizarding war we describe Voldemort as being at the “height of his power” which is just factually incorrect. Much like saying that Germany was at the height of its power when it surrendered. Sure, Germany was holding but it had stalled out and all of its allies, the Ottomans, the Austia-hungarians and the italians, were losing. Voldemort may have been winning but the truth is that his power base resided in pure bloods of which there are not many. Sure he could kill people and cause terror but he could never hold ground.

So when Voldemort died at the hands of Potter his little missband of terrorists dissolved. But the next time around he learned from his mistakes, first he went bigger, recruiting from a wider base (half-bloods) which he offered power instead of tradition. Second of all he pulled a, excuse the muggle term, Blitzkrieg, on us. Taking the ministry building almost immediately upon reveal. But perhaps the most important thing he did was propaganda. He controlled the radio and the newspaper meaning the populous belived whatever he told them. And he told them we were losing.

What Voldemort did not learn was the importance of supplies, he had never commanded such a large force and did not realise his mistake until it was too late. You might assume that a wizarding army does not need anything, that they could simply summon whatever they need but that is incorrect. Yes food, water and warm clothing become unnecessary, but as muggle concerns disappear magical ones appear. Specifically medical ones, you see magical war requires intense medical care and here's a smal secret: we never lost Sangt Mungos.

Voldemort started out just as the germans did with a stronger force hopelessly out numbering the auror core in strength but number quickly started changing as forieng aid started to roll in from nations that did not wish to see voldemort in power. And his manpower pool quickly ran dry when all the young upstarts in britain had joined him.

At the time of the battle for Hogwarts a full scale attack was being mounted to retake the ministry. Voldemort was forewarned of the attack and realized he could not win for the same reasons we lost it originally, the ministry is not a defensible position and he was outnumbered. To remain in the game Voldemort realised he would need a new base of operations so he launched a final desperate attack on hogwart in an attempt to secure such. There Harry Potter killed him and with him his soldiers dreams of power.

It is my professional opinion that even if we had lost the battle for Hogwarts, Voldemort had no more recruits and no other places to run. He would have died in Hogwarts within the year.

So, the next time you hear a story of a great hero rember that he did not carry his banner alone and that he stood on the bodies of the thousands of good people who died to get him there. But more importantly remember the people who carried the banner of evil, and remember that they may carry it again.

** I find it funny that this is the same bones that allowed a hearing in front of basically the whole government and then didn't even try to investigate the claims about "rouge" dementors. she would've been a shit general
