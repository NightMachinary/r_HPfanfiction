I started reading this trilogy (HP and the Darkness before the Dawn, HP and the Lions of Gryffindor, HP and the War of Shadows) by madscientist after it was recommended in another thread on here but every where I've found the War of Shadows, it ends just as the final battle is getting underway. Was this story abandoned or does anyone know where I can find the rest of the story?


** On HPFF it says last updated story was War of Shadows updated on 2007.03.19 So I'm going to say yes, or something happened to the author.

*** Yeah that's where I was reading from originally. When looking for the rest of the story I found on other sites that the author had 2 more full novel length fics (and several one-shots) since 2007 that weren't on HPFF so I figured I'd ask if anyone knew of a site that had the full story (if it existed)

**** The author, Madscientist, is probably one of my favorite from that era of Fanfiction.

The set you are talking about was his/her first works and they were written before HBP came out. I remember there being very frequent updates to War of Shadows for a long time and then Portkey did a new event (they use to do them frequently), called the Felix Felicies Competition. Harry Potter and the Circle's End was the story that he/she started writing for that competition and sort of abandoned the War of Shadows since it was not cannon anymore.

War of Shadows though was a great story and the 2 before it were fantastic as well in my opinion. Circle's End was one of the best fics I read during those years. There was a sequel but I don't think that it was ever finished. Of all the fics that I have kept up with and wanted to be finished, I wanted that one done more than any other. The way he did Harry and Hermione's powers in those stories I thought were fantastic and I thought the fight scenes were some of the best.

Moral of the story is, I followed those fics religiously and I really enjoyed everything that author wrote. But sadly War of Shadows and the sequel to Circle's End were both unfinished despite being preceded by really good work.

EDIT: I believe the sequel was called Harry Potter Beyond the Looking Glass
