Hey everyone here I'm looking for fanfics with at least some kind of 18+ content. Looking through websites I've ended up reading the first few chapters of a lot that initially looked promising, but ended up being rather poorly written, so giving up with them. One I found particularly good was Searching for the Power, nice blend of plot and smut without being too much of one or the other. So anything similar would be ideal. Thanks for any suggestions in advance


** Ok, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(7718942;12040341). There are some good smut in the first one, and lots of genocides in the second one.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
