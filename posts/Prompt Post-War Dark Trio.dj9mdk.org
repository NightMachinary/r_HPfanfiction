A bit longer than usual. I was thinking about how much political clout the trio would have after defeating Voldemort. I'd like to see a fic where they use this clout to take power, intending to prevent another Voldemort situation. They end up far worse. Dictator!Harry as the beloved Minister of Magic (or else) with Warlord!Ron in charge of the DMLE as his general and second in command. Inquisitor!Hermione runs the DoM as a combination of shady government research organization and secret police force, hunting down dissenters (Oops, I mean "Death Eaters".)

Problems with the press? The editor of the Daily Prophet disappears amidst talk of an affair, Luna Lovegood is promoted, and those rumors of power abuse from the government couldn't possibly be true. Her friends would never do that. What's this, an article on corruption? No, that's trash. Here, let's run this piece on the new legislation Harry signed to protect the recently discovered Crumple Horned Snorkack (clearly not an experiment from the DoM that got loose.)

Neville Longbottom was caught growing illicit substances? Official pardon, it's all just a big misunderstanding. Oh and ignore those rumors of experimental enhancement potions being used on the Auror Corps (they couldn't possibly be true!) And don't worry about the creepily blank stare and massive musculature of the new Advanced Aurors. They're here to protect you from dark wizards. Like the Malfoys, who have been arrested again for trying to escape house arrest and flee the country. Or the Death Eater Cormac McLaggen, an obvious dark wizard who certainly never made a pass at Hermione and Ginny while they were out shopping.

The road to Hell is paved with good intentions. (And Death Eater bones. Ignore the crunching under your feet and keep on walking.)


** That's pretty much what happened in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005), although their respective roles differ a little. The main conflict is not with British Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers anymore, since they have already been systematically liquidated early in the game; but with other European Pureblood regimes. The author didn't have the heart to let 'the heroes' fall completely and decided to 'save' them in the last minute, but I can see them going totally down the rabbit hole easily.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is another good example, although this Neville is fully on board with the Dark Trio.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** It's not a very popular idea, wonder why (duh!), but the only one who made it justice was holdmybeer with their, very often recommended, The Sum Of Their Parts.

Shame there aren't any more stories like that, which aren't smut and totally ridiculous. I think it's a very good premise for a story.

I can totally see Hermione as an avenger and social justice warrior. Harry is quite cruel and authoritative in DH and Ron just follows the two.

*** I've read Sum of Their Parts. It somewhat inspired this actually. I wasn't going for social justice warrior with Hermione so much as saying they've fallen so far that they will destroy someone simply for annoying them. But with her S.P.E.W. behavior taken into account the sjw take does fit.

**** Hermione, if she was written 20 years later, would totally be an SJW. She fits the model snugly and is a perfect example.

I wonder why people very rarely portray her as such, and if they ever do it's almost always about elves and such, never about current issues. hmmm... seems interesting to explore further.
