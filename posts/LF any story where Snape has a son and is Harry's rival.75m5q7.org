#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts brings with it three friends who might just help him honour his biggest role models, a Slytherin rival in the form of one Evan Snape, and a mystery to be solved involving a small package hidden on the third floor. PS retelling set in the world where Lily Evans made different choices as a young girl, that ended up changing wizarding history.

**** I wanted to like this...but I'm five chapters in and just ugh. The excessive changes to Hogwarts are irritating and both Evan and Harry are just... Annoying.

***** On another note...I can't believe they named him Evan Stephen. Also hard to believe - Lily wouldn't make more of an effort to look after her supposed best friend's orphaned child. Unless Sirius did something to completely alienate her, she would certainly visit him more than once.

So yeah, I'm gonna give the story a go, but I'm gonna pretend their mothers weren't close friends. Also, his name is Evan Samuel or something.

***** Yeah, I recommended it because it fits the brief, not because I think it's good.
