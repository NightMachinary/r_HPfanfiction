Seems Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Pasts has disapeared from [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]. Does anybody knows anything about that?

**** Based on it getting removed from multiple places, I'd guess the author removed it. I can't guess a reason though, especially since his other stories are still available.\\
Some think it's because "patreon" mentions in the author notes.

***** I can say with absolute certainty that he did */NOT/* remove it. Most of those places still seem to ping FF.net for their "backups" so when it got removed there by their mods, it got removed everywhere. Current working theory is that some chode reported him for mentioning he has a Patreon.

****** You're actually angry that someone, you know, used the report function for its intended purpose and reported somebody for breaking rules and laws? What did this guy even think was going to happen, that he could do patreon fanfic bullcrap and get away with it forever? Why? Because he's special, because he's an exception? That's idiotic arrogance and classic justification for lawbreakers. Don't go being pissed and calling the reporter a "chode", how about actually blaming the lawbreaker for breaking the law to start with and thinking he could get away with it?

I mean come on. That whole "wink wink I'm asking for patreon but NOT for my fanfic, WINK WINK!"? Yeah, no. He knew what he was doing, and he knew it was against the rules. This is just his rightful comeuppance.

Not even going into how fucking scummy it is to literally ask for MONEY to...write words on a keyboard? Seriously, he needs CASH to be able to use a word processor? Bullshit. He's just exploiting people for something he started doing for free, and should have KEPT doing for free. You can't make money off other people's work like that. that's just pathetic and disgusting. If he wants money so bad, he can get a fucking actual legal job! Not try and sit around and profit off another person's decades of hard work and copyrighted materials because he's that fucking lazy I guess. Writing fanfiction is always a free and fair use hobby, but getting greedy and trying to turn that into a moneymaker? No way.

******* While I do agree that asking for money to write a fanfic is at the very least questionable, you should be careful when ranting. A bit of what you wrote comes off as you claiming that writing in general is worse and not something people deserve to be paid for. Do read the quote yourself.

Yes, the phenomenon of asking people for Patreon funds to write fanfiction is not something I consider good. Stuff like holding the story hostage for funds, or reviews as the case has been in the past, likewise. But being able to write a good story is something that takes talent, skill, and effort, so please avoid putting that in general down when you rant.

******** For what it's worth, his patreon wasn't "give me money to write this story", it was "throw money at me if you want, i guess, i'm gonna keep writing this either way".

********* More importantly, his Patreon was about financing his original novel and had nothing to do with his fanfiction.

Dumb rules blindly enforced by stupid people I'd say.

******* 1. For what it's worth, his patreon wasn't "pay me to write this story", it was "i guess give me money if you want and i'll give you sneak-peek previews or something of stuff i was gonna write anyway".
2. You are literally simultaneously arguing that "making money off of another author's hard work is evil" and "authors making money is evil".
