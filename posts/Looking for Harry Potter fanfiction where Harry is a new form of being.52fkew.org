I mean in this like how fae from Dresden Files and and Humans. Fae are different beings, like humans, but utterly different- even on a new plane of existence, the Nevernever. So yeah, I want a fic with Harry being a new being, with its own lore, creations, realms, ect

Yes, I do know how unlikely it is that there is a fic like this.

Over 70k+ words!

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

First of all, I don't want to spoil too much, but in this Harry /thinks/ he is another species, but he isn't.

Also, it's old (2003-2005) and feels kind of dated. And abandoned.

However I definitely think it's worth reading. I haven't read this in years, but it has stayed with me - the author has a writing style that feels like a breath of fresh air. It's a shame he stopped writing.

  Harry decides he wants to try Animagi, and persuades Hermione to help... this changes them... a lot. Crossover, of sorts, with Pokemon. Mew!Harry. Not as stupid as it sounds.
