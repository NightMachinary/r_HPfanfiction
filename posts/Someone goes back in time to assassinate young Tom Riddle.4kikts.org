**** I don't think killing a 16 year old Riddle would be easy. Or perhaps post Hogwarts, during the time Riddle works at Borgin and Burkes or his 'missing years', though that wouldn't really qualify as young. There are other variables in Dumbledore, Grindelwald and the war as well. Could be fairly interesting if Grindelwald gets hold of young Riddle somehow.

***** If you're going to go back in time to assassinate Tom Riddle, why the hell would you go after a Tom Riddle who knows any level of magic? That's incredibly stupid. If you had a brain, you would go for a very young Tom Riddle because he is less likely to fillet you with magic. That's what I was thinking.

  "Merope Gaunt?"

  "Yes..."

  Harry pushes the door open, and draws his wand. Merope backs up slightly, in fear. He points the wand at her forehead.

  Piercing hex. She falls. Five more piercing hexes are cast.

** As PsychoGeek pointed out below, all those fics seem to let Riddle off the hook.

I really want to see a fic in which the protagonists disposed Riddle with little difficulty, but caused a less evil and insane, but far more cunning and wise dark lord to rise.

*** I'm working on a fanfiction of my own, an AU where /Hermione/ is a Dark Lord (Lady?), and Tom is the hero.

Hermione went back with Ron and Harry to kill off Tom Riddle as a baby, which obviously fails. As a result, /Tom/ becomes "the Boy Who Lived". Something decidedly bad happens to Harry as a result ("bad things happen to wizards who meddle with time, Harry"), and Hermione takes his place. However, her motivations run far deeper than they appear.

Hermione doesn't fall in love with Riddle, but she /does/ manipulate him for her own purposes.

  Go back to the beginning, that was the plan. Stop Voldemort on the cusp of becoming a dark lord, stop him before he created his first horcrux and change history before it could be written. That was the plan, only Harry made a mistake.
