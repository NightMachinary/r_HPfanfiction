Like the title says, I'm looking for this super short fanfic I read like 5+ years ago.

It was like a collection of moments in the beginning of Ginny's/Harry's marriage where they're like, seeing how the other handles food, and money, and whatnot. It was super cute, and has some parallels with my fiancee's and myself, and how different our childhoods were.

I don't suppose anybody knows it, it was short, like a single tumblr post, and I would really appreciate if someone could point me the right way!


** Was it the one where they see how the aspects of each other's childhood come into play as adults? Like Ginny is so used to not having money, but now has enough money to buy good stuff. And Harry never had enough food as a kid, and now Ginny makes him a bunch of stuff?

*** Yes, exactly that one! When I was younger I thought it was pretty cool, but now I tear up with just the vague memories of what was in it, and the trauma and talking each other through nightmares and firewhisky binges.

***** I'm more remembering it being a tumblr post, so idk if it was also on either of those.

If I could remember how anyb5 words orbso were exactly strung together, I could probably just google that phrase and see what came up, but alas, I dont remember anything besides the feel of the piece.

******* Not bad. Just if somebody expanded it into a standalone one-shot and post it somewhere better.
