Let's be honest here. When you are writing your weekly Harry and whatever girl comes to mind, you are most likely writing the story in the present. However if you haven't realised by now, our generation is very ‘unique' and there's a massive problem with your seemingly harmless stories:

The Lack of LGBT

To write Hogwarts as a world of only straights is not only homophobic but also extremely unrealistic. As J.K put herself, the LGBT would have been accepted in Hogwarts so not writing about them at all makes your story seem lazy and biased since most of Hogwarts would be dominated by non-cisgender straight students so I just want you to remember to not ignore the LGBT when writing your stories as it makes you look like a offensive, biased and terrible writer.

Thank you, Jessica. :)

** Was poisoning FF.net not enough for you? Now you had to come over to the Reddit boards and shove your LGBT crap down our throats? Please, you story is horrid enough, and your post here is just as bad. Oh, and by the way, I'm actually pleasantly surprised you haven't fired off against straight, white males as you usually do. Perhaps you're making a little bit of progress in life!

** I mean, I'm going to write lesbian Hermione, but that's more because I simply don't see a suitable male shipping option for her besides Harry. Not to fill some sort of quota.

And wasn't the stigma on homosexuality a lot stronger in the 90s?

**** But the story is set in the 90s and you should try to accurately reflect that. Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12884777/1/One-Way-Or]]) does a good job at that. Having widespread LGTB acceptance in the 90s would be as odd as Harry pulling out the latest iPhone to take a selfie in front of the Basilisk.

  Another. A tale of Mandy Brocklehurst. Not everyone has to face dark lords but that doesn't mean they don't have tales to tell. Especially if your best friend is engaged to Harry Potter and you've realised you need to come out to the school. Not quite a sequel to Call Me but the closest you're going to get.

***** Well, to be fair, according to some US survey I've read a couple months ago, nearly 20% of all people are bi-curious and about half of them actually experiments with the same gender. But still, according to A03, ~140% of all men are gay

**** How so? Homosexuality is /normal/, but as a simple matter of /statistics/, less gay people exist than straight people. In a small population pool like Hogwarts, it's only logical there would only be a few LGBTQ+ characters.

** Yeah...so if there is a story based on only LGBT or LGBTQ I would never say there had to be more straight relationships and individuals in it. Disregarding that, how dare you put a label on someone just for something they write in their free time for fun. It not realistic? Magics not realistic. Fiction is not realistic. Everyone has the right to write whatever they want (although I am not a fan of stories that cause harm to others specifically, but I am not going to call out people who write them)

** Idk about you but most of the stories I read are set in 90s. But, that's probably cause I'm very picky with what I read.

By your logic, people who wrote some of the greatest stories in our fandom are lazy, homophobic and etc because they didn't think/found need of writing a lgbt character and that's so stupid that it hurts me internally.
