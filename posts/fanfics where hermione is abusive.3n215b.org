we've all see the stupid and untrue cliche of ron or who ever being abusive to hermione but I was wondering, ever seen a fanfiction where hermione is the abuser not the victim?


** I've very much enjoyed The Scent that Lingers.

*** Wow...a bashing fic, where Ron is the protagonist and Harry and Hermione get the bashing. That's unheard of, right? It was actually well written and enjoyable.

***** Bashing in the sense that it portrays Harry as a bad, clueless friend. He remains blind to the issues and doesn't take the time to listen. At the end of the fic, Harry and Ginny see Ron off in the distance for the first time in years. They express bitterness over happy Ron looks with his new life, bitter that he is happy without them. Also, Ron knows that choosing Pansy means completely distancing himself from the Weasely's and Harry, but he does it without to much fuss. This is all written with a lot more subtlety than a typical bashing fic, mind you. But it still follows the path of "the unappreciated protagonist gets treated like crap, they deserves better, magical thing makes their situation better, the people who treated the protagonist like crap are shown to be the wankers they really are, the end".

Ron was pulling the same "I'm fine." automatic response that Harry used in canon and then refusing to talk about it. Harry left off in the same way he always wanted others to. The bitterness at the very end is also tinged with regret for what's lost, knowing that they failed.

I guess I don't feel this shows Harry in an unflattering way.

It was an okay one shot at least. And I totally would buy that behavior from Hermione.

******* I buy the Hermione behavior, and I can see what you're saying about Harry. The ending wasn't about them feeling betrayed, but regret that they failed a friend/brother. I don't think it portrays Harry in a positive light though. In my opinion, canon!Harry would have been much more perceptive. EDIT: I think it was a decent oneshot, and novel in it's portrayal of Hermione, but it's still a fic where the author shoehorned a contrived magical mcguffin to drive the plot, especially at the end when we it's added that marrying a veela means you have to abandon your friends and only hang out with the veela's....sooo I guess veela marriage exerts some power over your social life because...hmm, I'm not sure why really

  What if Hermione Granger wasn't Nice at all? This is the POV of a NotNice Hermione on the events of the first five books.
