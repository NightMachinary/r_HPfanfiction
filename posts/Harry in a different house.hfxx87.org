  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** Seconding The Best Revenge. Harry is sorted into Hufflepuff but he's not weak or obsessed with pleasing people. I really like what the writer did with that Harry.

The best Slytherin Harry fic I read is linkffn(On the Way to Greatness). For a more cracky but also surprisingly touching fic, I enjoyed linkffn(When in Doubt, Obliviate).

*** I read it a while ago And while it is a great recommendation for a time travel fic it isn't what I was looking for I dislike the idea of hufflepuff Harry because all the fics with it have him be weak. In gryffindor he is the golden boy the traditional hero we expect, in slytherin he is a gray version of tom riddle with attachments to other people, in ravenclaw he is hungry for knowledge immersing himself in the new world he is being shown, in hufflepuff he is a damaged little boy who needs help and drinks hot chocolate by the fire and is more concerned with other people's feelings than the plot Now this is just a very very generalized statement that I wrote, and not all hufflepuff Harry's are like that but I stand by it

******** Strings basically has him raised by his aunt only and he knows about his fame they deal with the "Harry potter" fiction books out there he even has a q&a session first year so that students who were fans of the books can get the real story. He even signs some autographs including one for the gray lady but he isnt a conceited ass about it. Imo it's a really refreshing take on harry who grew up differently. And harry is top or near the top of his class. I need to reread it actually. Maybe after I'm done with the fic I'm reading now.

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.
